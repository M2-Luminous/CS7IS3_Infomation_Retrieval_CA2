In the "Center" founding declaration, as read at today's meeting by Ombretta Fumagalli, the now former Christian Democrats also voiced their "deep disappointment" also at the fact of being unable to find a "democratic seat to express our views." "We want to be the yeast" explained Pier Ferdinando Casini, "for a moderate alliance, popular and reformist which is a candidate to govern. This is what is happening on the Left, where (Communist Armando) Cossuta and (Republican Giorgio) La Malfa are sitting together, I can't see why there should be obstacles in the center where, among other things, the differences in program are minimal." "It is our hope" Casini added, "that even [Pact for Italy leader] (Mariotto) Segni wants to be part of a moderate cartel." A cartel, he pointed out, which cannot include those of the National Alliance, formed by the neofascist Italian Social Movement (MSI) and other right-wing elements, such as Christian Democrat Publio Fiori. In related developments, Christian Democrat House Whip Gerardo Bianco wrote a letter to Francesco D'Onofrio calling on him to "think twice" before splitting the party underscoring how division before an election did not "respond to Aristotelian logic nor political wisdom." "Does it not seem contradictory to you" Bianco added, "to separate from those who are closest to you, for culture and political criteria."
