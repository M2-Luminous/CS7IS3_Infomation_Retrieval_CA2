Scharping outlines the changes in domestic policy if the SPD were to win the majority and he were to become next chancellor. Asked by Luc Jochimsen whether he was still disappointed at the outcome of the 23 May presidential election, Scharping says that he is, "because there can be no doubt that Johannes Rau would have been an excellent president for Germany." He adds, however, that one "has to live with defeats" in politics. The decision is legitimate, he says, and "like any upright democrat we will loyally cooperate with the new president." Nikolaus Brender confronts Scharping with an earlier statement of his according to which the Free Democratic Party [FDP] would no longer be needed after the next Bundestag election, arguing that this was an indirect statement in favor of a coalition between the SPD and the Greens after the Bundestag election. Scharping replies: "No, on the contrary. In the presidential election the FDP did what it did. Yet, this does not mean that all doors have been closed." Scharping believes that on the election night "the supply of coalition partners will be greater than the demand, which reduces the price, or to put it more politely, will make negotiations easier." Scharping adds that "politically, things will change for the better in Germany only when the SPD becomes the strongest party; this is what we are concentrating on, while everything else will have to be decided after 16 October." Scharping then criticizes the economic situation in Germany arguing that at the moment there is "a deficit of 5 million competitive jobs, that many young families are looking for affordable accommodation," and that "1 million children are growing up in this country with the experience of parents being on social welfare." Jochimsen argues that the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] also wants to create more jobs and build more apartments, but Scharping discards that, emphasizing that the coalition is cutting social benefits and funds for social housing. He says that "Helmut Kohl's government has dramatically reduced the funds for active labor market policy," thus having cut "an additional 700,000 jobs." The SPD chairman is asked how he would finance his social program. Scharping argues that raising taxes is unimaginative, considering that "taxes jumped up dramatically in the past four years" anyway, with the main burden having been put on employed people. "What we want is to shift funds around in the budget but not raise the quota of taxes and rates, because this quota is indeed high enough." Funds have to be increased for "more economic growth, more demand, and more investments," since "without these three elements we will not be able to create new jobs" and will "not be competitive in the future." Scharping does not go into detail but says that high-income earners, "the top 20 percent of the income pyramid" would have to pay higher taxes. He reiterates the importance of "creating growth," because otherwise it would not be able to create jobs or consolidate the state finances. "Some 2,000 billion German marks [DM] in public debts, or DM65,000 for every German" are the absolute limit. Jochimsen argues that she does not have the impression that people really feel it is time for a change, and she makes reference to U.S. President Clinton's election campaign. Scharping stresses that the Bundestag election campaign has not started yet but says that "I agree it is time for a change." He says that "it is a great challenge" to modernize the economy, seek social justice, and pursue a consistent environmental policy. "I am absolutely convinced" that this change will take place in Germany. He says that the SPD is currently standing at 39 percent in surveys, and in the European election on 12 June we will see whether the SPD will manage to "convince and mobilize more and more people, and to make it clear that in this country we need more solidarity, more shared responsibility, and less egotism," which "as I would say, has spread terribly under the Kohl government." Brender asks why the voters should want to change the government, considering that the economy is beginning to recover, a fact that could reduce the SPD's chances. Scharping asserts that the SPD's chances "have so far not decreased and will not decrease." He argues that as far as growing demand from abroad is concerned, Germany is currently "reaping the fruits of a better economic policy in other countries." Scharping says that Germany needs "a new founding era," "new enterprises, new investments," and a "dynamic development of the domestic economy." He says he is sorry that the economic situation does not look too good at the moment, adding that "I am happy about any improvement." However, "if the number of unemployed grows by 500,000 this year, one can hardly speak of economic upswing." He notes that "we are still a long way from recovery for everybody, and, I fear that with the policy that has been pursued so far we will not get recovery for all." Mrs. Jochimsen refers to surveys that predict an increase in support for the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] in the new laender and asks Rudolf Scharping why he is shying away from confrontation with the PDS. Scharping argues that he is not, noting that "for us the PDS is more than the normal political opponent." He adds that he is taking people in eastern Germany and their concerns "very seriously." "I go there a lot and talk to many people, and I do not just go there to turn a lever and open a new plant." He emphasizes that people in the new laender must also be aware that "each vote for the PDS may be understandable" as a result of the developments and disappointments of the past three years, "but democracy does not live on democracy or rage, but on the resolve to change things," and "anybody who votes for the PDS will strengthen the current situation and weaken the chances for change." Without wanting to discredit the party's supporters, Scharping maintains that the PDS is the "direct successor to the old Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED], and has directly taken over the former SED cadres, the former assets, and many other things, and even the old policies." Returning to the tax issue, Scharping points out that "German unification is currently financed basically by debts and by contributions to social security," rejecting that German unification be merely financed by employed people; self-employed people, such as dentists, politicians, and public servants, he says, must also contribute. Scharping says that considering the significant social cuts under the current government, the SPD would "not agree to any further reduction in social benefits." Scharping speaks out in favor of "stronger direct participation" of the citizens in the political decisionmaking process, such as referendums and petitions for referendums. He says that this issue will be brought up in the SPD's election campaign, and criticizes the coalition government for obstructing any SPD suggestions in this direction. Scharping says that in his state, Rhineland-Palatinate, mayors would be elected directly in the future. In conclusion, Scharping announces the SPD's motto for the future: "A just, tolerant, and peaceful Germany."
