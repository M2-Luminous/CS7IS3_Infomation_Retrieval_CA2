Accompanied by local leaders, Zou visited Jingtang Harbor, the harbor development zone, the Tangshan Iron and Steel Company, the Douhe power plant and the Jidong cement plant. While visiting the expansion project of the Tangshan Iron and Steel Company, Zou said the development of an enterprise must be based on technical progress. "Technical upgrading should be carried out every year, especially from the aspect of using new technologies and developing new products," Zou said.
