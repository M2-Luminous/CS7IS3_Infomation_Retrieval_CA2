The CPC and the state always attach great importance to minority cadres affairs, and they always consider forming a large contingent of ethical and capable minority cadres to be a major policy for people of all nationalities to achieve equality, unity, progress, and common prosperity. Thanks to the efforts made by party committees and governments at all levels as well as by relevant departments over the past four decades, the number of minority cadres has increased from 10,000 or so in 1950 to more than 2.28 million today, including large numbers of party workers, administrators, economic workers, scientists, technicians, cultural workers, educators, and health workers. Many minority cadres have assumed leading posts and are playing leading roles in minority regions' political, economic, and social development. As reform and opening up continue to proceed, minority regions have also taken effective measures for training, selecting, and appointing minority cadres, and the valuable experiences they have gained have enhanced the work of bringing up minority cadres. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has been training minority cadres while carrying out reforms and opening up to the outside world. Under a cadres exchange program, the region has adopted all kinds of measures -- such as rotating minority cadres at different posts, retraining incumbent cadres, sending outstanding college students to work at grass-roots units, providing counterpart support, exchanging cadres with different areas, and appointing cadres to work in developed provinces and regions -- to improve minority cadres' competence so that they can mature and become more proficient during the course of their training. Meanwhile, Xinjiang has hired experts to teach management and technology, to carry out scientific research, to take part in academic exchanges, and to help set up plants and mines in the region. Today all prefectures and counties in Xinjiang have launched similar cooperative projects, and the results that some have achieved are remarkable. Many minority cadres have become business directors and managers or persons in charge of science and technology projects. Tibet's programs for training minority cadres give priority to five categories: 1) To people of minority nationalities while selecting trainees. Since 1980, Tibet has trained 27,363 minority cadres of various categories and at various levels -- or 72.75 percent of the total number of cadres who have been trained -- through various channels. 2) To county- and higher-level leading cadres. 3) To intensive, short-term training for minority cadres. 4) To training local cadres through channels linking Tibet with other parts of the country. Tibet has a program for each year sending minority cadres to other parts of the country for advanced studies. 5) To training courses which are of practical use. While striving to build strong ranks of minority cadres, minority autonomous regions also pay great attention to combining training programs with the need to exercise autonomy. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has stated that training and selecting minority cadres must be underscored in projects for training, recommending, and evaluating the performance of cadres; reorganizing or reelecting leading groups; or drawing up policies and regulations for cadres. The region also has stated that such affairs must be organically integrated with the exercising of regional autonomy. The region has also stressed that the number of minority cadres must account for a proper percentage in the region, and that the number of Mongolian cadres and cadres of the Han and other nationalities -- especially leading cadres -- must account for a proper percentage of cadres in leading organs so that the number of minority cadres can be proportionally in line with the minority population as well as with the regulations of the "Law on the Regional Autonomy of Minority Nationalities." In light of this law, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has done as much as possible so that cadres of all nationalities, while increasing in number, will become more competent in handling political affairs and in involving themselves in scientific and cultural projects. The region has made it a policy that there should be no arbitrary uniformity in training and in selecting minority cadres, that preferential treatment must be given to people of minority nationalities who have few cadres, and that consideration should be given to past and present circumstances and the situation of people of other nationalities. While training and selecting minority cadres, all regions also stress the need to foster the concept of viewing cadres affairs as a whole. Guangxi emphasizes that cadres of the Han and minority nationalities must respect each other, learn from one another, and assist one another. All autonomous regions have promoted the unity between people of all nationalities by emphasizing the view that people of the Han nationality and people of minority nationalities need one another.
