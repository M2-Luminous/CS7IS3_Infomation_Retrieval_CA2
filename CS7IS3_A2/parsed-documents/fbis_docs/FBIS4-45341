The PJE reported that those arrested were in possession of weapons. Carmen Victoria Coronel, wife of Juan Jose Quintero Payan, was among those arrested. Quintero Paya apparently is a relative of drug-trafficker Rafael Caro Quintero. The police also reported that authorities seized a briefcase containing 4,000 new pesos and $7,000 in cash, as well as an additional 14,110 new pesos. As part of the investigations, police raided the residence of Luis Enrique Fernandez Hurtado, who was not arrested, and seized seven AK-47's, known here as "goat horns"; an R-15 rifle; and a .45 caliber pistol. It also has been reported that the people killed in the bomb blast have been identified as Marcial Gonzalez Muniz and Guillermo Gomez Chavez. Manuel Delgadillo Paez, director of the Investigations Department of the State Attorney General's Office, also reported that experts are working to determine what kind of explosives, and how much, were used in the bomb. At 0200 (0800 GMT) Saturday, a Ford Grand Marquiz exploded in the parking lot of a Guadalajara Hotel where a birthday party was being held. Two people were killed and five others injured as a result of the explosion. The hotel management has filed a property-damage suit against whomever is found guilty of the attack. The police also reported that their investigations have established that two stolen cars were parked in the parking lot in which the bomb exploded.
