FR940907-1-00048 FR940907-1-00016 Wednesday September 7, 1994 Part IV Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 20 Migratory Bird Hunting; Proposed Frameworks for Late-Season Migratory Bird Hunting Regulations; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 172␣/␣Wednesday, September 7, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 20 RIN 1018-AA24 Migratory Bird Hunting; Proposed Frameworks for Late-Season Migratory Bird Hunting Regulations AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed Rule; Extension of Comment Period. SUMMARY: This document announces the extension of the comment period for the Fish and Wildlife Service (hereinafter the Service) August 24, 1994, Proposed Rule Federal Register (59 FR 43684) from September 2 to September 9, 1994, to establish the 1994&hyph;95 late-season hunting regulations for certain migratory game birds. The Service annually prescribes frameworks, or outer limits, for dates and times when hunting may occur and the number of birds that may be taken and possessed in late seasons. These frameworks are necessary to allow State selections of final seasons and limits and to allow recreational harvest at levels compatible with population and habitat conditions. The Service invites additional public comment and suggestions due to public request. By letter dated August 31, 1994, the Fund for Animals, Inc. (Fund) requested that the Service extend the comment period for this proposed rule until September 16, 1994. As required by the Administrative Procedure Act, the Service provided public notice of the proposed rule and established a period of 9 days in which comments could be submitted in Federal Register (59 FR 43684). No specific time period for comment is prescribed by the Administrative Procedure Act. However, it is Department of the Interior policy, as stated in the Departmental Manual, to provide 30 calendar days unless a shorter period is necessary in cases requiring more timely action. In such a case, the proposed rule should state the reasons for the shorter period. This was provided at 59 FR 43692. Although the Service acknowledges the reasons for the request submitted by the Fund and has decided to extend the period an additional 7 days, for the reasons stated in the proposed rule and because the Service needs sufficient time to assess and respond to comments received and prepare the final rule in time for the hunting season, the full 14 day extension cannot be granted. DATES: The comment period for the proposed frameworks will end on close of business September 9. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to: Chief, MBMO, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, ms 634_ARLSQ, Washington, DC 20240. Comments received will be available for public inspection during normal business hours in Room 634, Arlington Square Building, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia.

Schmidt, Chief, Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, ms 634_ARLSQ, Washington, DC 20240, (703) 358&hyph;1714.
