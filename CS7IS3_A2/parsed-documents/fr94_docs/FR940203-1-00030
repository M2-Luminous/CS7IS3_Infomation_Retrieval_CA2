FR940203-1-00030 FR940203-1-00005 (B) Sold by licensee or exemptee. (5) When the power from a licensed or exempted project owned by a State or municipality enters into its electric system, making it impracticable to meet the requirements of this section with respect to the disposition of project power, such licensee or exemptee may, in lieu thereof, furnish similar information with respect to the disposition of the available power of the entire electric system of the licensee or exemptee. (e) Transmission lines. For projects involving transmission lines only, the administrative charge will be stated in the license. (f) Minimum and maximum charges. (1) The minimum annual charge under this section will be $100 per year for each licensed or exempted project, subject to reduction based on partial or total exemption pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section. (2) No licensed or exempted project's annual charge may exceed a maximum charge established each year by the Commission to equal 2.0 percent of the adjusted costs of administration of the hydropower regulatory program. For every project with an annual charge determined to be above the maximum charge, that project's annual charge will be set at the maximum charge, and any amount above the maximum charge will be reapportioned to the remaining projects. The reapportionment will be computed using the method outlined in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section (but excluding any project whose annual charge is already set at the maximum amount). This procedure will be repeated until no project's annual charge exceeds the maximum charge. (g) Commission's costs. (1) With respect to costs incurred by the Commission, the assessment of annual charges will be based on an estimate of the costs of administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act that will be incurred during the fiscal year in which the annual charges are assessed. After the end of the fiscal year, the assessment will be recalculated based on the costs of administration that were actually incurred during that fiscal year; the actual costs will be compared to the estimated costs; and the difference between the actual and estimated costs will be carried over as an adjustment to the assessment for the subsequent fiscal year. (2) The issuance of bills based on the administrative costs incurred by the Commission during the year in which the bill is issued will commence in 1993. The annual charge for the administrative costs that were incurred in fiscal year 1992 will be billed in 1994. At the licensee's option, the charge may be paid in three equal annual installments in fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996, plus any accrued interest. If the licensee elects the three-year installment plan, the Commission will accrue interest (at the most recent yield of two-year Treasury securities) on the unpaid charges and add the accrued interest to the installments billed in fiscal years 1995 and 1996. (h) In making their annual reports to the Commission on their costs in administering Part I of the Federal Power Act, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service are to deduct any amounts that were deposited into their Treasury accounts during that year as reimbursements for conducting studies and reviews pursuant to section 30(e) of the Federal Power Act. (i) Definition. As used in paragraph (c) of this section, ``authorized installed capacity'' means the lesser of the ratings of the generator or turbine units. The rating of a generator is the product of the continuous-load capacity rating of the generator in kilovolt-amperes (kVA) and the system power factor in kW/kVA. If the licensee or exemptee does not know its power factor, a factor of 1.0 kW/kVA will be used. The rating of a turbine is the product of the turbine's capacity in horsepower (hp) at maximum head gate opening under the manufacturer's rating head times a conversion factor of 0.75 kW/hp. If the generator or turbine installed has a rating different from that authorized in the license or exemption, or the installed generator is rewound or otherwise modified to change its rating, or the turbine is modified to change its rating, the licensee or exemptee must apply to the Commission to amend its authorized installed capacity to reflect the change. (j) Transition. For a license having the capacity of the project for annual charge purposes stated in horsepower, that capacity shall be deemed to be the capacity stated in kilowatts elsewhere in the license, including any amendments thereto.
