This statement acquired unheard of implications when it was pronounced on 17 March on the floor of the House of Representatives of the United States, the nation that has held an economic blockade, which includes food supplies and medicines, against Cuba for the past three decades. The demand was presented by (Julie Finesilver) in her argument against the U.S. siege against Cuba on the occasion of a draft bill submitted by Democrat Charles Rangel. The presentation by (Finesilver), a pharmaceutical company consultant, was the one, among various speakers who participated before a House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee subcommission, that caused a great impact. During a marathon session in which tens of interventions, which also included positions supporting the blockade against Cuba, were heard, the insistence of solid arguments, such as those of Congressman Jose Serrano and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, were evident in favor of a rational handling of the island. [sentence as heard] The debate was a solid reflection of the weakened influence of followers of the so-called Torricelli Law, which is aimed at intensifying the blockade's impact on 11 million Cubans. Politicians, businessmen, representatives of the Cuban community residents in the United States, and other individuals went to the podium to speak in favor of or against the blockade; nevertheless, the idea that the Unites States suffers steep economic losses as its hostility against Cuba prevails was emphatically reiterated. One of the most objective arguments was that of (Finesilver) who, when she displayed a box of PPG [expansion unknown], pills used in Cuba to lower cholesterol levels, expressed regret the box was empty, because the blockade prevents North American citizens from acquiring the product despite its international recognition. A devastating truth was felt in the room when the speaker stated Cuban and North American scientists could work together if the blockade were lifted. Only because there is a trend in the United States in favor of lifting the inhuman measures, only because of this did the U.S. House of Representatives begin debating such a conflictive issue. Irrefutable opinions such as those of Mrs. (Finesilver) were heard at that time.
