FBIS4-60414 "drnes101_l_94010" FBIS-NES-94-101 Daily Report 24 May 1994 ISRAEL Chief of Staff on Palestinian Police, Hizballah Chief of Staff on Palestinian Police, Hizballah TA2405175194 Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Arabic 1600 GMT 24 May 94 TA2405175194 Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Arabic 1600 GMT 24 May 94 Arabic BFN [Interview with Major General Amnon Shahaq, deputy chief of staff, by Eli Nisan at the Knesset on 24 May -- recorded, in Hebrew with Arabic subtitles; processed from the Hebrew] [Text] [Nisan] Two weeks after the implementation of the autonomy agreement in Gaza and Jericho, can you say Israel is pleased with the way the agreement is being implemented and with the deployment of the Palestinian police? [Shahaq] The Palestinian police is in a process of entering the territory; this is not completed yet. So far, more than 3,200 policemen came in, and more are to arrive. Those who have arrived, and I saw them on the ground, came from far away. I believe they have to study Gaza. They are not familiar with Gaza and I do not believe they are familiar with policing duties because they have not been policemen for several years. At the same time, judging from discussions with the police commanders, I can say that the Palestinian police commanders understand they need to be effective on the ground immediately and see to it that law, order, and security prevail. [Nisan] Do you believe that the PLO will be able to establish its control in Gaza and Jericho, vis-a-vis Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the Islamic Jihad, and prevent acts of terror against Israel? [Shahaq] I believe that the PLO realizes that if it does not establish control over the territory, others will. If others control the territory, the PLO will have simply failed. I believe the PLO understands this, and it has a vested interest in and the ability to attain full control. [Nisan] As the person who conducted the negotiations with the Palestinians, do you believe 'Arafat's declarations will impinge on the continued implementation of the autonomy agreement? [Shahaq] I believe that such declarations do not contribute. Just the contrary, they damage the process. It is irrelevant which declarations these are. Any declaration that can be interpreted in more than o6e way, with some interpretations being of the kind we have heard recently -- justifiably, I believe -- cause damage. The Palestinian leaders are better advised to think twice before they issue declarations. [Nisan] How do you refer to the threats made by Hizballah after the abduction of Musfata al-Dirani? [Shahaq] Hizballah made threats and carried out operations before the kidnapping of al-Dirani. Let us not be naive and start believing that Hizballah will suddenly attack us only because we kidnapped al-Dirani. Hizballah has always tried to hurt us in various locations. I believe we should be on the alert wherever Hizballah might attempt to attack Israel. [Nisan] Do you expect an escalation in the north? [Shahaq] I believe Hizballah will attempt to make good on its declarations. We must be ready wherever we believe Hizballah might attempt to take action.
