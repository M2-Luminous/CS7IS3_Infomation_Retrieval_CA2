FBIS4-12981 "drnes073_o_94003" FBIS-NES-94-073 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 SYRIA `Wondrous' Hadera, 'Afula Operations Hailed `Wondrous' Hadera, 'Afula Operations Hailed JN1404193394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1530 GMT 14 Apr 94 JN1404193394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Palestine Broadcast: "Talk of the Return" by Fayiz Qandil] [Text] Brother strugglers: Although the explosion at Hadera, in the Zionist heartland, yesterday, was only powerful enough to destroy just one Israeli military vehicle, it shook the earth under the decaying Zionist ideology, and dented the Zionists' arrogance and racism enough to make them understand who they are and who we, the Palestinian Arab people, are. We, the Arabs, will help the Zionists make sense out of what happened at Hadera yesterday, provided they try to remember what happened a week before that. On that occasion, the Palestinian Arab struggle punished the wolves of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in 'Afula, as called for by divine and temporal laws and moral ethics. It would seem, though, that the Zionists have not recognized the 'Afula attack as a limited Palestinian Arab punishment for an indescribably savage Zionist massacre. Indeed, the Zionists were so arrogant and racist as to bark their infamous slogan, death to the Arabs. True to their extremist and racist natures, they put their abhorrent slogan into practice. That was in the intervening week between the spectacular and wondrous 'Afula and Hadera operations. The Israeli military, using anti-tank rockets, flattened Palestinian Arab houses in the valiant city of Ramallah under their usual pretext that they were after some Palestinian Arabs on the run. That was an act of sheer terror and piracy. What matters here is that not one Palestinian Arab's body was found under the rubble. The houses and properties of all the world are not equal in value to a single Arab martyr's blood, even though martyrdom in itself is a gain and a new lease on life. In any case, let us remind Zionist injustice that by shelling Palestinian villages and camps with antitank rockets, Israel has pushed the limits of terrorism. Firing even a single rocket at an Arab house is the ultimate in terror -- an action prohibited by the Hague and Geneva conventions under which occupied territories and their population must be protected against the evils and criminality of the invading forces. Under these conventions, these forces are guilty of a category of war crimes and mass killings that came before special tribunals after World War II. For the record, we will point out that Arab resistance in the occupied territories has warned the Israelis to expect Arab rockets to be fired at Zionist houses, as tit for tat, unless Israel refrains. After the Arab houses were blown up in Ramallah, the Israeli occupation wolves shot and killed a young pregnant Palestinian Arab woman who happened to be standing by a window in her home. Yesterday, and before the Hadera explosion, a Zionist settler, acting under the protection of the occupation army, opened fire on Arab school children in Jericho, wounding several of them. He was able to escape with the aid of killers of the Israeli occupation army. Hours later, Arab dynamite shook Hadera. Will Israel now learn the lesson of 'Afula and Hadera, or will the Israelis revert to their terrorist, arrogant, and stupidly racist Zionist mentality? It is not for us to provide the answer to this question. This is for Israel to answer. If Israel learns the lesson and ends occupation and dismantles settlements and disarms settlers the road for peace will open wide. However, if Israel, as we think likely to happen, refuses to see sense, and death to the Arabs continues to be barked by the extremists, the Zionist state will be confronted by a great Palestinian Arab people who will unsheath the Israeli sword with one hand, staunch their noble wound with the other hand, and then hurl the sword back at Israel's chest. Israel must call a halt to its terror and atrocities against the Palestinian Arab people. Otherwise, the muscular hand of the Palestinian Arab people that struck at 'Affula and Hadera in the Zionist heartland will reach to any place in Palestine that the wolves of Israeli occupation imagine is out of reach of the Palestinain resistance. The only situation under which the Zionist invaders may have security and peace is the departure of Zionist colonialism and its weapons and institutions from the last inch of our sacred Palestinian Arab land.
