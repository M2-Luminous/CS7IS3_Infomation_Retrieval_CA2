One concerned the brewery group Prazske pivovary, he said in a Nova television interview. The second involved a former FNM employee, Milan Krcmar, who Jezek said had manipulated the sale of shares in three companies in favour of the Prvni investicni investment fund. In a spirited defence against lately mounting criticism, Jezek said: "There are politicians who fulfill their role as larks -- that means they flit off to international conferences and to Davoses and twitter about the successes of our transformation; and then someone here who has to do hard work everyday, project after project with all the problems, all the rascals who want to pinch a bit of state property for themselves, who are in far away places I can't get to, can't see... and then in the end it all falls on me". Davos, Switzerland, is the venue of a yearly International Economic Forum. This year the Czech Republic was represented by Premier Vaclav Klaus, Economics Minister Karel Dyba and Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy. Jezek said he believed a section of the communist left which never wanted transformation and privatisation was responsible for the attacks on himself and the FNM's work and were "eagerly slinging mud". "That can be exploited by various ambitious youngsters, unfortunately from within the coalition, who would like to see themselves in my position, at least at the end of the successful transformation. They are employed by various ministers, some from my party," Jezek said, referring to the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA).
