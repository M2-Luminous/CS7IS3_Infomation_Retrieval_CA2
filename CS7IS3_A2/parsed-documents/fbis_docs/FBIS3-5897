A passage of the bill will result in contracting, rather than expanding, the domestic and global financial markets, Hong said in an interview with THE KOREA TIMES. He said Seoul will dissuade Washington from introducing the bill on the Fair Trade and Financial Services, often called the Riegle bill, as it will be used as a tool to put pressure on Korea and other countries to open their financial market wider. He said, "I can not exclude the possibility of the passage of the bill, which will reciprocate against countries which do not guarantee full national treatment to American financial services firms." Washington has threatened to use the bill to restrict the American operations of international financial institutions until and unless foreign countries committed to opening their markets to U.S. financial institutions. A passage of the bill will arm the Treasury Department with more leverage to put pressure on Korea for opening its financial markets, he said. Hong excluded the possibility that Washington might use the forthcoming APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) finance ministers meeting as an opportunity to pry open financial markets of the other countries. "The meeting, scheduled to be held in March 18-19 in Hawaii, is a forum for discussing multilateral issues, not bilateral ones," he said. "The APEC meeting is to share our experiences with other members, not to discuss bilateral issues," he said, adding that APEC finance ministers will discuss multilateral issues to addresses some of the challenges facing the region, including ensuring non-inflationary regional growth, financing investment, infrastructural development and promoting capital market development. He did not specify when Seoul will raise the foreign stock ownership ceiling, currently set at 10 percent for each individual issue. Under the nation's Five-Year Financial Reform Plan, Seoul committed itself to raising the ceiling sometime between this year and next year, he said. The government will decide, after June, the timing and the extent of the ceiling expansion. He, however, said that foreigners can expand "indirect investment" in Korean stocks. "The government will soon permit such country funds as Korea Europe Fund in London and Korea Asia Fund in Hong Kong to increase capital. Additionally, three Seoul-based investment trust companies will be allowed to set up more funds to help foreigners expand indirect investments in Seoul shares." His remark appears to be a clear indication that the government will, at least for the time being, encourage foreigners to make "indirect" investment rather than direct investment. Hong said despite positive effects foreign portfolio capital has on the Korean economy, it is true that such capital influx has strained the nation's monetary & foreign exchange policies as well as inflation. The minister said the government intervened in the stock market three times this year as it showed signs of overheating, adding, however, that this does not mean Korea is backpedalling in its financial internationalization program. He said "Most of our stabilization measures include `deregulating' old rules that were adopted in the late 1980s to boost the stock market, adding that the recent measures do not necessarily mean introduction of `new rules.'" He said that Seoul will pursue a capital market development program consistently as was stipulated in the Five-Year Financial Reform Plan. He added that the government will make multi-pronged efforts to balance demand and supply in the stock market. He was replying to growing foreign criticism that Korea's arbitrary intervention in the stock market has overshadowed its reform process and scared away foreign investors. The minister said sometime this year, Korea will implement part of the third-stage of the interest rate liberalization program, which may include extension of maturity of certificates of deposit (CDs) and the lowering of its minimum face value of 50 million won. The minister said Korea will come out with a comprehensive plan to activate foreign direct investments by the end of May. "If our program is implemented, there will be qualitative and quantitative expansion in foreign direct investments in Korea," he said. Hong said the timing of Korea's joining the OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] will not be linked to the nation's pace of financial reform when he was asked to comment whether Korea must delay its OECD membership as the OECD views the speed of the nation's financial reform is "slow." He said by the time Korea joins the OECD around 1996, "Our liberalization ratio will be raised significantly." Korea will continue to liberalize the financial market even after joining the OECD as market-opening and liberalization is a dynamic process, he said. Preconditions for OECD membership is not to what extent a country is liberalized, but whether the country is willing to implement its pre-announced liberalization schedule after gaining membership, he said. There has emerged a view that Korea may be forced to delay the OECD membership as it may be tough for Seoul to meet all of the OECD requirements, especially those on foreign exchange and capital flows. He said depending on each country's economic situation, it can delay meeting part of the OECD requirements when it applies for a membership. In negotiations with the OECD, "we will fully explain to it why Korea must delay liberalizing specific restrictions," he said. He said the Korea Stock Exchange [KSE] will be authorized to handle stock index futures trading from 1996 in accordance with the pre-announced program but he did not say whether Korea will create another futures exchange which will compete with the KSE for stock index futures contracts.
