In an official statement issued today, Borrelli referred to the flurry of speculation in the nation's press on the chances that premier-designate Silvio Berlusconi might lure Di Pietro into his cabinet to take on the sensitive interior portfolio. The chief prosecutor said, "in relation to press reports of ideas of ministerial posts or other duties proposed to them," Di Pietro and assistant public prosecutor Piercamillo Davigo are honored by having their names linked to "functions of extremely high prestige" but are saying they cannot now abandon their posts with the Milan prosecutors office. Borrelli also reported in his official statement that he had dropped his own request to be named chief justice of the Milan appeals court. Speaking off the cuff, the magistrate said, "No one among us considers he is indispensable or cannot be replaced but it is good to save the unity of the operating team which worked for over two years on this difficult investigation. Especially at this time, when there are prospects of weakening the judiciary, a change in the line-up could reduce the effectiveness of operative unity." In December, Borrelli took part in a competition for the top job on the Milan appeals bench left vacant by the transfer of chief justice Piero Paiardi to the Supreme Court of Cassation. His decision to withdraw his name means there will be no change in the management of the Milan public prosecutors office. Earlier, speaking for publication in a news weekly, the chief prosecutor said he was aware of "signals of tiredness and annoyance" coming from the public with the continuation of the anticorruption investigations which got under way in February 1992. "People applauded our investigations, they closed ranks around us, they supported us. But they were also entertained to see so many heads, some crowned, rolling in the dust," he added with reference to figures like former Socialist Party leader and former Premier Bettino Craxi and other powerful politicians and businessmen brought low by Clean Hands' disclosures. "As the investigations reached increasingly high levels in political and public administration spheres, endemic bitterness against the powerful was satisfied. But this was not a thirst for justice, only a thirst for revenge," said Borrelli. He went on to speak of a need for an "authentic aspiration for legality" at all levels and insisted that the "renewal of ethics must begin with the individual, with each of us. This cannot be delegated." [passage omitted]
