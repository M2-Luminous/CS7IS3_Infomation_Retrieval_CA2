He says the countries of the South and the Third World realized at the conference that the strengthening of NAM will be in their interest. I asked him: What role is left to the movement now that the Eastern camp has collapsed? He replied: It is true that the Eastern camp has collapsed and gone, but subservience continues. Nonalignment means non-subservience. If we believe in this idea, we will notice that because one of the blocs collapsed, the other bloc is trying to strengthen its control and hegemony. Iran strongly believes in the need to maintain NAM. [Zaki] Mr. Minister, you met with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. What did you discuss? [Velayati] We had a good dialogue with the Egyptian side. There is increasing understanding between Iran and Egypt on the need to cooperate on regional and international issues. [Zaki] Did you discuss the exchange of ambassadors between Cairo and Tehran? [Velayati] We did not discuss that. [Zaki] Did you touch on the relations between Tehran and Khartoum? [Velayati] We did not discuss that subject either. [Zaki] Have you discussed Egypt's accusations that Iran supports the extremist Islamic trends in Egypt? [Velayati] We discussed the subject of the Islamic trends as a whole and as a general principle. But the accusations against Iran were not discussed, and were not raised in the first place. [Zaki] But what is your comment on these accusations? [Velayati] In general and in principle, the revival of Islamic values and thought cannot be ignored by anyone; nobody can or wants to ignore this fact. The signs of such revival are clear everywhere, so much so that even the pro-secularism in the Islamic world are now introducing their talk with "in the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate." I personally have seen this. I have also noticed that the number of Muslim women who wear Islamic dress has increased in recent years. This is not a sign of extremism, but the Western countries are trying to stop this trend. When Muslims return to their religion and somebody says that Iran forced them to do so, then this is an insult to them. [Zaki] Excuse me, we are not talking about Islam as a religion and a way to worship. We are discussing political Islam and Iran's position on the extremist Islamic groups that are now confronting the civil authorities in some Arab countries. What is Iran's position toward those groups? [Velayati] Islam is a religion of politics, and without politics there is no Islam. Those who argue against our opinion are politicizing Islam but in their own way. We do not believe Islam is the religion of staying in mosques. The Prophet, may God's peace and blessings be upon him, established a practical and actual government. If we want to follow the Prophet's way, we cannot tell those who govern in Mecca: You govern and we pray. But if we want a new Islam, then that is a different story. That the Islamic countries are now returning to Islam reflects Muslims' disappointment with Western values. Iran did not tell Muslims to [sentence incomplete as published]. [Zaki] But some governments are actually accusing Iran of supporting internal unrest in their countries. [Velayati] When governments of some countries face problems on the domestic scene, the easiest way is to accuse foreign quarters. [Zaki] Is there a relationship between Britain's position toward Iran and Iran's Islamist policy? [Velayati] Britain's position toward us is certainly linked to the Islamic position. The Islamic countries are increasingly worried at Britain's stance toward the Muslims in Bosnia. The Islamic majority in the world is convinced that Britain's bad position toward the Bosnian Muslims has led things to the edge of tragedy and prevented a tangible solution to the problem. [Zaki] Why did you not play an effective role--you are a major Islamic country? [Velayati] Concerning Bosnia, we did all we could. Iran was behind all pro-Bosnia moves in the United Nations, the Islamic Conference Organization, and the Nonaligned Movement. [Zaki] I am talking about military assistance. [Velayati] I will quote the Bosnian president: "Iran extended all possible assistance, and proposed sending military aid. After that, THE WASHINGTON POST reported that Iran is providing military assistance to Bosnia..." and the responsibility lies with the newspaper." [quotation marks, ellipses as published] [Zaki] Mr. Minister: You have met with the Iraqi foreign minister. Are we going to see a promotion of Iranian-Iraqi relations? [Velayati] The issue with Iraq is different. We are engaged in complex [murakkabah] talks; we are moving toward reducing problems and then solving them. [Zaki] When will you visit Baghdad? [Velayati] After a month, or perhaps 40 days.
