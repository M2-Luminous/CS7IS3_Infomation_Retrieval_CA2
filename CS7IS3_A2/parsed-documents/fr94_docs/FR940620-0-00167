FR940620-0-00167 FR940620-0-00030 To keep its ``List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities'' consistent with EPA's list of CERCLA hazardous substances and reportable quantities, RSPA is amending the HMR in accordance with these EPA final rules. In addition, RSPA is making several non-substantive editorial changes to its ``List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities.'' The RQ for ``diethylhexyl phthalate'' is being revised to correctly read 100 pounds. In addition, RSPA is adding ``methyl ethyl ketone'' to the list of hazardous substances as a synonym for ``methyl ethyl ketone (MEK).'' RSPA is also amending the entry for DO41 to correctly read ``D041 2,4,5-Trichlorophenol.'' Finally, RSPA is removing the footnote ``*'' from the list of hazardous substances. The footnote ``*'' symbolized that an entry also appeared in the Hazardous Materials Table in 49 CFR 172.101 (HMT) as a proper shipping name. However, the numerous changes to the HMT promulgated under Docket No. HM&hyph;181 on December 21, 1990 (55 FR 52401) make it impractical to determine if those entries in the list of hazardous substances marked with the ``*'' are still proper shipping names in the revised HMT. The paragraphs preceding the lists of hazardous substances are also editorially revised to indicate that the list of hazardous substances: (1) fulfills the requirement under CERCLA that all hazardous substances be listed and regulated as hazardous materials under the HMTA; and (2) includes substances listed under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Solid Waste Disposal Act, Clean Air Act, and those substances designated by the Administrator of EPA. In addition, common and contract carriers are informed that they may be held liable under laws other than CERCLA for the release of a hazardous substance during transportation that commenced before the effective date of the listing and regulating of that substance under the HMTA. This rulemaking will enable shippers and carriers to identify CERCLA hazardous substances and thereby enable them to comply with all applicable HMR requirements and to make the required notifications if a discharge of a hazardous substance occurs. In addition to the reporting requirements of the HMR found in §§171.15 and 171.16, a discharge of a hazardous substance is subject to EPA reporting requirements at 40 CFR 302.6 and may be subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. Coast Guard at 33 CFR 153.203. Because this rulemaking makes numerous modifications to the ``List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities'' found in Appendix A to §172.101, RSPA is reprinting ``Table 1_Hazardous Substances Other than Radionuclides'' in its entirety. II. Regulatory Analyses and Notices In accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), RSPA has determined that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment and review are impracticable and unnecessary. SARA mandates that the Department of Transportation list and regulate, as hazardous materials under 49 CFR Parts 171&hyph;180, hazardous substances designated by EPA under CERCLA. EPA is the sole agency authorized to designate hazardous substances and their reportable quantities. Therefore, public comment and review are unnecessary because: (1) The public was afforded time to comment when EPA published its notice of proposed rulemaking concerning that agency's change in the subject RQ's; and (2) RSPA does not have the authority to designate hazardous substances or determine their reportable quantities. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures This final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is not considered significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034). The economic impact of this final rule is minimal to the extent that preparation of a regulatory evaluation is not warranted. Executive Order 12612 This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 (``Federalism''). The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act contains an express preemption provision (49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a)4)) that preempts State, local, and Indian tribe requirements on certain covered subjects. Covered subjects are: (i) the designation, description, and classification of hazardous materials; (ii) the packing, repacking, handling, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous materials; (iii) the preparation, execution, and use of shipping documents pertaining to hazardous materials and requirements respecting the number, content, and placement of such documents; (iv) the written notification, recording, and reporting of the unintentional release in transportation of hazardous materials; or (v) the design, manufacturing, fabrication, marking, maintenance, reconditioning, repairing, or testing of a package or container which is represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in the transportation of hazardous materials. This final rule concerns the designation of hazardous materials. This final rule preempts State, local, or Indian tribe requirements in accordance with the standards set forth above. The HMTA (49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a)(5)) provides that if DOT issues a regulation concerning any of the covered subjects after November 16, 1990, DOT must determine and publish in the Federal Register the effective date of Federal preemption. That effective date may not be earlier than the 90th day following the date of issuance of the final rule and not later than two years after the date of issuance. RSPA has determined that the effective date of Federal preemption for these requirements will be [insert date 90 days after date of publication]. This rule is mandated by CERCLA, and does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule applies to shippers and carriers of hazardous substances, some of which are small entities; however, the economic impact of this rule is minimal. Paperwork Reduction Act There are no new information collection requirements in this final rule. Regulation Identifier Number (RIN) A regulation identifier number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory action listed in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Regulatory Information Service Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of each year. The RIN number contained in the heading of this document can be used to cross-reference this action with the Unified Agenda.
