FR940303-0-00053 FR940303-0-00015 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [MN31&hyph;1&hyph;6283; FRL&hyph;4842&hyph;9] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Minnesota AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Technical amendment. SUMMARY: This document contains corrections to a final rule which was published on April 8, 1981 relating to approval of a Minnesota State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision consisting of a sulfur dioxide control plan and emission limitations contained in revised operating permits for the Rochester and Twin Cities nonattainment area. This technical amendment corrects an error of codification in the CFR and prevents further confusion in citing the Minnesota SIP revision. EFFECTIVE DATE: This action will be effective on March 3, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Maggie J. Greene at (312) 886&hyph;6088. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 8, 1981, (46 FR 20996), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) approved a Minnesota State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision consisting of a sulfur dioxide control plan and emission limitations contained in revised operating permits for the Rochester and Twin Cities nonattainment area. USEPA erroneously codified its approval at 40 CFR 52.1220(c)(16). Paragraph (c)(16) had already been utilized to codify USEPA's March 4, 1981 (46 FR 15138) approval of a revision to provide for modification of the Minnesota air quality surveillance network. This revision is related to items incorporated by reference into the Minnesota State Implementation Plan which is designated as 40 CFR 52.1220, Identification of plan, subpart Y_Minnesota. Need for Correction Duplicate paragraphs 52.1220(c)(16) make citations to these paragraphs confusing and unclear. For this reason, USEPA is publishing this technical amendment to avoid further confusion.
