Kohl told the heads of state and government during the opening of the alliance's two-day conference in Brussels today that the alliance had to take seriously the "understandable security policy concerns" of the states of Central, Eastern, and southeastern Europe. The people in these countries currently felt they were living in a "gray zone of security." For this reason, NATO's offer of "Partnership for Peace" also opened up the prospect of joining the Atlantic alliance. Kohl stressed, however, that "nobody is able to give a concrete date for this at the moment." Training for participation in international peace missions could number among the joint activities envisaged. Kohl is also prepared to offer the reform states immediate consultations if they are faced with a threat. This made clear that the offer of a Partnership for Peace was not merely a diplomatic cliche, "but a seriously intended step on the path toward later membership," Kohl said. No new rifts should be created in Europe. A relationship based on partnership had to be developed with Russia and Ukraine. Policies of partnership, responsibility, and constructive involvement in international problems were expected from the Russian side. Attempts at hegemony could not be reconciled with these expectations, Kohl said.
