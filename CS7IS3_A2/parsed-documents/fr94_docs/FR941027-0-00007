Grant funds under the special disbursement method will be requisitioned in accordance with the applicable provision in paragraph (e)(4) of this section; (4) For the reimbursement method, grant funds requisitioned for individual projects in increments of $100,000 or greater, or at least 25 percent of the amount approved for the revolving loan fund, whichever is less, may be submitted for disbursement at any time. Under the special disbursement method, grant funds of less than $100,000 may be requisitioned for disbursement at any time.
