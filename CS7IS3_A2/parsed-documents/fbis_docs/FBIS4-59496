[Ghawshah] At a first reading, these agreements, which were carried by the media, are amazing. In the past, the [Oslo] PLO-Israeli agreement was opposed for basic and principled reasons. One who is conscientious or patriotic, or one who loves his people will be amazed when he reads this agreement. This is because the agreement gives a complete and perpetual mortgage to Zionist occupation. I want to emphasize three points regarding the gravity of this agreement: 1. This agreement relinquishes both the land of Palestine and the Palestinian people's rights to the lands of their fathers and forefathers. 2. This agreement forces all factions of the Palestinian people into standing on the same slippery road, and places them face to face with one another, so the Jewish occupier can look at them and laugh, exactly as the merchant of Venice, the Jewish Shylock, laughed. 3. This is a false peace. Everything in it is a lie. The hypocritical world blessed the Palestinian and Zionist parties to this agreement. In fact, there is only one party, the Zionist party, which, as Peres said, has no other party to negotiate with. [passage omitted] [Al-Hijjawi] There is talk about releasing detainees who support these agreements, after they sign pledges not to resort to violence and resistance, and also about excluding detainees who oppose the agreements, including Hamas detainees. What is your view in this regard? [Ghawshah] This is another tragedy. Regrettably, the Palestinian negotiating delegation, blessed by the Tunis leadership, distributed a pledge among all administrative detainees, so they would sign it, disavow the so-called violence and terrorism, and accept the Oslo agreement. There are many signs showing that this took place with the knowledge and approval of the Palestinian side. This, in itself, is a tragedy and a crime committed against the issue of prisoners and detainees. The decisions made by the Tunis group cannot be made by an armed Arab Palestinian group. The decisions of this group are almost the same as those of the Zionist enemy. This explains the current state of amazement, frustration, and despair our Palestinian people in the occupied territories are experiencing. [passage omitted] [Al-Hijjawi] Preparations have begun for the entry of a number of Palestinian policemen [into Gaza and Jericho]. How will Hamas deal with these policemen? [Ghawshah] The police issue is one of the dangerous mines planted among the Palestinian people. Undoubtedly, Rabin and Peres will laugh too much and exchange toasts when the last Zionist soldier leaves Gaza, because they know that they have put the Palestinian people face to face with each other, and put the Palestinian policemen and 'Arafat's men face to face with the Palestinian opposition, particularly Hamas. This serious image cannot be disregarded by any sincere person. We beseech God not to fulfill the Zionist planners' objectives and aspirations. The Hamas Movement has already said it will not attack the Palestinian police, if this police force carried out its duties of protecting its people. However, the situation will be very serious if this police force tries to chase the mujahidin and to prevent them from carrying out the duty of jihad, which is decreed by God. So, shall the mujahid respond to God's orders, or to this policeman who is executing Rabin's instructions? [Al-Hijjawi] How you will act if the police force receives orders to fire at your men? [Ghawshah] I cannot determine exactly how Hamas will deal with future developments, because the circumstance and the event itself will determine this action. However, we hope the Palestinian policemen will have a strong sense of responsibility and will not obey idiotic orders against their own people. We hope the youths of ['Izz-al-Din] al-Qassam will continue to direct their rifles against the Zionist occupation. This is not an easy thing. All faithful and sincere people should not be neutral, but they must prevent any inter-Palestinian fighting. What is taking place in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia is enough. There could be a ray of hope represented by an escalation of the jihad against the occupation troops in the West Bank. These mujahidin and intifadah youths will tell their people: "This is the real battlefield, come and join us." Only then will the crime of self-rule will be exposed. [Al-Hijjawi] Can we understand from you that Hamas will seek to calm the situation in Gaza and Jericho? [Ghawshah] Hamas has declared that it will not confront the self-rule by force. This is dictated by the principled and national position. It is true that this is somewhat bitter, but you should drink what is bitter if you want to overcome what is more bitter. Avoiding resistance against the Palestinian police force and self-rule in Gaza and Jericho is a Hamas policy which it will pursue, God willing, in order to spare its people the evils of internecine fighting. At the same time, those who planned the agreement which was signed in Cairo on 4 May 1994 must know that the mujahidin will not stop their jihad and that the intifadah people will not stop their intifadah. If the other party continues to pressure and harm its people, the consequences will be bad to all sides. We hope that this party will not use all its weight to achieve all that the Zionists want. We want to address a message to this party: "You are now on the touchstone, and you must prove that you are with your people and homeland, or otherwise, your people will discard you, and you will become one of those men who collaborate with the occupation and who are tools to it. This is the message we want to address in the name of the movement. [passage omitted] [Al-Hijjawi] There is a development in Hamas' political approach, which was clear in Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq's statements. Is this development moving toward dealing with specific political facts within the framework of a peace treaty, or is it a truce? Is Hamas still adopting its previous stands? [Ghawshah] Let me say the interview conducted with Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq contained some mistakes. Some of these mistakes were what was attributed to him about a treaty. The truth is that Hamas cannot agree on a treaty. This is a mistake. However, what Hamas said in the past, and even through Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, is that in case the Zionist forces withdrew and the occupation was removed, then it would be possible for Hamas to study a temporary truce. The temporary truce does not stipulate recognition of the other party. In the law of war and peace in Islam, truce is allowed. There is no objection to the truce issue, if the terms will be in the interest of Muslims. Regarding whether there has been a change in Hamas' strategic and short-term program, the answer to this is: Hamas' strategic and short-term program has not changed. The Hamas Movement considers Palestine an Arab and Islamic land from the [Jordan] River to the [Mediterranean] Sea. It is also an Islamic endowment. No one is authorized to relinquish one inch of it. Neither Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, nor Musa Abu-Marzuq, or Ibrahim Ghawshah or anyone else can do this. None of them has ever done this. This is part of the Muslims' creed. We cannot recognize the Zionist entity, achieve reconciliation, or hold negotiations with it. This is because as soon as we negotiate with it this will mean an official recognition. If negotiations have to take place, something which is ruled out, they will take place through a third party. What the Hamas Movement proposed was a short-term political view based on its strategic program. This is a reply to those who always say that the Hamas Movement program is nonexistent. [Al-Hijjawi] How does Hamas view the recent Interior Ministry measures to facilitate Palestinians' movement? [Ghawshah] The Islamic Resistance Movement was against the disengagement decision, because it was unjustified. We believe any measures adopted to facilitate visits by West Bank people and youths to the East Bank will reinforce the firm unity between the two peoples. We support unity between the two peoples, and Arab and Islamic unity.
