Before his departure from Albania, Van der Stoel gave a short interview to correspondent Shpetim Roqi. Asked what opinion he formulated from the meeting with the arrested, he answered: This morning I met five of the six arrested, as one of them is further along in his defense. I am very pleased that I, along with my adviser and an interpreter, was given the opportunity to meet with them alone and not in the presence of the Albanian authorities. Asked what he gathered from the conversation with the five arrested regarding their treatment, Van der Stoel answered: Of course, we should wait for the trial. The defendants told me that they were given the right to defense attorneys and that they have already met with them. Regarding whether they are guilty or innocent, that is for justice to decide. I did not hear any complaints about their treatment. Asked what influence his visit will have, he said he hoped that his visit will influence the normalizing of Greek-Albanian relations.
