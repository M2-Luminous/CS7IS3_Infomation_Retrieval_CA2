Opposition figures argue that the NDP, by including the chairmen of all political parties in a preparatory committee, sought to give "opposition doves the opportunity to swallow up opposition hawks". In a letter to President Husni Mubarak last month, the opposition demanded the inclusion of all parties, regardless of their size or role, in the preparatory committee. Mubarak, who chairs the NDP, responded positively and decided to expand the committee from its original 25-member set-up. The committee's exact make-up, however, is yet to be announced, although it was said at the time that its first meeting would be held the first week of May. Opposition figures feared that the minor, and largely moderate, parties would automatically align themselves with the NDP if they were represented on the preparatory committee, and would back the NDP in what the opposition views as its attempt to impose a "government-inspired" agenda on the proposed dialogue, thus pouring water on the burning issues opposition hawks seek to raise. The NDP's decision to enlarge the preparatory committee "appears to be a positive response to opposition demands but in fact it is aimed at ensuring that a significant number of opposition parties take sides with the NDP and its government-inspired agenda", said Dr. Hilmi Murad, deputy chairman of the Islamist-oriented Labour Party. At issue is the opposition demand, to which the NDP objects, that political reform be given top priority on the dialogue's agenda. Murad fears the minor parties would back the NDP's position that economic reform should take precedence over political questions. Lutfi Wakid, deputy chairman of the leftist Progressive Unionist Party [NPUG], described as positive the NDP's decision to enlarge the preparatory committee. "But what really counts is action on the ground, the government's response to the people's demand for greater democracy," Wakid said. "Only when the dialogue materialises and results are achieved will we be able to say whether the NDP's decision was a good move." Wakid said the decision, in itself, does not prove the good intentions of the ruling party. "It could be aimed at bypassing the opposition's demands," he said. "The course and results of the dialogue alone are what counts." Murad, for his part, rejected repeated assertions by Safwat al- Sharif, the NDP's assistant secretary-general, that the hoped-for dialogue would not be a "dialogue of confrontation". Al-Sharif had argued the NDP did not plan to face the opposition across the negotiating table but, rather, all parties would be involved in the exchange of views. But for Murad, a confrontation is inevitable. "The NDP has its declared policies and the opposition parties have declared theirs," Murad said. "If the NDP Government plans to simply listen to the opposition's views, the dialogue will be useless. The government must have the true readiness to be persuaded that other (opposition) policies might produce better results than its own policies." However, Murad added this did not mean opposition parties shared identical positions. Wakid likewise noted there are "clear contradictions in opposition ranks", declaring some opposition parties were "more reactionary" than the NDP. As an example, he said the NPUG and Wafd shared similar positions on the demand for greater democracy and public freedoms but were divided by basic differences on the questions of social and economic development. Murad conceded that the opposition parties were divided on the agenda of the proposed dialogue, but said coordination between them was possible. He stressed, however, that political reform should top the agenda "since political reform must constitute the basis of all other reforms, providing solutions to other problems". Murad argued political reform would spell the end of terrorism. "All parties condemn terrorism in all its forms, but the dialogue is not meant to produce a declaration of condemnation. We should search for ways to uproot terrorism. Here, the importance of political reform emerges. Once young people have confidence in the ballot boxes, everybody will respect the decisions taken by the majority, even though those decisions may run counter to some people's interests," Murad said. He said the NDP's Government did advance solutions to some problems "but those solutions did not work as a result of other actions by the same party. This underlines the importance of political and democratic reform to create the opportunity of democratic change through the ballot boxes," Murad said.
