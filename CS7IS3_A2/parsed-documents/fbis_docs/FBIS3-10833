AD Secretary of Organization Lewis Perez Daboin also was present at the meeting. Although it was said that the meeting was a social event to welcome Munoz Ledo, who recently returned from vacation in the United States, AD sources did not rule out the possibility that this meeting could be part of an AD internal stratagem to reorganize the party and recover some ground lost by the political organization. [passage omitted on background material] In addition, reports that Munoz Ledo will seek support from the Pentagon for presumed coupist plans in Venezuela still circulate. Of course, AD leaders, including Alfaro Ucero, have denied those reports. Alfaro Ucero expressed his full support for Munoz Ledo, describing him as a democrat.
