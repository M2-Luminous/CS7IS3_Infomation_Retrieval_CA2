In Mexico we had the opportunity to talk with President Carlos Salinas about the bilateral treaty signed between Costa Rica and Mexico. We discussed how to implement it better and how to make it function effectively. We also discussed the situation in Central America from Costa Rica's point of view. We discussed issues that we should discuss at the Ibero-American Summit to be held in mid- June in Cartagena, Colombia. We discussed with Mexican business leaders their expectations and aspirations for the bilateral treaty. We were accompanied by the presidents of the chambers of commerce of Costa Rica. We discussed Mexico's political situation with Mexican presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo and matters of interest such as NAFTA. In Mexico we were accompanied by Farid Ayales, who will be the labor minister during my administration, so he could talk with his Mexican counterpart and gain firsthand information about the great effort Mexico has been making based on the national agreement proposed by President Salinas. Based on this agreement, the various sectors -- business, labor, and government -- meet weekly to examine potential areas of conflict in the Mexican adjustment process. We were also accompanied by Marco Vargas, who will be the economy minister in my cabinet, so he could learn about Mexico's special program to make small and midsize enterprises more productive. [passage omitted] From Mexico we went to the United States and held several meetings with Vice President Al Gore; Alexander Watson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American Affairs; Assistant Secretary (Talbot); and Mr. Hamilton, a State Department expert on U.S. policy for Central America. We spoke with them about the importance of strengthening our bilateral relations. Costa Rica and the United States historically have had excellent relations, but we think they can be improved in many fields [10-second break in reception]. We are very interested in achieving an equal footing with Mexico so we can compete to attract foreign investment and so our products can compete on the U.S. market. We discussed this with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, the counterpart of our foreign trade minister. We can say that the United States views this as a possibility. We proposed this in September of last year during our first visit to the United States. We expect to see some specific action as early as July or August of this year, when the legislature will meet to ratify the Uruguay Round of GATT and may then incorporate annexes that will allow the Caribbean Basin Initiative countries to secure more benefits. Jose Rossi [foreign trade minister-designate] can give you more details on this. We also met with officials from multilateral and bilateral organizations, with [words indistinct] and the vice president of the World Bank, Mr. (Gourky) and Mr. (Beza), who holds a post that is equivalent to the IMF vice presidency. We discussed with them what we have been saying since 1991, when we presented at (Corec) a proposal on the PAE [Economic Adjustment Program]. We talked with them about what we want: more investment in the social sector, especially in health and education, to supplement loans recently approved for health and education by the IDB. We also discussed the need to improve production in the country. We have done much without reducing tariffs or eliminating tariff barriers as part of our world integration strategy, but we have not done all that could be done to promote production or to pave the way so that medium- and small-sized businessmen may compete in the world economy. We reached the very satisfactory conclusion they fully agree to reanalyze and restructure the loan they had been negotiating with the government. [passage omitted] We feel strongly about the great responsibility we have on the domestic side of public administration and the specific things we need to do in the country. We also feel Costa Rica should look abroad to forge strong alliances with at least three groups. One group, of course, is our nation's friends and those who lead their governments. We met with some of these people in each of the three countries. A second group would be the business sector in these countries. We met with members of the U.S. and Mexican business communities. Costa Rica is still interested in attracting large amounts of foreign investment to our country, but it must be foreign investment that offers a high degree of added value, meaning we want investment with a significant amount of technical transfer attached to it, something which can make us the leaders in many areas of worldwide competition. We want investment that can allow us to have better salaries than what we have now. A third alliance on the international scene, in addition to the political alliance with friendly governments and the economic alliance with the business community, should be with the academic world. The truth is many of these universities and learning centers have closely followed the process of development in many other countries. They have had the opportunity to study and propose alternatives and solutions to the many problems of development; they have seen what has worked and what has not. We believe, along these lines, it is important to have their experience, advice, and interest in Costa Rica. We expressed to the three countries and the groups with whom we met our desire for Costa Rica to become a prototype of sustainable development. We explained such sustainable development should be founded on the following: The enormous lesson this country learned during the 1950's, 1960's, and 1970's, a lesson which showed us how productive social investment can really be. What we invested in health and education then is what has allowed us to enjoy the country we have now. We want to continue with that investment. We need to be more efficient and decentralize public services, as we announced in our government plan. We must continue, however, with social spending as one of the main pillars that will buttress sustainable development. The second pillar should be the lesson we learned during the 1980's, when this country earned its place as a leader as of 1982.
