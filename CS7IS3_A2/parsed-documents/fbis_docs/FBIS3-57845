This is how the French newspaper LIBERATION announced to its readers that Greece had assumed the European Union [EU] presidency. The front-page headline would have honored Greece if the well-known "leftist" Parisian newspaper had not intended it to sound like a police warning about an fugitive thief or murderer. It is a fact that the foreign press has recently begun a recital of attacks against our country, particularly since PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] has returned to power. They have written about everything, especially the PASOK government and Greece.... Many of us will rush to conclude that there is an international conspiracy against our country designed by some dark forces to hurt us as a people and a country. We would not rule out some biased voices that are never missing, not even from reliable foreign mass media. But let's not exaggerate. Besides, we always find it easy to blame the foreigners and their secret services. First of all, we must admit our responsibility. We have had nothing remarkable to show in the international arena over the last few years. We used to receive one or two Nobel prizes. We had Maria Callas, Manos Khatzidhakis, Mikis Theodhorakis. We were "in" with our Sirtaki dance and our islands. We used to be heard. We used to be respected. Now we have fallen into nonexistence and disrespect. We proved to be incapable of promoting Greece abroad. Our diplomacy is nil. And instead of promoting an aggressive foreign policy and intervening in the Balkans, we have ended up grousing and constantly complaining. Especially about Skopje. After not demanding our rights for 45 years, we suddenly woke up one morning and, carried away by a thoughtless, sentimental--not to mention nationalistic--view, eliminated all the alternatives and now speak of an upcoming national defeat and humiliation. Unfortunately, we did not plan or weigh the risks. The leading parties showed concern only for the political costs in their handling of this issue. In their judgments of Greece, the foreigners certainly made malicious exaggerations, but we gave them the right to do so. By being unbearably divided, incapable of charting a minimum national strategy, and making frequent accusations containing the words "treachery," "lowest bid," and "submissiveness," we have given foreigners the right to treat us like international crooks. We assumed the European presidency the day before yesterday. It is a good opportunity to preside seriously and dynamically. The government and the prime minister are assuming a great responsibility: To shut the mouths of those who are insulting us and prove that Greece is not what they are hysterically declaring. It is a country they should respect, not just remember it during wartime.
