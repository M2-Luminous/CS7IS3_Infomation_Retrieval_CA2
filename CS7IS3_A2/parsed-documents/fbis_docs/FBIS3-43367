In a press release issued today, the minister of justice and attorney general said he had refused to receive the memorandum because he thought the document was not only irresponsible but also undemocratic and unconstitutional. The press release said it is the view of the minister of justice and attorney general that the president of this country can only be elected into office or removed from office by all the citizens who are eligible to vote through the ballot and not by the MDP alone, through what he called unorthodox means. The press release added that if the MDP wants the president to be removed from power it should go to the countryside and campaign for the forthcoming general elections so that it is voted into power through the ballot box. The press release, therefore, advised the MDP not to deliver such documents to the attorney general who, it said, had no power whatsoever under the constitution or any of the country's laws to ask the president to retire. Meanwhile, our reporter says police in Blantyre today stopped a march organized by the MDP to deliver the memorandum to the government (?through) the attorney general. Our reporter says the march, which had about 100 participants, and was led by the MDP secretary general Mr. Kondowe started at 1000 this morning from the clock tower in Blantyre. In the ensuing incident Mr. Kondowe and his driver were taken to the Southern Division Police headquarters. Latest reports say Mr. Kondowe and his driver have since been let free.
