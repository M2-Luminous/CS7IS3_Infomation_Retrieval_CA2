In an interview for the Zagreb weekly GLOBUS, Manolic said that the crisis could be solved only through elections. However, he added, the state and the HDZ leadership did not want early elections "because it is clear to them that they would lose because of accumulated problems." Speaking about his plans, Manolic said that he would move toward a differentiation in the HDZ. This means that a group of his supporters together with him will leave the party, which will "finally bring about a formal split in the HDZ," Manolic said. According to Manolic, "The final show-down has begun and the casualty list could possibly include Chamber of Deputies Chairman Stipe Mesic, Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, and former Prime Minister Franjo Greguric." It seems that Tudjman "has moved against me first, regarding me as the toughest nut to crack" and that from time to time he will replace "one by one the members of the liberal wing of the HDZ." According to Manolic, the vital difference between him and Tudjman lies in the strategic policy regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina. As far as the Washington agreement is concerned, I believe that my option for Bosnia prevailed: It is based on cooperation between Croats and Muslims and on respect for the integrity [celovitost] of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is a fact, said Manolic, that there is a group of politicians in Herzegovina who find the Washington agreement with the Muslims unsuitable. "A war can break out again over 10 square km and whether they would be part of the Croat or the Muslim cantons, or about different posts in the federation and whether they should be occupied by Croats or by Muslims," stressed Manolic. Manolic said he also came into conflict with Tudjman because of the functioning of a law-governed state. "We should halt forcible expulsions, the blowing up of houses, and discrimination along national criteria, which is still happening," he warned and said that "the present set-up has not proven capable of protecting the rights of all Croatian citizens." He wanted to know who stood behind the political decisions to establish concentration camps in Herzeg-Bosna, to hold the eastern part of Mostar under siege for six months, to blow up the Old Bridge, and finally, to wage a war against Muslims. In his interview for GLOBUS, Manolic said that Croatian Defense Minister Gojko Susak "was the one most involved in the implementation of the Croatian policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
