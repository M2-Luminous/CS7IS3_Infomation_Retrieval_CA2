FBIS3-29324 "dreas033__a94019" FBIS-EAS-94-033-A Document Type:Daily Report 17 February 1994 ANNEX Japan MITI Gives `Instructions' on Stimulus Package OW1602052294 Tokyo TOKYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 14 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1602052294 Tokyo TOKYO SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] has given rather unusual instructions to economic organs, including the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations [Keidanren] that, in commenting on the economic stimulus package announced recently, they should "indicate" to outsiders "a high appraisal" of the program. This was disclosed in a document obtained by TOKYO SHIMBUN on 13 February. This document, which also includes a "model" comment, urges economic organs to clarify their position on supporting correction of the gap in the ratio between direct and indirect taxes, and also on demanding a "prompt decision" on how financial sources will be secured to make up for losses from tax cuts -- an issue that has been discussed among various political parties following the rejection of the "national welfare tax" concept. In this way, MITI imposes pressure on the economic organs to make a high appraisal of the package. However, the economic circles have reacted strongly, saying: "It is tantamount to control of speech by bureaucrats." Moreover, in view of the fact that bureaucrats are being criticized for "controlling Japan," the MITI document will most likely create a stir in the international community. On the afternoon of 8 February, before a cabinet decision was made on the comprehensive economic package, MITI sent the document to various economic organs, including Keidanren, the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry [JCCI], the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations [JFEA], and the Japan Association of Corporate Executives [JACE]. The document entitled "Draft Comments on the Economic Package" is mainly made up of "major points" and "model" answers that economic organs should make when asked by new agencies to comment on the details of the economic package. Among the points clearly stated in the document are: that 1) they should welcome and highly appraise the government's decision on launching the package totalling over 15 trillion yen; 2) that they should support the government's plan for correcting the gap in ratios between direct and indirect taxes; 3) that they should call for an end to discussion on tax system reform, including the issue of how to finance losses from tax cuts, at an early date so as to obtain public consensus on the reform; and 4) that they should indicate their intention to immediately take measures based on early legislation of budget and tax reform bills. Moreover, the document gives several "model" answers based on these points. For example: "The package can be highly appraised as a decisive judgement made by the ruling parties and government." Even a proviso is attached to the document, saying they should highly appraise the package "by touching on proper content" such as concrete examples concerning tax cuts. In response, however, the business circles maintain that "the document should not be accepted" because it is unprecedented. Another top business leader also strongly criticized MITI and expressed his displeasure openly. He said: "MITI intends to mold public opinion by trying to convey the will and ideas of those who govern to those who are governed." Thus, evaluations of the package announced by the four major economic organs did not exclusively support it. For instance, JAEC Chairman Masaru Hayami even indicated dissatisfaction with the land tax system, and said: "It will have only a limited effect on promoting land transactions." Thus, the four economic organs managed to repel, for the time being, the pressure imposed on them by MITI. However, being a MITI-authorized corporation formed on the basis of the Law on Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the JCCI maintains delicate relations with MITI. Thus, in the comments issued on the evening of 8 February in the name of Chairman Kosaku Inaba, the JCCI stated: "We welcome the liberal measure of earmarking 1.3 trillion yen to help small and medium-sized companies." In this comment, it can be noted that some "consideration" must be given to MITI's intention. In response to opposition from business circles, a senior MITI official first admitted sending such a document to economic organs, and then denied it was an attempt to impose pressure on them. He explained that "the document is designed to make them fully understand the package, but 'they are not asked' to act in accordance with the document." According to MITI Administrative Vice Minister Hedeaki Kumano: "No instructions were given to make draft comments nor did I know what was all about. Generally speaking, when an economic package has been worked out, a briefing will be given to the business circles so as to make them fully aware of the package. This time we tried to give them a briefing. I don't think instructions were given as to how the package should be appraised..."
