They maintained that the national economic growth rate in China this year will be slightly lower than last year's, but will not go stagnant, if no serious natural calamities occur and no major changes take place in state macro-economic control policies. But, they predicted, the task to keep inflation under control and solve difficulties for enterprises will be more arduous. This year the central government sets the national economic growth rate at nine percent and will control inflation below 10 percent. Though experts differ on China's economic growth rate this year, a near-unanimous understanding is that, to seek a fast growth rate, it is essential to shift priority from expanding scale to improving efficiency. Future economic development should be governed by macro-economic controls, especially by financial policies. Experts predicted that this year China's economic efficiency is likely to improve, but not by a big margin. It takes time to improve efficiency as a whole, industrial efficiency in particular. Wu Jie, an NPC deputy and vice minister in charge of the State Commission for Economic Restructuring, said the economic growth rate this year projected by the government conforms to China's potential for actual growth. It is designed with the overall environment of economic performance and tolerance taken into full consideration. "If we simply expand demands to seek a fast economic growth, inflation will go up too," Wu added. When China's economy entered a speedy growth period in 1992, the growth rate of its gross domestic product was 13.2 percent that year. In 1993, the growth rate was 13.4 percent. Fast economic growth has significantly strengthened the national strength, but, at the same time, has brought about some conspicuous contradictions and problems, putting strains on the overall economic environment. Liu Guoguang, an NPC deputy and an economist, saw the economy as characterized by four "highs" and four "strains:" high inflation, high industrial growth, high growth in money and credit supply, and high price rise; and strains on transport, energy supply, major raw materials supply, and funds. Liu maintained that this year China's economic growth may come down to about 10 percent and inflation may be kept below 10 percent. Li Yining, an NPC deputy and an economist, maintained that there should be a "relatively fast and rational" development speed. Using a metaphor, he said economic development is like bicycle-riding -- "a too fast ride may lead to a fall while a too slow ride will lead to a stop." Qiu Xiaohua, a senior economist with the State Statistics Bureau, predicted that China's economy will maintain a relatively fast growth rate. He listed five factors to back his views. First, high consumer spending in a populous country provides necessary impetus for economic growth; second, the urgent need to expand construction scale resulting from uneven industrial development will inject vitality into the economy; third, in the course of changing the old system, once restrained productive forces will be released steadily; fourth, breakthroughs will be made in absorbing foreign investment; and fifth, along with a slow recovery of the world economy, markets will expand. Qiu maintained that, while keeping a relatively high growth rate, it is necessary to highlight a "healthy" economic growth and give equal emphasis to speed and efficiency. Economic growth rate should slow down in a proper manner to "land softly" to avoid too heavy economic losses. On strengthening macro-economic controls, experts said it is necessary to bring under control investment in fixed assets, which may fuel inflation. Economist Ma Hong suggested that total control be strengthened and investment structure be readjusted to use limited financial and material resources on key projects badly needed by the country. Economist Dai Yuanchen said China's economic growth is supported by its massive investment in fixed assets instead of being propelled by consumption. Of the 13.4 percent economic growth rate last year, less than five percentage points were propelled by consumption, Dai added. In his view, without being backed by consumption, high growth will not last long. As for this year's inflation, Qiu Xiaohua regarded the situation as "grim," because last year's inflation of 13 percent has left "upward" factors for this year. The unification of exchange rates and taxation reforms will also have an impact on prices, he said.
