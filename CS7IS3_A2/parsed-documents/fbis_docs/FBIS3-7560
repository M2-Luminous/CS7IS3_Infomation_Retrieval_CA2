Washington asserts that "Japan does not take actions unless external pressure is applied," while Tokyo retorts that "the U.S. method of seeking concessions with a threat of sanctions is unacceptable." Intensifying friction between Japan and the United States, two economic giants in the world, is not good for the growth of the world economy. Japan should propose concrete market-opening measures in trade negotiations with the United States. Meanwhile, the U.S. policy of seeking "results-oriented" economic goals is not advantageous to future relations. The two countries will be able to cooperate in areas of common interest and expand scope of cooperation. Since he took office, U.S. President Bill Clinton has listed the reconstruction of the U.S. economy as his top priority task. In accordance with this policy, the United States has taken a hardline stand in negotiations with Japan. After the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. summit in February, Washington reinstated the Super 301 provision of the trade act (which outlines steps for retaliation against trade partners' unfair practices). The United States reinstated the provision apparently because it thought Super 301 was "an effective tool" to press Japan to open its market wider. However, some Americans say there are problems with the Clinton administration's policy toward Japan. They say that there are some U.S. Government officials and negotiators who "regard Japan as a peculiar country" and assert that a hardline policy toward Japan is effective. They also point out that the administration's decisionmaking process toward Japan is not transparent. Glen Fukushima, formerly in charge of Japanese affairs in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, said: "The U.S. administration does not have a clear, consistent, and harmonious trade policy toward Japan." The Clinton administration weighs economic interests heavily in its policy toward Japan and in its Asia policy. But some Asian countries are concerned about U.S. ways of handling trade and human rights issues. With midterm elections set for this autumn, Clinton is expected to continue a policy that emphasizes economic interests. However, the U.S. "results-oriented" approach of seeking concessions from its trading partners could prove disadvantageous in the long run. Of course, Japan needs to reflect on its passive response and delays in decisionmaking that eventually resulted in criticism from trading partners. The European Union and Asian countries are critical of the reinstatement of the Super 301 clause. But at the same time, they urge Japan to open its market wider. French Industry Minister Gerard Longuet said: "Japan's huge current- account and trade surplus poses a problem for the entire world." To ease trade friction with the United States, Japan is urged to open its market wider and take measures to increase domestic demand. At the same time, it is necessary for both countries to expand the scope of cooperation in tackling various issues of common interest in the Asia-Pacific region and the world. In cooperation with the United States, Japan can play a greater role in promoting political and economic cooperation and establishing a relationship of trust in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan and the United States are currently cooperating in tackling global issues such as the environment and overpopulation and yielding desired results. Now is the time for both countries to strengthen their cooperative relations from a global viewpoint to reinvigorate the world economy and stabilize the Asia-Pacific region.
