In other words, have the Serbs completely withdrawn their heavy artillery? [Kinkel] No, we cannot give the all-clear signal, nor do we know what things will be like when the ultimatum expires. The Serbs are withdrawing, but they are having problems with the weather. We have to wait and see. NATO is ready to carry out air strikes. We all hope that air strikes will not be necessary. [Siegloch] One can, at least, say one thing -- the ultimatum, which, for the first time, was a serious threat to the Serbs, has had a certain success. Most of the guns have been withdrawn by now. One now wonders: The fighting in other Bosnian towns, such as in Bihac and Tuzla, continues. The fighting is continuing with greater intensity than before. Does one not have to pose a similar ultimatum and say: Fighting must finally stop there as well? [Kinkel] We deliberately tried to pick out Sarajevo, as pars pro toto, so to speak, as a part that speaks for all, and because the situation in Sarajevo is particularly tragic and bad. However, you are naturally right -- Sarajevo is only part of the terrible military conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, and, indeed, fighting is more intensive than ever around Bihac and Tuzla. Therefore, after Sarajevo, one will have to think about what can be done in these other towns. The question is justified and must be answered. [Siegloch] There are reports that there may soon be a summit on Bosnia, which will be attended by Clinton, Yeltsin, and Chancellor Kohl. What is true about these reports? [Kinkel] Well, it is certainly correct that, in particular, the political solution, which is and must still be striven for by everyone, has made progress as a result of recent developments, also because of the Russian help, because of the Russian influence on the Serbian side. We must use this political momentum, which has been initiated now. Therefore, next Tuesday [22 February], the political directors of Russia, the United States, the European states that are involved, and the United Nations will meet here in Bonn to think about how we can progress with this process, this European action plan, on which the Americans have now gratifyingly concentrated very strongly, too. Then we will wait and see what is going to happen after this directors' conference -- perhaps there will be further political conferences, but this cannot yet be said definitely. [Siegloch] What is the role of the Germans in these talks? Are we some kind of mediators? [Kinkel] Well, in particular, if military issues are involved, we should exercise restraint because we are a bad adviser in these matters due to our constitutional and our historic situation. However, we have a very essential mediating role. I played this role at the troika talks of the European Union last Friday. The chancellor has played this role through his many telephone conversations. We, together with the Americans, are involved most strongly in the humanitarian sphere and, by holding this conference on Tuesday, we are showing our good role as mediators. We have particularly good relations with the Croats and the Muslims -- that means, with two of the parties involved in the conflict -- and we want to make good use of that. [Siegloch] Mr. Foreign Minister, do you think that we will be able to adhere to this military restraint of ours for a long time, or do we not at least have to show in one field -- by sending paramedics to Bosnia, for instance -- that the Germans want to get more directly involved? [Kinkel] Well, we have already gotten involved in many areas -- in Cambodia, in Iraq, and we got involved in Somalia. However, we still have this constitutional brake, which, if maintained, will harm Germany. I say this as foreign minister and, therefore, here and now, I once again call on the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] to give up its blockade. We must become able to act in foreign policy. For that, we need the amendment to the Constitution, and I can only say that the SPD must participate in that, especially if it wants to become capable of ruling. [Siegloch] Thank you very much, Mr. Kinkel.
