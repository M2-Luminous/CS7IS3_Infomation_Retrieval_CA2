Deputy Home Minister Datuk Megat Junid Megat Ayub said Asaari should not be allowed to use a proxy to renew his passport. "We want him to come personally to the department," he told reporters after addressing a seminar on the role of Penawar, a bureau in Pemadam [antidrug association] which helps families of dadah [drug] addicts cope with related problems. Although Megat Junid declined to elaborate, he indicated that there were a few things that the Government needed to know from Asaari, who is believed to be in Thailand. Megat Junid also instructed the Immigration Department to ensure that Al-Arqam sympathisers within the department do not renew Asaari's passport without the latter coming to the office. He added that the Government was getting information on Al-Arqam's activities in Thailand. Megat Junid said he had spoken to Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Dr Abdul Halim Surin [name as published] on the matter and the latter had given an assurance to co-operate fully with Malaysian officials. Although many negative things have been said about the Al-Arqam movement, Megat Junid said appropriate action could only be taken with proof of wrongdoing. He also believed that many people joined the movement for its religious activities and it would not be appropriate to assume that they were engaged in activities that threatened national unity. "The movement has about 10,000 hardcore members but it has about 100,000 sympathisers. We cannot assume that these people are involved in the formation of its alleged Badar [Warrior] Army" he said. Asked why Al-Arqam conducts many of its activities in southern Thailand, Megat Junid said: "Only Asaari can answer that. The movement should continue to carry out its activities here if they do not breach the rules." In Alor Star, the Kedah Government has directed the State Islamic Religious Department to identify Al-Arqam members among civil servants. State Islamic Religious Affairs Committee chairman Sheikh Alias Mustaffa said the department had also been asked to compile a list of activities conducted by Al-Arqam members here. "We are aware that the movement is quite active in the State. We need to know the extent of the members' activities and influence on the people," he said after closing a day-long seminar for 600 imams [clergymen] and religious teachers here yesterday. Sheikh Alias said the directive was in line with the department's move to check Al-Arqam activities. In Kangar, Kedah Menteri Besar [Chief Minister] Tan Sri Dr Abdul Hamid Pawanteh said the State Government was monitoring the activities of the Al-Arqam movement and several other missionary groups to check deviant activities. "The State Islamic Affairs Council is aware of the existence of religious cults in Perlis. "We do not want to have any group using religion for self-gain or for the benefit of a certain group of people to exist in the State," he added. Dr Hamid said the State Government needed evidence that the Al-Arqam had deviated from Islamic teachings before it could decide on what action to take. Al-Arqam has a base at Titi Tinggi along the Kangar-Padang Besar trunk road and its followers are involved in a wide range of economic activities in Perlis. The Islamic Centre recently alleged the Al-Arqam has 313 armed units called the Tentera Badar [Warrior Army].
