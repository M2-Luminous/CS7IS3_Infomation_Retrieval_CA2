The rebellion by security forces was the reason for Brigadier Oupa Gqozo's decision to stand down as leader of Ciskei yesterday. Brig. Gqozo is reportedly being held at a military base in Bisho. The volatile situation, which developed at the stadium in the capital this afternoon, was defused when Brig. Gqozo failed to arrive and address the crowd. Fires are reported to have broken out in two prisons where inmates are demanding a general amnesty.
