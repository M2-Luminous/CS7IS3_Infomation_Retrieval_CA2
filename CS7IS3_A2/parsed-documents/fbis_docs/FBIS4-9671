Such changes are planned in the seven congressional committee proposals announced today by constitutional revision rapporteur Deputy Nelson Jobim. According to these proposals, the right to exploit oil, natural gas, and telecommunications ceases to be the privilege of public companies. [Begin Jobim recording] Look, we want to ensure a state monopoly, that is, the possibility that the government can exploit things either directly or through concessions. We are not forcing public companies to give concessions (?even if the pertaining) company is monopolistic. That is a government decision. [end recording] Flexibility in monopolies also will be adopted for the distribution of piped gas. The rules for concessions will be defined by a complementary law. Jobim also suggested a limitation on government intervention in the economy by eliminating the requirement of government authorization to exercise any economic activity. His proposal also ends differences between national and foreign companies. In the field of public finances and budget, Jobim suggests changes to balance the fiscal accounts, and he is open to suggestions from the Budget CPI [Congressional Investigative Committee]. The main changes he suggested are to withdraw the concept of a congressional committee from the Constitution, and to end social subsidies and voluntary transfers of funds to states and municipalities, which should be authorized only through a specific law.
