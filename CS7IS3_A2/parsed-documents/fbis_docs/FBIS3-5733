Their lawyers said their clients have also criticized the ruling of the Okinawa branch of the Naha District Court for failing to reflect an appropriate amount of compensation. On February 24, the branch court ordered the state to pay a total of 807.45 million yen to 768 residents around the U.S. Kadena Air Base in compensation for noise pollution. The court rejected the suit by the other 139 plaintiffs on the grounds that they did not suffer the same level of inconvenience. The ruling rejected demands for a halt to night flights at the base in line with a Supreme Court decision in February last year involving Yokota Air Base in Tokyo and Atsugi Air Base in Kanagawa Prefecture. The group of 907 residents demanded a halt to flights to and from the Kadena base between 7 P.M. and 7 A.M., 1.15 million yen each in damages for noise-related suffering and compensation for future annoyance until a night flight ban is imposed. Kadena Air Base is under the control of the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing and is considered a key base of the U.S. Air Force in East Asia.
