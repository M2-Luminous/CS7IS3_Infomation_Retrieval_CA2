The forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] have continued shelling the barracks of the presidential forces in Kigali. [passage omitted] Francoise Walmack met Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Willy Claes at noon today. She asked him whether the French decision to intervene was not a gaffe, given the reservations and the opposition of the RPF. Willy Claes said: [Begin Claes recording] I do not think that it is awkward. I understand the reservations that have been expressed, but it must be understood that.... [pauses] and I am not going to give you an exhaustive list of all the attempts to achieve a cease-fire that have failed. Unfortunately, confirmation of serial killings--if I may put it this way--is expected every day. Someone must indeed take the initiative to try and save what can still be saved. France has taken the initiative. There are no other candidates, as far as I know. There are no others, because we should not underestimate the military risks of any operation, even if it is a humanitarian one. I believe that the French are only intending to try to rescue civilians in danger in a single zone by taking them temporarily outside the country to refugee camps, while hoping that--in two months' time at the latest--UN soldiers will be in a position to fulfill their mandate. They are also hoping that, in the meantime, it will be possible to have a cease-fire respected. [end recording] [passage omitted] What is the situation on the ground? As we told you in our headlines, scenes of violence are still taking place on a daily basis. If French troops enter the Rwandan territory, it will be through the west, that is, through the Central African Republic via Zaire. Massacres are taking place in the west of Rwanda, whereas in the south--in Butare--people in a precarious situation in makeshift camps still prevail. Nicholas Poincare takes stock of the situation in Butare: [Poincare] If French soldiers come to Rwanda, they will probably enter through the west. They will come to the country of militias, machetes, and killers--in those regions where the Tutsi hunt is not over, even though casualties are becoming scarce. A humanitarian operation could still save many lives here. It would come quite late, a long time after the massacres, but there are still thousands of Tutsis in mortal danger who are scattered and hidden in many places. There are orphans who are grouped together by nuns. There are Hutus threatened because they protected Tutsis, while others hide simply because they have lost their identity papers and cannot prove that they are Hutus. There are also hundreds of thousands of people who are not threatened by the massacres, but by famine and disease. They are the Hutus who have fled before the RPF. At least 2 million of them are believed to be in the south of Rwanda. They live in utter poverty, banding together in the hills. In most of these unauthorized camps, no humanitarian organization has yet been seen.
