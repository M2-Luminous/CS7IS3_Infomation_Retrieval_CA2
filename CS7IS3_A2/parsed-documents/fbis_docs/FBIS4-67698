Heavy rains are falling on the city and the neighboring countryside, although the Office of Civil Defense of the Province of Guayas has not reported serious damage from the downpour of 9 February. Health authorities in the City of Guayaquil are combining their efforts to prevent and fight against endemic diseases such as hemorrhagic dengue fever, malaria, and cholera, among other illnesses. Furthermore, efforts are being made to avoid the duplication of effort, the waste of materials, and squandering of human and financial resources. On 9 February technically qualified persons, including Liria Mendoza, subsecretary of health, and officials of the municipal health service, reviewed the situation at a meeting held at the Municipal Offices of Guayaquil. The meeting was presided over by Luis Chiriboga, vice president of the Municipal Council of Guayaquil. The meeting became necessary due to an outbreak of classic dengue fever and an increase in malaria in several outlying areas of the city. Cases of dengue fever have been reported in the densely populated areas of Ayacucho, Ximena, Tarqui, and Febres Cordero, with 94, 343, 133, and 249 persons affected, respectively. Regarding malaria, more than 500 persons have been reported as suffering from the disease in the Flor de Bastion area, a heavily populated section North of Guayaquil. The persons affected by malaria are receiving specialized medical care, and no deaths have been reported so far, nor has any case of hemorrhagic dengue fever been recorded. At the same time heavy rains are falling on Guayaquil and the surrounding province, although, according to the Office of Civil Defense of the Province of Guayas, no substantial damage has been reported, following the downpour of rain on 9 February. The regions most affected by the diseases are the outlying, residential areas of Guayaquil, because they do not have paved streets, safe drinking water, sewage systems, and other modern city services. Large lakes of water and mud have been left by the rains, and food is being sold in town squares and other places under unsanitary conditions. The City of Guayaquil will work with personnel from other services in the area of environmental health to reduce or eliminate pools of water, where disease-carrying mosquitoes breed. Subsecretary Liria Mendoza participated in the technical assessment of the situation, as she has greater experience in spraying insecticides, through the National Service for the Eradication of Malaria. She will also provide insecticides, mosquito netting, and other materials. Antonio Martinez, director of health services of the City of Guayaquil, said that if we do not act in an aggressive way, we will run the risk of having cases of hemorrhagic dengue fever and an increase in other diseases. He explained that, in addition to spraying ponds and pools of water, his service will provide free medical service in outlying residential areas, thanks to which possible outbreaks of epidemics can be detected. The municipal Departments of Sewage and Public Works will also take part in efforts to prevent disease through cleaning drains and draining ponds, canals, and other areas where rainwater has accumulated. A serious case has occurred in the Bastion residential area, where stagnant water has caused a major outbreak of malaria affecting 85 percent of the people living there. For this reason work to drain pools of water is being undertaken on an emergency basis. According to technically qualified sources, the increase of malaria is in the pernicious form of the virus which causes the disease. In the outlying, Bastion area ponds of rain water have formed which the authorities should drain immediately to prevent an increase in the disease. The people have an important role to play in resolving the problem. They should cooperate in cleaning up back yards and gardens, draining ponds and puddles of water, and disposing of objects where water can collect.
