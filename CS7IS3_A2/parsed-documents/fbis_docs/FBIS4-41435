On Friday morning 273 deputies voted for it, with 80 voting against and eight abstaining. Four deputies, who left their electronic voting cards behind, supported the vote in favour at the microphones in the hall. The law provides for the spending of 194.5 trillion roubles and the revenue of 124.5 trillion roubles. It imposes a cap of 70 trillion roubles on the budget deficit. Following the approval by the Duma, the law will be forwarded to the Federation Council. The budget-94 was eventually approved in the fourth round of voting after the earlier three rounds on Wednesday failed to give the seal of approval to the budget, which the deputies found lacking due allocations for defence, health care and education. The Duma had to set an hour apart for voting on Friday and threatened sanctions to absentees. All scheduled trips were cancelled and those on business elsewhere were recalled to ensure the quorum.
