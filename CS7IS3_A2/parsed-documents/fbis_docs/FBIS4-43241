Deputy DGB Chairperson Ursula Engelen-Kefer, who also presented the report on behalf of the late chairman, Heinz-Werner Meyer, called for a "change in economic policy" of the Federal Government. She said full employment had to become the main goal again. The number of unemployed this year would increase to half a million this year, the deputy chairperson predicted. In view of these figures, there was no reason for the government to "demonstrate official euphoria" about economic recovery. Mrs. Engelen-Kefer called such an optimistic assessment an "obvious tactical preelection maneuver." She added that politicians only started talking about economic recovery when the new pay settlements, which had been described everywhere as moderate, were concluded. According to Mrs. Engelen-Kefer, the DGB is seeing the social welfare state in danger. Following the defeat of real socialism, the threshold at which people are reluctant to attack core elements of the social market economy had decreased. The DGB official mentioned as examples the abolition of bad water allowances for construction workers, the introduction of private employment offices, and the admission of sub-standard wages. She blamed the Federal Government's "reckless privatization campaign" for this development. Neither regulation nor deregulation should become a dogma. By the Federal Government's "campaign" for more part-time employment, the government had also recognized now that shorter, not longer, working hours would be a means to combat unemployment. However, most employees were hardly able to renounce a substantial part of their incomes in connection with part-time work. Nor would the DGB accept an increase in part-time employment conditions that did not envisage any social insurance, said Mrs. Engelen-Kefer. At the DGB congress, a reform of German trade unions will be the most important topic. Mrs. Engelen-Kefer told the 600 trade union delegates that it was urgently necessary to strengthen the DGB's competence. However, she also warned them about getting involved in a crisis scenario. The trade unions should defend themselves against a "public campaign." She said: "Neither do we have a mass exodus of members, nor are we a toothless tiger." Mrs. Engelen- Kefer disputed a DGB budget deficit. However, she admitted there were "financial problems" and an "alarming" decline in the number of members by 1.5 million since 1992. Presidium member Teitzel, who is in charge of finances, also disputed a DGB budget deficit. He said the budget of the current year was balanced, and there was no need to draw on trade union assets. The profit and loss account of last year was balanced and would show a "minor surplus." CDU politician Fink, who is also a deputy DGB chairman, called for "work for all." According to Fink, the pay settlements this year have shown that trade unions not only talked about, but also practiced, solidarity. However, Fink warned about always presenting the United States as a model for a functioning labor market. He said that in the United States, many workers' incomes were below the poverty line. International change would only be decided by the importance a country gave education and research, said Fink with reference to U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich. This Tuesday [14 June], the DGB congress will select a successor to Heinz-Werner Meyer. The only candidate is IG Metall Metal Workers Union Presidium member Dieter Schulte. Mrs. Engelen-Kefer is once again running candidate for deputy chairperson. There will be no other deputy in the future. Fink is not running. He said it should still be possible in a unity trade union to be an employee, a trade unionist, and a member of the Christian Democratic Union. The Association of Christian Democratic Employees (CDA) will, in the future, presumably only be represented in the DGB Presidium by Mrs. Goerner. The Presidium will be reduced from eight to five members.
