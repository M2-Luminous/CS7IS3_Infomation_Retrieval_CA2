The agreement is the result of the interests of the Muslim and Croatian nationalities, Izetbegovic said over Croatian television. This was the first explicit comment made by the Muslim leader on the preliminary accord signed in Washington on March 1, under which Bosnian Muslims and Croats will found a federation to be turned later into a confederation with Croatia. But Izetbegovic stressed the integrity of Bosnia and ruled out the possibility of allowing Bosnian Serbs to take away part of the land to Serbia. The federation accord obviously means the recapture of lost territory, he said. The Muslim leader described the agreement as a major step toward peace and said that what is at issue now is how Serbs will act accordingly. He reiterated his expectation that peace may come in late autumn.
