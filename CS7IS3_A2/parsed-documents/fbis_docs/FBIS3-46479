"Our troops are getting closer and closer, the military pressure is working," Ieng Muli said, adding that he hoped the government troops would control the base within the next few days. The attack was a follow up to the offensive launched in central Kompong Thom province December 16 where government forces recaptured a number of Khmer Rouge bases. The troops advanced from Kompong Thom towards Anlong Veng and now control almost half the area around the Khmer Rouge base which is the guerrilla faction's headquarters for all operations in north and central Cambodia. The base was commanded by one-legged Khmer Rouge general Ta Mok, nicknamed "the butcher" because of his reputed cruelty when the Khmer Rouge was in power. He is now said to have fled Anlong Veng and set up a command base in Preah Vihear province where the Thai, Laotian and Cambodian borders meet. Leng Sochea, an Information Ministry official, said the guerrillas had orders to break up into small groups to harass government forces and "to deploy as many landmines as possible." A diplomat in the capital said the Khmer Rouge base would probably be empty when the government troops eventually took it. He said the government already faced major logistics problems in maintaining large numbers of troops in remote areas where access is difficult because of poor roads and landmines. Meanwhile up to 100 Khmer Rouge attacked villages in the Choam Khsan district of Preah Vihear -- near Ta Mok's fall-back base -- on December 22, killing one villager and burning 30 homes, a military report said. The guerrillas struck again in the same area the following day destroying a further 16 homes before being repelled by government troops. The assault on Anlong Veng comes as Prince Norodom Ranariddh said he had agreed with Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan to form a working committee to discuss implementing peace proposals put forward by King Norodom Sihanouk. Asked why the government attack was going on when the two sides had agreed to talk, a senior government official said "it's normal. When you start to negotiate you have to put your weight in the military side also." He said the Khmer Rouge had refused to observe a ceasefire before the talks. "So it's up to them now. If they agree a ceasefire there will be no fighting," he added.
