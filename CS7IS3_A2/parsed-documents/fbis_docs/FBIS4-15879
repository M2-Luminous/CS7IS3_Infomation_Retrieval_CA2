The statement was made by the speaker of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin during his Monday visit to the Chief Staff of the Strategic Missile Force. He was accompanied by the Deputy Defence Minister Andrey Kokoshin. Addressing the personnel of the staff Rybkin stressed that the repetition of the 1959 situation should not be permitted. Then 1,200,000 military men were actually thrown out into the street as a result of cuts in the armed forces. The speaker said he agreed with the former American president Richard Nixon who told the press after a recent visit to Russia that the world is complicated and no one wants any "last breaks to the south" anymore. Rybkin said that in questions related to the army one should be careful with harsh, radical expressions. In his opinion if a pattern of change is chosen, it should not be revolutionary but gradual. Rybkin said that reforms are irreversible but spoke for tighter measures against those whose "grabbing instincts are extraordinarily developed, who take enormous credit for making giant profits." Rybkin stressed that if the president, government, parliament and other political forces act resolutely and revenue will grow irrespective of the way in which the State Duma approves the budget - in parts or for the whole year at once.
