The Pace of Inflation Will Increase in Coming Months"] [Text] For 2.5 hours on 3 February the members of the government's presidium discussed the draft, "Economic Conditions for the Operation of the Agricultural Complex in 1994." Since it is traditional to make up subtitles to government documents, in my opinion this one could be called the classic manual to branch lobbying. The 24 points contain almost everything against which the reform government struggled for 2 years, as, for example, government subsidies for the procurement from abroad of agents to protect vegetation and raw materials for the food industry, and the cancellation of duties on imported spare parts and equipment for some branches of industry. These are seemingly innocuous points, but they radically undermine domestic industry, especially the chemical industry, machine building and the military industrial complex. With government protection of the domestic market they would be able to supply the agroindustrial complex with all it needed, but without it the domestic industry will not be able to withstand competition with foreign suppliers. Let us say that the procurement of sugar from abroad requires a 20-percent duty. Even without this, our sugar prices are the highest in the world. Now the sugar barons, protected from competition, will be able to do with us what they will. It is possible to analyze every point of the document, but it is better to provide summary figures. In the course of this year direct subsidies from budget allocations will equal 14.1 trillion rubles; the creation of a federal food fund will require 14.5 trillion; and special-purpose preferential credit for spring field work - 6 trillion. Add some other benefits to this and you will have a total of 34.7 trillion. From past experience we know that ultimately almost half of preferential credit is transformed into cash and appears on the market. The reaction to this will be unequivocal -- first there will be an increase in the cost of durable goods because they are purchased in expectation of inflation. We can assume that in the coming 2-3 months there will be a sharp increase in the cost of televisions, refrigerators, VCR's and other embellishments of our lives. We cannot avoid price fixing on the hard currency market, which is completely understandable because people prefer to exchange "mad money" for something more dependable, i.e., hard currency. During the January panic about 2 trillion rubles were thrown into the currency market. What if several times more rubles follow this route? In such a case we cannot rule out that B. Fedorov's prediction that by year's end $1 will be equivalent to 10,000 rubles might come to pass even sooner. Everything taken together -- the sugar, meat, flour and milk monopolies, their protection from competition with cheap foreign products, and the growing pace of inflation -- will result in price increases. I think that very soon we will be paying 10,000 rubles for a kilogram of meat and 20,000 for a kilogram of butter. The government has already corrected its goals for the end of the year several times. First there was talk of 4-5 percent inflation in December, then 7-9 percent and then 15-16 percent. But independent experts feel that the upheavals arising from the implementation of "economic conditions" will be so painful that already in April inflation may exceed 30 percent, and in July -- 50 percent. Why should millions of Russians suffer new deprivations and difficulties? The attack on the state treasury proceeded under the pretext that it is essential to rescue the village and to save the peasant from death by starvation. But is the situation within the branch all that tragic? In the course of 2 years production volume decreased within the branch at the slowest pace -- by 4-5 percent as compared to 16-19 percent in industry and 24-27 percent in transportation. Last year there was an increase in the consumption of almost all types of food products except fish and vegetables. Especially great was increased consumption of sugar, confectionery goods, fruit and citrus products -- by 21 percent. The average wage within the agroindustrial complex is 80,000 rubles. At the same time, if we take into consideration income from private plots, then peasants receive more than the workers of half of the sectors of our economy. Perhaps it is not a matter of poverty? Everyone who lives in this country realizes that the entire society is in debt to the village. We would not begrudge any amount of money if it were directed into solving the most acute social problems and into structural reorganization. Unfortunately, there is no talk of this. The people's money will be used according to former methods -- to support that which exists, and not for a structural transformation of the village. This is a guarantee that these tens of trillions will not be enough. They, like previous credit infusions, will disappear into the black hole of ineffective agricultural production. On 3 February the draft was not passed. But we can assume that the basic numbers will not change because the only voices of opposition were those of A. Chubays, S. Dubinin and V. Mashits. At the meeting one of the representatives of the agroindustrial complex said: "The Russian people must feed their peasants." It cannot be said any better. So, fellow countrymen, get out your wallets.
