FR941117-0-00153 FR941117-0-00011 §22.911 Cellular geographic service area. The Cellular Geographic Service Area (CGSA) of a cellular system is the geographic area considered by the FCC to be served by the cellular system. The CGSA is the area within which cellular systems are entitled to protection and within which adverse effects for the purpose of determining whether a petitioner has standing are recognized. (a) CGSA determination. The CGSA is the composite of the service areas of all of the cells in the system, excluding any area outside the cellular market boundary, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, and excluding any area within the CGSA of another cellular system. The service area of a cell is the area within its service area boundary (SAB). The distance to the SAB is calculated as a function of effective radiated power (ERP) and antenna center of radiation height above average terrain (HAAT), height above sea level (HASL) or height above mean sea level (HAMSL). (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) of this section, the distance from a cell transmitting antenna to its SAB along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows: d=2.531×h 0.34 xp 0.17 where: d is the radial distance in kilometers h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters p is the radial ERP in Watts (2) For the cellular systems authorized to serve the Gulf of Mexico MSA, the distance from a cell transmitting antenna to its SAB along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows: d=6.895×h 0.30 xp 0.15 where: d is the radial distance in kilometers h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters p is the radial ERP in Watts (3) The value used for h in the formula in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must not be less than 8 meters (26 feet) HASL (or HAMSL, as appropriate for the support structure). The value used for h in the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must not be less than 30 meters (98 feet) HAAT, except that for unserved area applications proposing a cell with an ERP not exceeding 10 Watts, the value for h used in the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to determine the service area boundary for that cell may be less than 30 meters (98 feet) HAAT, but not less than 3 meters (10 feet) HAAT. (4) The value used for p in the formulas in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section must not be less than 0.1 Watt or 27 dB less than (1/500 of) the maximum ERP in any direction, whichever is more.
