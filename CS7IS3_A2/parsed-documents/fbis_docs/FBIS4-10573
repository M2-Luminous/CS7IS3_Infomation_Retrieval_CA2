It is surprising, to say the least, that less than three weeks after launching his program, Dr. Pastrana has decided to change his position on such a central issue as how Colombian economic policy should be handled. Indeed, on page 5 of his announcement speech, one reads: "The recent evolution in the rate of exchange is largely the result of having a more open economy that has at the same time won the trust of national and foreign investors." In other words, 20 days ago, Pastrana defended the revaluation process as something inevitable and almost appropriate, given the recent influx of capital. On Monday, for reasons I ignore, he decided to support Ernesto Samper's position. For more than eight months now, the Liberal candidate has been explaining that "revaluation is not the path" for an open economy because it hurts exports and all activities that compete with foreign products and services. He has therefore pledged to support a macroeconomic policy that will keep the real rate of exchange stable. What fate would await the country on such a delicate issue as exchange policy in the hands of Andres Pastrana if he changes his mind on the matter every 20 days? Nor is this the first time this has happened in the past two weeks. It is a well-known fact that Ernesto Samper has focused his program on the generation of an adequate number of productive jobs. At the international seminar on Liberalization and Employment sponsored by his campaign and held in Medellin on 28 January, he laid out his employment policy in detail, giving out the figures on how many jobs would be generated by its different components: the export plan, agricultural conversion plan, investment and physical infrastructure programs, low-income housing and human resources, a program to support mini- and small businesses, programs to recruit and train vulnerable groups. According to the numbers, Samper's program would create 1.5 million new and better jobs over the next four years, exceeding the goal of 3.5 million new jobs set for the decade. In contrast, the jobs issue is not among the seven priorities contained in Pastrana's program, priorities publicized profusely in paid advertisements carried by all the daily newspapers and the topic of his announcement speech. His platform, which, as President Gaviria would say, is more of a telephone directory than a true platform, devotes only two of its 200+ pages to the problem of employment, contains no overall strategy for handling it, and offers absolutely no figures whatsoever on the matter. Bombarded with criticism as the result of such a notorious omission on an issue so critical to all Colombians, candidate Pastrana next tried to dispatch the matter by saying that if 1.5 million jobs were created under the Gaviria Administration, he thinks more could be created over the next four years. In addition to being superficial, the argument contains one tiny flaw: Even the most optimistic calculations estimate that fewer than a million jobs have been generated over the past four years. Pastrana's lack of seriousness about and commitment to the issue of employment is more than obvious. The third example of the same approach is the agricultural sector. In his announcement speech, candidate Pastrana goes after the subsidies and protection for the agricultural sector that are part of Samper's Agricultural Conversion Plan. Pastrana said textually on the day he announced that "we shall remove the barriers preventing the agricultural sector from joining the commercial world." "I am telling you that the solution to the crisis does not lie in trying to compete by granting equal subsidies" (equal to those extended by other countries) and that "our only path is to achieve greater efficiency" (in order to overcome the agricultural crisis). In recent days, he has changed that position in public speeches, offering all manner of support to the rural world. Pastrana's position on agriculture apparently depends on whether he is speaking at the Bogota Convention Center or in a town square! The last and most incredible change in position is on the Bogota Metro [subway]. After saying "No" to the Metro in two speeches and opposing Samper's proposal, on the television program "Panorama" broadcast on 28 February, he said with particular cheekiness that he would build the Metro in Bogota. He added that he proposed to do so when he was mayor, even though all Bogota residents recall that he killed the Metro when the Barco Administration and Mayor Sanchez had practically awarded the contracts. By the same standard that you judge, you shall be judged! When the Samper campaign urged candidate Pastrana to take the high road during the campaign and engage in a debate based on ideas, no one ever imagined facing a chameleon-like strategy that changes color to blend with the background: Prussian blue when speaking to the Conservative Convention and when writing to Alvaro Gomez on their many points of ideological agreement; pinkish when sensing a sprinkling of Liberals in the audience. Whether it be on the revaluation, employment, agricultural policy, or the Metro, the country at least knows what to expect from Andres Pastrana: "In all likelihood, who knows?" as he himself said in answer to a question on a different issue put to him by the periodical CAMBIO 16 two weeks ago.
