FR940912-2-00018 FR940912-2-00015 Financial Assistance: The Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa); Cooperative Agreement No. DE&hyph;FC07&hyph;89ID12903 (Renewal) AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office, announces that pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.7, it intends to award a renewal for Cooperative Agreement Number DE&hyph;FC07&hyph;89ID12903 to the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa). The proposed renewal would provide funds for a project to develop lightweight (low density) refractory aggregates for use in a variety of high performance insulating (low thermal conductivity) refractory applications. The project goal is the development of an alumina-based aggregate with a 30% reduction in packed bulk density, with 50% of current crushing strength, and with costs not to exceed 25% more than existing alumina aggregates. The original proposal ``Lightweight Refractory Aggregates'' was submitted to DOE by the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) in response to Solicitation for Financial Assistance Applications for Refractory Materials Research and Development No. DE&hyph;PS07&hyph;88ID12782. The proposed costs for completion of Phase III of the project is $1,265,855 with a 20% cost share by The Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa). The CFDA number is 81.078. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ginger Sandwina, U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office, 850 Energy Drive, MS 1221, Idaho Falls, Idaho (208) 526&hyph;8698. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The statutory authority for the proposed award is the Energy Conservation Program begun in 1977 under the mandate of the Federal Non-Nuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974 (PL 93&hyph;577). The proposal meets the criteria for ``non-competitive'' financial assistance as set forth in 10 CFR Part 600.7(b)(2)(i)(A). The activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of, or is a continuation or renewal of, an activity presently being funded by DOE or another federal agency, and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity of completion of the activity. Issued: August 24, 1994. David W. Newnam, Acting Director, Procurement Services Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;22509 Filed 9&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
