According to the regulations, lawmakers enjoy the right to be received immediately by heads of government organisations. The legislator's ID card is a document granting him the right to pass freely to any body of state authority as well as any enterprise, office or organisation. Parliamentarians have the right to demand that violations of laws, rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of citizens be removed without delay. The regulations also say that the lawmaker's monthly cash remuneration includes a bonus for special nature and intensity of work, a long-service bonus and other bonuses in compliance with operating legislation. The lawmaker's monthy salary is equal to that of a federal minister. State Duma members struck out an item from the regulations today, saying deputies who are members of the federal cabinet, may receive their pay envelopes only at the lower chamber. Legislators are entitled to medical and every-day services enjoyed by cabinet members. The regulations note that legislators enjoy the right of free travel by air, rail, road and water in Russia as well as by all types of city passenger transport, except taxi. They also have the right of obtaining travel documents without waiting. Duma members in the city of Moscow and the Moscow region are provided with office cars assigned to them permanently. Lawmakers with no permanent residence in Moscow are provided with flats for the term of their work at the Duma. However, they cannot be privatised. Pending the receipt of a service flat, the lawmaker is provided with a separate hotel suite or, at the legislator's wish, cash compensation necesary to conclude a contract for hiring a living premise in the amount equivalent to the cost of living at a two-room suite of a four-star hotel. The legislator receives a diplomatic passport for the entire term of his duties. The deputy is also granted an annual paid leave of 48 workdays. He receives an allowance for medical treatment amounting to two monthly salaries. To perform their duties, parliamentarians are provided with offices at the State Duma building as well as at constituencies where they were elected. The lawmaker may have up to five assistants. He independently defines the number of his assistants and the size of their remuneration within the wage fund for assistants. The Duma also adopted a decision later in the day under which the Russian Government is instructed to take appropriate measures to implement the regulations which come into force today.
