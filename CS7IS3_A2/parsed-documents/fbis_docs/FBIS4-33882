A former Popular Action activist, Hurtado Miller (born in Lima in 1940) graduated from the National Agrarian University in 1962, a year after the present head of state, Alberto Fujimori. In an interview with EL COMERCIO, he said it is now time for agriculture to emerge from the prostration in which it has been sunk for the past 20 years. [EL COMERCIO] Why should agriculture be the priority sector to get the $2 billion from privatizing the Peruvian Telephone Company? [Hurtado] For economic development reasons. This sector can give the fastest response with a little investment. We can improve our food supply and diversify our exports. We would also be able to stabilize our food growth, improve our price structure, and create greater territorial integration. On the social side, it is urgent to attack critical poverty and improve the occupation of Peru's territory. [EL COMERCIO] Why has agriculture been the sector least favored by the state in recent times? [Hurtado] There are spectacular figures that destroy the economy. From 1980 to 1984 agricultural subsidies declined systematically. That trend was reversed in 1985; agricultural subsidies soared and came to $944 million in 1988. In 1989 these subsidies were $2.64 billion. And subsidizing a sector in such a total, massive, and generic manner as was done in agriculture by the former government does not help that sector. Those subsidies favor consumers and undermine the real growth of agriculture. [EL COMERCIO] Are you suggesting there should be no subsidies for agriculture? [Hurtado] The subsidy system has to exist, but it needs to be guided, focused, and financed with real resources -- it also must be temporary. There cannot be an indiscriminate expansion of subsidies via the Central Reserve Bank. This government (the Fujimori administration) deactivated the Agrarian Bank because it thought the Agrarian Bank was causing inflation. That is not true. What creates inflation is (inorganic) issues by the Central Bank. [EL COMERCIO] Do you think the time has come to promote agro-industry with the resources generated by privatization? [Hurtado] This is a great opportunity for Peru. People say we are going to get $6 billion through privatization. The agrarian sector represents 30 percent of the country's population. So it should get 30 percent of the resources from privatization: $2 billion. I propose that all the revenues from privatizing the CPT be allocated to the agrarian sector. We need to develop two types of agro-industry: high-tech for export purposes and intermediate-level technology. [EL COMERCIO] Then we would not need to rely on external sources to finance agricultural development? What the now flourishing Public Treasury can provide for us is more than sufficient? [Hurtado] These resources from privatization ($2 billion) can generate nearly $1 billion in credit, either from multinational organizations, from development banks, or bilateral loans from other countries. In the next three or four years we could get $3 billion. That would create a great boost for the agrarian sector, which provides 11 percent of our Gross Domestic Product. The Proposal [EL COMERCIO] Tell us about your proposal for using the resources from the CPT's privatization. [Hurtado] On a national level we need to make up the deficit in the National Food Reserve by allocating $50 million for production areas. We need to establish a production and market information system and a Promotion Fund to create agricultural and seed production services with private industry to ensure vertical growth in agriculture. [EL COMERCIO] What needs to be done to revitalize agricultural exports? [Hurtado] We propose to create a fund to promote exportable crops and export guarantees, starting by targeting specific zones for production and promoting social development. The BLADEX [Latin American Export Promotion Bank] and FLAR [Latin American Reserve Fund] can provide us with $100 million. We are also proposing agricultural credit insurance to cover natural disasters. [EL COMERCIO] But agriculture also needs technological support.... [Hurtado] Our proposal contains a technical assistance program, to complement credit, and two programs: one for the creation of high-tech agroindustry and the second for primary processing with intermediate-level technology. These proposals total $520 million, with the resources to come from privatization. And we are also considering another $350 million in additional funding that could be financed by international development banks or by bilateral credits. [EL COMERCIO] Your proposal, divided by regions (coast, mountains, and forests), comes to $1.6 billion. For the coast you propose establishing a loan guarantee fund. What would that involve? [Hurtado] Commercial banks do not make agricultural loans, and they are not going to. They say this is a problem of land ownership titles. Only 54 percent of our cultivated land area has ownership titles. The Loan Guarantee Fund could have $50 million in cash so that Peruvian banks will earmark $1 billion for agrarian credit. I will also mention midterm financing for advanced irrigation systems for 100,000 hectares at a cost of $200 million. We also need a saline land recovery program because 30 percent of the total of $600 million is for the coast. [EL COMERCIO] What about resources to stimulate agrarian production in the mountains, which have recently experienced population declines, and the forests, where coca plantations now occupy our arable land? [Hurtado] For the mountains we are proposing another $600 for three projects: the South American llama and related species breeding project, the rural development program, and communications infrastructure. For the forests we suggest two programs: a coca crop replacement program with a guaranteed price, so the state will start to buy from the forests to create incentives by promoting other crops like rice or corn. The other program is the improvement of our road system. Right now it is cheaper to import rice from South Vietnam or the Philippines than to get it from Huallaga. That would be the $2 billion agrarian development program. So in the future campesinos will not get used to living on subsidies or gifts, paternalism, or simply on state aid. Instead, the role of private activity will be preponderant, it will be the driving force. In summary, producers will become businessmen with the determined support of commercial banks and with the state providing resources.
