Mr. Papandreou conveyed the message in his opening address at the PASOK Central Committee meeting for the organization of the party congress, at which he also presented the party's new outlook. Referring to the Skopje issue, the prime minister said: [Begin Papandreou recording] Greece has made it clear in every way that it is obliged to defend its national interests and national security with all its strength. We hope that our partners in the EU will fully understand this. Until now, there are no such indications. There are issues that cannot be weighed by the scales of quid pro quos or negotiations. I believe that with our actions we now express the feelings of the entire people and the national sensitiveness of all Greek people, of all of Hellenism. The same also goes for the unified defense area on our eastern borders. We are seeing the dramatic return of extreme right-wing forces in Italy who are exploiting a long political crisis. Moreover, we are seeing the rise of Islamists in neighboring Turkey, particularly in Istanbul, which is a sign of further concern for our already disturbed region. In this atmosphere, the change that took place in our country on 10 October [1993--PASOK's election victory] is not merely an oasis in a dark landscape, it is a significant and I would say historic development in the region and, of course, a big moment for Greece.
