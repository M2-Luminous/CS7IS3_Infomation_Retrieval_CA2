This stage will have repercussions -- which hopefully will be positive -- on the overall situation in the region, although this will definitely depend on subsequent developments, whether in terms of the Israeli side's approach in implementing the agreement objectively and reasonably or in terms of local and internal Palestinian, Arab, and even Israeli positions. For example, on the Palestinian level the new agreement requires a maximal spirit of positive citizenship, a sense of responsibility, and a realization that the stage which the Palestinian people have entered is actually fundamentally different from previous stages in their history. Now the entire world is watching to see how the Palestinians will deal with the opportunity that has been given to them to prove that they not only deserve this opportunity but also that they can exploit it well. If the Palestinian people's sons prove their competence and their social, political, and civilized cohesion, this will convince the international community -- enemies more than friends -- that the Palestinian people are worthy of the legitimate rights which they are demanding. The Palestinians alone do not bear the future consequences of the agreement. The Israeli side, which possesses the powers of implementation and -- if it so desires -- the ability to place temporary or sometimes permanent obstacles, is more than a partner in determining the agreement's future. Negotiations are still being held over some pending issues in the agreement itself despite the fact that the two sides have signed the agreement. In reality, there are many Israeli practices that encumber the residents and do not conform with the agreement's spirit. Among these are the continued closure of Jerusalem to the occupied territories' residents, the Israeli authorities' delay in releasing thousands of Palestinian prisoners, the measures imposed on Hebron since the al- Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, and the preventing of the majority of Palestinian workers from reaching their work places inside the Green Line. Despite all the negative points, the agreement reached through intensive efforts by Egyptian President Husni Mubarak and his government, the sponsorship of the United States and Russia, and the participation of Norway and other European Community countries and international powers represents -- according to the consensus of the international community -- a good prospect for launching a new era of peace and coexistence. Also, according to the Palestinian concept, the agreement constitutes an initial step toward the achievement of the Palestinian people's legitimate demands. From this premise, it is the difficult beginning of a long march requiring cooperation and unity for reaching the aspired for inalienable goals.
