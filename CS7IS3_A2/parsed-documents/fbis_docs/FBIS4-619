Anne-Marie Coetzee reports: [Begin recording] [Coetzee] The strike was averted following a decision by the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] to grant policemen on active duty daily allowances of 61 rands 50 cents, the same as received by members of the National Peacekeeping Force. The question of disparity between the basic salaries of the two forces has not been solved as yet. The police union says if the TEC does not react positively to their salary demands within 2 weeks, they will consider action. [SAPU spokesman Pieter-Don Brandt] One of the disruptive actions that are coming from grassroots is to say that we are not going to guard election posts. We will keep on addressing crime problems in the community, but certain actions around the elections, around the election stations, we will disrupt. [Coetzee] In its reaction to the threat the police pointed out that SAPU, with its official membership of 7,000, constitutes less than 10 percent of the police force. Police say any member of the force taking part in a strike can be dismissed on the spot. [end recording]
