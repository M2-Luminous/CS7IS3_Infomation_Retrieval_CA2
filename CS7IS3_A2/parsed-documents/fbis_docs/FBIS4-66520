In the talks now under way in Tunis, General Amnon Shahaq and Director-General Uri Savir will probably raise other suggestions, the common denominator of which would be insistence on what has become hallowed principle in Israeli policy--not one settler will be evacuated from his home, even if that home is sheer stupidity (in Rabin's words), no matter what the price. This principle has important implications even now in Hebron. "The end of the week will mark one month since the slaughter and the victims continue to pay the price," according to Palestinian publications referring to the curfew, that, at the time of this writing, has still not been lifted from the city's inhabitants. In fact, the IDF is not strict about the curfew in neighborhoods removed from the center of Hebron, but even in them there are no classes, most of the services are stopped, and few residents go to work. Occasionally the IDF removed the curfew for a couple of hours to allow for food shopping, but even then the center of the old city remained shut down. Last week the military governor of Hebron told the heads of the Arab community that the main highway serving the center of town, which passes by Bet Hadassah, was closed to Arab traffic. Hashim al-Natshe, the head of the Hebron Chamber of Commerce, tried to appeal that decision to the governor, and, according to him, the governor told him: "this is a final decision and there will be no debate about it." The decision will be very hard on the lives of the city's Arabs since this street connects Hebron's western and northern neighborhoods with the southern neighborhoods, and thus now, in their view, makes it a divided city. One of the street's residents, Maher Shahada, said (in the paper AL-QUDS) that homes in the area have become intolerable and that the Arabs will be forced to leave. Other residents also believe that the curfew on the old part of the city, adjacent to the Jewish homes, will continue for a long time. Businesses there have long been dying because of continuous friction with the settlers, and those who can will do everything possible to move to more distant neighborhoods. The measures taken by the IDF commanders in Hebron are understandable. They, like everyone else, fear Arab reprisals, and they must provide the settlers a minimum of security and the ability to travel. The only way to do this is to impose limits on the Arabs and try to create a breach between the Arabs and the Jews in the center of town. In other words, because it is clear to everyone that there is no going back to the uncertain coexistence that previously existed in the center of Hebron between settlers and Arabs, the decision not to evacuate the Jews means that the Arabs have to be evacuated. While the East Jerusalem newspapers describe the increasing pressure on thousands of their Arab neighbors by the Hebron settlers to leave the area, they also stressed at the end of the week reports of two new Jewish families that just arrived to settle in the heart of the Arab city. Palestinian spokesmen like Faisal al-Husayni and Hanan Ashrawi said after the Security Council resolution that now the international resolutions, declarations, and various agreements do not much matter to them; what matters is what happens in the field. At the offices of the Palestinian delegation in East Jerusalem they pointed to the fact that despite the announcements of despair among the settlers, some of whom want to leave, just the opposite kind of work is going on in the territories, which testifies to a strengthening of the settlements. In Ma'ale Adumim, in Ari'el, and in other places, accelerated construction continues. In the most ultra-Orthodox settlement, west of Bethlehem, they are starting to build (according to an announcement by the Housing Ministry) 470 new housing units. In al-Jib (ancient Giv'on), which is north of Jerusalem, the Duqa family complained that tractors ran over 12 dunams of their olive plantings in order to expand the settlement of Giv'at Ze'ev. In areas east of the Jerusalem-Ramallah highway, construction of a new Jewish neighborhood is now being completed. A member of the delegation, Rasan al-Hatib, noted a while back that the concession made by the Palestinians for the Gush Qatif security arrangement actually triples the area of the Israeli settlements in the center of the Strip. Hebron is the most trenchant example, but from the point of view of most of the Palestinian community, it signals that the settlements remaining in the territories will prevent any hope of reaching an agreement.
