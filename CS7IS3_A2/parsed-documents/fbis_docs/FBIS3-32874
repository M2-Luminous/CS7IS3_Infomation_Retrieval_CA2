[Cardoso] I have always said that creation of the URV will be possible only if the fiscal adjustment is guaranteed. If the adjustment is not approved, the URV will be delayed. [Marquez] Following the implementation of the URV, when will a new currency be created? [Cardoso] It is impossible to set deadlines. If we set a date, we run the risk of a repeat of what occurred last December when entrepreneurs adjusted prices either in self defense or to attack the economic plan. Support for the URV must be voluntary, precisely to avoid that type of problem. [Marquez] Do you not consider it very unfair on workers to convert salaries into URV's by an average value, while prices -- especially utility rates -- will be converted by the value in force on the date of conversion? [Cardoso] Nothing has been decided yet. We have said that there will be a negotiation process. Stories about conversion by the average or by the top value presupposes there will be a freeze and that no more fluctuations will follow. As we are not planning to implement a freeze, how can I know if conversion will be by the average or by the top value? Converting prices by the top value and salaries by the average value is unacceptable. The rules have not yet been established. We will never adopt two different measuring units, one for prices and another one for salaries. Either Economic Policy Secretary Winston Fristch was misinterpreted or he inferred more than what he actually wanted to say. [Marquez] Utility rates are quite high, while salaries, which are based on the current salary policy, are rather low. [Cardoso] A plan to fight inflation does not seek either the redistribution or the contraction of income. Our entire effort concentrates on preventing a socially unfair mechanism. The important factor is to compare the URV's starting point with what is happening now, which is a steady deterioration of salaries. This has happened independently of the law, because no law can protect salaries from inflation. We are studying ways to update salaries, which will provide stronger protection. I am not saying salaried people's living conditions will improve right from the start. I am saying that from the very beginning, losses will be smaller. [Marquez] So it will not be like the Cruzado Plan, under which salaries received a productivity adjustment at the moment of the conversion, right? [Cardoso] One of the problems of the Cruzado Plan was a mistake at the start, when there was excessive demand without sufficient supply. This happened because of an increase, in real terms, of salaries, which ended up producing a loss. It is wrong to imagine that through a law or a provisional measure the government will set salaries according to the mid-URV and prices according to the top URV value. That would be absurd. [Marquez] Labor unions have announced that they will strike if salaries are adjusted by average values and prices are adjusted by top values. [Cardoso] I repeat: There is no definite rule yet. They should strike against businessmen who increase prices and not against the government. [Marquez] Labor Minister Barelli has been defending the idea that when salaries are converted into URV the previous year's productivity be taken into consideration. The productivity of Sao Paulo industries, for example, was 18 percent. Will that also be taken into account? [Cardoso] This must be discussed by the labor unions. We want the negotiation to be based on the collective bargaining contracts. We do not plan to introduce this element in the URV. [Marquez] So, there will be no rule for salary conversion? [Cardoso] As far as I am concerned there is no need for a salary conversion rule, especially this sort of rule. [Marquez] One of Fritsch's concerns is that salary conversion has to be very carefully done to avoid creating financial cushions [gorduras] in the costs of companies, which they then incorporate into their prices -- forcing them up. [Cardoso] Salaries are only one component of a product's price. We realize that salaries are not being increased, but prices are. This concern would apply if our economy were stable, open, and had a well-defined cost structure. But we have an inflationary economy which is very confused and allows companies to increase prices without linking them to salary hikes. There is no definition yet. I refused so firmly to discuss the URV before the fiscal reform is approved that I am sure no one has been able to adopt this or that formula. Fritsch referred to theoretical considerations about relations that should exist between salaries and prices. This, however, is not related to the government's decision, let alone to a provisional measure that can be drafted by the government. [Marquez] So, there is no provisional measure to establish the URV? [Cardoso] There may be one later, but so far there is nothing definite. [Marquez] Another one of Minister Barelli's proposals is that the government consider a long period, two years, to figure out the price average to be used for the conversion. Is this feasible? [Cardoso] It is a possibility, but nothing has been decided yet. There is no reason to discuss that before having defined the fiscal reform. I do not confirm any of these conversion studies. [Marquez] State-owned companies have updated prices, but Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] has been passing financial costs onto its products -- such as raw material for packing -- thus forcing the private sector to increase its prices. [Cardoso] I deem that very bad. I have already asked for confirmation that Petrobras is really increasing its prices by passing on its financial costs. So far, Petrobras has not given me any information. One of the advantages of the URV is that it makes speculative increases in cost and prices unnecessary. All that has to be done is to add cost and the interest rate. [Marquez] How will rents be converted? [Cardoso] This is very complicated. In rents conversion we will be discussing not only URV's but also demand, which is very low. We are being asked to reduce the renewal term on contracts under the excuse that otherwise rents could drop. Others say this is unnecessary, because it does not alter the level of rents. At the moment of figuring the URV, we will need a rule, but as I have already said, the URV is not compulsory. So far, nothing has been defined. A request has been made that the law on rents be reviewed. We will not do it because we are going to create the URV and the review may become unnecessary. [Marquez] What is the government's greatest concern over the implementation of the URV? [Cardoso] We did not want to enforce the URV during a period of high inflation. Right now there is a tendency to halt this growing trend. There were estimates that the inflation rate would surpass 40 percent, but the FIPE [Economic Research Institute Foundation] has already stated that this figure stands at 39 percent. According to information supplied by Labor Minister Walter Barelli, the cost of the family basket in Sao Paulo increased by 35 percent. Public rates are not being readjusted on the basis of current inflation, neither are fuels or electricity rates. This concerns us most because it is important not to have growing inflation in February. [Marquez] Do you believe the talks that Adviser Jose Milton Dallari is holding with businessmen will help to curb inflation? [Cardoso] He is not there to control prices. His job is important because he identifies problems regarding prices, even regarding public rates so that we may make decisions. It is also important for businessmen to know we are watching. The entire price monitoring system was destroyed during Collor administration. We must restore it. [Marquez] Why did Congress not approve provisional measures that increased taxes on financial corporations and banks? Was it against the economic program or against you? [Cardoso] It was because it happened on a Friday. [Marquez] But Senator Pedro Simon, the government leader in the Senate, said that the economic program was rejected because of your presidential candidacy... [Cardoso] I have never said I am a candidate and I believe it would be very selfish to try to prevent an eventual candidacy by voting against a national program proposed by someone who has said he is not seeking to be a candidate. [Marquez] But you went to the Northeast to distribute family baskets... [Cardoso] I did not go to distribute family baskets. I went with Planning Minister Stepanenko and Regional Development Minister Canhim in response to an invitation by the governor of Pernambuco. We went with four PFL [Liberal Front Party] governors and one PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] governor to show that the federal government is implementing the largest food distribution program in the country. I did not go there to distribute any family baskets. Representatives from several political parties were there. This is the third time I have visited the area and now they come up with this. It is mere speculation, it is completely groundless. I do not even believe what some people say that the provisional measures were not approved out of fear for my candidacy. Had the deputies attended the session, we would have won two to one. But they were not there because they never attend sessions on Fridays. It was a lack of articulation. They were not there but they should have been; I consider it unforgivable that they were not there, particularly those from my party. The PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] -- which is most opposed to these provisional measures -- was almost compelled to oppose it because of its business ties, particularly with important businessmen. The PPR has to show it is strongly defending their interests. [Marquez] Did you really tell National Health Council leaders that you were annoyed with Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf because of the instructions he gave the PPR? [Cardoso] Paulo Maluf phoned me that same day and told me that he would intercede so that the voting would not be blocked. I believed him. He said he achieved an understanding to readjust bus rates by only 33 percent. Before it was 40 percent. If they sought to upset a presidential candidacy, why lower it from 40 percent to 33 percent? There is a more serious issue behind all this. [Marquez] So what is the problem? [Cardoso] It is not just political. On one side is the PPR which does not vote in favor of increasing taxes, on the other side is Congress, which only votes on Wednesday. How can we conduct a constitutional reform this way? But it is even more serious. There was a huge scandal just because the government had two provisional measures rejected. From the financial viewpoint, $400 million is not a lot of money. The most serious aspect is that I cannot see in anyone the required zeal to fight inflation, as if inflation were not a very serious problem. I do not see the required zeal in dealing with other matters either. Perhaps this lack of coordination and unity is a result of the Congressional Investigating Committee, CPI. But we have had several victories. For the first time, Congress agreed to modify the ITR [Rural Property Tax]. I now hope the Social Emergency Fund will be approved. [Marquez] Will the agreement reached on 28 January with the Chamber of Deputies and Senate presidents, and with congressional leaders lead to the approval of the constitutional amendment to create that fund? [Cardoso] An agreement had already been reached but it was broken. Deputy Adilson Peres said he would vote against it, that he would not obstruct it. He changed his mind. In politics people change their minds but when an agreement is reached it is better not to change. The conclusion of today's meeting was not really an agreement but a demonstration of support. The president is very worried because it is difficult to run the government if Congress does not allow it. The danger is a crisis of governability. I have been warning about this for a long time. No candidacy or my position in the ministry are at stake. It would be easier for me not to be a minister. I am not a minister for political or personal reasons but because the president asked me in the midst of problems. [Marquez] What should be done? [Cardoso] It is necessary to take some measures on time otherwise we will have problems. What worries me is that things may happen any time. Congress must realize that we are in the final phase of the negotiations of the foreign debt which took years to implement. The issue of voting in Congress can compromise the possibility of resolving the problem of the foreign debt and of freeing the government from the need to ask for money from the bank all the time which increases interest rates and inflation. But what is so disappointing is that no alternatives are presented. [Marquez] Do you feel betrayed? [Cardoso] No. There is indifference, a part of the political sector does not seem to be in touch with the country. When there is a link, there is debate. I am a senator and I know how Congress works. It is not always 100 percent. Sometimes there is weakness. Unfortunately this has lasted too long -- since the CPI activities. I don't know if the CPI was a problem or a revelation. I believe next week congressmen will show up to vote. They may talk badly about me now that I am talking badly about Congress. But what do I care? Will the people think the same? I believe not. When people have conviction they should speak out. One should not be worried about applause and popularity, but always remember what is necessary.
