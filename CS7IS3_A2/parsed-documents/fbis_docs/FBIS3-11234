TSE Magistrate Eduardo Colindres told ACAN-EFE at the voting sites [colegios electorales] "the police are tasked with looking after the people's safety, and I can assure you the Army is not there." Shortly after the general elections started today in El Salvador, Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate for the leftist coalition, which comprises former guerrillas and the Social Democracy, claimed soldiers were present in seven countryside towns, although this is banned by the Electoral Law. Francisco Flores, deputy candidate for the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance (right-wing ARENA), also told ACAN-EFE there is no military presence in the countryside but added certain policemen are clad in olive-green uniforms, and this makes them resemble soldiers. Flores said "this does not imply an Army presence." At least 2.5 million Salvadorans will elect today, in the first elections since the civil war ended, a new president and vice president, 84 deputies to the Legislative Assembly, 262 municipal mayors, and 20 representatives to the Central American Parliament (Parlacen). The TSE, government, political parties, and UN observers have reported the elections have progressed normally so far, without any serious incidents.
