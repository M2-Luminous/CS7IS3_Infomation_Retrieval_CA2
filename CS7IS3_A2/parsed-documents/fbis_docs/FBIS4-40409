Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA. [Begin Beliy recording] We are not inclined to dramatize the DPRK's Announced withdrawal from the IAEA since we proceed from the basis that the DPRK remains a participant-member of the Non- Proliferation Treaty, and therefore has an agreement with the IAEA within the framework of that treaty. Therefore, inspections of nuclear sites in the DPRK should continue. We are in close contact with the other five permanent members of the UN Security Council and we are beginning to prepare a draft resolution. An agreement has been reached that, in the very near future, the Russian foreign minister and the U.S. secretary of state will meet. [end recording] Russia believes that tough UN sanctions against the DPRK is an extreme measure. However, if there is going to be talk of sanctions, then Russia will insist that they must be gradual and also take into account its own interests.
