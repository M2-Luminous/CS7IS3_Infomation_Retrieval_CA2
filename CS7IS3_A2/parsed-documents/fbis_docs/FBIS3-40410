Nothing less than a warning cry was sounded last week by officials of the Large Solid Rocket Booster Group, alias G2P. The little-known consortium of SEP (75 percent) and SNPE (25 percent) designs and produces solid rocket engines for tactical (Pluton and Hades) and strategic (SSBS and MSBS) nuclear ballistic missiles. The Group's appeal coincided with the new nominations of Pierre Betin, SEP deputy general manager, as administrator and general manager of G2P, and of Emile Blanc, SNPE CEO, as its Supervisory Board president (see AIR & COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL No. 1446). In its first public statement since its inception in 1972, G2P is desperately sounding the alarm to "save the national capability" in large ballistic-missile propulsion systems. That capability, stresses Emile Blanc, "represents an approximately Fr25 billion investment over the last 25 years"! Indeed, the leaders of the group and its parent companies worry about a far-from-hypothetical risk that France could lose its technical and industrial expertise in the manufacture of big, military solid rocket boosters. For the last 10 years, the country has mainly conducted a dwindling number of "exploratory developments" (somewhere between research and actual developments), and has failed to produce new missiles (or propulsion systems). The S45 was shelved, and the new Navy M45 strategic missile copies the propulsion system of the M4 that came out in 1980. Worse, the French Defense Ministry now appears ready to delay the introduction of the future M5 strategic Navy missile for two years. "The current situation is certainly not upbeat, since there have been no developments in propulsion since the M4," stresses Jean Sollier, SEP's CEO. "The S45 was a great source of hope, quickly dashed" since the program launched in 1987 was halted in mid-1991. True, the S45 was followed by several exploratory development contracts foreshadowing the M5. But, says Sollier, the contracts came along after 10 years of no activity and staff reductions. And according to SEP's CEO, there is now "a national problem" that "may cost the country the credibility of its dissuasive force by 2005 or 2010"! SNPE and SEP have already seen their total strategic ballistic powder booster staff fall to less than a thousand, or 40 percent of the number employed in the eighties. Most important, stresses Pierre Betin, the "hard core" of "technologists" (engineers, technicians, and workers) with real know-how in all aspects of big military rockets, from design through production, has been reduced to "the bare minimum." A detailed study of each position by G2P showed that this irreplacable capability had been whittled away to a mere 500-550 by late 1993. As far as Pierre Betin is concerned, "There would seem to be, if not peril, at least some danger"! For as Emile Blanc stresses, the last few years have seen the scrapping of the Hades and the S45, the completion of the S3 and M4 (with the only production extension being the M45), and the delayed and still-threatened startup of the M5. The G2P "can still survive", says P. Betin, "but not too long without government help"! For government help is indeed the issue in a strategic-missile solid booster industry which, unlike space propulsion and its commercial offshoots, depends--as do the missiles--on government's willingness to fully back dissuasive policy. And France's strategic missile propulsion industry has not fallen down on the job, quite the contrary. As expert Pierre Betin, who has spent 30 years in the field, points out "There have been no failures in ballistic rocket flight since 1977"! "But today we are weakened", he says, and "the lack of developments for the next 10 years poses a real danger of destroying our store of expertise." Moreover, space propulsion cannot replace strategic propulsion work among manufacturers. Although there can (and should be) certain synergies between the two, space and strategic propulsion are two different fields. Performance and technical demands (structural ratio, total life, environmental resistance, etc.) are greater for solid military boosters. This is illustrated by Nitralane, developed and perfected in France for the M5, and ultimately never used despite the fact that it reportedly boosts French missiles to the same level as the best American ones (Trident D2). Despite budget restrictions, the United States takes great care to preserve its expertise! In France, in contrast, the situation is already red alert. According to P. Betin, France's strategic propulsion industry and know-how would be jeopardized if the M5 program were temporarily halted as announced. And Emile Blanc fears that "We will start next year at this year's level, then reduce funding another 10 percent." According to Blanc, neither research nor production can take care of the situation alone. France urgently needs to apply its store of know-how by making and regularly firing missiles (the current timetable is one every two years). "If we get stuck in exploratory developments only, our expertise will evaporate and our personnel lose motivation," says Pierre Betin. The government must therefore pursue development of the M5's propulsion system. But Emile Blanc insists that "The M5 will not be enough, for there are no plans to follow it up with anything." This is because France no longer has a regular, continuing series of ballistic missile programs (under development or production), as before. Consequently, the industry also needs to continue exploratory development and refinement of big powder boosters "to preserve the field." Concretely, says the knowledgable Emile Blanc (a former General Weapons Delegate), France must spend a minimum of Fr1 billion a year to keep its strategic propulsion capability afloat. Half, or Fr500 million, must go to keep the "hard core" of about 500 specialists intact. That amounts to only two percent of the funding for the national dissuasive force, which gobbles up approximately Fr25 billion a year!
