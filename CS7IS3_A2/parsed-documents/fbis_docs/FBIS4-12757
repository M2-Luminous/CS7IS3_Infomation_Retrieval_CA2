We would like to make it clear that any actions prejudicial to the brotherly ties between the brother Tunisian and Palestinian peoples are the responsibility of the PLO's security services, in conjunction with brother Tunisians. Any practices that may discredit the PLO or abuse brother Tunisia's hospitality are handled in the same fashion.
