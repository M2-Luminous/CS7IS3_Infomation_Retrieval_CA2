Addressing the forum of leaders of the business world, now under way here, the Prince of Wales expressed satisfaction with the fact that Russia, particularly St. Petersburg, was already carrying out several concrete projects with the participation of British businessmen. He said that if St. Petersburg was regarded in Russia as a window into Europe, it was for him a window into Russia. He believes that the cityscape of any centre of population is important for the successful development of entrepreneurship and St. Petersburg was lucky in this respect. The monotype architecture of many other modern megapolises makes them spiritless, which has a negative effect on business, he stated. The prince dwelt on the responsibility of entrepreneurship, on the need to ensure proper balance between wealth and the social sphere. In his opinion, a market economy cannot decide by itself the task of building up a sound society, but can combat such phenomena as hunger and poverty. It is most important, at the same time, to safeguard the environment. Addressing the forum, St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak said that the West realises that Russia has lived through the most difficult stage of the reforms. If no new mistakes are made in the course of the ongoing reforms, the country's economy will begin to perk up by the end of 1994. Sobchak criticised the Western mass media which frequently speculates on such subjects as growing crime in Russia and its alleged neoimperialist designs. This desire to slur Russia is explained by their realisation that the reviving Russian economy will become an increasingly active competitor on the international market. The mayor believes that such negative tendencies are not be seen in relations with Great Britain and that cooperation between that country and Russia has "brilliant prospects." On Tuesday, the British guests called at the St. Petersburg Mariinskiy Hospital. Its building was designed by architect Giacomo Quarenghi early last century. It, so to speak, illustrates the extraordinary history of Russia's first multi-profile clinic. The hospital was intended for the poor and was patronaged by the imperial family until the revolution of 1917. It was backed by generous charity donations. As the entire Russian public health service, this hospital, catering to more than 30,000 patients a year, is today badly in need of investments. "The positive emotions, evoked by Prince Charles' visit, had, without doubt, a curing effect on our patients," chief physician of the Mariinskiy Hospital Alla Popova said. Prince Charles talked with a group of St. Petersburg businessmen in the library of the hospital. They discussed possible investment projects in the humanitarian sphere. "It is yet difficult to say anything certain about the initiatives of our potential British patrons, but our foundation is ready to cooperate with them in the sphere of charity," ITAR-TASS was told by Lyudmila Nurusova, president of the Mariinskiy Foundation. Prince Charles' St. Petersburg agenda includes a visit to one more medical establishment -- the hospice clinic for incurables. The distinguished guest plans to visit it on May 19, the last day of his stay in Russia.
