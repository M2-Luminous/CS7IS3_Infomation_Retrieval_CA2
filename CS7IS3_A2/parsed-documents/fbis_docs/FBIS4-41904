The republic government was forced into taking this step by the critical situation in this sector, which was rapidly privatized two years ago. The newfound freedom turned out to be a heavy burden for the 15 joint-stock companies formed on the basis of the Transbaykal region's timber procurement establishments. Their output proved uncompetitive not only in the world market but also in the Russian market, as its prime cost is greater than those of its nearest rivals in Siberia. Nevertheless, the Government of Buryatia's decision does not signal a return to the administrative economic management of the sector. The "Lesopromyshlennaya Kompaniya `Zabaykalles'" state enterprise will only be a coordinating body. Its main task is to coordinate interests of the republic and the joint-stock companies and to create a scientifically and economically based model of investment in the Transbaykal region's timber industry.
