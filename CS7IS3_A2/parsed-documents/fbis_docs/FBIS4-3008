He stressed: In carrying out the anticorruption struggle, we should have a firm grasp of economic construction, the center of all our work, to enable the struggle to better serve economic construction and reform and opening up to the outside world. In terms of work planning, we should carry out anticorruption work simultaneously with reform and development tasks. We should closely follow the major measures taken in reform and development and inspect law enforcement. In determining and handling cases of economic discipline violations, we should make a specific analysis of specific cases. He urged: We should solve deep-seated problems of corruption by deepening structural reform, pay close attention to the departments and links where corruption emerges most easily, and by deepening reform establish and improve an internal management system, a supervisory mechanism, and laws and regulations. He stressed: Party committees and governments at all levels should have the overall situation in mind and effectively strengthen leadership over the anticorruption struggle. 1. Party and government organizations should work together to carry out the anticorruption struggle under the leadership of the party committee, with principal leaders taking charge personally. 2. We should strengthen inspection and supervision and give specific guidance in specific matters. 3. We should vigorously support the work of discipline inspection, supervision, and judicial organs. 4.
