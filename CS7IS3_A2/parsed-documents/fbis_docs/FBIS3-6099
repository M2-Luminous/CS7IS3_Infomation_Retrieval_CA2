The purpose is to alleviate U.S. discontent with Japan's huge current-accounts surplus. The Japanese Government plans to include this in the market opening measures to be compiled by the end of this month, and inform the United States about this. In connection with the tax cut, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced in early February that a total of 18 trillion yen reduction in income and residential taxes over a period of three years would be implemented, to be followed by an increase in consumption tax rate from 3 to 7 percent, which he termed the "national welfare tax scheme." However, this plan was rescinded due to the opposition of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and other groups. As a result, only a 6 trillion yen tax cut for fiscal 1994 has been agreed upon, and the issue of tax cuts beyond 1994 is being left to deliberations by the ruling parties' consultative body on tax reform, aiming at "passing the relevant laws before the end of 1994." However, the United States is strongly critical of a "single-year tax cut." Visiting Secretary of State Warren Christopher criticized Japan's stance at a news conference on 10 March, saying "this will be ineffective." While the government intends to include in the economic measures to be announced by the end of March four major steps to liberalize the market -- such as import promotion -- and other steps to bring about improvement in the automobile and auto parts sector, and two other priority areas in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, there is a persistent opinion in the Prime Minister's Office and the Foreign Ministry that "the United States will not be appeased unless there are concrete measures offered in macroeconomic policy." Top on the list of macroeconomic policies being considered is a plan to further augment the basic program for public investments totaling 430 trillion yen. However, since it is believed that "what the United States wants is tax cuts; and they will also contribute to the expansion of domestic demand," (according to a senior Finance Ministry official) an earlier conclusion in the ruling parties'debate on tax cuts has now become a major focal issue. Nevertheless, if an announcement that tax cuts are to continue beyond fiscal 1994 is to be made, it will not be possible to evade the issue of revenue source -- that is, the consumption tax hike. There is still the problem of how to persuade the SDPJ and other opposing forces inside the ruling coalition parties.
