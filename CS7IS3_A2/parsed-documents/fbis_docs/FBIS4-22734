With regard to these questions the federal agencies of state authority of the Russian Federation publish the Principles of Legislation, in conformity with which the agencies of authority of the republics that make up the Russian Federation carry out their own legal regulation, including the enacting of laws and other legal acts. On 21 February 1992 Russian Federation Law "Mineral Resources" was signed. In Article 1 of this law it is indicated that the law is in effect on the entire territory of the Russian Federation. The legislative and normative acts of the republics that make up the Russian Federation must not contradict this law. An analysis was made of seven laws on the mineral resources of the republics that make up the Russian Federation, one code, and two decrees: Komi SSR Law "Mineral Resources," 12 February 1992; Udmurt Republic Law on Mineral Resources, 13 February 1992; North Ossetian Republic Law, "Use of Mineral Resources in North Ossetian SSR," 27 October 1992; Republic of Buryatia Law, "Mineral Resources and the Principles of Use of Mineral Resources," 28 October 1992; Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Law, "Mineral Resources," 22 December 1992; Republic of Tatarstan Law, "Mineral Resources," 18 February 1993; Republic of Bashkortostan Code on Mineral Resources, 28 October 1992; Mordvinian SSR Supreme Council decree, 9 April 1993, "Procedure for Application of RSFSR Law, Entitled `Mineral Resources,' on the Territory of Mordvinian SSR"; and decree of the Government of the Republic of Tuva, 28 January 1993, No. 41, "Measures to Regulate the Relations in Use of the Mineral Resources of the Republic of Tuva." Only two laws were enacted several days prior to the signing of the "Mineral Resources" Law; the others were enacted later. Therefore they must not contradict the "Mineral Resources" Law. At the same time, study has indicated that the republics that make up the Russian Federation are not taking into consideration the fact that the territory of the Russian Federation includes within itself territories of subjects of the Federation and those republics view themselves as independent sovereign states that are not subordinate to the Federation's central authority. Certain republics that make up the Russian Federation, in laws on mineral resources, do not always mention the Russian Federation's "Mineral Resources" Law as the basis for promulgating their own act on mineral resources. For example, in the Republic of Buryatia Law, "Mineral Resources and the Principles of Use of Mineral Resources" (Article 1), it is stipulated that the Republic of Buryatia legislation on mineral resources is based on the corresponding principles enunciated in the Republic of Buryatia Constitution and the Federative Treaty, in accordance with which the mineral resources of Buryatia are the property of the peoples living on its territory. In the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Law (Article 1) it is stipulated that the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) legislation on mineral resources is based on the corresponding principles enunciated in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Constitution and the Russian Federation (Russian) Constitution. Similar formulations exist in the Republic of Bashkortostan Code on Mineral Resources and the laws of certain other republics. The Republic of Tuva Government has limited in time the application of the RF Law "Mineral Resources." In a decree dated 28 January 1993, entitled "Measures to Regulate the Relations in the Use of the Mineral Resources of the Republic of Tuva," it is indicated that, pending the enactment of the Republic of Tuva Law, "Mineral Resources," state regulation of the relations in the use of mineral resources on the territory of the Republic of Tuva is carried out on the basis of RF Law "Mineral Resources"; the statute governing the granting of licenses for the use of mineral resources, which was approved by RF Supreme Soviet decree, dated 15 July 1992, No. 3314-1; and the Statute governing the rules and conditions for collecting payments for the right to use the mineral resources, which was approved by RF Government decree dated 289 October 1992, No. 828. The Udmurt Republic, in its Law "Mineral Resources" (Article 4), has stated that the Russian Federation's legislation on mineral resources is in effect on the territory of the Udmurt Republic so far as it does not contradict the Udmurt Republic Law on mineral resources. According to Article 7 of that law, questions that have not been included in the competency of the Udmurt Republic and the local soviets of people's deputies are under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation with regard to the regulation of mining relations. Despite the fact that Russian Federation Law "Mineral Resources" failed to mention the question of the ownership of the mineral resources, and also failed to divide the state's mineral resources fund into any component parts, the republics that make up the Russian Federation have expressed their own point of view with regard to these questions. In Komi SSR (Article 2) the mineral resources on the territory of Komi SSR are considered to be the republic property of Komi SSR; and in Udmurt Republic (Article) the mineral resources are the state property of the Udmurt Republic, and the use of the republic's mineral resources can be carried out for the benefit of the peoples living on its territory. In North Ossetian SSR (Article 2), Republic of Buryatia (Article 2), Republic of Bashkortostan (Article 2), Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) (Article 2), and Republic of Karelia (Article 2), stipulation is made for republic mineral resources funds. In accordance with Russian Federation Supreme Soviet decree, dated 27 December 1991, entitled "Delimitation of State Property in the Russian Federation Into Federal Property, State Property of the Republics That Make Up the Russian Federation, Krays, Oblasts, Autonomous Oblast Autonomous Okrugs, the Cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg, and Municipal Property," the resources of the continental shelf pertain exclusively to federal property. Despite this fact, the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), in Law "Mineral Resources," stated that the republic fund is made up of the parts of the mineral resources that are being used and that are not being used, as well as the continental shelf of the territory of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The disposition of the republic mineral resources fund in the interests of the peoples in the Republic is carried out by the Government of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). In Russian Federation Law "Mineral Resources" (Article 2) it is stipulated that the disposition of the state mineral resources fund is carried out in the interests of the peoples living on the corresponding territories, and all the peoples of the Russian Federation. Meanwhile the Udmurt Republic (Article 2) and North Ossetian SSR (Article 2), the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) (Article 2), and the Republic of Karelia (Article 2) stipulated the disposition of the republic mineral resources fund only for the benefit of the peoples residing on the territory. In a number of acts the competency of the Russian Federation in the sphere of regulating the relations in the use of mineral resources is not mentioned at all, or is defined in abbreviated form. According to the Law of the North Ossetian SSR (Article 2), sectors can be allocated from the republic mineral resources fund for the purpose of guaranteeing state security and the protection of the environment. The borders of those sectors and the procedure for using the mineral resources on them are established by the enacting of joint decisions by the agencies of authority of the Russian Federation and the North Ossetian SSR. This proviso does not guarantee the subject of the jurisdiction of the federal agencies of state authority of the Russian Federation, which already include the federal energy systems, nuclear power engineering, splitting materials, federal transportation, railroads, and activities in space. All of these areas require mineral resources. According to the Republic of Bashkortostan Code on Mineral Resources (Article 1), individual powers with regard to promulgating acts of legislation concerning the mineral resources of the Republic of Bashkortostan can be transferred to the Russian Federation in accordance with the Treaty on the principles of international relations between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Bashkortostan. Legislative acts of the Russian Federation concerning mineral resources with regard to questions transferred by the Republic of Bashkortostan to the Russian Federation are mandatory on the territory of the Republic of Bashkortostan, and in Article 3 of this Code it is stated that the Republic of Bashkortostan can transfer individual powers with regard to regulating the use of mineral resources both to the Russian Federation, and to the republic's rayons and cities. Thus, the interrelations between the agencies for administering the Republic of Bashkortostan state mineral resources fund and the agency for administering the Russian Federation state mineral resources fund in questions of the functioning of the Russia-wide methodological and normative base for the use of mineral resources and the single base for geological information about mineral resources, as well as in other questions of use of mineral resources, are defined by bilateral agreements between them. According to Komi SSR Law "Mineral Resources" (Article 5, paragraph 2), the interests of the Russian Federation in the area of the efficient placement and use of the mineral fuel-and-energy base are reinforced by treaty and other agreements with the Russian Federation. The Republic of Karelia, in its Law "Mineral Resources," states in detail the competency of the Russian Federation in the sphere of regulating the use of mineral resources. In our opinion, it would be desirable to prepare, instead of the Russian Federation Law "Mineral Resources," Principles of the Russian Federation Legislation on Mineral Resources, to define the owner of the mineral resources, to give a more clear-cut formulation of the concept of the mineral resources fund, and, to the extent possible, to reduce the competency of the Russian Federation in the sphere of the relations for regulating the use of mineral resources. Then there will be the possibility of enacting laws on the mineral resources of the republics that make up the Russian Federation in a new wording. The Komi SSR Law "Mineral Resources" provides a definition of the concept of mineral resources. It is the surface of the land and the space under it, excluding the agricultural stratum, with rocks, minerals, and containers. This definition omits the bottom of bodies of water, which is not the surface of the earth, and also the lower limit of the mineral resources to depths that are accessible for geological study and assimilation. The Udmurt Republic also provides a definition of the concept of mineral resources. According to Article 1 of Law "Mineral Resources," the mineral resources of Udmurt Republic include that part of the natural environment within the confines of the republic's territory that lies below the soil stratum and the bottom of bodies of water to depths that are accessible for assimilation. This definition omits depths that are accessible for study. The Republic of Udmurtia provides a definition of the fund, calling it not a mineral resources fund, but the Udmurt Republic state mining fund. According to Article 1 of its law, the mineral formations contained in the mineral resources, as well as other objects there that represent interest for study and industrial assimilation, constitute the state mining fund of the Udmurt Republic. It is not completely clear what is meant by objects representing interest for study and industrial assimilation. One wonders whether these objects include a subway or an underground airfield. According to Republic of Tatarstan Law "Mineral Resources" (Article 1), the mineral resources of the Republic of Tatarstan constitute that part of its natural environment that is situated under the soil and vegetation stratum, and under the bottom of lakes, rivers, and reservoirs, with the minerals contained in them, from their outcroppings to the daylight surface to depths that are accessible for geological study and assimilation. In our opinion, the definition of the concept of mineral resources is most precise in the Republic of Tatarstan law. The same Tatarstan law contains Article 3, concerning mining relations. According to that article: 1) relations arising during the possession, disposition, and use of the mineral resources constitute mining relations; 2) the owner of the mineral resources, and the user of the mineral resources, are the subjects of mining relations; 3) the agencies of state authority and state administration of the Republic of Tatarstan, as well as the local administration, cannot be the user of the mineral resources; 4) the sector of the mineral resources (mining claim) that was granted to the user in the procedure established by this law is the object of the mining relations; 5) the license and the mining-claim document which are issued in conformity with this law are acts that result in the arising of mining relations; 6) the license is a document that certifies the right to use the mineral resources within the confines of granted sector within a period of time established by the license, with the observance of the terms stipulated by it; 7) the mining-claim document is a document that grants the user of the mineral resources the right to carry out his activities within the confines of the mining claim in conformity with the purposes indicated in the license; 8) state administration of the use of mineral resources is carried out by the Government of Tatarstan or through agencies empowered for that purpose. The overwhelming content of the article is nonnormative. It consists of definitions of concepts (of mining relations; of subjects and objects of mining relations;of acts that result in mining relations; of the license; and of the mining-claim document). In several laws this is usually stated at the beginning of the law, under the title "Terms Used in the Law." As for the substantive content of the article, in our view the concept of mining relations does not encompass the protection of the mineral resources. This is an independent element of mining relations, and it must be pointed out. Something that is not completely precise is the absolute ban preventing agencies of the state authority and state administration of the Republic of Tatarstan, as well as the local administration, from using the mineral resources. It would scarcely be desirable to deprive them even of the right to carry out the mining of generally widespread minerals, which right is granted to owners of sectors of land in accordance with Article 5 of the law. An article that is of definite interest is Article 4 of Republic of Tatarstan Law "Mineral Resources," which is devoted to objects of the right of ownership. According to this article, the property of the Republic of Tatarstan includes: 1) the mineral resources and the deposits of minerals that are located in them; 2) deposits situated on the territory of Tatarstan and contiguous territories in that part in which they are located in the Republic of Tatarstan; 3) deposits of minerals and sectors of mineral resources that were acquired by the republic within the confines of other territorial-administrative and national-state formations of the CIS and abroad; 4) information concerning the geological structure and mineral and raw-materials potential of the mineral resources that is received at the expense of funds from the state budget; 5) tailings of removed, surrounding, and side-recovery rocks, and storage facilities for other waste products, which form technologically exploitable resources of mineral raw materials that accumulate during the extraction, dressing, and processing of natural minerals. From the text of the article on objects of the right of ownership it is evident that the republic is attempting to define as precisely as possible the limits of everything valuable that is its property. Unfortunately, it has not revealed in the law the methods by which the republic acquires deposits of minerals within the confines of other territorial-administrative and national-state formations of the CIS and abroad. In the preamble to the Republic of Buryatia Law "Mineral Resources and the Principles of Use of Mineral Resources," there is a statute concerning the use of mineral resources in the drainage area of Lake Baykal, which is regulated by conditions governing special use of the natural environment, which are aimed at the unconditional preservation of Lake Baykal as national property of the Russian Federation. The section of the law that is devoted to the efficient use and protection of the mineral resources contains Article 32, "Special Rules For Use of the Mineral Resources in the Drainage Area of Lake Baykal." According to this article, the use of the mineral resources in the water-protection zone of Lake Baykal is allowed only with the application and observance of technological schemes that preclude any runoffs or emissions that are capable of harming Lake Baykal or its ecosystem. The use of the mineral resources in the shore zone of Lake Baykal, with the exception of the study of the mineral resources without the carrying out of mining operations, the extraction of generally widespread minerals, and the construction of underground and water-intake structures with a depth of up to 10 meters for their own needs by the owners and leasers of sectors of land, is prohibited. In Article 19 of the Bashkortostan Code on Mineral Resources it is emphasized that users of the mineral resources to whom they are granted for purposes that are not linked with the abstraction of minerals, in the event that minerals are detected or appear on the sector that has been allocated to those users, must immediately report that fact to the agency that issued the license.
