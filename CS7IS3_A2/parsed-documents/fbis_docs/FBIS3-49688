The two met at the invitation of Dr. Zhelev more than two years after their last meeting. During that time the president maintained his contacts with the other parliamentary groups. After he was elected president as a SDS nominee, the stands of Dr. Zhelev and the SDS tended to diverge. "We made a deep and comprehensive analysis of the domestic and external political situation. As far as foreign policy is concerned, there are no differences between the president and myself, as for home policy issues, we agreed on one thing: The reform should go on," Stefan Savov told journalists after the meeting. The two also dwelled on the scandal which the press recently fanned up in relation to an issued but unpublished presidential decree which, according to the two major political forces, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and the SDS, provided for creating structures parallel to those of the army. "According to President Zhelev, the establishment of a military office is a matter of collecting and processing information and it (the office) will have no operational functions," Mr. Savov said. He declined to make further comments and went on to say that he had received the decree from the president and the SDS parliamentary group will come out with an official stand after carefully considering it. Meetings of the SDS and BSP leaderships held yesterday decided to ask Dr. Zhelev expound the matter. Mr. Savov said that President Zhelev has brought forward the question of restoring the old parliamentary majority of the SDS and the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS), but the two failed to reach a common understanding, as the SDS remained firm on their stand that they would never collaborate with those who had betrayed them. The SDS-DPS majority fell apart in late 1992, following a dissent on the formation of a joint cabinet. Then the incumbent non-partisan cabinet was formed on the mandate of the DPS after Prof. Berov was elected by a majority of the DPS and BSP votes. The opinions of Dr. Zhelev and Mr. Savov diverged on yet another issue -- whether parliament should be dissolved in case of formation of a caretaker cabinet and early general elections, Mr. Savov also said. This will leave a period of some two or three months without a sitting parliament. While the president was supportive of the idea, the SDS believe that Bulgaria is a parliamentary republic and should never be left without parliament. This stand enjoys the support of the BSP as well. There was full agreement between the president and myself as to foreign policy, Mr. Savov said. The two discussed possibilities for NATO-Bulgarian cooperation and the events in Russia. We failed to agree on most issues, but I think that the meeting was useful and I am satisfied as a whole, Mr. Savov concluded.
