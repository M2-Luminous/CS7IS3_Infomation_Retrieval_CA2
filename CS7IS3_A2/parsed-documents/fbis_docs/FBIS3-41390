Sarkozy, who is also budget minister, said a total of 40 tonnes of drugs were seized in 1993, including 38 tonnes of cannabis resin, 1.28 tonnes of cocaine and more than 230 kilograms (464.6 lbs) of heroin. He added that the French customs had helped the customs services of several foreign countries to seize more than 33 tonnes of drugs "through intensive exchange of information and coordinated operations." The minister said it was difficult to tell if the customs service was working more efficiently or whether there had been a rise in drug smuggling. "In any case, this demonstrates an extremely preoccupying situation," Sarkozy said.
