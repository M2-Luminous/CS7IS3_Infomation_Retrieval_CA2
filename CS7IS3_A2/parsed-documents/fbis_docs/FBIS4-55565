[Pittner] The names of communities in the language of the minority are set down in a list that constitutes a separate supplement to the government-sponsored bill. This list includes the official name of the community--that is, its name in the Slovak language--and its designation in the language of the ethnic minority. Under the law, it will only be possible to use names that are on this list. This applies to the Hungarian as well as the Ukrainian and Ruthenian minorities. Those names have been studied by experts from the fields of history, geography, linguistics, and other disciplines, whom we assembled at the Ministry of the Interior. The names had first been discussed with all of the partners in the coalition. [Vymazalova] Does the government recommend in its own bill the incorporation of some ideas from the deputies' bill on bilingual signs, which it turned down? [Pittner] Not at all, because the deputies' bill only repeats the previous government's proposal of November 1993, under which the name of the community was to be translated into the language of the minority or transcribed according to its rules of orthography. The translated or transcribed names are not identical to the names used--for example, by Hungarian fellow citizens when referring to their community in their own language. The names of communities as they evolved in the entire historical period until the early 19th century and as they are recorded in Jan Lipsky's work Repertorium of 1808 were used as a point of departure. The names on the list are names that have taken shape in the course of historical development and that are used by the local population. [Vymazalova] You said at a news conference that the law would apply to about 560 names of towns and villages and that the signs ought to be financed by the state. A sum of approximately 6.6 million korunas is to be set aside for this purpose. Who will make and install those signs? [Pittner] This is the responsibility of the district road administrations. This obligation arises from the law on the designation of communities, and there is a decree that stipulates where exactly at the community's entry and exit the signs must be installed. The name of the community in the language of the ethnic minority will be placed on the appropriate traffic sign. [Vymazalova] What impact will this law have on citizens' everyday lives? Can the second name be used in the address, for example? [Pittner] No. Only the name in the Slovak language is the official name. The second name is only for the designation of the community in the mother tongue of the ethnic minority.
