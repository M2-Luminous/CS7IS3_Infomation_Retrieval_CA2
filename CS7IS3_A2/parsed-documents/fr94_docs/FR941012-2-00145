FR941012-2-00145 FR941012-2-00098 Champagne Imports Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (Registered Importer No. R&hyph;90&hyph;009) has petitioned NHTSA to determine whether 1990 Mercedes-Benz 560SEL (Model ID 126.039) passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States. The vehicle which Champagne believes is substantially similar is the 1990 Mercedes-Benz 560SEL that Daimler Benze A.G. manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States, and certified as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. The petitioner states that it carefully compared the non-U.S.-certified 560SEL to its U.S.-certified counterpart, and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. Champagne submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S.-certified 560SEL, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as its U.S.-certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards. Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1990 model 560SEL is identical to the U.S.-certified 1990 model 560SEL with respect to compliance with Standard Nos. 102 Transmission Shift Lever Sequence *␣*␣*. , 103 Defrosting and Defogging Systems , 104 Windshield Wiping and Washing Systems , 105 Hydraulic Brake Systems , 106 Brake Hoses, 107 Reflecting Surfaces , 109 New Pneumatic Tires , 113 Hood Latch Systems , 116 Brake Fluid , 124 Accelerator Control Systems , 201 Occupant Protection in Interior Impact , 202 Head Restraints , 203 Impact Protection for the Driver From the Steering Control System , 204 Steering Control Rearward Displacement , 205 Glazing Materials , 207 Seating Systems , 209 Seat Belt Assemblies , 210 Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages , 211 Wheel Nuts, Wheel Discs and Hubcaps , 212 Windshield Retention , 216 Roof Crush Resistance , 219 Windshield Zone Intrusion , and 302 Flammability of Interior Materials . Additionally, the petitioner states that the non-U.S.-certified 1990 model 560SEL complies with the Bumper Standard found in 49 CFR part 581.
