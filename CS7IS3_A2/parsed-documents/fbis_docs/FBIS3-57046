All efforts by national extremists to drive a wedge between Russia and Tatarstan are in vain, the minister added. In the minister's opinion, everything should be done in a civilised way. A government decision between Russia and Tatarstan is being drafted now. It will define ways of delegating powers. All this is being made to reform the Russian Interior Ministry. The first move has been made: The role of city and district militia departments was increased. Their powers were enlarged. These departments were granted additional rights and, consequently, their duties were increased. Functions which city and district departments are unable to fulfill, are delegated to regional departments or the Interior Ministry. The entire ministry will be remade on such principles. Yerin noted that he gave a news conference on last year's results for the first time. Although the crime situation remains difficult, there are some positive changes. Crime rate rose by 1.4 per cent over the past year, while in 1992 it was 24 per cent. The rate of crime exposure is at the level of 50.6 per cent and for serious crimes -- 55.6 per cent. The situation in Tatarstan is much better, the minister stressed. The general rate of crime exposure here is 60 per cent. The minister attributed this to special crime control measures taken by the republic for the second year running. These measures should be thoroughly studied, the minister noted. In Yerin's opinion, Tatarstan outstripped Russian law enforcement bodies in taking initiatives in the sphere of crime control, which should be acclaimed.
