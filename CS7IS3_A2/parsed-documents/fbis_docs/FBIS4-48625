President Taylor said such statements have the tendency of bringing about renewed problems in the peace process. The former NPRA [National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly] government president said the United Nations has nothing to do with politics, and should stay out of Liberian politics. President Taylor said it is clear, although not explicitly stated in the Cotonou Accord, that the leaders of the three parties to the Liberian conflict will appoint ministers and other officials of government. He said it was predicated upon an agreement among the leaders of the parties that led to the allocation of cabinet posts. President Taylor emphasized that it was out of the intent of the leaders that all positions in government are filled, saying discussions among the leaders are an addendum to Cotonou. He stressed that whatever discussions are held among the leaders, with the intent of arriving at certain decisions, must be considered an addendum to the Cotonou Accord, and any attempt to do otherwise will not be accepted. President Taylor said the leaders of the various parties, in an attempt to avoid any delays in the transitional process, allowed the government to be seated in order to facilitate the speedy implementation of the disarmament process and the holding of free and fair general and presidential elections. President Taylor, in referring to the LNTG [Liberia National Transitional Government], gave an analogy, saying the LNTG is the birth of the union of three parties, which brought forth what he called a whole human being, with a head and other parts of the body.
