Introduction On November 5, 1993, the Commission authorized publication in the Federal Register of a proposal to make major amendments to the Commission's Rules of Practice. Published on November 22, 1993 (58 FR 61732), this proposal stems from the work of the Commission's Task Force on Administrative Proceedings, chaired by Commissioner Mary Schapiro. In addition to updating the Commission's existing rules and make them more consistent with actual practices, the proposed revisions would establish procedures to implement the authority granted to the Commission by the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act. The Commission requested that comments the received by January 6, 1994. Since the publication of the Rules, the Commission has received from interested persons a number of requests for an extension of the comment period. On December 27, 1993, an Ad Hoc Committee of the American Bar Association that is preparing comments in response to the Commission's proposal sent a letter requesting that the comment period be extended from January 6, 1994 to February 1, 1994. The stated reason for this request is the ABA requires more time because of the breadth of the Commission's proposal and its accompanying commentary. Three other parties have contacted the Commission's Office of the General Counsel to request an extension of the comment period. II. Discussion In light of the length and complexity of the release and the benefits to the Commission of receiving carefully considered comments, the Commission believes a reasonable extension of the comment period is appropriate. Therefore, in order to assist interested participants in their consideration and preparation of carefully reasoned comments, the Commission is extending the comment period for all persons to February 4, 1994. III. Conclusion The comment period for responding to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34&hyph;33163 is extended to February 4, 1994. Dated: January 5, 1994. By the Commission. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;621 Filed 1&hyph;10&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 8010&hyph;01&hyph;M
