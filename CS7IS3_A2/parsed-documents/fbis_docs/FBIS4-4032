The inauguration of the Hata administration came after Social Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama rejected Hata's last-minute call for SDP to return to the nine-month-old coalition. The largest political force in the alliance led by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, SDP on Tuesday announced its withdrawal from the ruling bloc to protest the formation of a 130-strong parliamentary group called Kaishin (Renovation) that excludes the Social Democrats. The Hata coalition now has only 182 seats in the decisive 511- member House of Representatives, far short of a majority of 256. Earlier today, Emperor Akihito appointed Hata, leader of the coalition's key party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), as Japan's 51st premier in a morning ceremony at the Imperial Palace. The appointment had been delayed by the political unrest sparked by Kaishin's establishment on Monday and the subsequent SDP defection from the coalition.
