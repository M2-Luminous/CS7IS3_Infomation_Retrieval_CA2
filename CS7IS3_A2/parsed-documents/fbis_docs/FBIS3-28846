In an 80-page report, it expressed its view on each topic under discussion by nearly 700 delegates at the National Convention. [passage omitted] Government officials are now scrutinizing the NLD report before it can be presented by National Convention Chairman U Aung Toe. The NLD, which won a landslide victory with 80 percent of the votes in the 1990 general election, did not even get 20 percent of the delegate representation at the National Convention. Larry Jagan reports from Rangoon that some NLD members are putting pressure on their leaders to boycott the National Convention. Dear Listeners: The NLD led by U Aung Shwe is now concerned about being deregistered. That is why it is certain that the NLD will not boycott the National Convention. In December, before the resumption of the National Convention, the authorities warned the leader of the NLD and one or two other opposition leaders that their parties will be deregistered if they boycott the National Convention. [passage omitted] Another NLD source believes that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, before being put under house arrest, told U Aung Shwe to work within the framework of the multiparty regulations. Now the delegates who support U Aung Shwe's position suggested that the NLD carry on with the present situation to allow the party to participate in the future election which will be held for sure once the new constitution is completed. At the same time, it is also true that there are many in the opposition movement who believe that the NLD will lose its credibility if it continues to do what is being directed by the rulers. They also believe that, as a result, the NLD will face the danger of losing the public support it amassed in the 1990 general election. [passage omitted] According to the inner circle of the National Convention, many new suggestions are presented in the NLD report. Although the NLD has accepted the presidential system, it is still firm on its demands: The parliament must be sovereign and the president must be a representative elected by the people. The NLD source said the NLD has rejected the paragraph which says the president must be a national leader and proposed that the presidential candidate must be a highly educated person. According to the inner circle of the National Convention, the NLD also said that only representatives elected by the people must be in the electoral college, which is responsible for electing the president, and these representatives must by equally elected from the two chambers of the parliament. It is totally contradictory to what U Aung Toe, chairman of the National Convention Convening Work Committee, said during the resumption of the convention at the beginning of last month. In his speech, he said two-thirds of the electoral college, which is responsible for electing the president, is to be elected by the pyithuhluttaw representatives [parliamentarians], while the remaining one-third is to be elected by the commander-in-chief of the Defense Services. It is also mentioned that each chamber must elect one presidential candidate each while the third presidential candidate will be elected by the commander in chief of the Defense Services. Once the president is elected the remaining candidates will become vice presidents. If the president steps down, one of the vice presidents will be elected president. But the NLD said there should be only one president and one vice president, and it is still firm on its demand that both must be elected by the people. [passage omitted] Rangoon residents believe that the military rulers are trying their best to complete the procedures of the National Convention as soon as possible. [Words indistinct] also believe that the Burmese Government has a great desire to make sure that the NLD participates in the National Convention until the completion of the constitution so that the NLD cannot blame the government for being excluded at the convention. A source close to the NLD says the NLD is actually trying to prolong National Convention procedures using delaying tactics. [passage omitted]
