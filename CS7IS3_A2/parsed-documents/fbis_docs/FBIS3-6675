NODONG SINMUN today devotes one whole page to the article. In the article Yi In-mo gives an emotion-charged description of the fact that the Korean people are blessed with a sagacious leader, on the basis of his life experience, saying he felt this most deeply among a lot of things he has felt and understood in the last one year since he found himself in the embrace of the socialist homeland after 43 years. The article writes that it is a great fortune of the Korean people to be guided by such a peerless hero as our leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who is possessed of both outstanding military qualities and brilliant literary accomplishments and with exceptional loyalty and filial piety to the great leader President Kim Il-song. "Our people are, indeed, blessed with a sagacious leader as others enviously say," it notes. In the first part of the article "We Have the Greatest General of Generals" Yi In-mo tells about the greatness of the dear leader who overcomes ordeals and adversity. Noting that the situation was so grave when he returned home that he looked attentively at the developments and the weather chart of world politics, but the homeland guided by Comrade Kim Chong-il, an unrivalled, most brilliant general in the world, was unwavering, the article says: When the United States threatened us with "Team Spirit" joint military exercises in South Korea, it was the sagacious general who struck the provokers with terror with his strategy and grit befitting the famous general, with his dignified orders that they would not be allowed to touch even a single tree, a single blade of grass of our homeland. When they attempted to encroach on the supreme national interests of our Republic by raising a clamor for a "special nuclear inspection" in the international arena, it was also our general who defended the destiny of the homeland with his decisiveness and will as a brilliant commander through another statement that such brigandish logic or strongarm action cannot work on us and that no threat and blockade can frighten us. It was our general who quelled the reckless frenzy with his iron will, determined to answer dialogue with dialogue, and a war with a war, when the United States goaded the foolish warmaniacs of the South on to confrontation and war, breaking its promise to our Republic. It was our General Kim Chong-il, the most famous general in the world, who brought a dramatic turnabout in the situation through the decisive declaration that not only big countries but we also have options, when they were again trying to opt the way of military pressure. As the great leader President Kim Il-song said in praise of him, our Comrade Kim Chong-il is, indeed, a brilliant commander possessed of both literary and military accomplishments. Our dear leader is, in the real sense of the word, a great hero who wins with his ideology, his strategy and his grit. Our dear leader is the most illustrious general of generals who moves the globe, placing it on his palm, and always emerges victorious. In the second part of the article "We Have the Man of Noblest Human Qualities" Yi In-mo says he has felt the virtues and personality of the dear leader, a great man, from his sense of obligations. Our dear leader is a benefactor who found out like spotting a gem in the sand me who was living with the support of farm family on the shore of the South sea after spending not a long period at a lonely home for the aged in the South, and took pains and gave instructions on hundreds of occasions for years to bring me back to the homeland, says Yi In-mo. Referring to all solicitudes and deep loving care shown by the dear leader for him since his return to the homeland, Yi recalls that when Koreans residing in an alien land presented to him a rare quilt which they had prepared with utmost care wishing him good health, the tender-hearted dear leader thought of him first and sent it to him, warmly saying Yi In-mo must have slept with no quilt in prison in the South, so, not he, but Yi should have it. To love human beings and hold the people dearest as the almighty beings is our dear leader's philosophy of love for the people, the article says, and stresses: It is said from olden times that humbleness and modesty are good virtues. Our dear leader is, indeed, a "great commoner". That is why the people follow him. The might of love and good virtues is great. It is natural that all the people come like clouds to be embraced by the dear leader who is possessed of such great love and noble virtues. Indeed, dear Comrade Kim Chong-il is the man of noblest human qualities. And ours are a people who are blessed with a sagacious leader and guided by the man of noblest qualities. In the third part of the article "I Make Up My Mind" Yi In-mo tells about his duty as a soldier to uphold the dear leader, saying the people who are blessed with a sagacious leader must uphold the leader with loyalty. He notes that although he is now in the waning days of his life he is determined mentally to uphold the leader with loyalty and physically to become an impregnable castle wall in defence of the leader, and hardened his resolve to safeguard socialism at the cost of his life. He says: I think our minds must always be clean in upholding the leader and defending socialism. So I am going to live, saying to myself like this every day and every moment: -- When I wake up every morning, I'll think of the great leader and the dear leader first. -- Whatever work I may do, I'll always do it with the great leader and the dear leader in my mind. -- When I go to sleep, I'll first wish the great leader and the dear leader well. -- Whenever I dream, I'll dream of the great leader and he dear leader. -- We who are blessed with a sagacious leader must know to uphold the leader with loyalty and filial piety.
