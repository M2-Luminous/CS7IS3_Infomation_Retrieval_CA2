There is a Fujian Hitachi Television Set Company Ltd. in Fuzhou, a Sino-Japanese joint venture established in late 1980. In the early days of the company, it organized, at the Chinese side's insistence, a trade union according to China's relevant regulations and international practice. The trade union has earnestly exercised its four social functions as required by the central government and carried out various activities, focusing on promoting democratic management of the enterprise, raising economic efficiency, enhancing workers' moral standards and professional competence, and promoting cultural progress, and has achieved marked results. They set up China's first congress of workers and staff of a joint venture in 1989, and then established democratic managerial bodies at the team, workshop, and factory levels. To institutionalize and standardize democratic management involving workers and staff, the trade union formulated regulations on the congress of workers and staff and the trade union members' representative assembly so workers and staff would really participate in democratic management of the enterprise. The congress of workers and staff has called 14 sessions since its founding to examine the enterprise's major management decisions including the enterprise's "annual management guidelines and objectives." The trade union also regarded signing and honoring labor contracts as its central task. After studying China's relevant laws and regulations and conducting many investigations, they worked out labor contracts acceptable to both the owner and the workers of the enterprise. In the process of enforcing the contract, the trade union played an active supervisory role so that the contract was observed. In a certain year, the workers were each entitled to a bonus equivalent to one or one-and-a-half months' wages since they had fulfilled the production quota, but the Japanese side only agreed to grant a bonus amounting to half-a-month's wages. The trade union argued strongly on just grounds on behalf of the workers, and finally the Japanese side agreed to pay the bonus in full as stipulated in the contract. Since labor-capital relations have been stable enabling workers to bring their wisdom into full play, the enterprise has grown with each passing day and has become an important production and export base for television sets in China. China Fuwan (Fujian) Toys Company Ltd., is another joint venture with distinctive features. This Chinese-Japanese company has done a large amount of work in enforcing China's laws and regulations on labor protection, exercising management with civility, and ensuring workers' health. In a visit to the company, this reporter found that the workshops were spacious and bright and air conditioners were installed in most. Electric fans were provided for some workshops where air conditioners were unsuitable for production. Every day workers had two 10-minute breaks during which they were allowed to buy cold drinks and enjoy a chat with friends at the small shop attached to the company. To stimulate the workers' cultural life in their spare time, the company authorized the trade union to establish a club, a reading room, and a singing-and-dancing hall. They took special care of women workers, giving them articles for sanitation every month, and requiring them to have a physical check-up every two years. In March this year, a women worker's house caught fire causing a great loss for her. The trade union workers immediately rushed to her place to express sympathy and solicitude and encouraged other fellow workers to make donations. Again, they made a claim to the insurance company for damages on her behalf so that she would overcome her difficulties. The Nanan Baoqun Shoe Company Ltd., wholly owned by a Taiwan businessman, enjoys a good reputation in Fujian. Wang Kuo-hui, the Taiwanese board-of-directors chairman, has enthusiastically supported the trade union in its work and has taken good care of workers' lives, arousing enthusiasm for production. Since the trade union was set up, he has given it full support in matters related to personnel allocations and workers' living expenses. In light of the situation that the work force is mainly composed of women, the trade union demanded the company provide special articles for labor protection to women workers, and Wang immediately acted as requested. In the hot season last year, Wang fixed ventilation equipment in the workshops at the trade union's suggestion and provided drinking water. On days off or festive occasions, the company provides special funds to the trade union for carrying out cultural activities or sports meets or to send outstanding workers to a scenic spot in Xiamen to spend their holidays. Wang also saw to it that the trade union played a safeguarding role in the enterprise. In September last year, when the company produced a new product involving more complicated procedures, the workers demanded higher wages. Based on investigations, the trade union considered the workers' demand reasonable. The company, which fully valued the trade union's advice, then agreed to grant additional wages.
