Only three of the ex-Soviet countries, the Baltic republics, are not attending. The other twelve countries sent twenty specialists on disarmament and customs officers to attend the seminar. Japan's Foreign Ministry, the main organiser of the five-day seminar, told ITAR-TASS that earlier such contacts had been carried out only on bilateral level, including with Russia. But as Tokyo grows ever more concerned over the growing scale of arms trading, including illegal, in Asia, Japan's Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Foreign Commerce and Industry have decided to considerably increase the range of participants in the seminar within the frame of the general technical assistance to new independent states. The seminar's chief task is to demonstrate to ex-Soviet republics, in most of which the custom services are just gaining their footing, the latest achievements for use in combatting illegal trade operations and discuss measures undertaken by the Japanese government to supervise armaments, disarmament and the proliferation of weapons and their components.
