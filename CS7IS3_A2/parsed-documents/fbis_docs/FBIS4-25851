Japanese customs authorities agreed Wednesday [15 June] to apply the new quarantine procedure starting at the end of this year, according to a Council of Agriculture (COA) official. Currently, all Taiwan fresh-cut flowers are quarantined by Japanese customs after arrival there. A majority of the flowers, however, are fumigated with methyl bromide after failing the stringent Japanese quarantine standards. Most flowers exported to Japan are chrysanthemums, but also include gladioluses and roses. The fumigation seriously downgrades the appearance and life span of the fresh flowers, thus reducing the profits of the Taiwan flower growers and exporters, said Chen Chiu-nan, a division chief of the COA's food and agriculture department. Once the Japanese officials start conducting quarantine checks in Taiwan, fewer fresh flowers will have to be fumigated and losses will be minimized, Chen asserted. According to customs tallies, Taiwan exports an average of 5,200 metric tons of fresh-cut flowers worth U.S.$11.27 million a year, of which 5,000 metric tons go to Japan.
