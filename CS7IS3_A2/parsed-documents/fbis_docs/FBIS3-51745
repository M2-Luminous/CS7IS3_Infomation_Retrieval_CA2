The current financial imbalances must be solved by acting on the offer-demand principle, states an editorial in the weekly paper which also points out the need for eliminating its causes. The Cuban economy is burdened by an excess of circulating currency of approximately 10 billion pesos (the same amount of dollars as per the official exchange rate) and annual subsidies in excess of 4 billion pesos to profitless enterprises, according to official data. Since a few weeks ago, and after the last convocation of the National Assembly of the People's Government (parliament), the CTC called on its affiliates to analyze the internal causes of the economic crisis in the country and propose measures to reverse it. The editorial points out that at the first such meetings there has been a tendency in some work centers to "think little about the problems, weaknesses, and errors that undermine their own daily work." In this regard it proposes that the administrations present to those assemblies an economic analysis of their management and proposals for improving them, drafted by the main administrative official of each unit and in understandable terms. After admitting that there are production plans which are "tainted by paternalism" which include "large components of the inefficiency (...) we mean to fight," the editorial expresses the need to reduce the costs of production and create, in places where it does not yet exist, an instrument for determining them.
