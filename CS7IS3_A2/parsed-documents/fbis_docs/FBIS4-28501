Speaking at the opening ceremony for the War Memorial Hall in Yongsan, Kim, noting the Russian documents on the Korean war he received from President Boris Yeltsin during his recent visit to Moscow reveal how North Korea started the war by invading the South, said the North is again seeking to commit war crimes by developing nuclear arms. To avoid this scenario, it must repent for what it did 40 years ago and apologize to the nation for its criminal acts. Deploring that some South Korean youths still believe and follow the old dogma of communism shunned by the entire world, he expressed hope that the war memorial hall would serve as a training ground for the people, especially the rising generation, to learn the pain and suffering of war. A people who never forget war will enjoy peace, he stressed, urging his countrymen to protect freedom and peace. Attending the ceremony were Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, Seoul Mayor Yi Won-chong, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Yi Yang-ho, U.S. Forces Korea Commander Gen. Gary Luck and many other dignitaries. Completed in three years and seven months, the six-story war memorial hall, including two basement floors, is situated on an area of 35,000 pyong (one pyong is about 3.3 square meters) on the old site of the Army headquarters in front of the Defense Ministry building. Displayed in six showrooms in the building are some 7,800 war items collected from many countries. In addition, over 110 Korean war items, including the South Korean Air Force's T-6 training plane, the North Korean Army's T-34 tank and a U.S. Air Force B-52 bomber, are on display. The hall is open from 9:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, starting Tuesday. Admission fees are 2,000 won for adults, 1,500 won for secondary school students and 1,000 for elementary school pupils.
