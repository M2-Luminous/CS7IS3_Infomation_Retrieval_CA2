However, he emphasized, these are not the only institutions for privatization. In his opinion, it is here that one can find the most reliable data both about the size of the property and the process of privatization. He finds it strange that no one is requesting data about the size and the fate of property in the hands of local governments, the treasury property manager, or the cooperatives. Incidentally, at its latest meeting, the board of directors of AVU decided to prepare for parliament the list of state firms privatized up to now, as requested by Zoltan Kiraly. Tibor Pongracz drew attention to spontaneous privatization that started at the time of the previous government, and noted that in order to see clearly one should give an account to parliament and the public about that process, as well. He noted that AVU was established by the Socialists, but they never drew up a property list. The state secretary regards privatization as a fundamental issue for the economy, and as he put it, "if politicians during the campaign turn it into a prostitute, it will be difficult to turn it into a nun in a few months." The state secretary does not agree with the latest proposal by the board of directors of the AVRT, namely that in the second segment of providing the banks with capital the state should supply them not with money, but with guarantees. As he said, this would lead to a process in which the banks would completely exploit the firms, drive them to ruin, and then hand in the bill to the government.
