This announcement was made today by the director of the state's Public Property Register, Francisco Gerardo Campos Martinez. Although not citing statistics, he claimed that the number of confiscations far exceeds those made of landed properties last year. This increase is a result of the intensified action on the part of the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic to combat the drug traffic since Carpizo McGregor became head of that department. He stressed: "What has occurred is just a reflection of a more persistent battle against the drug trade by the PGR." As for the confiscations, Campos Martinez claimed that most of the real estate and rural properties involved are located in the municipalities of Matamoros, Reynosa, Nuevo Laredo, and Miguel Aleman. It should be noted that the judges and the PGR will maintain the impoundments until a determination is made of whether or not the owners are guilty of the illicit acts charged. Finally, the official revealed that, in some instances, as many as two farms and several residences have been seized from a single presumed drug trafficker.
