According to the information, a plot targeted Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, along with certain military and civilian leaders. The plot was to be linked to the current differences between Yemeni leaders, whether this was revealed before or after its implementation, in a manner that would pave the way for wide- scale fighting--not just a possible clash between the north and the south--that would drown the whole of Yemen in waves of fighting. The source of the information at the U.S. Department of State refused to give more details on the plot, but hinted that regional quarters were aware of the plan and supported the assassination plot, which was due to be carried out during the first half of this month. The source declined to reveal whether the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, was informed of the details of the plot or if only the Arab capital in question was asked to withdraw its support for the assassination plot and its sponsorship of those masterminding it. The source also refused to draw a link between the current military buildup in Yemen and the exchange of accusations between the two main parties on one hand, and the assassination plot that was exposed on the other. It seems that the Yemeni leadership in Sanaa was not directly informed about the plot. [passage omitted]
