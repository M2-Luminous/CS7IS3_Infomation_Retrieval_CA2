FBIS4-51727 "dreas085_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 2 May 1994 North Korea Chondoist Chongu Party on ROK Nuclear Issue Chondoist Chongu Party on ROK Nuclear Issue SK0205215794 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1509 GMT 2 May 94 SK0205215794 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Central Committee of the Chondoist Chongu Party in a statement issued Monday sharply denounces the feverish acceleration of the development of nuclear weapons by the Kim Yong-sam group, branding it as an undisguised perfidy in reducing the joint declaration on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula to waste paper and a never- to-be-condoned criminal act aimed at destroying the nation. Recalling that the South Korean ruling quarters have pursued a policy of developing nuclear weapons from the early 1970s, the statement warns that if a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula owing to the reckless military provocations of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets, it will, no doubt, develop into a nuclear war, inflicting an irrevocable nuclear scourge upon the Korean peninsula and its surrounding countries. The statement demands that the Kim Yong-sam group promptly stop the development of nuclear weapons which would bring horrible disasters to the nation and dismantle the pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) and multi-purpose research reactor. Noting that the United States is the very one standing in the way of the solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula, the statement urges the United States to come out to the DPRK-USA negotiating table for a fundamental solution of the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. The International Atomic Energy Agency which has so far resorted to a double standard, abandoning the principle of impartiality in nuclear inspections, should apologize for the fact that it has joined the United States in its anti-DPRK campaign and closed its eyes to the development of nuclear weapons through the PHWR for military use and the multi-purpose research reactor by the South Korean puppets, the statement says.
