General Liamine Zeroual was selected by the Algerian High Security Council as the new president Sunday. The English daily said that Zeroual enjoys a good reputation compared to the five members of the current unelected collective presidency. "Nevertheless, his presidency cannot bring legitimacy to the Algerian regime." Noting that the Algerian problem is of a politico-military nature, the editorial said "Algeria's efforts to destroy its domestic opposition and to accuse other countries of interfering in its internal affairs have met with failure. "If Zeroual truly wants a national reconciliation...He should realize that his time to legitimize his own presidency and the Algerian Goverment is limited. The process of legitimization must take place soon or the current conflict would blow up into a full-fledged civil war, the daily added. "This legitimacy must be approved by the people of Algeria, not by Paris or Washington," wrote the editorial.
