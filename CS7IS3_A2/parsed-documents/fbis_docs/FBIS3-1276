So says ANC [African National Congress] Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa. Either the TEC should take administrative control of KwaZulu or it should adopt a military choice of deploying a combined security force in the region to defend polling stations. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Ami Nanackchand] Speaking at an election rally at Phoenix, north of Durban, Mr. Ramaphosa said the TEC was determined to go ahead with the elections even though there was resistance from some quarters to the first nonracial poll. He said the TEC had an obligation to protect the taxpayer from threats to his right to vote. [Ramaphosa] And this the Transitional Executive Council must do. If we don't do that, then it will have failed in its task of making sure that elections do take place on a free and fair basis in Natal, and we do have the SADF [South African Defense Force], and the South African Police, and we have the National Peacekeeping Force, and those forces will just have to come to the defense of the people, to come to the defense of democracy, to come to the defense of the election process. And if Buthelezi does not like it, then tough luck for him. He is in big trouble. [end recording]
