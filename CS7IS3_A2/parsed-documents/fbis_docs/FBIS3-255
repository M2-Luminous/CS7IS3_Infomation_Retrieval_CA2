"I have never experienced any yearning to betray my people in the Orange Free State or my party," Dr Gous, who represents the Parys constituency, said in a statement. Dr Gous said African National Congress [ANC] leader Nelson Mandela and ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa had repeatedly stated that plans were being made for South Africa to become a unitary state and that there would be no Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland]. "Measured against these utterances, it is clear that if a volkstaat does not come into being before the April 27 elections, the legal implication that it could possibly come into being after that date, is meaningless." Any reasonable person could see that the so-called constitutional concessions would not realise the ideal of the Afrikaner people, he said. "Therefore, it is impossible to convince us to participate in such an election." Dr Gous called for something concrete, not vague promises, to create the basis for positive negotiations. Dr Gous was one of eight CP MPs named by the SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] as having been absent during parliamentary voting on amendments to the interim constitution and the electoral act. The SABC claimed this could indicate a possible split in the party over participation in the elections.
