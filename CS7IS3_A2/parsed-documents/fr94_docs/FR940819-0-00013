FR940819-0-00013 FR940819-0-00005 33 CFR Part 117 [CGD08&hyph;94&hyph;024] RIN 2115&hyph;AE47 Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, TX AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: At the request of the Galveston County Navigation District No. 1, the Coast Guard is changing the regulation governing the operation of the bascule span Pelican Island Causeway Bridge across the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, mile 356.1 at Galveston, Texas. The draw will no longer be closed to navigation on Saturday from 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m., 12 noon to 1 p.m. and 4:15 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. but will open on demand. The draw will continue to be closed to navigation during those hours Monday thru Fridays, except Federal holidays. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation becomes effective on September 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. John Wachter, Bridge Administration Branch, (504) 589&hyph;2965. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Mr. John Wachter, Project Officer and Lieutenant Elisa Holland, Project Attorney. Background and Purpose Upon request by the bridge owner, the closure hours of this bridge are being changed to create a better balance between the needs of vehicular traffic and the needs of navigational traffic. Vehicular traffic across the bridge on Saturdays has decreased while navigational traffic has remained the same. The closure of the draw is no longer necessary on Saturdays. This change in the closure hours of the bridge is less restrictive on navigational traffic and will not significantly affect vehicular traffic. For these reasons, the Coast Guard for good cause finds, under 5 U.S.C. ยง553(b)(B) that notice and public procedure on the notice are unnecessary. Regulatory Evaluation This rule is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential cost and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040); February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .), the Coast Guard must consider whether this rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). This rule will have little impact on either vehicular or navigational traffic. Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1 (series), this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges.
