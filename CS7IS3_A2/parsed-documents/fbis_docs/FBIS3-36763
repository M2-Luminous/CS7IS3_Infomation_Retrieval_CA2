He said during the legal proceedings in Moscow on Tuesday that his guilt was that he had failed to prevent the collapse of the USSR as a Soviet citizen and a communist. According to Shenin, the real coup d'etat started not on August 19, 1991, but on April 24, 1991, with the signing of the draft treaty on establishment of a union (the Novoogarev agreement "9+1") and finished on December 8, 1991, with the agreement on establishment of the CIS. According to the accused, "this has broken the balance of forces and has been inevitably leading to the third world war, which is now at hand." The issue on renewal of the case against Oleg Baklanov deferred due to his illness was also raised during the proceedings. However, this issue's consideration was postponed.
