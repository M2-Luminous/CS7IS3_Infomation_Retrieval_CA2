But the "express visa" applied for by travel agencies on behalf of their clients will remains intact. The consulate had offered applicants two options according to the speed of processing visas. One was a "regular visa" which was processed in a week at a cost of 15,000 won, and the other is an "express visa" which was processed in just three days at a cost of 35,000 won. More and more people who had been plagued by the delay in visa issuance opted for the express visas, to make sure they got their visas before their scheduled departures. They were willing to pay more than double the original fixed fee. Other embassies in Seoul, including the Russian and Vietnamese Embassies also charge the so-called "express fees." It's a war. This is what Korean applicants say of the visa application procedure at the Chinese Consulate in downtown Seoul. Not war refugees but visa applicants are striving to obtain permission to enter China. A travel agent, identified only as Cho, has stayed up all night on the stair-case outside the consulate office. It is still dark outside and it is still three hours before the consulate opens. Her thick jacket doesn't match the month of June, early summer. But she needed the clothes to withstand the night chill. Her job is to apply for Chinese entry visas on behalf of her clients. Individual applicants as well as Cho and other travel agents have waited all night long to submit visa applications, sitting on a concrete floor. Since the government announced the liberalization of trips to China April 1, the number of Koreans who want to visit the country has sharply increased. And naturally the number of visa applicants at the Chinese Consulate has also gone up. The visa application and issuance section at the consulate, however, operates only from 9 to 11:30 A.M. The consulate office is always overcrowded. Even before the office opens, the long line for visa applications runs down to the front door of the building. The consulate is locate don the third floor. "I came here last night. Otherwise, I could not succeed in getting even the chance to apply," said Yi Yong-chin, another travel agent, adding that he had been forced to come earlier and earlier. A woman from Taegu in her 60s complained that the consulate staff never considers the inconvenience of the visa applicants. She voiced the hope that more visa application windows will be installed at the consulate. "It is the second time I've tried to obtain an entry visa after failing to get a visa last week. It would be exhausting to return home without even applying for a visa again," she said. Chinese Consul General Zhu Yigang, however, said at present the consulate has no plans to establish more application windows. There are a total of six windows inside. One is for issuing visas; three for receiving application forms, two of which are normally open; and the other two for taking visa fees. Moreover, on one of the two application windows is posted a notice reading "Chinese Living in Korea and diplomats First." "To deal with the flood of visa applications, I think the consulate should extend the current hours for application into the afternoon," said Son Nam-kyu, a businessman living in Kwangmyong City in Kyonggi Province. But the consul general said the consulate cannot extend the office hours for application any longer because the staff has to process more than 1,000 visas in the afternoon. Asked about the chances of filing the visa application form during the day, Kim Chin-myong, who was the 20th in the waiting line, was a little skeptical. "Yesterday, I failed to make it though I was sixth," said the frustrated man, pointing his finger to a pile of application forms of a travel agent in front of him. Unfortunately, there were more than 10 agents waiting their turn with scores of application forms in front of Kim. But he can also find more than 200 people waiting behind him. "I initially planned to ask for a regularly-processed visa', but I will apply for `a speedily-processed visa' at an additional fee of 20,000 won (about $25) because the issuance may be later than I expected," said Kim. As individual applicants can hardly succeed in visa application, they decide to leave the visa work to travel agencies. The agencies dispatch their employees to secure places at the front of the application line. Each client pays from 10,000 won to 20,000 for the service, sometimes more, plus the visa application fee. "Because I thought the total fee for the visa application asked by an agency was too expensive, I came here to do it for myself. But I had to stay at a hotel after I failed to apply for it yesterday, spending much more money than the agency had asked. I should have entrusted the work to the agency," said an applicant from Pusan. Some agencies are cashing in on the difficulty in applying for visas. It is an open secret that an applicant must pay from 150,000 won to 300,000 won to a travel agency to get a one-day-processed visa at the Chinese Consulate.
