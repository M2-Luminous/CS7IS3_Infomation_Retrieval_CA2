FR940119-1-00019 FR940119-1-00007 These standards, when read together, establish a three-tiered system governing motorized and mechanical equipment use in the non-wilderness portion of the HCNRA. The requirements by which use may be authorized become increasingly rigorous depending on whether the proposed use is contemplated on Forest Service roads/airfields, Forest Service trails, or off Forest Service airstrips, roads, or trails. This provision recognizes that off-road travel is generally not tolerated within the HCNRA due to the fragile and difficult terrain, impacts to wildlife and their habitat, and other issues associated with resource protection. Proposed paragraph (b) explains that there are no non-duplicative regulations needed for managing motorized and mechanical equipment in wilderness areas of the HCNRA since such use is already prohibited by the Wilderness Act. Accordingly, the proposed rule would merely restate the exiting prohibition and provide cross-references to exceptions permitted in the Wilderness Act. The proposed rule would exempt from its coverage all uses related to Forest Service administration which might include, at a minimum, research activities and public health and safety responses. It also would exclude uses necessary to access privately owned lands or interests in land wholly within the HCNRA. Section 292.45␣Use of Motorized and Non-Motorized Rivercraft Proposed §292.45 would establish seven standards to guide Forest Service administration of the use of motorized and non-motorized rivercraft in the HCNRA. These standards and guidelines are only applicable to those rivers or river segments that have been designated as components of the Federal Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Though not explicitly referenced, the relevant provisions of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 U.S.C. 1271 et seq., and regulations at 36 CFR part 297, would also apply. Paragraph (a) would authorize the use of non-motorized rivercraft on Wild and Scenic Rivers subject to such rules and regulations the Ranger deems necessary to protect and enhance the values which caused the river to be designated wild and scenic or to ensure the public's safe use and enjoyment of the river. Paragraph (b) would prohibit the use of motorized rivercraft on all Wild and Scenic Rivers except for the Snake River. This prohibition will not prevent the exercise of any type of currently authorized motorized rivercraft use in the HCNRA; rather, it will simply provide for management of this use which is currently limited to the Snake River. It does, however, effectively preclude expansion of motorized rivercraft use to other Wild and Scenic Rivers which will facilitate the protection and enhancement of the values which caused those rivers to be designated. Paragraph (c) would require that all authorized rivercraft use on Wild and Scenic Rivers in the HCNRA be in compliance with State and/or Federal boating safety and registration laws. Proposed paragraph (d) establishes a requirement that all users of motorized and non-motorized rivercraft on the Snake Wild and Scenic River must receive prior written authorization for such use from the Ranger. It also explains that such authorization may include terms and conditions on numbers, duration, seasons of use, noise, or other matters that will protect and enhance the river resource and ensure a high quality river experience for users of all types.
