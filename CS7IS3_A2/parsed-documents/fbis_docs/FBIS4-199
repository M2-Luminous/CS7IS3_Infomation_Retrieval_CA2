For two hours President Soglo discussed serious national problems, such as the social and political crisis, insecurity, and the effects of the CFA franc devaluation. Indeed, one of the causes of the political crisis is the devaluation, a development which is being capitalized on by some politicians for their own ends. This in fact is what the president stated in his introductory remarks. President Nicephore Soglo stated that his government was open to criticism, and was even prepared to mend its ways and change direction, if need be. However, he noted his opposition to abuse with the sole purpose of doing harm. Let us listen to the head of state: [Begin Soglo recording] The political scene here has been characterized by unprecedented tension since the setting up of new institutions in April 1991. These tensions stem from various sources. The most important of these sources is, obviously, the sudden devaluation of the CFA franc, a devaluation which we neither wished for nor really planned or prepared for. No head of state within the CFA franc zone wished for or was prepared for it. The difficulties arising from this situation -- i.e., the drastic fall in our population's purchasing power -- unfortunately were capitalized on by some of our countrymen, in an atmosphere typical of a pre-electioneering campaign period. From verbal violence, they progressed to violence in general, and even assaults. People simply forgot that impatience can be a bad adviser, and that a nation divided against itself is bound to perish. They forgot the principle of self-respect, and sold our collective dignity dirt cheap. They then sought to trigger an institutional war which, had it been prevailed, would not have benefited either our budding democracy or even those who sought to set it off. On the contrary, it would rather have resulted in -- sooner or later -- a questioning of the hard won freedom and social peace which was restored thanks to the national conference. [passage omitted] We cannot afford to forget so soon the disastrous effects of the disorder of dirty politics, which gave our country the unenviable tag of Africa's sick child in the early years of her independence, and which served as a pretext for military takeovers. We cannot forget the long tragedy from which we were narrowly rescued by the February 1990 national conference. We had to create a collective reawakening of the entire Beninese people and a new sense of patriotism, solidarity, tolerance, and collective dignity. We had to achieve, on some basic questions, the broadest consensus possible, a prerequisite for a fresh start. Since then we have been trying to establish a law-abiding state together. The 11 December 1990 Constitution clearly laid down the rules of the democratic game. It makes political succession possible. Each one must agree to play the game in a serene and loyal manner. No one has the right to resort to violence. Power will henceforth be determined only through the ballot box. Power is no longer attainable through the gun. The real battle has a new stake -- public opinion. Like any other kind of battle, it can be tough. But if we love our country, we must ensure that such political clashes -- which are necessary and unavoidable -- preserve our collective dignity and honor and that they do not, at any time, call to question the indispensable consensus on the nation's philosophy and major objectives. [end recording] On the problem of security, the head of state said he was disturbed about the kidnapping of the Boukoumbe subprefect, and stated that the government is doing everything possible to secure his release. The president noted in passing that the growing insecurity in our country is not the result of laxity or a lack of firmness on the part of the government, but rather of the refusal of some political groups and leaders to respect the code of ethics laid down by the national conference. Henceforth, all legal measures necessary for the security of the state and the protection of life and property will be implemented rigorously and firmly, the head of state stressed. He took this opportunity to seriously warn students responsible for acts of violence. While remaining open to dialogue, he said, the government will not allow the university to become a breeding ground for criminality, indiscipline, or intolerance. The head of state also touched on the devaluation of the CFA franc and on its consequences on citizens' living conditions. Let us listen to him: [Begin Soglo recording] Ladies and gentlemen, on 23 January, before the nation, I reviewed the government's determination to limit, as best as we can, the negative effects of the devaluation on the various socioprofessional categories. In this regard, I announced certain backup measures. Wage-earning workers, including the public sector's civil servants, have suffered greatly from the effects of the devaluation, as have all the other components of the national community. Yet, they are legitimately anxious to preserve their purchasing power. I make it a point to commend them once again for their significant contribution to the building up of New Benin and the reconstruction of its economy. Furthermore, the government is happy concerning the sense of responsibility exhibited by all those among them who understood that their particular demands can be met only within the framework of a general solution to the nation's problems. The government remains open to dialogue with all workers. However, I would like them all to understand that Benin is a tiny country with limited resources, and that it is impossible to consider only civil servants' demands and close our eyes to the existence of industrialists, traders, and farmers, who comprise 80 percent of the population. Ladies and gentlemen, in my 19 September 1991 radio and television address to the nation I stated that I will never lie to the Beninese nation, because I consider my people a population of mature and responsible adults. I firmly stick to this pledge. The government is responsible for the interests of the entire nation and each of its components. It neglects no one, and similarly it will not favor any categories to the detriment of others, or in contempt of our dignity. [end recording]
