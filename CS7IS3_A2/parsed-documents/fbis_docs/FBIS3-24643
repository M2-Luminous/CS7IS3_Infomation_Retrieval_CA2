FBIS3-24643 "cr00000006894001" 8 February 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-017--IRAN IRAN: COMPLAINTS TO NEWSPAPER REFLECT ECONOMIC, SOCIAL PROBLEMS, NO. 3 This is the third in a series of media notes based on the SALAM newspaper column "Hello, SALAM," which explores further the social problems perceived to be facing the Iranian public. Some of the issues and complaints discussed, purportedly called in by individual Iranian citizens and often drawing comments by the paper, are: unemployment, differences between the Majles and the Voice and Vision, the disparity between social classes, the rising dollar, late payment of salaries, the high cost of living, medications shortages, high taxes and lawyers' fees. The samples of the column published below are translated in full. On Unemployment Caller: I am a veteran who spent 15 months at the front. I have been unemployed since 1988. Wherever I go, the answer is negative. I even referred to the President's office. They told me: "If there is work and a job is not given to you, we will investigate, but if there is no work, it is the problem of society." Who is supposed to solve this problem? What are we supposed to do if unemployed youths find themselves dragged into illicit activities.? SALAM: This is the second time we have published this message. This caller should send his resume in to us because a benefactor plans to assist him. (SALAM, 23 Nov) On Poverty Caller: A few days ago, at a traffic light on a crowded Tehran street, two grown girls along with their mother were asking with great insistance for money from passing drivers. I spoke with one of the girls. She said she was twelve and that one hour earlier a passenger in a car had called her an obscene name. When she protested, the driver got out of his car, grabbed her hand and tried to force her into his car to take her to the police station. Finally, with a great deal of difficulty, the mother, the girl, and other people succeeded in freeing her. When I spoke to the mother, she told me that her husband had been bedridden for the last two years. First, herself, and later, one by one, her daughters have been forced into begging to fight the ever increasing cost of living. (SALAM, 23 Nov) On Prisoners' Access to Press Caller: Now that Mr. 'Abdi's (SALAM's arrested editor-in chief) trial is to convene, after his being in detention for 90 days, has he been kept informed of news? For example, does he receive SALAM and is he aware of everyday happenings? SALAM: It is highly unlikely that he has had access to radio or press, but it appears that he has access to books. (SALAM, 24 Nov) On Differences Between Majles and Voice and Vision Caller: I am very sorry about the differences that have come about between the Majles and the Voice and Vision because this will strike a blow to Islam and the well-being of the system. This will cause the enemies of Islam to take advantage of this situation and create division. SALAM: Not all disagreements are bad. Inquiries and investigations are among the rights of the Majles. If we were to adopt the logic of this caller, then we would have to say that the Majles should not perform inquiries and investigations because of the potential for causing divisions. Answering inquiries and doing investigations are also within the rights of the Voice and Vision, but not the way it proceeded. The platform it assumed was improper. Voice and Vision had to answer queries either to the Majles or the judiciary. (SALAM, 25 Nov) On Restraining Anti-American Demonstrations Caller: Interior Minister Besharati promised to list the reasons for preventing anti American demonstrations by students. He seems to have forgotten his promise; and you don't pursue it anymore either. SALAM: The Rasht deputy questioned him regarding this matter, which will be discussed and addressed soon in the Majles. Will it be answered satisfactorily? We'll have to wait and see. (SALAM, 27 Nov) On Disparity Between Social Classes Caller: I am a student in the north of the city. Our house is in the city's south. When I return from the university, see the poverty of the people and compare it to the wealth in the north where people travel in cars, millions of them, I lose heart. When I hear my classmate say that his uncle owns several factories, that he earns several million tomans a month and that he has capital amounting to several billion tomans, my heart bleeds. And, now even the dollar is worth 200 tomans. Isn't there anyone who can get to the root of this inflation and fix it. (SALAM, 27 Nov) On the Rising Dollar Caller: Regarding the rise of the dollar and the falling rial, I want to know what the banks are doing about fixed investments, which lose their rial value every day. Do the banks guarantee the value of these deposits or not? With the steady increase in the value of the dollar and the sharp fall of the rial, will depositors be given worthless paper at maturity or some money? (SALAM, 27 Nov) On Late Salaries Caller: I work for the metro system. Every month our salaries are late by 10-15 days. Please have the (authorities) look into this. We are renters and have children in school. They should at least let us know that they will be paying us every two months, so we can plan. (SALAM, 30 Nov.) On the High Cost of Living Caller: I recently bought two packages of meat from the Molla Sadra (Meatpackers) Organization. They weighed about 2.800 grams. Each package had about 700-800 grams of pure fat and the meat was not good quality either. I figured that this meat, which should have sold for 440 tomans, in reality cost 600 tomans. Are the officials in charge of the Neat Organization aware of the situation? I'm curious if this is the result of actions by the employees or of the government's policy. SALAM: This type of thing is not related to government policy. However, it might be that the Meat Organization will have to supervise the packaging process. (SALAM 27 Nov) Caller: I am calling from Khorramabad and work in the office of communication. On Wednesday one of our customers came to complain about his bill. We verified it and told him that the bill was correct and he should pay it. When he was leaving, he asked: "What am I supposed to do, now?" We told him to pay it. "He said that my problem is something else. I am a civil servant and earn 15,000 tomans. The telephone bill is 4,800, the water bill is 6,000 and the electric bill is 2,800 for a total of 13,600. Only 1,400 tomans are left. I have three children and rent to pay. Why don't you budget your charges so that I can know how to continue my life." would like you to publish this so that the public will become more sensitive to our problems. (SALAM, 2 Dec.) On Shortage of Medications Caller: One cannot find any aspirin in this country. How does the Health Minister justify this? SALAM: The aspirin shortage is real. Officials admit to its shortage and that of many other medications. These shortages are simply the effect. The real cause is the financial difficulties that have prevented pharmaceutical companies from producing medicines. The president declared in recent weeks that these companies will receive financial assistance. We have no information about how this promise will be kept, but many commonly needed medications are available. (SALAM, 28 Nov) On Taxes Caller: Aren't taxes collected by the government to provide comfort and service to the public? What is the reason for the excessive increase in taxes, such as the ones on water and electricity. The taxes are far greater than what we can pay. And, has the government provided any services in exchange for collecting these huge taxes to satisfy the nation? Furthermore, are these taxes collected only to solve the government's problems or should they also solve the nation's? (SALAM, 5 Dec.) On Exorbitant Lawyers' Fees Caller: I have a question from the Judicial Branch. Hasn't the Judicial Branch set the fees that lawyers charge their clients? If the Judicial Branch has set these fees, why are they so high? And, if it has not, why don't they control them. They are exorbitant. Lawyers should be fair. I hope that the Judicial Branch will set its own equitable rate so that everyone who needs a lawyer can hire one. (There were two complaints of this type.) (SALAM, 5 Dec.)
