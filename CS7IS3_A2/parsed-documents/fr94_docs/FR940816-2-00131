The telephone number is (202) 267&hyph;1477. Copies of the EA and FONSI may be obtained by contacting LCDR George Privon at (202) 267&hyph;0297 or faxing a request at (202) 267&hyph;4427. A copy of the EA (less enclosures) is also available on the Electronic Bulletin Board System (BBS) at the GPS Information Center (GPSIC) in Alexandria, VA, (703) 313&hyph;5910. For information on the BBS, call the GPSIC watchstander at (703) 313&hyph;5900. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LCDR George Privon, Radionavigation Division, (202) 267&hyph;0297. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Request for Comments Copies of the Programmatic Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) are available as described under ADDRESSES . The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to comment on these documents. The Coast Guard may revise these documents in view of the comments. If revisions are warranted, availability of the revised documents will be announced by a later notice in the Federal Register . Background As required by Congress, the Coast Guard is preparing to install the equipment necessary to implement a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) service in the St. Marys River/Lake Huron Corridor area of the United States. DGPS is a new radionavigation service that improves upon the 100 meter accuracy of the existing Global Positioning System (GPS) to provide an accuracy of better than 10 meters. For vessels, this degree of accuracy is critical for precise electronic navigation in harbors and harbor approaches and will reduce the number of vessel groundings, collisions, personal injuries, fatalities, and potential hazardous cargo spills resulting from such incidents. After extensive study, the Coast Guard has selected five sties along the St. Marys River/Lake Huron Corridor for the DGPS equipment. The sites are in the vicinity of Detroit, MI: Saginaw Bay, MI; Cheboygan, MI; Neebish Island, MI; and Whitefish Point, MI. The sites are used already for related purposes and were chosen, in part, because their proposed use is consistent with their past and present use, thus minimizing further impact on the environment. DGPS signal transmissions will be broadcast in the marine radiobeacon frequency band (283.5 to 325 KHz) using less than 50 watts (effective radiated power). Signal transmissions at these low frequency and power levels have not been found to be harmful to the surrounding environment. Proposed Installations at Each Site (a) Radiobeacon Antenna_The Coast Guard proposes to install a 90 foot guyed antenna with an accompanying ground plane except at Whitefish Point where the existing whip antenna will be used. A ground plane for these antenna's consists of approximately 120 copper radials (6 guage copper wire) installed 6 inches (or less) beneath the soil and projecting outward from the antenna base. The optimum radial length is between 200&hyph;300 feet, but this length may be shortened to fit within property boundaries. Wherever possible, a cable plow method will be used in the radial installation to minimize soil disturbance. Installation of the ground plane may require some clearing of trees and bushes on the site. (b) DGPS Antennas_Each site will require two 10 foot masts to support four small (4 inches by 18 inches diameter) receiving antennas. The masts will be installed on a concrete foundation measuring approximately 3 feet by 3 feet by 15 inches. These masts are needed to support the primary and backup reference receivers and integrity monitors. The location of the two masts will be in the vicinity of the electronic equipment building or hut, but at least 50 feet to 100 feet from existing structures. (c) Equipment shelter_A 10 foot by 16 foot equipment hut will be needed to house the DGPS equipment at each site except at Whitefish Point, where the existing equipment building will be used. (d) Utilities_The Coast Guard proposes to use available commercial power as the primary source for the electronic equipment. However, an existing diesel generator is available at the Whitefish Point site and may be utilized if backup power is needed. A telephone line will be required at each site for remote monitoring and operation. Description of Each Site The Detroit, MI site is located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers boat yard property, which is located adjacent to Fort Wayne. The site will require installation of a 90 foot guyed transmit antenna. In addition, a 10 foot by 16 foot equipment hut will be installed to house the DGPS electronic equipment. The Saginaw Bay, MI site is located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers field office property, which is located near Essexville, MI. The site will require installation of a 90 foot guyed transmit antenna and a 10 foot by 16 foot equipment hut to house the DGPS electronic equipment. The Cheboygan, MI site is located on U.S. Coast Guard property in the city of Cheboygan, MI near the intersection of Western Avenue and Lincoln Avenue. The site will require installation of a 90 foot guyed transmit antenna and a 10 foot by 16 foot equipment hut to house the DGPS electronic equipment. The Neebish Island, MI site is located on the north end of the island, at the Neebish Cell Dock, and within U.S. Army Corps of Engineers property. The site will require installation of a 60 foot guyed antenna and a 10 foot by 16 foot equipment hut to house the DGPS electronic equipment. The Whitefish Point Light Station, MI site is located on the upper peninsula approximately 35 miles northeast of Sault Ste Marie. The existing radiobeacon has already been partially upgraded and is transmitting prototype DGPS signals for test and evaluation purposes. The existing radiobeacon transmit antenna will be used and the DGPS equipment will be housed in the existing equipment hut. The light is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Coast Guard and MI State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) agree that the proposed project will have no effect on the historic property. Implementation of a DGPS service in the St. Marys River/Lake Huron Corridor Region is determined to have no significant effect on the quality of the human environment or require preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement.
