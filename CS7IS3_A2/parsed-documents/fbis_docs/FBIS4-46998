Agafonov, chief of Nevel Customs Post, by Yu. Kozlov; place and date not given: "Fifty-Five Customs Agents on a Transparent Border"] [Text] As far back as I can recall, Belarus has always existed more prosperously and better than Russia. At any rate better than Nevel Rayon in Pskov Oblast, which adjoins it. Formerly the Nevel side had poverty, hunger, and a shortage of gasoline, while on the Belarus side it was not really abundance, but definitely better. Traffic moved principally in one direction--from hungry Pskov Oblast into Vitebsk Oblast. But the link of time has disintegrated. Such a suddenly acquired indisputable factor of independence as the Belarus hare, which at first could be exchanged for 10 Russian rubles, was called upon to protect the higher standard of living and at the same time restrain Pskov Oblast residents from emptying Belarusian shelves. At present the situation along the new Russian borders is completely different. The hare lost considerable weight--seven for a ruble. Even though store shelves in Belarus are hopelessly empty, the flow of goods still continues to flow into Russia--from the doubtful hare to the still lively ruble. Russia to Belarus at the present time is something like Poland used to be to Russia, and Germany to Poland. On Sundays the Nevel market is highly reminiscent of a Polish or Hungarian market at the end of the 1980's. Remote Russian towns very quickly turned into border towns, which amazingly fast become saturated with the regular infrastructures: secret warehouses for contraband goods, intrepid people, guilds of conductors, guiding huge trailers via secret rural roads, drinking establishments, ramshackle hotels offering travelers saunas, Russian bath houses, and comely young ladies. Vladimir Agafonov, chief of the Nevel Customs Post talks about what the Russian-Belarus border looks like today. [Agafonov] The Nevel Customs Post has existed since 1 January 1993. It was created on the basis of the Velikolukskiy Customs Post and includes a crossing point for motor vehicles along with two railway crossing points Nevel 1 and Nevel 2. [Kozlov] How many people work at the customs post? [Agafonov] There are 55 persons at the three crossing points. Most of the inspectors work directly at the motor vehicle crossing point--they conduct inspections of motor vehicles entering and exiting Russia. [Kozlov] When will construction of the new customs complex be completed? [Agafonov] Right now the motor vehicle crossing point represents, so to speak, a temporary facility. It is planned to introduce the new complex on 30 June. All of the services required for customs control will be deployed over an area of three-and-a-half hectares. Four lanes will be in operation--two for passenger vehicles, and two for trucks. [Kozlov] Vladimir Nikolayevich, how was it possible to find 55 customs officers at once in a remote Russian town such as Nevel? [Agafonov] Actually, most of the inspectors live in Nevel. Mainly they are former officers and young people with a higher education. Many of them worked in production, but now the enterprises are being closed and the personnel are discharged. We send inspectors to St. Petersburg for special courses, after which they immediately go to work. Unemployment is growing in the country, therefore we are having no problems with personnel. I was recently the head of one of the enterprises. [Kozlov] In other words, no one has years of working experience? [Agafonov] Experience is acquired quite rapidly. It is possible to say that we are growing together with new Russian customs legislation. The main documents were adopted in May of last year. Our advantage over the old customs personnel is that we do not have to retrain. [Kozlov] On average, how much does a customs inspector earn? [Agafonov] Our wages are equated to wages in law enforcement organs. An inspector earns approximately as much as a sergeant in the militia--slightly less than 2,000. [Kozlov] How would you describe the state of today's Russian- Belarus border? [Agafonov] The border is quite transparent. There is no passport control. In our sector there are no frontier forces and none are planned. There are, however, 26 unmanned customs posts on alternate routes that could readily accommodate heavy transport. Even though we do have an agreement with the Belarus customs service--they return smugglers to Russia--it is, naturally, possible to catch far from all of them. [Kozlov] Do assertions that Russia is being robbed and everything of any value at all is being exported, correspond to reality? Let us recall the latest film by Stanislav Govorukhin. [Agafonov] To a certain degree they do, or rather did. In the first months of the customs post cargo, mainly raw material, was shipped out of Russia. This year the situation has changed. Shipments have been declining. Presently more is being imported into Russia than exported. In May the flow of freight decreased somewhat, but up to then 130-200 trucks were lined up daily waiting to enter Russia, and there was no exit line. [Kozlov] What is being imported in Russia? [Agafonov] Mainly foodstuffs, alcohol, and consumer goods. Less frequently, equipment. [Kozlov] Each customs service has its history and traditions. What can the Nevel Post be proud of? [Agafonov] When the flow was coming from Russia we detained up to seven freight shipments a day. We saved quite a lot of fuel, lumber, nonferrous metals, and fertilizer for the country. One shipment had 20 tonnes of copper, another one had 38 tonnes of nickel, while a third one contained seven tonnes of black caviar. [Kozlov] Was that contraband? [Agafonov] For the most part. Sometimes, however, the corresponding structures simply did not know how to complete the required documentation properly. [Kozlov] What happens with the detained freight? [Agafonov] It is stored in our guarded warehouses. Legal proceedings are initiated concerning the violation of customs rules and an appropriate decision is made. Frequently the matter is turned over to organs of the Internal Affairs Ministry or the procurator's office. Perishable goods are sold through the retail network of the Nevel Rayon, as soon as documents are prepared regarding the confiscation. [Kozlov] What is the situation with narcotics and weapons? [Agafonov] There have been some individual cases. [Kozlov] Vladimir Nikolayevich, customs legislation changes so rapidly that people are simply unable to keep up with it. Do the existing rules infringe on the rights of normal citizens who are not smugglers? [Agafonov] If one wants to export or import some goods within average limits, not at all. Personal effects with a value of up to 50 minimum wages and import $2,000 worth may be exported. Most goods may be imported into Belarus from Russia and into Russia from Belarus without any duties. Every citizen of Russia has the right to import one domestic motor vehicle from any CIS country once a year. There are restrictions on the export of gasoline--a full tank plus a 20-liter can. The Belarus side exercises rather strict control over the export of food from the republic. [Kozlov] The establishment of a new country--the Republic of Belarus, took place virtually before your very eyes. How does the economic state of that country appear today out of the window of a Russian customs post? [Agafonov] At first the tendency of Russians to export goods to Belarus was evident, since the economy there was functioning with greater success than in Russia. Sometime in October of last year the pendulum swung the other way--goods are being shipped from Belarus to Russia in order to acquire cash in rubles. [Kozlov] What can be said about the Belarus currency--the hares? [Agafonov] Absolutely no one wants them in Russia. Citizens of Russia exchange rubles for hares in order to purchase Belarusian goods, which are still somewhat cheaper than similar Russian goods but are of an inferior quality. On the whole that is done by people on both sides of the border who are not very prosperous. As far as I know, most of the residents of Belarus have a positive attitude toward the Russian ruble zone. [Kozlov] Will there be any changes at the customs post after the final entry of Belarus in the ruble zone? [Agafonov] I do not think so. Of all the freight shipped through the post that from Belarus amounts to barely more than 10 percent. There may be some changes in duties, but customs control will continue as it has been. [Kozlov] How are relations with your Belarusian colleagues shaping up? [Agafonov] We have excellent relations. We are in contact almost daily. I frequently meet with customs personnel from other CIS countries. Everyone favors cooperation and restoration of ties. We are also for that. But without harm to Russia.
