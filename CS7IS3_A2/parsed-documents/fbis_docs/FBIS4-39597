Today the Second Readings of the Draft Federal Budget for 1994 Begin"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The first version of the draft federal budget was submitted to the Federal Assembly 18 March. [passage omitted] The draft federal budget immediately generated sharp criticism in several significant spheres. First of all, it was submitted without the necessary accompanying documents, the main one of which is a forecast of economic and social development for the year and a preliminary report on the implementation of the budget in the previous year. Second, the realistic nature of the draft federal budget and the forecast based on it generated a great deal of doubt. The findings of the Committee for Economic Policy noted that attempts to meet the figures for the average annual deficit incorporated in the forecasts by further squeezing the real money supply could cause a continuation in the reduction in production by 25-30 percent as compared with last year, which, in its turn, will generate a sharp increase in the state budget deficit, and, as a consequence, a growth in inflation, whose rate far exceeds the forecasted scale. [passage omitted] Third, the question of the correspondence of the draft federal budget for 1994 with the priorities of the state socioeconomic policy arose. [passage omitted] Fourth, important potential income was not taken into account in the draft federal budget. [passage omitted] Fifth, the prevailing practice of forming funds outside the budget was subjected to serious criticism; these are formed out of quasi-tax payments, but are not taken into account in the budget. [passage omitted] Sixth, a lot of contradicting information and basic arithmetical mistakes were discovered in the draft budget and the attached materials, the form of the presentation of the budget makes it impossible to assess allocations for many spheres, and the absence of a breakdown of expenditure for programs makes funding and supervision of the implementation of ratified federal programs difficult. [passage omitted] A large part of the criticism of the budget being adopted remained unanswered, and the insignificant changes which the government made to the draft did not lead to a fundamental improvement. The income, increased by 3,776.5 billion rubles [R] and the deficit, by R6.4 trillion, were mainly targeted at the needs of agriculture, which increased the disproportions in the funding of priority spheres of structural policy even more. Amplifications were not made to the forecast of the development of the Russian economy, which was evidently at variance with reality. Proceeding from this, the Committee for Economic Policy adopted a decision -- to recommend that the State Duma should reject the draft Federal Law "On the Federal Budget for 1994" given the amendments presented by the government 26 April 1994. The majority of deputies disagreed with this proposal and voted for the adoption of the budget at the first reading. Although practically all factions made a negative assessment of the draft federal budget and stated the need for its cardinal improvement. Curiously, the opposition parties, which had sharply criticized the economic policy which remains unchanged under the approved draft federal budget, voted in favor of the ratification of the draft federal budget. It is hard to understand the logic of this decision. Everyone was hoping for the improvement of the draft federal budget during its revision for the second reading, but they were deceiving themselves. It is impossible to improve the draft budget within the framework of an economic policy conducted on the condition of "collective irresponsibility." Behind every entry for items of expenditure in the draft federal budget which has already been approved at the first reading lie opportunist interests which have already proved their supremacy in respect of the approach to the national economy. Obviously, it will scarcely prove possible to reduce expenditure following the adoption of the draft federal budget in the first reading with such an approach toward forming it. Consequently, it is only possible to improve the draft budget by increasing its income part. And increasing this presupposes, first of all, a repeat examination of the draft federal budget in the first reading, and, second, the need for a serious change in the economic policy being conducted; if only in accordance with the directions of the president's message to the Federal Assembly, which was supported by the Duma. But that is what the government evidently does not want to do. It is no accident that the proposals of the Committee for Economic Policy to increase income from the privatization and commercial use of state property were given a hostile reception. This is a troublesome matter, requiring long and painstaking work and the implementation of mechanisms for State Committee for the Management of State Property organs to carry responsibility for the use of the state assets they have been entrusted with controlling, strict accountability for income received, and so on. It is far more convenient to continue the policy of the uncontrolled pulling apart of state property on the pretext of building national capitalism. The program of so-called post-voucher privatization is based on the previous mechanism of spontaneous privatization "from below," geared to privatization for the sake of privatization at the fastest possible rate, without taking into consideration the criteria of economic efficiency. The same goes for restoring order in the sphere of foreign economic activity. Further increasing income by R6.65 trillion proves to be a less attractive task than the shady redistribution of state income in favor of privileged structures. The adoption by the prime minister of new decisions on granting privileges in violation of legislation was a kind of reaction to the Duma's demand for the revocation of unlawfully distributed privileges and the Edict of the President No. 1007 (once again ordering the government to revoke the unlawful privileges). These include privileges for the purchase of foreign airplanes (and this in a situation in which domestic aircraft builders cannot sell finished airliners amid the acute need to renew the fleet of airplanes, and the program for the development of civil aircraft is being underfunded), privileges on the import of goods for the Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg (although usually the organizing parties try to use international rivalry to stimulate internal demand), and also privileges for the export of oil to Tatarstan (which is in fact a subsidy and should be reflected in the distribution of transfers in the federal budget). No response has been received to the requests of the Committee for Economic Policy that the government should present some kind of justification for the privileges that have been granted. The same has happened with the inquiries concerning the number of shares of privatized enterprises retained in federal ownership and the dividends received on them.... The answer the Ministry of Finance gave to the proposals made by the Committee for Economic Policy to increase budget income by revoking unlawful privileges is curious. It rejects this proposal because the government has planned to reduce the export tariff rate, which will entail a reduction in income under the heading of foreign economic activity. Obviously, no calculations are cited here. There is no reasonable explanation for this latest unplanned change in the income base of the budget in the process of its examination, either. The aim of such actions is to raise enterprises' income from the export of raw materials, which have gone up in price in relative terms as a result of the growth in domestic prices, which outstripped the fall in the rate of the ruble by 8 percent in the first six months of the year. But after all, bringing the dynamics of the ruble rate into line with price dynamics is an obvious measure in this situation -- the correct policy for the exchange rate should actually be geared to settling tasks relating to support for the competitiveness of domestic output and stimulating exports of it. Instead of this, an obviously damaging decision is being adopted -- to reduce the export tariff rate, which will lead not only to a significant and unplanned reduction in budget income, and consequently, to the underfunding of planned expenditure and an ensuing increase in nonpayments, but also to the raising of the domestic prices of raw materials. Correspondingly, the competitiveness of domestic output will continue to fall, the structure of exports to worsen, and its volume to decrease, home-produced goods will inevitably be squeezed out by imported ones, and domestic production will be steadily reduced. The income base of the budget will also undoubtedly be reduced. The most surprising thing is that the proposal to reduce export tariffs comes from the Ministry of Finance, which, by virtue of its functions, should be concerned about increasing the income base of the budget. It is paradoxical but true that the State Committee for the Management of State Property is pursuing a line of spontaneously giving away the property it has been entrusted with, without even being interested in the income it brings, and the Ministry of Finance is proposing to reduce the income part of the budget, and is spending state funds without conforming to the economic effectiveness of this expenditure. And the government is approving and supporting this strange policy, assuring citizens that things are going well and that there will soon be an upturn, whereas even the forecasts made by government research centers inexorably testify to the catastrophic fall in industrial production. As the famous song goes: "Everything is fine, beautiful Marchioness, everything is fine..." The second reading of the draft federal budget, for which the Committee for Economic Policy has prepared detailed amendments, will take place this week. Their adoption will make it possible to solve the most acute problems of preserving the country's scientific-industrial potential, developing long-term spheres of scientific research, effecting conversion of the defense complex, preventing the degradation of the education system, and implementing the necessary investment programs. This will not have to be paid for by an increase in inflation and a growth in social tension. And responsibility for the management of state property must be reestablished and violations of legislation in foreign economic activity must be ended as soon as possible.
