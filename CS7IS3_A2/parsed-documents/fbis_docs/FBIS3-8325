The decision was explained by the trade union's activity related to restructuring its information-publishing activity. An announcement of the Podkrepa Labor Confederation's Press Center indicates that the Executive Council has declared a partial liquidation of the PODKREPA daily as a separate department of the confederation. The effective date is 2 March 1994. The decision on the newspaper's going into liquidation was adopted against the background of the conflicts that developed between the newspaper's editorial board and the leadership of the Podkrepa Labor Confederation. More than one month ago Dr. Trenchev openly expressed his dissatisfaction with the information published by the newspaper. Margarita Vurbanova, PODKREPA's chief editor, was fired. PODKREPA's journalists accused the confederation of refusing to pay their wages and royalties. Informed sources claim that the newspaper will begin to appear in a new format, and that it will be financed by powerful economic groups.
