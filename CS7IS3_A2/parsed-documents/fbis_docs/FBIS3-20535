Since 1993 in particular, the scope of capital investment and the rate of growth in many new projects have been heightened, and the macroeconomic picture looks good. This indicates that the buildup in China's transportation and telecommunications industry has made a big leap into another phase. Large-Scale Capital Investment and Accelerated Growth. By the end of 1993, investments by state units in the transportation and communications industry have broken through the hundred billion yuan mark, while reflecting a more than one-fold growth, an increase of 44 percentage points over that for the same period a year ago. The proportion of capital investment also rose from 16 percent for the same period a year ago to 21 percent in 1993. Among these, investment in new projects in basic construction and improvements for the transportation and telecommunications industry costing more than 5 million yuan each totalled 41.5 billion yuan, also more than one-fold over outlays for the previous year. Its proportion of the total capital investment also rose to 20.9 percent from the 14.6 percent figure for the previous period a year ago. The scope of capital investment and the rapid rate of growth are unprecedented. Numerous Completed Projects With Good Macroeconomic Benefits. Up to the present time, important projects already completed and placed into operation include the Wujiaba airport in Kunming, the Gongyi airport in Lhasa, the Tianho airport in Wuhan, a new passenger terminal in Shenyang, the second phase of the Da-Qin [Dalian to Qinhuangdao] railway, the Xuan-Hangzhou [Xuancheng to Hangzhou] dual line, the Jiejiang-Jiangxi dual line, the Jiao-Zhi dual line, the Bin-Zhou [Haerhbin-Manzhouli] dual line, the Guang-Mei-Shan [Guangzhou-Meixian-Shantou] line etc. The 318-kilometer highway from Jinan to Qingdao, built at a cost of 3.1 billion yuan, is the single largest investment item in China's highway construction history. Of sound quality construction, its completion in record time for automobile travel is highly significant toward furthering economic development on the Shandong peninsula and stepped-up opening and exploration of its western part, with circulation of commodities, construction and exploration of the Shengli oilfields, and development of the Huang He delta. It has become an important conduit linking China's interior with its coastal region. The Qingdao-Jinan highway can accommodate as much as 80 million tons of freight annually, comparable to one and one-half times that carried on the Jiao-Jinan rail link. Social benefits derived from this operation are increased by 5 billion yuan annually. The macroeconomic advantages are outstanding. Rapid Progress on Current Projects. Ongoing large projects at present include electrification of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railroad, construction of the Western Passenger Terminal in Beijing, the Lan-Xin [Lanzhou to Xinjiang] dual line, the circumferential highway on Hainan Island, and the first phase of an engineering project on the bay approaching the port of Qingdao, the second phase of projects at the port of Zhangjiagang, and Miaoling at the port of Lianyungang. For the Beijing-Kowloon Railway that has attracted worldwide attention, 403 kilometers of track have been laid down and completed. By the end of October, 6.1 billion yuan of investment capital have been expended, and 94.5 percent of the annual plan has been completed. Among ongoing projects, 184 kilometers of track has been laid on the Jing-Heng [Beijing-Hengyang] segment, while 217 kilometer has been laid on the Heng-Shang segment. An Optimistic Future. Not long ago, the State Council approved for immediate startup, a series of structural construction projects for use in transportation and telecommunications. For example, a capital investment of 3.5 billion yuan to lay down 369 kilometers of track for the Bao-Cheng [Baoji-Chengdu] dual line, which is an important transportation channel for southwestern China, has been planned. A capital investment of 2.5 billion yuan on a project to electrify the Chengdu-Kunming line, laying tracks on all 1,100 kilometers of its length will, upon completion, improve its transportation capacity more than three times over its present level. Furthermore, an overall investment of 2 billion yuan to lay 251 kilometers of track on a second line traversing southern Fujian province, as well as a capital investment of 1.6 billion yuan for building the Fushan-Kaiping highway have been planned. Construction on these projects foretell another giant step forward made by China's transportation and telecommunications industry, and its important effect on furthering economic development in the national economy.
