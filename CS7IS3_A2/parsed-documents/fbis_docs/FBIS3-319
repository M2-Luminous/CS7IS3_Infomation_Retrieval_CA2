The ANC has confirmed that Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] co-leader General Constand Viljoen "volunteered" information linking the plot with covert military operations. The ANC has, however, not divulged the full details of Viljoen's information and referred inquiries to him. SOWETAN has learned that Viljoen approached the ANC with the information because he wanted to draw suspicion away from his people who, he said, were not part of the conspiracy. Viljoen was this week travelling around the country on AVF and Freedom Alliance business and could not be contacted for comment. ANC chief media officer Mr Carl Niehaus said the organisation had stepped up security, especially around Secretary-General Ramaphosa, in the light of the threat. ANC leaders have been targets of rightwing forces for some time, and several leaders have been killed in suspected plots. The most prominent was Mr Chris Hani, while SACP [South African Commun?st Party] chairman Mr Joe Slovo has also been a target.
