In a morning radio program, the prime minister stated that he must meet with the candidate once again. "One or two days are not a problem," he said. "The agreements reached on Tuesday with the prime minister are still binding, and they will be acted upon until the end of the week." This was how Zbigniew Siemiatkowski summed up the events of the entire day. "The issue is very serious, and haste is not very advisable." According to the prime minister, it should be explained once again "whether Mr. Rosati shares our views on structural issues." Since Professor Rosati is in Geneva, the organization of such a meeting will take some time, stated the Prime Minister's Press Secretary, Ewa Wachowicz. After the evening meeting of coalition authorities on Tuesday, Aleksander Kwasniewski reported that the prime minister had given assurances to the participants of the meeting that he would forward the motion concerning Rosati to the Belweder on Wednesday. "Some people tell me what I should do, as well as what I say and what I should say," the prime minister commented on this on Wednesday morning. He also added that the procedure of the appointment of Rosati had been complicated by some statements of politicians; the advancing of the date of forwarding the appointment motion was termed "slightly humorous" by him. SLD leaders, obviously taken aback and angry, tried to minimize in their official statements the absence of a decision by the prime minister. "Well, just a slight delay that will soon be explained," said Zbigniew Siemiatkowski in the afternoon. The situation was similarly assessed by Speaker Jozef Oleksy. The issue of forwarding the appointment motion was discussed at a session of the SLD Club, which was closed to the press (the date of the session was agreed upon earlier; the deputies were supposed to sum up the activities of the government and the coalition). "The decision has already been made, and there is no reason that there should be any delay in forwarding the motion to the Belweder," said Aleksander Kwasniewski before the session of the club, thus maintaining his earlier stand. He added that "everything in this issue will be explained." During that time, Jerzy Szmajdzinski tried to reach the prime minister on the phone. At a break in the session, at approximately 1900, Kwasniewski began phoning the prime minister; he refused to make any comments until that talk. As Siemiatkowski said, in the evening, Kwasniewski was in constant contact with the government leadership. The SLD leader, however, still refused to issue any information. The press spokesman gave assurances that the motion requesting Rosati's appointment was a matter of days. He said that the prime minister's delay had been caused by the desire to meet the president personally. However, SLD politicians do not see a reason that any further talks with the SLD candidate should be conducted. Yesterday's reactions by SLD politicians and the atmosphere in the club were very similar to the days of the greatest government crisis and the Borowski-Pawlak dispute. Strak: Decision After Easter Michal Strak, head of the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM], stated at a meeting with journalists of the regional press that there is no need to turn the appointment of Dariusz Rosati into a sensation. "There is no reason for taking any violent steps," he argued and added that the delay in appointing the new finance minister does not threaten the Polish economy with any catastrophe. "We have not had the head of this ministry for a few weeks now, and there is nothing bad happening with the economy." The statement by Minister Strak suggested that Dariusz Rosati will be appointed finance minister, but it will be after Easter. "It is better to wait a while than make hasty decisions," the URM head explained. Asked by RZECZPOSPOLITA whether he believes there are reasons to believe that the president will reject Rosati's candidacy, he gave a negative answer. Finance Deputy Minister Henryk Chmielak stated that "the main theses and directions of the program presented by Prof. Rosati are in accordance with what the present government is doing." However, there are no details concerning the rate of the changes, and this is where differences of opinions may appear. Even though he was awaited by journalists of the regional press on Wednesday, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak did not show up at the meeting. He stayed longer than expected in Siedlce, where he took part in the funeral of his office chief, Andrzej Piwowarczyk. On the previous day, at the session of the coalition, he announced, however, that he would organize a press conference on Wednesday. This was the only piece of information he passed to journalists after the coalition talks on the candidacy of Rosati. What Does the Candidate Say? A few Wednesday statements concerning the candidacy of Prof. Dariusz Rosati: Prime Minister Pawlak for "Sygnaly Dnia" ["The Signals of the Day"]--about the need of several days for additional contact; by representatives of voivodship authorities of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], who are afraid of the continuation of the state's financial policy that has been conducted so far; and by Acting Finance Minister Henryk Chmielak, who stated that the program presented by Rosati does not contain any details and methods of implementation of its goals--suggest that the candidate is still controversial, despite the PSL-SLD coalition meeting. Therefore, RZECZPOSPOLITA asked the candidate himself whether he still wants to become deputy prime minister and finance minister. "Prime Minister Pawlak and I have agreed that I will receive the final answer by the end of last week. I treat this situation quietly, even though I am considering various possibilities, including the one that I may resign. I am waiting for a signal because that was the agreement," we were told by Prof. Rosati. As of Wednesday afternoon, no one from the prime minister's entourage had gotten in touch with the candidate. The question whether the delaying of the decision may be related to the Senate debate over the budget, in which also the issue of financing the Food Industry Bank and the restructurization of the sugar industry are discussed, were left by Prof. Rosati without a comment. "However, there is certainly some reason for the delay," he said.
