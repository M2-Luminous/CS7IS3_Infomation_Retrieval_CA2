The definition goes on with describing the opposition as "a much too burdensome moral and financial luxury for this country." PRM reproaches the presidency, the government and the prosecutor general the failure to bring before court the dignitaries who in 1990-1992 "plundered the country and now take shelter in the clamorous choir of the contentious opposition."
