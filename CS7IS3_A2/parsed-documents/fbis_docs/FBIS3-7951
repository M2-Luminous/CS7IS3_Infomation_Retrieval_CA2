This information was released by KDS Chairman Ivan Pilip and LSNS Chairman Pavel Hirs after their meeting. According to Pilip, their talks focussed on the issue of the territorial-administrative arrangement, restitution, the approach to returning emigres' property, the election laws, and educational and housing matters. He said that the two parties' opinions on the issues discussed are very close in the basic principles. The only exception is the parties' differing views on the elections to the Senate. The KDS prefers 27 electoral districts, while the LSNS prefers 81, added Pilip. According to the LSNS chairman, yesterday's meeting, the first to be held at the party-leadership level, took place out of a mutual need to get together. "No one initiated it," said LSNS Chairman Pavel Hirs. He added that some things have to be coordinated in parliament, while others have to be clarified and "discussed in advance" in cooperation with experts. "We want to set an example to the other parties and show them that it is possible to cooperate and reach a sensible agreement on apparently conflicting issues on which opinions differ and that this can be done without having to shift from one's own position," said LSNS Chairman Pavel Hirs in conclusion.
