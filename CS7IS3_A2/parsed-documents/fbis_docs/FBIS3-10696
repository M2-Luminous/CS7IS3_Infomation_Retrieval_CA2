Either there are many disagreements among cabinet members or you actually threatened to resign... [Cavallo] Well, I made a communications error. In one way or an other I was the cause of the storm over the past two weeks. I admit my responsibility and will do everything in my power to avoid a repetition. People inside and outside the government -- not the media -- have used the mistakes I made to harm me. They believe it would benefit the country if I had a setback and had to step down as economy minister. That is nothing new: in all governments there are people who dislike some cabinet members. I have faced many problems within the government but I have always had Carlos Menem's full support. The ministers who have generally and repeatedly disagreed with me or confronted me have had to listen to the president's reiterated support for my work. The current cabinet composition will enable the entire government and I to work together very well. [Diaz] What about the other ministers? How are your relations with them? [Cavallo] Let us take the case of the labor minister (Armando Caro Figueroa): I believe there is full consensus between us, like never before, but there was also quite a good understanding with former Education Minister Rodolfo Diaz. Former Labor Minister Enrique Rodriguez and I viewed labor problems very differently. Defense Minister Oscar Camilion and I have a close understanding -- much better than with former Minister Erman Gonzalez. I have always been on good terms with Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella. I never had problems with former Education Minister Antonio Salonia, while Jorge Rodriguez is an excellent education minister: I would say his personality leads him to become engaged in matters that are common to the economic area. Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf and I are managing regional economies quite well. He placed Juan Antonio Zapata [not further identified], who is one of my team. Secretary General of the Presidency Eduardo Bauza always helped to make a harmonic government, he always played the role of moderator. In addition, he is the closest man to the president and can best interpret the president's thinking and mood. In other words, the government is running well... [Diaz] How come? Now you have no problems with anyone? [Cavallo] There are obviously snipers; some of them from Congress, others from the government. Then there are people like Barrionuevo [not further identified], who attacked me in a shameful manner. There are also those who always take advantage of each of my mistakes to try to undermine my position. Then there is the Radical Civic Union, especially its leaders, who want me out. They do it because they are electorally strained. Three or four months ago, before signing the pact, Alfonsin spoke about me and the economic team with high regard, while he strongly attacked President Menem. His aggressiveness returned after he signed the Olivos pact when the problems of outlining an opposition stand appeared because he had to give up his political opposition. This time he spoke against the economic plan. He said inflation and recession will return within two years -- as if that trend will yield some political benefit for him. [Diaz] It is incredible that just 40 days before the elections, confrontations within the cabinet have intensified and Cavallo is suddenly be seen to be alone... Are you alone? [Cavallo] I can tell you that last week I felt alone -- and I said so at the cabinet meeting. That was unfair because the president has always given me his full support. Yet I did feel alone, especially when I was the target of the shameful attack by Judge Roberto Marquevich. The only voice I heard in my favor was that of Eduardo Menem, who very rightly noted that when I said there was vagueness in the DGI [General Directorate of Taxation], in no way was I meddling with court decisions or speaking against the judge or the courts. People like Deputy Alberto Piotti praised Marquevich and criticized me, thus giving the impression that I caused a controversy with the courts, despite the fact that I never mentioned the judge or commented on what he had to decide. [Diaz] But the judge was about to prosecute some officials on charges of perjury...? [Cavallo] I suddenly realized that versions were being fueled from the court itself. The judge personally leaked that he would prosecute Gustavo Andres Parino, the national customs administrator. That was outrageous: Parino was being attacked by those who previously managed the customs finances. He was implementing a substantial transformation there, with Tacchi and Cossio [not further identified]. Having heard Marquevich's attack and reviewed the generalized media opinion that the judge was right -- without anyone standing up to defend me, and with some Justicialist Party members attacking me -- I felt alone on that day. That is why I raised the point at the cabinet. [Diaz] Did you threaten to resign...? [Cavallo] Never. I never threatened to resign. Neither once nor on many occasions, as some people have said. I would never resign in a situation that could jeopardize the continuity of the economic program and the success of our government work. I would never step down for my own personal benefit, jeopardizing what we have accomplished through the Menem government. The president knows this very well. I am also convinced that -- contrary to what many have suggested -- President Menem's is not trying to overshadow me. I believe it is natural that Menem should claim for himself the leading role in this process, because he is the one who has led it. I think he should feel uncomfortable when people want to make me appear almost on the same footing with him, as far as the merit for what is being done is concerned. I may have my own merits, but the factor that led to Argentina's transformation is the political determination, leadership, and courage of Menem. Some people believe I say this just to please Menem. It is, however, how I feel... [Diaz] You believe there was a minor conspiracy against you... [Cavallo] No... Some people tried to use my communications mistakes or those verbal confrontations to attain sectorial objectives or to defend personal interests or the interest of groups with respect to the economic policy. To me this is very clear. [Diaz] What interests? [Cavallo] Economic and political interests. Economic interests, like all that occurred in connection with the automobile regulations. Such regulations, which are eight years old, stem from a total ban on importing automobiles. The ban is temporary, it is similar to the ones that are being enforced in Mexico, it was accepted by NAFTA countries, and it was suggested at the Uruguay round of GATT talks. Even though the automobile sector is today much more liberal than it was four or five years ago -- despite the fact that when this campaign began the newspapers reported a drop in car prices -- despite all that, they intend to compel us to enforce total liberalization. They took advantage of that opportunity to insist on their objectives. I believe they are being driven by economic interest. Others are doing it for, say, political motivation: it is undoubtedly tantalizing and attractive for the middle class to buy cars at half the current price, in a much larger number of installments, and with the choice of any model. Yet any responsible person will understand that transition from a totally closed economy -- like that of Argentina's automotive sector -- to a totally open economy in a technically complex sector with strong world competition, is not that easy. [Diaz] Are there any other economic sectors or interested groups that seek to sabotage your plan? [Cavallo] There was a lesser-known sector that tried it. They began to attack the customs office. There is a set of businesses linked with mail, transportation, and cargo services, which seeks to remain as a monopoly. They want me out to avoid disclosure of what comes through the airport... Nothing will be left of this monopoly, even though it began during the military government, it flourished during the Radical administration, and it managed to survive at the beginning of the Menem administration. [Diaz] Some people think your work may now begin to fade, because there will be no more income from privatizations, while public spending will grow. Is the economy doing well? [Cavallo] I want people to be totally reassured. Argentina is doing very well. In the past two months we had very important news, to which no attention has been given. There is no reason to be afraid. There is no problem whatsoever between President Menem and Minister Cavallo. Quite the contrary. I don't feel discouraged as economy minister and I am not giving up.
