Unless further offers are received by this Wednesday, Germany will be competing against Switzerland, which would like to keep the WTO in the current GATT building if possible. In a letter to GATT Director General Peter Sutherland, Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt praised the advantages of the German offer. It has been said that Bonn would be willing to pay for the expenses of moving the GATT Secretariat (400 employees) and not ask for any rent. So far, in accordance with Germany's share in world trade, Bonn has paid about 12 percent of the GATT budget (110 million German marks). The costs for the trade organization, of which no official estimates have been made yet, would have to be added. Due to its many tasks, the WTO, which will be established in early 1995 after the ratification of the Uruguay Final Act, is expected to employ more than 500 people. Moreover, Bonn would grant diplomatic status to more professionals and be generous as far as work permits for dependents are concerned. This offer is an indirect reaction to complaints by Geneva diplomats about Swiss restrictions. Nevertheless, it has to be assumed that Switzerland will make further concessions in addition to what it promised so far to keep the organization at the European UN seat in Geneva. This is all the more likely, since the country is increasingly beginning to isolate itself in Europe. The WTO preparatory committee, which includes the 123 GATT members, is expected to make a decision before the summer recess.
