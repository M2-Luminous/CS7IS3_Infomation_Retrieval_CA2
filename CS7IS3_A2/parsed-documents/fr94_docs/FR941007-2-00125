FR941007-2-00125 FR941007-2-00074 The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice thereof in the Federal Register . Amendment No. 2 amends Interpretation .02 to Rule 6.42 to allow stock-option orders, as defined in Rule 1.1(ii), to be priced net in any fractional or decimal price, but also states that the priority principles applicable to such transactions will not apply unless the net price is expressed in increments that are multiples of 1/16. The Commission notes that a stock-option combination order is a transaction involving a combined trade and the purchase or sale of the underlying stock. The Commission does not believe it is appropriate to distinguish between combined trades and stock-option combinations simply because one transaction involves the purchase or sale of the underlying stock. The same concerns attendant to the pricing of combined trades apply equally to a combination coupled with the purchase of stock. 13 Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis. 13 CBOE Rule 6.45(d) currently treats stock-option combination orders and combined trades the same for priority purposes. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27418 (Nov. 1, 1989), 54 FR 47003 (Nov. 8, 1989). The proposal will not create disparate treatment. III.
