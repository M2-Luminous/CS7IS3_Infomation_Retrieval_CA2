At this moment, I would like to talk about our--and I repeat our--view on the role of trade unions on a large-scale level between trade union leadership and government. I have repeatedly spoken in favor of a relationship of consultations, in favor of informing each other, in favor of listening to each other, and, thanks to it all, in favor of mutual enrichment. The government does not have a monopoly on knowledge, and therefore it listens carefully, and I can assure you that also in the future it will listen to trade unions' objections and suggestions regarding legislation as well as our country's economic and social policy. The government is searching for a basic consensus of the population regarding the main issues of our current as well as our future situation and is aware of the exceptionally important role of the trade unions in this. We therefore respect the existence of the Council of Economic and Social Accord and will make every effort to continue negotiations within its framework, even though the privatization is radically changing the role of the government and the state as an employer. We will continue submitting proposals for partial changes in tripartite negotiations, but I would like to stress here, in front of you, that we do not call for any revolution or for radical changes. I therefore believe that there is no need to dramatize the partial differences of opinion that exist on these issues. [passge omitted] I believe everyone is aware that both our rate of inflation and the unemployment level are the lowest of all the postcommunist countries, and, in most cases, they are significantly lower. I also believe that, in the recent period, there were no developments in our labor legislation that would really aggravate an employee's situation. I believe the recent, rather sharp controversy between the government and the trade unions on this matter is nothing more and nothing less than different opinions on one and the very same matter, and that this difference of opinion is common and one that exists legitimately in every democratic society. I cannot agree with the opinion that the trade unions have to face insensitive politicians and deputies, as voiced at your recent rally. I can say, with full responsibility, that a number of requests by trade unions concerning the most varied issues have been accepted by the government recently. I cannot accept the accusations that we are not able, I quote, to listen to people, and that we retreat into office chambers, foreign limousines, and empty sentences because this simply is not true. We, but not only we, may not succeed in everything. It is not true, though, that we are not trying to achieve the maximum possible contact with the citizens of our country, to listen to what they have to say. I also disagree with the statement that we do not show social feeling because we have taken and continue to take on an everyday basis dozens of social measures. [passage omitted] I am convinced and believe that many of you have the same view that we are implementing the profound and very much needed social change as quickly as we can and with the lowest possible costs for us all. Therefore, I cannot agree either with a statement pronounced at your recent protest rally that, as citizens, we had democratically voted for belt-tightening. I would like to say that we have voted for nothing of the sort. [passage omitted] When I hear that this belt is getting rather dangerously tight for rather too many people, I cannot agree with that, either. [passage omitted] I am convinced that, in 1994, we will witness general economic growth in the form of a several-percentage-point increase in the gross domestic product, and that this will enable a further increase in real wages. I do not see any reasons the increase in real wages should not continue in the coming years. When I say this, I also say at the same time, with the same breath, that we are well aware of the imbalance in the economic and wage development in our country as well as some remaining social problems that some of our fellow citizens have to struggle with. For that reason, we are trying in every possible way--and I believe that in the majority of cases our views are not different from those of the trade unions--to improve our social policy. Not at the cost of our future but on the basis of our current possibilities and our active work. I know that the trade unions do not like the introduction of wage regulation, but, after the excesses of a too rapid increase in wages in some enterprises in the past two years, this measure was unfortunately necessary. I believe that the selected very careful degree of regulation enables two main things. It enables the growth of real wages and the necessary wage differentiation between successful and less successful enterprises and between more and less efficient employees. This is the most important thing for all of us today becaquse a sensible level of wages is the most important prerequisite for the preservatin of the current low unemployment rate and for the overall success of our postcommunist era. I believe that our views on these and many other issues do not differ too much from those of the trade unionists. I believe that what was said at your recent protest rally, to the effect that, in the next elections, we will make a better choice, was meant as rhetorical hyperbole and not as an expression of a responsible overall assessment of the situation in our country.
