To be more precise, Sarajevo will be under UN administration, Mostar under European Union administration. The Bosnian Presidency will be given one-third of the territories. So far, we have not managed to overcome the issue of territories. In the coming days, the United States and Russia are going to talk actively with the conflicting sides in order to be able to see whether the negotiating process can be continued. We will then meet again at the end of this month or the beginning of March. Progress in the talks: That means that I can look somebody in the eye and say that we are closer to peace than we were on Friday, at the beginning of the talks. No, I could not say that. Therefore, we now have the agreement that Sarajevo will be under UN administration, but we do not have an agreement that we will take Sarajevo by storm first. [Karadzic] We have invested a great effort to give the Muslim Republic first 30 percent and then 33 percent of the territory. However, they have expanded their demand to 15 more towns, seven from the Croats and eight from the Serbs. It is obvious that they have rejected the plan of the European Union. They are using the method of delaying in order to gain time and cause military intervention with a view of improving the situation in and around Sarajevo. This is why they have rejected the plan on Sarajevo that was accepted a few days ago in cooperation with Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. We must stress here that the Muslims are not taking peace seriously and that the threats by the international community are encouraging the Muslims not to sign peace but to continue fighting. If they fight for territories legitimately then nobody can guarantee 33.33 percent to them. They are gambling. As regards threats, they are going to threaten, whatever we do, because our behavior did not cause these threats. The reason for the NATO threats is NATO itself. Problems within NATO are the reason for the threats. Besides, Mr. Juppe, French minister of foreign affairs who is trying to pull the United States into the chaos and push it into the conflict, is trying to compromise NATO. If NATO interferes in a conflict on one side, this is the end of NATO. We can completely guarantee the security of those people who are working on humanitarian aid in the republic of Srpska.
