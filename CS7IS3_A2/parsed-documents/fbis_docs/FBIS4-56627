The case began following a charge presented by the U.S. Hoechst company against the Spanish company Viscofan. The two companies are competing in the Brazilian sausage casings market, which moves $10 million annually. The investigation involves 2 million tons of this material imported in 1993. The sausage casings manufactured in Brazil by Hoechst are more expensive than those imported from Spain by Viscofan, which has businesses in Germany and is looking at opening a factory in Brazil. The Foreign Trade Secretariat will also begin an investigation by mid-May of wheat imported from Germany at subsidized prices. Argentina is the main wheat supplier for Brazil.
