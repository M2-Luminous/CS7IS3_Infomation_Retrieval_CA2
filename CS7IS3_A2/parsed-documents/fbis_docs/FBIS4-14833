The article headed "Spring. Restless politician is gambling" says, in particular, that the words "Euro-Asian Union" are "for simpletons." "Uzbekistan is still to grow up to Europe's level where the states can allow such an extravagance -- unification without the fear to appear under a foreign dictatorship," said the article. In the opinion of the author, there exists a real threat to appear under an alien dictatorship in the post-Soviet time. The article underlined that "the essence of the idea to create the Euro-Asian Union is the same -- to revive the former Soviet Union and this cannot be assessed in any other way but as a pure delirium." This publication in the official press is the first reaction of the Republic towards Nazarbayev's initiative. The article was handed over to the newspaper by the national information agency.
