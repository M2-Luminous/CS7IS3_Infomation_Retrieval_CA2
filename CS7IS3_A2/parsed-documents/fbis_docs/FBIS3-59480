A while back, there was a disagreement at the Turkish border. The Turkish border organs would not allow Macedonian citizens to export goods from Turkey, saying that they would be going to Serbia, since they identified Macedonia with Serbia. For 24 hours, the border guards held the Macedonian citizens at the border, until they received an order from the Turkish Government that they would be allowed to export. For this reason and for many other reasons, importers of various articles are experiencing many other difficulties, especially with the Macedonian police who, after the border control, stop the merchants and carry out unnecessary inspections, despite the fact that they have all the necessary documents. We are presenting the opinions of some merchants on this matter: Etem Billali said: "The irregular status of Macedonia has caused us serious problems with the Turkish border organs. Likewise, the unnecessary inspection by the Macedonian police and the mistreatment which we endure en route are just too much. We do not get any better treatment at the Skopje customs office. The customs fees are astronomical and they have no relation to the purchase price of the articles. The customs fees force us to increase the price of the articles." Musa Lamallari and Adnan Aliu said: "To tell the truth, this is a hard job. The mistreatment which we suffer until the goods reach the market will cause us to abandon this activity and to seek some other solution. The embargo against Serbia, which has a considerable effect on us (the citizens of Macedonia), the fear of traveling by night through Bulgaria, the mistreatment at the border and at the Skopje customs office are enough to make us give up all of this, which is the source of our existence." [passage omitted] Extensive inspections by the police are also being carried out in Bit Pazar. Persons who do not have the necessary documentation for selling goods on the market have to undergo these inspections. Bejtulla Bajrami told us that, a few months ago, he had to turn over 1,300 pairs of socks, confiscated by the police, although he had already paid the customs fees for them. The matter went to court and the outcome is not known. The general impression remains that the embargo against Serbia and customs problems are two main obstacles to the normal development of trade in Macedonia.
