I. Introduction On December 23, 1993, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.

On January 21, 1994, the CHX submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. 3 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). 3 See letter from David T. Rusoff, Attorney, Foley & Lardner, to Louis A. Randazzo, Attorney, Office of Derivative and Exchange Oversight, SEC, dated January 21, 1994. Amendment No. 1 made certain clarifying amendments to the proposal. The proposed rule change, together with Amendment No. 1, was noticed for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33499 (January 21, 1994), 59 FR 4127 (January 28, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1. II. Description of the Proposal The Exchange is adopting Interpretation and Policy .03 to CHX Rule 3, Article VI relating to the filing of a Form U&hyph;5 following the termination of a person associated with a member. 4 The new Interpretation and Policy requires members for which the Exchange is the Designated Examining Authority (``DEA'') to notify the Exchange of the discharge or termination of any person associated with the member by submitting to the Exchange a Form U&hyph;5 within 30 days of such termination date. In addition, the new Interpretation and Policy requires similar notification by other member organizations with respect to their associated registered persons active on the Exchange trading floor. 5 Finally, the Interpretation and Policy requires members to provide a copy of the notice to the person whose association has been terminated. 6 4 The Form U&hyph;5 is employed in connection with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD'') Central Registration Depository (``CRD'') system and is used by the various securities self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') as part of their registration and oversight of member organization personnel. Form U&hyph;5 contains information relating to the circumstances surrounding the termination of an applicant's prior employment. 5 Conversation between David T. Rusoff, Attorney, Foley & Lardner, and Louis A. Randazzo, Attorney, SEC, on April 5, 1994. 6 The text of Interpretation and Policy .03 is as follows: ``Following the termination of a person associated with a member in a registered capacity, such member shall promptly, but in no event later than thirty calendar days after such termination, give written notice of such termination to the Exchange on Form U&hyph;5, and concurrently provide a copy of such notice to the person whose association has been terminated. This requirement shall only apply to member organizations for which the Exchange is the Designated Examining Authority and to registered persons of other member organizations active on the CHX trading floor.''
