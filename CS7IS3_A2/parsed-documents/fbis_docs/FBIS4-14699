FBIS4-14699 "drsov064_s_94007" FBIS-SOV-94-064 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 Georgia Shevardnadze Satisfied With Agreement Shevardnadze Satisfied With Agreement LD0404162094 Moscow NTV in Russian 1500 GMT 4 Apr 94 LD0404162094 Moscow NTV Russian BFN [Video report from Tbilisiby correspondent Ugza Keresilidze, including recording of comments by Georgian Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze and Boris Kakubava, leader of the Organization for the Liberation of Abkhazia] [Text] [Announcer] The Georgian parliament has already expressed its opinion about the documents signed in Moscow between Georgia and Abkhazia. [Keresilidze] At an unscheduled session today behind closed doors, the Georgian parliament discussed the Abkhazian issue and determined its position on the agreements reached in Moscow with the Abkhazian side, with Russian participation. It was easy to judge the level of passion generated by the issue under examination by looking at the faces of the deputies coming out into the foyer. The parliament has evidently split into two camps -- the supporters and opponents of the agreements. During the interval Eduard Shevardnadze appraised the agreement reached in Moscow like this: [Shevardnadze] I believe that they achieved the maximum which it was necessary to agree at the present stage, and the minimum which is needed for a decision to be taken in the Security Council on the introduction of peacekeeping forces into Abkhazia. Without the introduction of peacekeeping forces there will be no return of refugees. Personally, at the present stage, the agreement suits me. Parliament's opinion is unimportant. [Keresilidze] The parliamentary opposition has called these agreements -- the text of which, incidentally, was not given to the deputies -- treason. It demanded that the Georgian delegation be recalled from Moscow and the agreements denounced. Boris Kakubava, leader of the Organization for the Liberation of Abkhazia, the most radically minded as regards the head of state's policy, stated: [Kakubava] As long as Shevardnadze is the leader at the helm in Georgia, this policy will continue. But this will probably not be for long, because the Georgian people will understand that Shevardnadze is a leader who works only for Russia. [Keresilidze] Shevardnadze in his turn highly appraised Russia's role in achieving the agreement, and noted the positive influence of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who was present at the talks. [Shevardnadze] With his presence the secretary general stressed the significance of this stage. I think that we should value the true worth of this. I personally am grateful that he will agree to participate in this process once again.
