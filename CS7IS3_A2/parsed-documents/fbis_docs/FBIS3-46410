Welcoming Kozyrev and his party, Li said that the policies of good neighborliness, friendship, mutual benefit and cooperation, set by Chinese and Russian leaders during President Boris Yeltsin's China visit in 1992, are "correct". These policies conform to the essential interests of the two countries and the two peoples and should be adhered to. On Sino-Russian ties, Li said that the bilateral relations had a fairly long history. The two countries share long borders which should be peaceful and friendly ones. He said that the economies of the two sides are complementary, adding that Sino-Russian economic and trade relations have experienced rapid development. The trade volume between China and Russia reached 7.6 billion U.S. dollars last year, which is less than four percent of the total Chinese foreign trade value in 1993. Li said that both China and Russia should take practical views to explore new ways for further bilateral cooperation. Relevant departments of the two sides should promote contacts and conduct some large-scale cooperation. Li, on behalf of the Chinese Government and in the name of himself, invited Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to visit China. Kozyrev expressed gratitude for Li's invitation. He said that the invitation from President Yeltsin to Premier Li for a future Russia visit was still valid, adding that an early meeting between Russian and Chinese prime ministers will be "very important". Kozyrev said that Russia is willing to acquire a in-depth understanding of China's economic reform experience. He himself will also tour south China's Shenzhen city to this end. Li said: "The national conditions in China and Russia are not the same; China's practice is for reference only to your country." Noting that Russia is rich in natural and human resources, Li said he believed that the Russian people will overcome the temporary difficulties. China wishes to see a stable Russia with a growing economy, he added. Li also briefed the Russian guests on China's foreign policies. He said that after the Cold War, the world is facing a multi-polarization trend. Yet the world is not peaceful. New conflicts and contradictions keep occurring. The gap between the north and the south is further enlarged, Li said. Kozyrev said that the world is not single-pole nor bi-polarized but multi-polarized. In this changing world, Kozyrev said, to improve Russian-Chinese ties is a top priority in his country's foreign affairs. He said that the constructive partnership between the two sides should be enhanced and reach new heights. Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo, Chinese Ambassador to Russia Wang Jinqing, and Russian Ambassador to China Yegor Rogachev participated in the meeting.
