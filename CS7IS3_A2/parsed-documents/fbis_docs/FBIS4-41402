Sergei Abelsev, a member of Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party, told reporters that according to information he had gathered "the secret service is preparing an attack against Zhirinovskiy." Speaking at the same news conference, Zhirinovskiy denounced the "campaign of lies and humiliation" against him. He said the campaign has pushed his party to reassess its decision to join Russian President Boris Yeltsin's Agreement on Obtaining Civil Accord in Russia. The pact, signed in April by some 200 leading Russian politicians, aimed to establish temporary groundrules to limit confrontation in domestic politics and stabilize the country. Signatories to the accord undertook not to call for early elections, not to amend the new constitution for the time being and to refrain from violating the constitution in their political activities. Zhirinovskiy's party signed the accord after several weeks of hesitating.
