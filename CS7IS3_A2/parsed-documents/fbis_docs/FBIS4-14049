As recalled, in reply to a question posed by an IDF radio correspondent, the Iranian foreign minister denied that any Israeli prisoners are being held on Iranian soil. Iran is now officially denying that its foreign minister ever spoke to a Zionist correspondent. Our correspondent Eyal Eisenstein spoke with Foreign Minister Peres: [Begin recording] [Eisenstein] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres was skeptical with regard to Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati's statements on the issue of the Israeli POW's and MIA's. Yesterday, Peres said that Israel still considers Iran responsible for the fate of captive navigator Ron Arad. [Peres] Iran's word carries no particular weight. Iran has no problem with making up or denying stories, without any foundation. Therefore, regardless of this or that statement, we shall continue to regard Iran as the main party responsible for the fate of Ron Arad. [passage omitted] [end recording]
