The figure also represented a 6.08 percent increase compared with September of this year, the MOEA tallies showed. From January to October 1993, Taiwan received a total of US$71.13 billion worth of foreign orders, a growth of 6.25 percent over the same period of 1992. MOEA attributed the increase in October foreign orders to increasing foreign demand.
