David Messman, Branch Chief, at (202) 272&hyph;3018 (Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. Applicant is a diversified open-end management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation. On August 22, 1985, applicant filed a notification of registration pursuant to section 8(a) of the Act and a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement became effective on March 27, 1986, and applicant commenced its initial public offering on that same date. 2. On July 16, 1993, applicant's board of directors approved a plan of reorganization whereby applicant agreed to transfer all of its assets and liabilities to the Value Equity Fund portfolio of Core Funds, Inc. (the ``Acquiring Fund''), in exchange for Series B shares of the Acquiring Fund. In accordance with rule 17a&hyph;8 of the Act, applicant's directors determined that the sale of applicant's assets to the Acquiring Fund was in the best interest of applicant's shareholders, and that the interests of the existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result. 1 1 Applicant and the Acquiring Fund may be deemed to be affiliated persons of each other by reason of having a common investment adviser. Although purchases and sales between affiliated persons generally are prohibited by section 17(a) of the Act, rule 17a&hyph;8 provides an exemption for certain purchases and sales among investment companies that are affiliated persons of each other solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers. 3. In approving the reorganization, the directors considered various factors, including, (a) the low asset size and consequent high expense ratios of applicant, (b) limited investment flexibility due to applicant's small asset size, (c) the compatibility of applicant's investment objectives and practices with those of the Acquiring Fund, (d) the potential of enhanced investment performance, greater flexibility, and increased stability due to larger asset size, and (e) economies of scale to be realized primarily with respect to fixed expenses. 4. Proxy materials soliciting shareholder approval of the reorganization were distributed to applicant's shareholders on or about October 4, 1993. Preliminary and definitive copies of the proxy materials were filed with the SEC. Applicant's shareholders approved the reorganization, in accordance with Maryland law, at a special meeting held on November 2, 1993. 5. As of November 26, 1993 (the ``Closing Date''), applicant had 330,695 shares of common stock outstanding with an aggregate net asset value of $3,977,614, and a per share net asset value of $12.03. On the Closing Date, applicant transferred all of its assets to the Acquiring Fund in exchange for Series B shares of the Acquiring Fund having a net asset value equal to the value of the assets of applicant, subject to its liabilities. The shares received in exchange for applicant's assets were distributed to applicant's shareholders on a pro rata basis. 6. The expenses in connection with the reorganization consisted of legal, accounting, printing, and administrative expenses totalling approximately $55,500. These expenses were borne by applicant and the Acquiring Fund, with applicant's share of the expenses totalling approximately $24,000. 7. As of the date of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceedings. Applicant is not presently engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
