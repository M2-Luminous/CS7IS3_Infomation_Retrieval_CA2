FR941206-1-00080 FR941206-1-00007 The initial and continuous compliance methods for sources using control devices are identified in §§63.804(f)(4) and (f)(6) and (g)(4) and (g)(6) of the proposed rule and are generally consistent with previous regulations developed by the Agency. Therefore, the rationale for selection of these requirements is not discussed in great detail here. For example, the proposed rule requires the same type of monitoring parameters for a source using a thermal incinerator as those required by §63.114 of the HON (57 FR 62608). A source must determine the HAP emission rate using EPA Reference Method 18, and during the test set the minimum combustion temperature that corresponds to compliance with the standards. Subsequent operation at a combustion temperature lower than this value constitutes a violation of the rule. Special compliance provisions have been included for catalytic incinerators equipped with a fluidized bed and for carbon adsorbers. The compliance provisions for catalytic incinerators equipped with a fluidized bed are consistent with those currently in use by the only facility in the source category equipped with such a device. These provisions have proven successful in demonstrating compliance for this facility, so EPA has agreed to adopt these provisions for this category. However, they should not be adopted as compliance measures by other source categories without a thorough evaluation. In this proposed rule, compliance monitoring is identified only for incinerators and carbon adsorbers because other types of control devices are not likely to be used for compliance. If an alternate control device is used by an affected source, the rule includes provisions for proposing appropriate compliance monitoring to the Administrator. The proposed rule also recognizes that the overall control efficiency of a control system does not depend only on the destruction efficiency of the device but on the capture efficiency as well. The capture efficiency is the ratio of the quantity of pollutants entering the control device to the quantity of pollutants emitted from the emission source. The overall control efficiency is the product of the capture and control efficiency. The proposed rule identifies the methods to be used to determine the capture efficiency initially, and the monitoring required to demonstrate that this efficiency is continuously maintained. The provisions contained in the proposed rule are the same as those in the NESHAP for the magnetic tape industry (59 FR 11662), which was proposed on March 11, 1994. Owners or operators of a source to which the capture efficiency provisions apply are encouraged to review the magnetic tape preamble and rule to understand the rationale for selecting the capture efficiency provisions. As previously stated, most affected sources are expected to comply with the proposed rule by using compliant materials. Initial and on-going compliance for these sources are demonstrated through reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
