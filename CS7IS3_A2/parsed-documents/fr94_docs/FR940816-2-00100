FR940816-2-00100 FR940816-2-00077 In addition, the licensee has demonstrated an ongoing commitment to support and maintain its emergency preparedness program. In the last 18 months, the licensee has conducted five full-scale drills and a medical drill, and conducted an annual partial participation exercise in July 1993. On December 25, 1993, an accident occurred at the facility which resulted in the declaration of an Alert. There was a catastrophic failure of the turbine generator which caused a reactor scram, a fire, and significant damage to the turbine auxiliary systems. During the event, the licensee implemented its Fermi 2 emergency plan and activated a portion of its emergency response organization, including the technical support center, operations support center, and alternate operations support center. The AIT (augmented inspected team) report covering the event and the response to the event identified some problems with the licensee's ability to classify the event and perform personnel accountability. In response to these findings, the licensee has performed additional training in the simulator, modified and revised procedures, and conducted an integrated onsite drill on June 8, 1994, to verify the plant staff's capability to classify an event and to demonstrate personnel accountability. In its letter requesting an exemption, Detroit Edison included letters from the two surrounding counties and the State of Michigan. All three letters concurred with the licensee's request as long as the licensee will continue to support the September 1994 offsite exercise. FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) Headquarters and FEMA Region V have reviewed the request and agree with the position taken by the State and local officials. The licensee has committed to support the State and local support agencies by providing communication links, scenario data and interface staff at the JPIC (joint public information center). IV Based on a consideration of the facts presented in Section III above, the NRC staff finds that the following factors support the granting of the requested exemption: a. The licensee demonstrated adequate response to the December 25, 1993, turbine-generator failure event. b. FEMA, State and local agencies have indicated agreement with the proposed exercise exemption for 1994. c. The licensee has a strong emergency preparedness program, as indicated by its last two SALP ratings. It has supported its program with a continuing series of drills to maintain its performance levels. In response to the AIT inspection and the concerns in the area of event classification and accountability, the licensee has instituted additional training, revised its procedures, and held an integrated drill on June 8, 1994, to demonstrate its ability to classify an event and account for its staff during an emergency. d. The licensee has committed to support the State and local agencies in their September 1994 offsite exercise by supplying scenario data, communication links and staffing for the JPIC. e. The licensee will conduct a utility-only exercise in July 1995. The requested exemption is a one-time event, which will result in cancelling the partial participation exercise scheduled for September 1994 and rescheduling a utility-only exercise in July 1995. The exemption will relieve the licensee of the resource burden of conducting an exercise while trying to repair the damage to the facility and return the plant to service. Based on the factors considered above, the Commission has concluded that granting the proposed exemption will not result in a decrease in the effectiveness of the licensee's emergency preparedness program. The special circumstances for granting this exemption pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12 have also been identified. As stated in part in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v), special circumstances are present when the exemption would provide only temporary relief from the applicable regulation and the licensee has made a good faith effort to comply with the regulation. The licensee has made a good faith effort to comply with the regulations by conducting the required full-participation exercises at Fermi 2 with the State and local government agencies since 1985. The licensee has taken into consideration the various concerns of FEMA and the local governments by supporting the September exercise being conducted by the State and local governments. All affected parties support the proposed exercise schedule change. Granting the proposed exemption provides a one-time only relief from the requirement of 10 CFR 50, Appendix E, Section IV.F.3. Therefore, the Commission concludes that special circumstances are present. V Accordingly, the NRC has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2), the exemption requested by the licensee's letter of April 19, 1994, as supplemented June 23, 1994, is authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common defense and security. The NRC further determines that special circumstances as provided in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v) are present justifying the exemption. Therefore, the NRC hereby approves the following exemption: Fermi 2 is exempt from the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix E, Section IV.F.3, for the conduct of a partial participation emergency preparedness exercise in 1994, provided that a utility-only exercise be conducted by July 1995. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the NRC has determined that the granting of this exemption will have no significant effect on the quality of human environment (59 FR 40626). This exemption is effective upon issuance. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 10th day of August 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Jack W. Roe, Director, Division of Reactor Projects III/VI, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20007 Filed 8&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M
