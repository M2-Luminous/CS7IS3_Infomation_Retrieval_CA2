In concrete terms, the aim is to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo and to unblock Srebrenica, as well as Tuzla airport. Laurent Boussie reports: [Boussie] The French are satisfied. Bosnia, which was not on the agenda of this summit, was in fact at the core of the talks. The signature of the Americans, their commitment to support the European peace plan, the contribution by the 16 countries of the alliance to the implementation of this plan, and their support to the United Nations for its action in Bosnia are all positive elements that were not on the agenda at the beginning of this summit. There is a firm commitment behind these diplomatic gestures: In two specific cases, Srebrenica and Tuzla, the use of force is not only being considered, it is almost planned. [Begin Juppe recording] The Twelve of the European Union [EU] have requested it [?the use of force] on several occasions, and I did the same myself strongly when I met Mr. Karadzic in Geneva, and later on in Brussels; the Serbs have refused. We are now deciding to go ahead all the same. [end recording] [passage omitted]
