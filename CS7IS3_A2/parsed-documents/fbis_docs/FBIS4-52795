On 10 May, Mr. Kantor spoke highly of measures the Japanese Government has taken for individual sectors. In response, the Japanese Government is paying attention to his attitude change. The issue of reforming the current tax system is the key to resuming the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, but it remains unclear how the current tax system will be reformed. As the U.S. Government is showing "a notable change" in its response to measures taken by the Japanese Government, the Japanese Government will explore ways to resume the stalled framework talks before the Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled for early July by making constant informal contacts with the U.S. Government through various channels. What Japanese officials in charge of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are noticing is that since late April when the Hata government was inaugurated, the U.S. Government has begun showing a notable change. The U.S. trade representative decided to postpone imposing sanctions against Japan over the Japanese Government's procurement in accordance with the Omnibus Trade Act. During a 3 May television interview, President Clinton stated: "The United States will not seek a numerical market share or managed trade." During a 9 May telephone conversation with Prime Minister Hata, the President stressed the need for both Japan and the United States to work for resuming the stalled framework talks. Commenting on the U.S. moves, Japanese officials in charge of the framework talks said: "The U.S. Government has made such moves out of consideration for the new government in Japan. The U.S. Government has been concerned with the dollar's devaluation and the drop in stocks and bonds prices. The mood may be building within the U.S. Government for a need to alter the hard-line trade policy toward Japan, which the U.S. trade representative has thus far upheld." A U.S. Government official visited Japan this week for a meeting with influential Japanese business leaders. During the meeting, he told the Japanese business leaders: "I hope you will visit Washington. If you visit, then you will find how the U.S. Government has changed its trade stance toward Japan." Commenting on the change in the U.S. trade stance toward Japan, a senior Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] official welcomed the change by saying: "I assume the U.S. Government has realized at long last that no matter how hard it pressures Japan, it cannot wring concessions from its demands for numerical targets." MITI even goes so far as to say: "The focal point of individual sectors has reached a point where the two countries will have to reach a set of agreements which will allow the United States to save face." A Japanese official in charge of the framework talks, said: During the informal contacts with the Japanese Government, "The U.S. Government has consistently expressed the hope that Japan will do something with its macroeconomic policy." The Hata government holds a minority in the Diet and this makes it unclear how the Hata government will formulate a macroeconomic policy aimed at reforming the current tax system and adding the planned amount for public works projects at the end of June. There are no wide differences between Japan and the United States over macroeconomic policy. American officials, who attach importance to macroeconomic policy, are gaining influence in the U.S. Government. This development will serve as a positive factor in resuming the stalled framework talks. It can be said that a climate has been created for resuming the stalled framework talks during a time when the Japanese Government has continued to do nothing because of political turmoil. A senior Foreign Ministry official, however, makes a wary response to U.S. Government moves by saying: "Basically, the Clinton administration pursues a trade-result policy. I wonder whether the U.S. Government has really made a `notable change' in its trade stance toward Japan. We need to be sure the areas of agreement have actually surfaced between Japan and the United States. Once the framework talks have been resumed, it will be impermissible for the two countries to break them off again." During the April meeting with (then) Foreign Minister Hata, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor set three conditions for resuming the stalled framework talks, which included: 1) a macroeconomic policy, 2) overall targets for opening the Japanese market, and 3) establishment of an objective criteria. For the time being, the Japanese Government will notify the U.S. Government of its responses to the three conditions through the informal contacts and then seek responses from the U.S. Government.
