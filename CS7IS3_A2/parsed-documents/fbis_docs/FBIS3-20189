He assumes that the deported criminals would not be tortured or killed in their homeland, Kinkel said after an FDP [Free Democratic Party] Presidium session in Berlin today. In Germany consideration is currently being given to an agreement with Turkey on the deportation of Kurdish extremists. No decision has however yet been made. The Turkish Government has already given an assurance that German weapons would not be used in internal disputes with the Kurds and its party, the PKK. Since he became foreign minister there has only been "five or six cases" where the German Government has had doubts about the implementation of that agreement, Kinkel said.
