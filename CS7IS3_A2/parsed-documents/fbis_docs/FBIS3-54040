At the beginning of the meeting, his excellency the leader president explained the reasons for increasing the state's purchasing prices of wheat and rice crops from farmers, especially at an early stage of the agricultural season. His excellency said: The announcement of the price increases will encourage farmers to pay more attention to fertilization, irrigation, and the use of pesticides, which will increase the agricultural crop and will show farmers a clear horizon to reassure them about the fate of their products after harvesting. His excellency said that it is a national, economic, and technical duty of every one in this stage--a duty which will remain a priority in the future--to continue to encourage farmers to increase their production because agriculture provides food for citizens. He said that providing food and persisting in efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in food is a vital part of national security that it should be followed up with interest. His excellency said that it is not a luxury for us to decide to increase the states' purchasing prices of the basis agricultural crops. It is necessary to study the increase in the state's purchasing prices for other crops, such as corn, and industrial products. In light of the instructions of the leader president, may God preserve him, it has been decided to increase the purchasing prices of wheat and barley for the current agricultural season as follows: 1. Wheat: The current price of 1 tonne of first-class wheat is 5,000 dinars. The new price of 1 tonne is 8,000 dinars. The current price of 1 tonne of coarse wheat is 4,750 dinars. The new price of 1 tonne is 7,500 dinars. Regarding other kinds, the current price of 1 tonne is 4,500 dinars. The new price of 1 tonne is 7,000 dinars. 2. Barley: The current price of 1 tonne is 2,500 dinars. The new price of 1 tonne is 4,000 dinars. The joint meeting of the RCC and the Council of Ministers then discussed the current budget and the investment plan for 1994. In this regard, the leader president stressed commitment to the requirements of the march, which will be crowned with victory, God willing, if the ministries do not confuse the immediate and existing projects and services with medium or long-range goals. His excellency said: What is important is that we should remain effective and manage our resources well in this stage, and that after this stage, new and wide horizons will be opened for us, God willing. His excellency also explained that the importance of this stage comes from the fact that the evil aggressors have been exposed as boring and illogical before the whole. Therefore, continuing to exert our utmost energy in production; in maintaining machines, equipment, and material; and fighting dissipation will increase the people's patience and steadfastness. Decreasing expenditures in building and operating projects, as well as choosing the least costly ways and alternatives will mean an increase in the Iraqi dinar's value, regardless of the size of the increase. The minister or the manager, who succeeds in reducing the cost of a 1 billion dinar project to 450 million dinars, for example, will feel the sweetness of this result because he, in fact, will have contributed to defending the homeland and the people. His excellency also stressed the importance of increasing transportation energy this year, as it is important in transporting agricultural crops, industrial products, and workers in all sectors. At the end of the discussions, the meeting endorsed the current budget and the investment plan for 1994. The joint meeting was attended by several technical cadres of the industrial sector.
