SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said he will call on Hata, hopefully Wednesday [22 June], to discuss the SDP's policy platform, adopted late Tuesday, and the party's possible return to the ruling coalition. The SDP, the second largest opposition party, will not submit a no-confidence vote during the course of talks, whose outcome should determine the survival of Hata's two-month-old cabinet, Murayama said. Meanwhile, the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) decided the same day to formalize the party policy of submitting a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet after the long-overdue fiscal 1994 budget clears the last Diet hurdle on Thursday. With the opposition camp raising the ante through their political maneuvering, the ruling coalition extended its own overture to the SDP to rejoin their camp, officially proposing talks to the socialists. The coalition is pinning hopes on its efforts to woo the SDP back into their group in order to defeat the LDP's planned no-confidence vote. The SDP platform has been welcomed by both the ruling coalition and the LDP, which is seeking to create a stopgap cabinet with the SDP through early elections. The SDP policy outline calls for making the policy-making process within the coalition more "democratic" and proposes a tax reform centered on raising indirect taxes. The party stormed out of the ruling coalition in April in a row over a move by some coalition partners to create a new Diet bloc without the socialists, which the SDP viewed as an attempt to put them on the back-seat in policy making. The outline also urges passage in the next Diet session of the bills for redrawing the electoral map for a new election system of single-seat constituencies combined with proportional representation for the House of Representatives, to replace the current multi-seat system. Ruling coalition lawmakers immediately showed a readiness to embrace the SDP proposals. "At first sight, there are no problems (with the platform)," said a top government official. A senior official of Komeito [Clean Government Party], a key component of the coalition, concurred, saying, "the hurdles (for an agreement) are not high. The proposals show (the SDP) is seriously thinking about returning to the coalition." The SDP's government blueprint also met a welcome from the LDP, which needs the socialists' support to pass the no-confidence vote. "The contents (of the proposals) are nothing that we have to refuse at the negotiating table," a senior party policy maker said. "No obstacles exist to our acceptance," another senior official said. Even if the ruling coalition and the socialists agree to link up again, it remains unclear whether Hata will retain office due to disarray within the SDP. SDP lawmakers who support Murayama called first for Hata's resignation, and a no-confidence motion if Hata should refuse the call. On the other hand, SDP right-wingers led by Wataru Kubo, the party's secretary general, are placing top priority on a return to the ruling camp and are reluctant about demanding that Hata step down before the results of the realliance talks become clear.
