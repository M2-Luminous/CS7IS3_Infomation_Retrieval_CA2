"In my opinion, they are ethno-religious ones," he said in an interview for MLADA FRONTA DNES during yesterday's flight to Ankara, where he was headed on an official visit. [Palata] What is the most important point in your proposal? [Baudys] The essence of my plan is an attempt to find a way of ending the war that ensures that the fighting does not break out again. The means that peace must be associated with disarmament. All of the warring parties must simply be given unequivocal guarantees that the conflict will be resolved in such a way that none of them can feel at a disadvantage. The solution must be acceptable to everyone; this should be guaranteed by the states allied with the individual sides in the conflict. It is important that police units and not troops provide direct protection. We do not know the solution to the conflict yet, but we want to stop the war. The aim of my proposal is to seek a solution and to give the warring sides guarantees that this will proceed in a just and responsible manner. [Palata] Did you consult anyone on your initiative? [Baudys] I did not consult anyone, apart from a group of my closest friends, who took part in formulating the proposal with me. I did not consult anyone in the government, parliament, or other parties for the simple reason that the decision on whether this initiative is accepted must be made by those authorized to do so--the UN Security Council and representatives of the NATO countries. I did not consider a discussion on the domestic political level to be appropriate. [Palata] Do you think that the European Union's peace plan could form the basis for a solution? [Baudys] It is certainly a good plan, although I do not have enough information to be able to say responsibly what is better and what is not. I submitted this initiative in order to broaden the spectrum of possible solutions. [Palata] Disarming the warring sides is the first point in your plan. How do you intend to achieve this? [Baudys] My proposal does not envisage disarming the warring sides in the form of a NATO ultimatum; it banks on guarantees from the Goodwill Committee and on the agreement of the warring sides. [Palata] Should the Czech Republic also take part in the work of the Goodwill Committee? [Baudys] I think the Security Council must make this decision. I do not think, however, that it would be feasible for the Czech Republic to send its units to resolve this conflict. The situation may develop the other way round. It may turn out that my initiative will be rejected because it proves to be unimplementable. I have merely tried to find a way to a solution.
