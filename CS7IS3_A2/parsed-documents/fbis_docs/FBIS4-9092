"I am satisfied with the apology and the admission that I was right, after all," Walesa said. During the meeting with the SLD group, its leader, Aleksander Kwasniewski, had acknowledged that the president was the author of the citizens' constitutional initiative. "I am not saying this in order to fight, in order to prove who was better. It is good that we have removed one of the problems that makes cooperation possible," the president added. Lech Walesa said there had been no concessions on either side; there was the logic of facts and "a logic that said that a platform for talks has to be found." Answering a question from journalists on what he had won as a result of the meeting, Walesa replied, "I do not want to win anything for myself; I want to win peace, calm, and a good solution for Poland, and this has been achieved for today, it seems. There will be no tinkering with the Small Constitution, there will be no attempt on the powers of parliament and the president. We are left with work." Asked by journalists if he accepts the coalition's aim of putting its representatives into the posts of deputy ministers in the ministries subordinate to him--Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, and National Defense--the president recalled the plan by Foreign Ministry head Olechowski, under which the political structures in his ministry would be made separate from the organizational structures, staffed by professionals. "If the coalition accepts that plan and brings it into those three ministries, I have nothing against that," Walesa said, adding that the agreement of the ministries concerned would, of course, be essential. "If need be, of course--yes," the president said in answer to a question on whether he will soon meet representatives of the coalition. He added that, "for today," he does not see such a need. In the president's opinion, a suitable forum for this type of regular meeting in the future would be the National Security Council. Walesa announced that he would soon be visiting all of Poland's provinces. The president denied that this is to be the beginning of his election campaign. "Encouraging people to take part in the local self-government elections, to make good election choices, that is not an election campaign, it is helping all those people who take the good of Poland seriously."
