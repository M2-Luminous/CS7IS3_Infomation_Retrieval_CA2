The specifics of producing the majority of microbial synthesis products, including the production of feed proteins, involve the fact that during their growth process, microorganisms utilize oxygen, the source of which is, as a rule, air, which is released to the atmosphere after it has passed through the reactor. The traditional scheme for producing microbial synthesis products includes a bioreactor (fermenter), air processing equipment, and equipment for purifiying the gas exiting the reactor. Air processing equipment is intended for purifying gas of solid and harmful gaseous contaminants, compressing and condensing air, separating condensed moisture, and sterilization. Equipment for purifying gas exiting the reactor is intended for trapping aerosols. As a rule, wet or dry filters are used for this. However, wet filters have a low purification effectiveness, and dry fabric filters, while they are relatively highly effective, have a high hydraulic resistance and require frequent regeneration or filter element changes, which makes it impossible to maintain sterility in the production space. Due to the large volume of air that passes through the reactor per unit time (5000 - 3 m[.sup]3[/]/hr), which results in a low level of oxygen removal from the air (no greater than 15%), and the need to mix the liquid medium, equipment for processing and purifying air is significantly large. In such a manner, the creation of ecologically pure technology allows one to overcome problems that have arisen and to give new momentum to the development of microbial synthesis. The basic principle of creating ecological pure technologies lies in organizing a closed cycle, which is accomplished by capturing the carbon dioxide evolved in the reactor by means of sorption methods and returning the purfied gas to the reactor after adding the required amount of oxygen to it. In this case, total oxygen utilization is achieved, whereas in a traditional apparatus, losses of oxygenated air are unavoidable, which leads to high air and energy consumption. The absorption of carbon dioxide from spent gas can be accomplished by chemical or physical sorption. In this case, the need for equipment to process air and biologically purify it after exit from the reactor drops. A diagram of the equipment that carry out an ecologically pure method for producing microbial synthesis products with the application of chemical sorption of carbon dioxide from the gas after its use in the reactor is presented in fig. 1. Such a method for organizing the purification of spent gas leads to additional costs associated with chemisorbent consumption and the need to reprocess or neutralize reaction products. Organization of the closed cycle with the application of physical sorption of carbon dioxide assumes regeneration of the absorber (monoethanolamine) and generation of carbon dioxide, which is widely used in various industrial sectors. A diagram of equipment intended for producing microbial synthesis products with physical sorption of carbon dioxide from the gaseous mixture is presented in fig. 2. Regardless of the apparent prospects of technology for producing microbial synthesis products by organizing a closed gas cycle based on chemical or physical sorption of carbon dioxide, additional expenditures will be required with its implementation that are associated with creating equipment for producing pure oxygen and with the need to regenerate the sorbent or to utilize products formed as a result of chemical sorption of carbon dioxide. Therefore, there is definite interest in a combined method where microorganisms that utilize oxygen and give off carbon dioxide in their life processes are cultured with microorganisms that utilize carbon dioxide and give off oxygen. For example, combined culturing of Candida scottii yeast and chlorella, whose biomass may be used as a feed additive, has been conducted. A diagram of equipment for combined production of C. scotii yeast and chlorella is presented in fig. 3. Such a method allows one to organize ecologically pure and absolutely waste-free production of microbial synthesis products with a significant reduction in the equipment required for this task, as well as in capital and operational expenditures. The achievement of ecologically pure methods of conducting microbial synthesis assumes the use of high-efficiency reactors capable of processing highly concentrated nutrient media with low air (gas) and energy consumption.
