Now I want to ask you whether it is true that you did not want to take the post of chief cabinet secretary? [Kumagai] It is true. [Tahara] So, you took the post reluctantly. [Kumagai] I did not want to assume this important post at a time when the nation is in difficult times. I experienced neurasthenia for the first time. [Tahara] To tell you the truth, we also think that you are fit to be the international trade and industry minister. Because Finance Minister Fujii has been retained in the same post, we also thought you would be retained as the international trade and industry minister. How come you have been appointed as chief cabinet secretary? [Kumagai] Well, this would not have happened if the Social Democratic Party of Japan had remained in the coalition. With the reduced number of members, the ruling coalition has to deal not only with party affairs but also cabinet tasks. So, it was inevitable for me to accept the post. [Tahara] Some reporters told me that Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa has sent you to the cabinet as his other self. Is this true? [Kumagai] I am often called an aide to Mr. Ozawa. I was when I and Mr. Ozawa were in the same faction. But now I argue with him and sometimes oppose what he says. Subjectively speaking, I am not his aide. But because I have worked with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata for a long time, I can say I serve as a bridge between Ozawa and Hata. [Tahara] Mr. Ozawa is often criticized as being dictatorial and for his arbitrary decision-making together with [Komeito Secretary General] Yuichi Ichikawa. Is what has been said about him true? [Kumagai] I think there are some points in his political style that he should reflect on. But what has been said about him is untrue. He is a poor talker and not a careful tactician. He usually makes a frontal attack. He does not conduct behind-the-scenes negotiations, even when we expect him to do so. [Tahara] Some say he is slovenly. [Kumagai] Rather than calling him slovenly, I would say he can do no more than making a frontal attack. [Tahara] So he is like a baseball pitcher who can throw only a fast ball? [Kumagai] Yes, he is just like a pitcher who can throw only a fast ball at the speed of 170 km three times and does nothing else the rest of the game. [Tahara] I would like to ask about the uproar caused by the formation of the parliamentary group "Kaishin." When the SDPJ secretary general appeared on this program recently, I asked him whether Ozawa and Komeito's Ichikawa really make decisions arbitrarily in the coalition. Kubo's answer was no. So I thought Kubo was on good terms with Ozawa. Do you not think the uproar would not have occurred if Ozawa had made just one call to Kubo? [Kumagai] I do not know. We had only a vague idea that a new parliamentary group might be gradually formed toward the end of the current Diet session. We thought if the formation of a new group was planned that day, only small parties would come together and announce the formation of Kaishin. But things progressed before we knew what was happening. [Tahara] I also thought only the Democratic Socialist Party and the Japan New Party would participate in the group. [Kumagai] In his political concept, Mr. Ozawa has the desire to form two major political forces and then establish a two-party system. Because an unexpected person moved to form the group, I think Mr. Ozawa lost control of himself and took the opportunity. [Tahara] So he is careless. (laughing) [Kumagai] Yes, I think he is. [Tahara] That is one thing I wanted to ask you today. In connection with our earlier discussion, the fact is the ruling parties hold only one-third of the lower house seats and only one-fourth of the upper house seats. The cabinet is very much a minority administration. Some term this a caretaker government for the next election, or for the passage of the budget. How do you intend to carry on? [Kumagai] This is not what we originally planned. If we had enough time, we would have engaged in more patient persuasion of the SDPJ and Sakigake to remain in the coalition. It is a shame, because we had agreed on Hata as prime minister, although there was a procedural fault; we also reached a basic agreement on policy. It would have been merely a question of how to start with a clean slate to make up for the procedural mistake, and it would have been necessary to work by all means to persuade them to return to the coalition. However, the Diet session had been suspended due to various issues. Then the air crash occurred in Nagoya, the budget remained untouched, and nothing was being done about the economy which was starting to show initial signs of recovery. Many things were left undone. This affected the people's livelihood. Thus, in a sense we had to take off because of the time limit. I personally believe that although the SDPJ is saying it is impossible for them to return to the coalition since agreements have been reached on basic policies, based on this policy accord and on the consensus that Hata is the right man we need to keep our door open and work to tenaciously persuade them to return to the coalition. There is also deliberation on the budget. We need to continue to discuss tax reform. It is important to close the gap in our discussion process. [Tahara] If you intend to bring Sakigake [Harbinger] and the SDPJ back into the coalition, would it not have been better to give them ministerial posts? [Kumagai] Oh, no. If we do that.... [Tahara, interrupting] For instance, Komeito and Shinseito hold many cabinet posts. Are some of them not just temporary occupants [kuseki join] of these positions who will make way for returning SDPJ and Sakigake cabinet members? [Kumagai] No, that is not the case. [Tahara] A number of them do not seem to be competent. [Kumagai] In the event they come back, we will have to reshuffle the cabinet. [Tahara] A reshuffle? [Kumagai] I am not talking about any particular person. With regard to the budget, the SDPJ and Sakigake say they will cooperate because they took part in formulating it. They say they will cooperate in passing budget-related bills. Once the budget is passed, we will have to engage in preparatory discussions and lay the groundwork for asking them back. [Tahara] I think they will cooperate. They will probably cooperate in passing the draft budget because the SDPJ also took part in formulating it. It is said the Diet will be dissolved after approving the budget. As a matter of fact, a survey conducted by Voice Inc. [name as heard] shows many people want the Diet to be dissolved. Of course, if the Diet is dissolved, an election will be held under the new election system. Do you agree? [Kumagai] Of course. All preparations have been made. Members of the deliberation panel [the electoral redistricting panel on new constituency boundaries for the House of Representatives] were selected in April. As far as the system is concerned, we are supposed to start Diet deliberations on the redistricting bills within six months of the members being selected. However, the agreement among the ruling parties, including the SDPJ, says they will try to enact the redistricting bills during the current Diet session. It is said that procedures to enact the bills take time. However, we are having endless discussions compared to the discussions the LDP had during the Kaifu administration. We are preparing ourselves to listen to the opinions of local cities. The next step is to map out fundamental ideas needed to enact the bills. Once we have this yardstick, then the remaining problems will be technical matters. All we have to do is to actually rezone the precincts according to the plan. It is not a dream at all to start Diet deliberations during the current Diet session if the members of the working group work energetically. [Tahara] Suppose an election is held under the new system. When do you think is the earliest it will be held? [Kumagai] We can hold it around July. [Tahara] What? Masuzoe, would you listen to this for a moment? Do you think an election can be held in July? [Masuzoe] It can be done if we want. [Kumagai] It is not something we can force. [Tahara] I mean, if it is possible. [Kumagai] Our fundamental understanding is that the current Diet session will end on 29 July. The coalition and the SDPJ have had discussions and have agreed to complete its deliberations during the current Diet session. [Tahara] Does it mean the current Diet session may be extended? Will it be extended in order to rezone the precincts? [Kumagai] It will cause problems if a government official says such things. What I mean to say is that it is possible if we can reach an agreement. [Tahara] Is it possible to extend the Diet session? [Kumagai] Yes. [Tahara] Would you like to pass redistricting bills even if you have to extend the term of the current Diet session? [Kumagai] As you know, Tsutomu Hata became chairman of the Election System Research Council when the Kaifu administration was inaugurated following the Recruit scandal. In other words, he was the first LDP member who stood up for the reform. [Tahara] You mean election system reform? [Kumagai] Yes. That was his starting point. To Tsutomu Hata, adoption of redistricting bills will put an end to his quest. [Tahara] It has to end. [Kumagai] He has to complete what he started to talk about in front of the people, otherwise he cannot rest. [Tahara] Let me go back to what we were discussing earlier. Do you think July is too early, even if relevant bills are approved by extending the term of the current Diet session? Masuzoe said earlier the election would be held in September. [Masuzoe] An election has to be held within six months. Initially, three months was required for public notification. Six months plus three months is nine months. However, nobody needs a three-month notification because people watch TV. They will know it right away. Also, there are 300 seats in total. There will be no change in the total number of seats; only minor changes are needed. If you make a change in one district, then you have to make a change in other districts. The council can inform us about new constituency boundaries tomorrow if we ask them to. [Tahara] This means that an election, no matter how soon it may be held, can be held under the new election system. [Masuzone] There will be no problem at all from a legal point of view. [Kumagai] Masuzone is quite right. However, it is necessary for the panel members to come up with a yardstick, or to listen to the opinions of local autonomies once again. They need to fulfill the minimum requirements. Therefore, it is impossible for them to submit the bills in May. They need to work hard for a certain period of time. Moreover, politicians' opinions should be reflected in the bills, otherwise the bill will never be approved. [Tahara] I have a feeling half of the politicians do not want political reform. [Kumagai] It is more than half. [Tahara] More than half of the politicians? [Kumagai] Including myself. [Tahara] Are you saying you are included in the half of the politicians who do not want political reform? [Kumagai] No, I am not. I mean to say that I benefited from the election system for medium precincts. This is an imaginary destruction. In other words, we grudgingly agreed and pledged to the people that we would make changes by destroying the election system for medium precincts. We should be ashamed if we break that promise. [Masuzoe] Is it possible to pass redistricting bills before approving the budget? [Kumagai] Theoretically, it is possible. [Masuzoe] That means you can insist on saying you cannot pass the budget unless redistricting bills are approved. [Kumagai] Well, I cannot say that. The Diet, which will begin on Monday, will be turned upside down if I said that. [laughing] I have to remain cool as much as possible. [Tahara] The Hata administration is determined to approve the budget and redistricting bills during the current Diet session even at the risk of extending the Diet session. [Kumagai] The Hata cabinet has to enact by all means the 1994 budget bill and the bills on new constituency boundaries during the current Diet session. [Tahara] Do we still have enough time? We do? There is another thing I would like to talk about. It's about the Korean peninsula issue. I hope a war will not break out on the Korean peninsula. However, how is Japan going to deal with an emergency situation? The Japanese people think about this issue. UN Forces or the U.S. military will be dispatched if war breaks out. Well, the foreign minister said today on another TV program that we need to change various things in order to deal with such an emergency. Do you think we need to make legal preparations? What do you think? [Kumagai] Well, the foreign minister.... [Tahara, interrupting] He was referring to the Self-Defense Force Law. He was talking about the possibility of revising the law. [Kumagai] Well, regarding the Self-Defense Law, a bill was already submitted to the Diet. We went through a bitter experience. [Tahara] Some are asking what Japan can do. Some say we should introduce a law only for a limited period of time. As a matter of fact, Komeito's Secretary General Yuuichi Ichikawa said during this program last week that we should take legislative actions. What do you think, Kumagai? [Kumagai] The Hosokawa administration said Japan will act within the scope of the Constitution. The administration did not say within the scope of laws because.... [Tahara, interrupting] This means new laws can be introduced. [Kumagai] That is correct. We have to do that as a matter of course. However, negotiations on the North Korean issue are coming to the final stage. The UN is trying to settle the issue peacefully on the basis of the UNSC statement. Negotiations with the DPRK are entering their final stage. Judging from the tacit rules of the International Atomic Energy Agency, it is not a good idea at this stage to threaten the DPRK by hinting at the possibility of taking military action. I think we should prudently deal with the issue. However, we have to prepare ourselves for various cases, and this is another story. It is true that the government has studied necessary measures. [Tahara] Masuzoe, what do you think about this issue? Do you have any opinions? [Masuzoe] For example, in case we need to rescue Japanese citizens living abroad, the issue of revising the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] Law will naturally arise. [Kumagai] A related bill has been submitted to the Diet, but it has not been easy to enact. [Masuzoe] There is also the question of how to deal with "nyukan ho" [the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act] in case refugees come to Japan. Moreover, when the United Nations adopts a resolution calling for sanctions against North Korea, and the sanctions include a ban on remittances to North Korea by "Chosen Soren" [General Association of Korean Residents], will Japan fully implement them? I do not think "gaitame ho" [the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law] is sufficient to that end. If the critical scenario for this situation becomes reality in a month, Japan will not have enough time to deal with these issues. Do you think these issues will cause the cabinet to collapse? [Kosaka] I think it is necessary to form a large coalition government. The current cabinet has the capability of dealing with these issues, or the people would not have empowered the cabinet to do so. This is because the cabinet is a minority administration. I am talking about a possible scenario. Although I do not want to say this, the government should have started making preparations for North Korea's nuclear issue two years ago. Since there is confusion in the administration, it has no choice but to apologize to the public. [Kumagai] Most people, including the Hata cabinet, know what we should do if events occur. They know this well. I am not saying we are studying necessary measures. However, if we spell out our policy during peace time when nothing is happening, this will create much confusion due to the current political situation. However, we understand North Korea is serious and the situation is fast developing into a reality. It is true we are now studying what we should do. Once a consensus is reached, it will be possible for us to establish a crisis control system in a heartbeat. [Tahara] Do you mean that although the government should not talk about such things while nothing is happening, it can properly deal with the situation when something happens? Do you think the government needs to take legislative measures? [Kumagai] To that end, a political procedure is necessary. As you said, since we are minority ruling parties we cannot do everything in haste. After all, the establishment of a political foundation or mainstream thinking will naturally be a precondition for adopting political procedures. [Masuzoe] My opinion runs counter to yours. Because the government has not studied the necessary measures in a cool-headed manner during peace time, including adopting legislation in case of an emergency, there is a possibility that if Japan decides to revise the SDF Law for the purpose of rescuing overseas Japanese, this will worsen relations with South Korea. It is rather dangerous for the government to enact emergency defense legislation when it is terribly upset by a serious situation. If you enact legislation, do you intend to do so without going through the legal formalities? [Kumagai] No, it is impossible for us to violate the law. This issue....[pauses] However, we do not think the situation will suddenly develop into a military collision. What measures the United Nations will take in the future depends on the next moves by North Korea. In dealing with the Gulf war, the United Nations spent almost half a year accumulating its resolutions in a persistent manner, and it gradually reached its final decision while observing Iraqi reaction. While watching developments at the United Nations, we need to appeal to the public regarding necessary measures; the government may need to change its policy depending on these developments. We have created conditions to that end. [Kosaka] It is good to prepare for various scenarios. We should do so during peace time. Therefor we must make preparations now--for example, a measure to rescue Japanese living abroad. But if we cannot do that, we need to accept the situation. Because we have not made preparations so far, it would be better not to enact an emergency legislation. In that case, the government needs to apologize to the United States and the international community for not participating in their actions, and must apologize to those citizens living abroad for being unable to rescue them. If the administration is not supported by the entire nation after making such an apology, it cannot deal with the situation. But I do not think such a scenario will occur. If my expectations are wrong, I will apologize. [laughter] [Tahara] Mr. Kumagai, the issue of the tax system must be considered in addition to the electoral system and budget issues. [Kumagai] This is a major issue. [Tahara] Do you intend to solve the tax issue during the current Diet session? [Kumagai] No, we hope to enact relevant bills by the end of this year. To that end, we need to reach an accord among the ruling parties, including the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which used to be a ruling party. [Tahara] Do you hope to do so by around the end of June? [Kumagai] The current Diet session will end on 29 June. So I mean during the current Diet session. [Tahara] Do you hope to have a general plan for tax reform during the current Diet session? [Kumagai] Yes. [Tahara] Now that the SDPJ has become an opposition party, do you think the SDPJ intends to reach an accord with the coalition? [Kumagai] Like the issue of North Korea, this issue is a major topic of the nine-point policy agreement, which was reached among the ruling parties, including the SDPJ. The SDPJ made bold to make concessions on this issue. There will be various arguments on the details of the agreement. I think we need to solemnly continue our efforts. As such, it is not appropriate for us to promote work by ourselves without consulting with the SDPJ. We need to continue to keep our door open to the SDPJ and to seek its views. While communicating with the SDPJ through such measures, we would like the party to return to its past stance in line with the coalition. [Tahara] Do you need to urge the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] to help as well? [Kumagai] This is a matter of course. An additional clause of the previous bill on special tax reductions stipulated partial reform of the tax system. In a sense, this was the LDP's proposal. For this reason, we need to urge the LDP to cooperate in dealing with this issue. [Tahara] Mr. Kosaka, do you have anything else you want to ask of the new administration? You may make one more request. [Kosaka] Well, no matter what, the administration should not be too hasty. There is an old saying about waiting until the time is ripe, but everyone, including Mr. Ozawa and Mr. Kumagai, seems to have forgotten this. You should think about this. Three months have already passed since February, but in this period there has been commotion over a national welfare tax or a reshuffling of the cabinet. Who would want to [words indistinct] at such a busy time? If they had passed the budget bill and worked out the new electorate divisions during that time, they would be happy right now. The last three months have shown how bad things can turn out to be when you rush things. [Kumagai] Well, they certainly say "walk but do not run." [Tahara] Well, maybe that has something to do with your earlier remarks about Mr. Ozawa's character -- that he is a hasty person... short-tempered. [Kumagai] Well, he is always very direct. [Tahara] You mean throwing fast, straight balls only? [Kumagai] Yes, like he does not like to beat around the bushes. [Tahara] I think you could tell Mr. Ozawa to stop doing this. [Kumagai] Yes, that is right. Not only by myself, but together with Prime Minister Hata. I think this is a question of style. [Tahara] Do you think Prime Minister Hata can do this? [Kumagai] Well, Prime Minister Hata is quite stubborn. As prime minister, he would be the only person who could stand up to Mr. Ozawa's fast balls. When he is really determined -- I am talking about Prime Minister Hata -- then you had better watch out.
