Vytautas Landsbergis told reporters Monday [31 January] that consultants from NATO could have been invited to Lithuania during the signing of the Partnership for Peace program, to reflect on whether Lithuania is safe or not, confronted with Russia's current policy and certain statements of Belarus. The opposition leader said such a visit would enhance Lithuania's security. Landsbergis said Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas' speeches in the West were very cautious and expressed a position on "joint movement" that is soothing to Russia. He said the president's thoughts about a security zone from Vancouver to Vladivostok "resembles explanations by the Russian foreign minister that Partnership for Peace is a Russian, not an American idea."
