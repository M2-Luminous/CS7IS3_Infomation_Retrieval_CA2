Hata told Sadako Ogata, United Nations high commissioner for refugees, that he wants to "positively consider" carrying out the activities based on the law, Foreign Ministry officials said. He made the remarks in response to Ogata's call for Japan to utilize the law in the humanitarian field to solve problems concerning refugees, the officials said. Neither Hata nor Ogata specified the regions that might recieve such Japanese assistance, they said. Tokyo is likely to study possible humanitarian assistance for the former Yugoslavia, such as in the medical field and in rescuing and repatriating refugees, after a government fact-finding team returns from the region. The mission, which is to leave Japan later in the day, is to visit areas such as Zagreb, Skopje, Sarajevo and Belgrade. The members are scheduled to meet Yasushi Akashi, head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the former Yugoslavia, as well as other U.N. officials and government officials.
