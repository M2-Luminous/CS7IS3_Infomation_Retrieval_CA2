Why Do the Crimean Tatars Need Chechen Arms?"] [Text] A few days ago chiefs of Russia's various special services, foreign and internal affairs ministers, and senior staffers of the presidential administration received a fact sheet saying that "certain groups in Chechnya have organized the illegal delivery of small and other arms designed for the Crimean Tatars living on the peninsula. The weapons are allegedly to be used to carry out provocations during the "all-people's poll" in Crimea, particularly, in order to prod the Black Sea Fleet toward active steps to prevent disturbances and to cause its standoff with Kiev." Last year, when Russia halted its oil and oil product deliveries to Ukraine, Kiev signed an agreement on fuel supplies with Azerbaijan. Since Ukraine did not have money at the time, it paid with weapons. Now a part of the weapons is being returned as surplus commodities (!). One year ago, these "surplus commodities" were used to carry out active combat operations in Nagorno-Karabakh. It is hard to believe that the Ukrainian leaders are unaware of the upcoming provocations. All the more so because recently Kiev has been replacing its troops in Crimea (primarily command personnel): servicemen hailing from Russia and the republic's eastern and southern regions are being replaced with those coming from western Ukraine. Also from there, "separate groups and formations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' special purpose units" are being moved up to Crimea. Last week, the conflict in Odessa briefly plunged the world into shock. The split of the fleet, which has been going on for several years already and which is seen in Moscow as a family dispute over property rights, has been assessed in the West as nothing less than a standoff between two nuclear powers. Former President Richard Nixon said in an interview for THE NEW YORK TIMES: "A conflict between Russia and Ukraine could make us see the events in Bosnia as a picnic organized by Sunday school children."
