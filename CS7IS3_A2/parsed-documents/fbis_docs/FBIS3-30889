[Hodzha] I was certainly not prompted by any emotional reasons. My doubts started as early as in late 1992. I was restrained by the concern about the DPS unity and about preventing the DPS constituents from learning about our disagreements, about the processes underway in our parliamentary group and in the Central Council. I very seriously objected to the developments in late 1992, when Mr. Stefan Savov was overthrown from the post of parliamentary chairman. I still do not understand why all this happened. The same applies to the subsequent events with the fall of Filip Dimitrov's government and the efforts to form a cabinet under Yordan Sokolov. As early as at that time I suspected my party's leadership of biased intentions. I had the feeling that all their actions were inspired by exterior forces, that it was not the wish of our constituents they were following, and that all these developments did not serve the people's interests. Naturally, the DPS Parliamentary Group and the Central Council found very convenient motives to explain the situation to their constituents, pretending that all their actions were aimed at solving the people's socioeconomic problems. [KONTINENT] Mr. Hodzha, what makes you so sure that your misgivings and forebodings about such biased actions have already been confirmed? [Hodzha] The DPS Central Council and the Parliamentary Group had decided that a bill or a draft resolution on disclosing personal police files should be moved as soon as possible, or in case another parliamentary group should submit such a proposal, our group would support it. Nevertheless, our leadership and its entourage did not support the draft resolution in question when it was submitted. [KONTINENT] Do any former police informants exist among the DPS members? [Hodzha] They definitely exist. A leading member of parliamentary group had the insolence and arrogance of proposing to the group that we should support the nomination of Filip Bokov [from the Bulgarian Socialist Party] as head of the Bulgarian delegation to the European Parliamentary Assembly. This was a question of principle for us. It could have been our second great blunder. It was prevented with great efforts. I am genuinely concerned about the negligent attitude of our DPS Parliamentary Group leadership, about its unwillingness to visit the areas of our constituents. In the community of Dzhebel, in part of the Krumovgrad, Ardino, and Kirkovo communities, even not one kg of the "Basma" tobacco variety has been purchased. last week a telegram was dispatched to all members of parliament from the Kurdzhali election district, with copies of the letter to the National Assembly Presidium and the Council of Ministers, asking for their presence at a meeting scheduled to take place on Saturday [29 February]. No one attended the meeting. What does it mean? It means a total lack of responsibility whatsoever toward the electorate. The excuse of one of our Parliamentary Group leaders was it would have been our duty to pass a bill on tobacco growing and processing and to force the government and the Bulgartabak Company to set a minimum purchasing price. However, much more than that is at stake. The existence of a whole economic branch and the survival of numerous human beings are at stake, as a matter of fact. [KONTINENT] Would you return to parliament after the next elections as a deputy of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], for example? [Hodzha] It depends on the local people, namely on the constituents. I am not the one to decide. If people, regardless of their ethnic origins, think that I would be eligible on the basis of my behavior and my actions, on the basis of my stand, if they become convinced that I am capable of defending their interests, I would not decline such a proposal. Naturally, I leave everything to them. I would not have the courage to appear before those people and try through mediators, or through hired persons, to persuade them that they should put my name on the list of candidates for the next elections. [KONTINENT] Whose interests is the current DPS leadership serving in your view? [Hodzha] They are serving alien interests, under all circumstances. I understand their dilemma. They are really under severe pressure, but in what case can someone be subject to pressure and blackmail? It can only be done with something stronger than a police file. Those people are trained [by Communists], and they would not get the permission of certain agencies outside the DPS to do something more for democracy. They are simply not free to do so. If I had been a traitor and an informant, if I had really worked against my fellow villagers, I would not hold my present position, because no one would have elected me. However, there is something much more serious at stake. The DPS leadership is just following somebody's secret instructions. Such leaders cannot be free and they cannot possibly act in the interest of their constituents.
