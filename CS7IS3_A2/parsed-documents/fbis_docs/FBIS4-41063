Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov said in the lower house that the NATO partnership plan is "US expansionism aimed against Russia". He compared it to the notorious "Barbarossa" plan of Adolf Hitler which was used to invade the former Soviet Union exactly 53 years ago - on June 22, 1941 when Nazi Germany attacked the USSR. However, the Duma voted down the communist proposal to include the issue into the agenda.
