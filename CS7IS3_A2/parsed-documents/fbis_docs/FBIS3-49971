[Rakitic] We are deputies of the Depos that was founded in 1992. That DEPOS still exists, it still has its Presidency, its Council, its founding documents, and a large membership. That Depos is registered as a political organization, which is the only relevant thing for us. In our letter we inform the public that we shall work autonomously within the Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO], keeping in mind that the SPO long ago ceased to be a democratic party, meaning that all the important decisions are made by the chairman of the party alone. The chairman of the SPO alone made the decision that SPO deputies were not to take part in the assembly debate on no confidence in Nikola Sainovic's cabinet, and he alone withdrew that decision again.... For these recent elections Vuk Draskovic formed a new coalition, naming it Depos again, which is false. The Presidency of Depos did not want to protest, fearing a negative impact on the election results of the democratic opposition. Because of the event on 1 June [Draskovic's arrest], because of Draskovic's hospital treatment, and later because of the elections, we, as deputies, did not protest. However, as soon as the elections were over, we decided to end our political abstinence. We consider that the issues of democratic relations within the SPO can no longer be postponed. That we are right is proven by the fact that our denunciations have not been denied by a single word -- the SPO leadership has tried, using already proven rhetoric, to discredit 11 respectable SPO members, among them even several founders of the SPO. [Milivojevic] So you still feel members of the SPO, do you? [Rakitic] We still feel SPO members, but we believe that in general terms something must be changed in the opposition parties. It is necessary to legalize factions and trends in the parties. Different opinions are a normal occurrence, just as it is normal that, in global terms, we hold unified views on certain issues. Unfortunately, the way in which the meeting of the Main Board is supposed to be held speaks of a different attitude -- the meeting will be a trial to the unlike-minded, who dared oppose the chairman of the SPO. If they expel us from the party, then we shall still call ourselves Depos deputies. I expect that the Depos Presidency and Council will soon meet to solve disputes between the original Depos and the new one that has no continuity. That is to say, we shall be acting as an opposition party, although we are already being attacked in advance for only benefiting the cause of the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS]. Furthermore, it is very sad that the party's leadership has ordered telegrams to be sent by SPO regional boards condemning us. In addition, we are receiving threatening telephone calls, and we are being blackmailed, while rumors about a secret meeting between Slobodan Milosevic and myself have already started to circulate. Such paranoia only shows that the question of democracy is an essential question for the democratic opposition. Tomorrow we are holding a meeting at which we shall make a decision regarding our further steps. Yet, if they have already condemned us in advance, I see no reason why we should attend the meeting of the Main Board. [Milivojevic] Does your open letter have anything to do with the previous attempt by non-partisan people to institutionalize part of Depos? [Rakitic] Yes, it does. That idea is very close to us, and I believe that such a Depos would be deprived of all those shortcomings that the opposition is suffering from, such as, for instance, the cult of the personality, and suchlike. [Milivojevic] Have you had any contacts with chairman Draskovic recently? [Rakitic] Yes, on the eve of the very elections, when he asked me to take part in the work of the campaign committee. However, in view of everything that was happening in the party while Draskovic was in prison, in view of all the accusations against me that have been delivered by the people who were on hunger strike and were behaving like a group of religious fanatics encircled by a rope -- I do not see any way to talk to people who are not ready to start a democratic dialogue. All the more since it was Draskovic alone who made the decision on the coalition, as well as the decision on the candidates for assembly deputies. I know that we shall be linked to the SPS, and the State Security Service, and it will be said that the right moment has not come yet, and so forth. It turns out that one is a good member only when one keeps silent, and supports what the chairman and his closest aides do. Otherwise one will be told that "the opposite attitude suits the regime." In that case any action is made impossible, which we do not accept. [Box, page 4] Belgrade -- "One needs only several facts out of many to see that the SPO lacks any democracy. The current SPO differs in no way from the Communist Party from the time of Tito's autocracy. The SPO has become a private firm of the Draskovic family, which employs many relatives of theirs," it is said in the open letter to the Main Board of the SPO, that was written by nine former republican deputies and members of the Main Board of the SPO, among whom are Dr. Aleksandar Taskovic, Dr. Ivan Milutinovic, Dr. Predrag Mijailovic, and author Mladen Markov. "The staff policy of the party is completely in the hands of Vuk Draskovic and his wife. The basic criterion is the personal affinity and loyalty toward the Draskovics. The bodies that are in charge of the staff policy according to the SPO Statute are regularly bypassed. Also, the financial dealings of the party are far from being under any control, something on which the Main Board has never received any report," the letter states. Still, Draskovic is receiving many letters of support. Until yesterday, letters were coming in from Nis, Paracin, Decane, Kragujevac, Gora, Vlasotnice, Kladovo, Osecina, Ruma, Pozarevac, and Zajecar....
