The Constitutional Court had been intimated on December 30, 1993 by 59 deputies on the unconstitutionality of the above-mentioned law. They claimed that the law had been endorsed consequent to the vote on the report of mediation on chambers' divergences that did not meet the legal quorum. In its decision released today, the Constitutional Court shows that the quorum is the condition for the parliament's chambers to meet in sitting. Therefore, failing to have a quorum results in adjourning the sitting. So, one cannot mistake the quorum for the vote. Consequently, the constitutionality of the quorum condition and of the result of the vote shall be assessed on separate moments of the parliamentary legislative procedure. As is known, the chamber speaker called the roll before the voting to check the quorum and it appeared that 278 parliamentarians were present, as shown even in the intimation. Which makes the quorum valid. It is sustained in the intimation that the constitutional wording "the presence of the majority of the parliamentarians" means the number of parliamentarians who participated in voting and not the number of actually present parliamentarians. This mistakes the legal sitting quorum, which is a condition of immediate presence before voting, for the voting itself, which has a quite different meaning, which is the expression of the attitude required for a majority to endorse or turn down an act.
