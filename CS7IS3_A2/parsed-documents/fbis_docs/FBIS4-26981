"China's 21st Century Agenda" is "The White Paper on China's Population, Environment, and Development in the 21st Century." "China's 21st Centuray Agenda," completed after one and a half years since its drafting began in August 1992, was compiled in line with China's national conditions. It echoes the United Nations' "21st Century Agenda." This volume of policy guidance documents, compiled like an encyclopedia and approved by the Chinese Government, expounds the strategy for sustained development in China and will certainly serve as guidance for drawing up long- and medium-range economic and social development plans for China. Deng Nan said: China has entered a stage in which its economy is developing rapidly. This has brought about an opportunity for us to solve environmental problems, but it has also brought us challenges. The development of the economy and technology has made it possible for us to increase investment to deal with environmental problems, but economic development in China at present is basically resource-oriented. Therefore, it is possible that development will bring about destruction of the ecology and worsening of the environment. Deng Nan said: We should foster an outlook for the comprehensive development of the population, the economy, society, resources, and the environment, and find a path for sustained development for China in accordance with its national conditions. Deng Nan said: The formulation and implementation of "China's 21st Century Agenda," as a document to privide guidance for the drafting of national economic and social development, will make it possible for us to solve the past problem of economic development divorced from environmental protection. At present, we have drawn up the first batch of priority plans for the implementation of the "China's 21st Century Agenda." Sixty-two projects in nine areas are included in these plans. Of these projects, those that we have successfully striven to turn into projects of international cooperation will be included in the state's long- and medium-range plans. These projects will be developed according to our needs. Deng Nan pointed out: In drawing up their programs for the year 2010 and their Ninth Five-Year Plan, various areas and departments should pay attention to embodying the idea and contents of "China's 21st Century Agenda." Meanwhile, they should do a good job in running comprehensive social development experimental zones and set up training centers which can train international personnel on a sustained basis. We should strengthen propaganda and further mobilize and encourage the masses to participate in our projects. We should further advance the implementation of "China's 21st Century Agenda" by relying on science and technology. We should extensively launch international cooperation so as to lead China onto the path of sustained and sound development.
