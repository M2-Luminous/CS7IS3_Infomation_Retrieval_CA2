There is no such plot. What there is, is a community of individual countries disillusioned by recession, unnerved by the Maastricht debate but badly in need of some renewed momentum to meet the challenges of enlargement and unemployment. Contrary to the British view, enlargement of Europe has always led to greater integration: this is no exception. The question is: who is going to make the running? The Franco-German axis indeed remains central, if only because without it the European Union would fall apart. That is why Chancellor Kohl, who will hold the presidency of Europe from July, and President Mitterrand, who follows him in January, made so much of their meeting in Mulhouse last week. But the Paris-Bonn link is showing its age. France and Germany may talk of longterm plans: in terms of practical proposals and real weight it is through Kohl and Germany, reunited by history but sobered by the experience, that European impetus has to come. An enlarged Europe swings north and east. Europe in recovery goes Germany's way. Kohl believes he can win the October election for Chancellor. Mitterrand knows he is going next spring and will almost be certainly replaced by a conservative nearer to German views. The good news for Europhiles is that a resurgent Germany is also a Germany anxious to keep within Europe rather than reach out for the new opportunities in the east on its own. `Germany,' says Dr. Hans-Friedrich von Ploetz, director-general of the federal Foreign Office, `is in a unique situation. All her neighbours want to work with her. There is no coalition against Germany. We want to make this situation permanent.' Therein lies a century of history and generations of insecurity. Therein also lies Germany's profound commitment to the union. Keeping Germany as part of a dynamic and expanding European Union is the way of making security permanent. It may be also the only way of keeping the far right under check. Hence an obsession that Europe must create a police force and common actions to control immigration and racism. The good news for the British, at least for the Conservatives, is that much of what Germany wants to do is far from inimical to British economic thinking, even if Kohl is dead against the idea of leaving a Europe as an `elevated free trade area.' Nearly two years of recession and four years of reunification have convinced German government and business that the road to recovery is paved with flexible labour arrangements and lower costs. Equally, there is an almost savage mood against Brussels and over-regulation. Reunification has reconfirmed the importance of regional devolution. A Europe run by Germany would be a Europe of regions, in which the powers of Brussels would be strictly circumscribed and the functions of the Council and Parliament clearly defined. This owes more to German domestic pressures than philosphical belief. The past few years have turned the German public inwards. Reunification has given it a greater sense of national destiny but also a greater consciousness of cost. This has made Germany accept that early membership by the Czech republic, Hungary and Poland will have to be put off until their economies are more compatible. Cost has also made Bonn reluctant to sanction high investment in infrastructure, preferring a more competitive environment as the means to new jobs. That in many ways puts it on a divergent course to France, which still believes in centralisation, federalism and investment as the way out of recession. France, which needs Europe to give it a central position, would prefer to push ahead with an inner core. Germany, which likes to see allies all the way to more distant horizons, does not. The great question remains the single currency. The German public doesn't want it, its independent central bank is solidly opposed, yet Chancellor Kohl persists. The date can be put off, he suggests, but the aim must be pursued. It is a commitment that will not necessarily outlast Kohl should he lose in October. On Europe, uniquely for so careful a politician, he is way ahead of his own public opinion. But if Kohl goes and Germany turns inward, Europe has problems. There is no alternative to German leadership at this moment, and not just because it has the presidency from July. France, following it in the EU presidency, has a domestic presidential election in the middle of its European term. Spain, Italy and Britain are all weighed down by internal political crises. Enlargement is far from a foregone conclusion. The advantage of Germany's presidency is that it has at least had stable political leadership of its own for the past halfcentury. It will take on structural reform of the Community and will get decisions moving again. The disadvantage is that, in seeking a vision of Europe after so long below the parapet, Germany remains confined to its own experience -- regionalised, industrialised, self-sufficient and provincial. That leaves much for the British to play for. The whole area of security and foreign policy is ill-defined and barely nascent. The reformation of the Union structures has still to be approached, let alone decided. Monetary Union is now not due for consideration until 1997 at the earliest. But, to do this, Britain has now to come to terms with German thinking. It's not a case of joining them or being left out. That has always been one of the more foolish arguments of Euro-enthusiasts. It's simply a matter of being in there. For if the German presidency goes sour, we are all in trouble.
