The protest, which was organized by opposition political parties, affected Esperanza, Mao, and Laguna Salada, where stores closed and urban and intra-urban transportation decreased, a Dominican radio station reported. Some 20 people were arrested and are under investigation for throwing tacks on the streets, burning tires, and detonating explosive devices, police reports stated. Committee members were linked to the Santo Domingo Agreement, which established a coalition made up of opposition parties led by Jose Francisco Pena Gomez of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) and the Democratic Union (UD). Pena Gomez, who was favored to win the elections in the Dominican Republic, today reiterated his charges of electoral fraud and presented the Central Electoral Board [JCE] with "new evidence" that holds that organization responsible for the irregularities. JCE initial results show that President Joaquin Balaguer, candidate for the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC), is leading by a minimum margin, but electoral authorities have not yet proclaimed his victory. JCE President Manuel Garcia Lizardo reaffirmed that the board will not proclaim a winner yet based on the official results of the elections because every one of the reported irregularities is being investigated. Meanwhile, Balaguer and Dante Caputo, UN envoy to Haiti, discussed the Haitian crisis behind closed doors. Caputo, who arrived in the morning, refused to give details on his meeting with Balaguer, but said they discussed international initiatives on the Haitian case.
