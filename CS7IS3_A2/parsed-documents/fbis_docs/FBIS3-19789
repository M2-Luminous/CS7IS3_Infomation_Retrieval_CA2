According to MEPs, the European Union should tend, moreover, towards establishing an international and universal control system of the "complete cycle" of uranium, plutonium and possibly thorium, for civilian purposes. In addition, MEPs consider that, in the cooperation agreements with third countries, the Union should include clauses on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Finally, MEPs took an explicit stand in favour of establishing a denuclearised zone in the Near East.
