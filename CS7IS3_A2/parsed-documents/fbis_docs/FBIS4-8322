The two documents are likely to be negotiated with Syria this year, Czech Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra said today. Vondra was speaking to reporters after his return home from a trip to the two countries and Iran. He said that as far as Syria is concerned, all agreements with that country will be reviewed, which is important from the point of view of past commitments and accords concluded with Syria by former Czechoslovakia. Vondra handed over an invitation for the Syrian foreign minister to visit the Czech Republic. Vondra also said that since Syria was a traditional region for investment and commercial activities by Czech firms, he had tried to support the activities of Czech business people in realizing promising projects. Vondra believes that the issue of Czech liabilities in Syria dating from the 1970's and particularly from the 1980's will best be settled through the maintenance of mutual trade relations. He said Syria was now in a very good position regarding payments. Over the past two years, particularly after the Gulf War, it has been a responsible partner, said Vondra. Pakistan is following the path of extensive privatization of the state sector. Vondra believes it is necessary for Czech business people to obtain information about the changed situation there so that they will be able to orientate themselves quickly. That was also one of the reasons why the Czech Government decided some time ago to turn the former commercial department in Karachi into a general consulate.
