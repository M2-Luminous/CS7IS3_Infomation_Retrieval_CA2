Masayoshi Takemura told reporters Hata will have an opportunity for talks with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor about ways to reopen stalled trade negotiations between Japan and the United States. "We hope this will provide us a chance to achieve a breakthrough," Takemura said. Takemura denied a news report that Japan and the United States will have unofficial talks as early as this week aimed at breaking the stalemate in bilateral trade negotiations. "We haven't decided on such a specific plan," he said. Takemura also said that Tokyo will continue to seek a breakthrough in the stalled "framework" trade talks with Washington while carrying out a market-opening package announced last month. The bilateral trade talks have been deadlocked since February 11, when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to reach agreement on a U.S. demand for numerical targets to gauge the openness in Japanese markets. A Japanese newspaper reported Sunday that Japan will send a senior official to Washington as early as this week to hold unofficial talks in hopes of breaking the impasse over the trade negotiations.
