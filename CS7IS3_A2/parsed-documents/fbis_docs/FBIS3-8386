The session has been going on in the Cernin Palace in Prague since Wednesday [2 March] ends today. The situation in the former Yugoslavia was a key question of the session, Hoynck said. Hoynck said it was emphasised that the only real way out was a complex solution, and this could only be achieved through close cooperation by the international community and the recognition of the constructive role which could be played by all its components. The CSCE could play a new role here, especially in the sphere of human rights and freedoms and above all by establishing ombudsmen appointed and supported by the CSCE. Negotiations were also going on for the renewal of CSCE missions in Kosovo, Sandzak and Vojvodina. The participants of the session approved a decision to renew the activity of the CSCE mission in Georgia, and to enable it to monitor the peacekeeping forces in South Osetia and Georgia and widen its mandate. They expressed themselves in favour of an active role for this mission in stimulating dialogue between the sides involved in the conflict by organising round-table talks. They also favoured the arrangement of an international conference under the aegis of the CSCE and with UN participation. Hoynck also talked about the necessity for close cooperation between the CSCE missions in South Osetia and Abkhazia. He pointed in particular to the humanitarian aspect to the problematic situation of this area, where thousands of refugees needed help which could only be provided to them by the international community.
