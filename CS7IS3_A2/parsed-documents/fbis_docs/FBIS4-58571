He pointed out that he will work toward increasing the movement's "political effectiveness" while continuing military action in the same manner in the other occupied territories. Al-Shaqaqi said in Damascus yesterday that "in the event of the Palestinian authority's entry into Gaza, we will reconsider the nature of military action there. But we will continue [military action] in the same manner in the West Bank, Jerusalem, and the 1948 territory." He added that military action will continue, "and we will not suspend it during the reconsideration period. The confrontation methods will be linked to the nature of the Israeli presence in the Strip." He pointed out that the Jihad Movement does not object to "political moves in the Strip away from the self-rule authority and its institutions. We will push toward the broadest political movement possible, whose motive power is the jihad." On the nature of the future relationship with Fatah and the administrative self-rule authority, al-Shaqaqi said that the "Jihad's" history is closely linked to Fatah. He added: "There are personal ties between Fatah and Jihad sons. This personal relationship could become a channel through which to solve some of the problems" that may emerge between the two sides. He pointed out that he has no "desire to fight over power. Nevertheless, the possibility of a confrontation exists. If they judge us because of our jihad against Israel, confrontations would occur between us." On his opinion of the agreement to be signed today, the Jihad secretary general said that he considers "this day a danger in our history, and (Palestinian President Yasir) 'Arafat has sold his soul for the sake of his body and is trying to sell the Palestinian people's soul in return for their remaining alive politically."
