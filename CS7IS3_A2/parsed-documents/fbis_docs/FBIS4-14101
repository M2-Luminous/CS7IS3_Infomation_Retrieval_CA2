Speaking at a news conference today, Sha'th said that it is not possible now to set a final date for signing the agreement, although the two sides are trying to deal with the issues left from last week and want to finalize the negotiations by the end of the week, if possible. The Palestinian official added: We are working day and night to get it over with as soon as possible. Dr. Sha'th stated that 'Arafat will arrive in Cairo tomorrow evening and will meet with President Husni Mubarak on Thursday morning. He added that 'Arafat will hold talks with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Dr. Sha'th noted that he will represent President 'Arafat at a small ceremony to be held at Cairo Airport in the presence of Musa and Christopher to mark the arrival of the first group of Palestinian police vehicles donated by the United States to the Palestinians. There are 200 vehicles, he added. He pointed out that the remaining vehicles will arrive at Port Said within two weeks, noting that the first group, which will be transported by air, will be available for use by the Palestinian police once the agreement for implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord is signed. Dr. Sha'th expressed the hope that during U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to Egypt beginning tomorrow the two sides will finalize all parts of the agreement, except for two or three items that will be endorsed by President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Sha'th welcomed any effort made by the U.S. secretary of state during his tour, saying: We welcome the role of the U.S. cosponsor in promoting the negotiations. Asked whether President 'Arafat will meet with the Israeli Foreign Minister in Cairo, Dr. Sha'th said he did not know if Peres will arrive in Cairo some time after tomorrow. If Peres does arrive, he might meet with 'Arafat. However, such a meeting has not been confirmed. Dr. Sha'th said the two sides are working to find solutions, clarify all matters, sign the agreement, and work out any pending details. He said: We do not want to divulge the details of the progress in the negotiations now. Perhaps all details will be announced in two days. He added: We are trying our best to finish the negotiations. Dr. Sha'th indicated that he is "optimistic" by nature. However, this is a very difficult process in which the Palestinians are seeking justice. Regarding the date the Palestinian police will enter Gaza and Jericho, Dr. Sha'th said that some forces will begin their duties after the signing of the agreement and that 6,000 Palestinian policemen will be deployed in the two areas one week after the signing. On the meeting between PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, and Chief Israeli Negotiator Gen. Amnon Shahaq, Dr. Sha'th said the two sides reviewed the course of the negotiations before Abu-Mazin left for Tunis today. He added that Abu-Mazin could return to Cairo tomorrow with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat. Dr. Sha'th said that a team of legal experts will revise the items of the agreement in light of the Palestinian documents next week. The team consists of Dr. George Sealam [name as received], a U.S. professor of international law, and Dr. Mufid Shihab and Dr. Salah 'Amir, two Egyptian professors of international law. On the criticism by [former chief Palestinian negotiator] Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi of the current negotiations, Dr. Sha'th said the PLO welcomes objective opposition within the democratic framework serving the Palestinian people's cause. He added: We respect Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi and appreciate his view. What we are doing now is only a small step on a long road to achieving our goals.
