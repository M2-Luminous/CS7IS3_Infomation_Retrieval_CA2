One about payment for rent of the Skrunda military facility and the other one concerning the wording of the text of the agreement. However, in spite of the disagreements, there is hope that an agreement will be reached in the nearest future, possibly today. The main achievement of yesterday's talks is an agreement prepared for signing on the army withdrawal and two agreements on social guarantees for the Russian military. It has been agreed in the document that pensions will be paid to Soviet army pensioners, that is, to those who had become pensioners by January `92. A new stage is characteristic of this round of talks, because documents which have been discussed for several years have practically been prepared for signing.
