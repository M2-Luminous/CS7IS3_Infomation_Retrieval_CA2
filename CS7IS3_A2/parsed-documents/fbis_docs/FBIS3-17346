During the meeting, the head of state spoke of his striving towards friendship between NATO and Russia, Georgia, and the CIS states. He said that the restoration of Cold War would stir up reactionary forces, and this could be tragical in effect for many small countries. Today, when even the United Nations fails to render a real help to this or that country in the settlement of a conflict, NATO's role as that of a guarantor of stability has further increased, Shevardnadze said. The head of the NATO delegation, an official representative of the Republic of Turkey in NATO, Tugay Ozceni, welcomed Georgia's joining the Partnership for Peace initiative. He said NATO intended to extend the cooperation with Georgia including the military sphere.
