"It's a serious problem for the international community and truly unfortunate that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection in North Korea was incomplete, and that it was unable to inspect two important sites," Kim said in an interview with NHK-TV broadcast here on the evening news. "It's now heading toward a situation where international sanctions cannot but be imposed on North Korea," he said. The comments by South Korea's top executive came just hours after the IAEA announced in Vienna that its inspectors, during their two-week stay in North Korea, were denied access to important sites that could determine whether the Stalinist state diverted nuclear material for non-peaceful uses. Kim's interview came a week before he heads to Tokyo on his first outing this year. It was only last year that the Seoul Government closed the book on the dark past with Tokyo from the 1910-45 colonial years. On opening his country to Japanese cultural imports, Kim said the important thing is to open up naturally and gradually through exchanges between the two peoples and their governments. "The opening will have to wait until such time comes," he said, predicting that this would occur during the remaining four years of his presidency. He also thought a visit to Korea by Japanese Emperor Akihito was possible during the next four years, a step officials here say is the last emotional door to close on the two countries' past relations. But it's important to create an atmosphere where the people of both countries can sincerely welcome such a visit, he said.
