FR940324-1-00038 FR940324-1-00009 B. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by EPA (OMB control number 2060&hyph;0095, ICR No. 10.06) and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch,; EPA; 401 M St., SW. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460 or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. This collection of information has an estimated reporting burden averaging 0.5 hours per response and an estimated annual recordkeeping burden averaging 0.3 hours per respondent. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M St., SW. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final Rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposal. C. Impact on Small Entities The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires federal agencies to identify potentially adverse impacts of federal regulations upon small entities. In instances where significant impacts are possible on a substantial number of these entities, agencies are required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. There will not be a significant impact on a substantial number of small business entities because the proposed rule benefits the small businesses that import nonconforming vehicles into the United States, allowing them additional options for importing these vehicles and minimizing their costs. Therefore, as required under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq ., the Administrator certifies that this regulation does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. D. Statutory Authority Subpart P_Secs. 203, 206, 207, 208, 301 and 307, Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 7522, 7525, 7541, 7542, 7601 and 7607).
