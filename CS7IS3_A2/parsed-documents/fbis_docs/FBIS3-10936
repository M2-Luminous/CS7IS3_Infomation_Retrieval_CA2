We are a handful of men and women who, by taking up arms, found an answer to the oblivion into which the state plunged us, to the daily hunger, and to the lack of public services to reaffirm our condition as decent human beings. On other occasions, we resorted to arms in self-defense of the criminal behavior of police authorities who are killing the future of Ciudad Bolivar: its youth. We believe that now is a propitious moment to stop, pause for the sake of coexistence to find different ways to face despair and anguish; we urge communities to join efforts and the national and district governments to adopt a new attitude to rescue this vast zone known as Ciudad Bolivar. For us, peace negotiations at this location only make sense insofar as they bring about social investments by the state to settle the social and human debt that Colombia and Santa Fe de Bogota owe to Ciudad Bolivar.
