The official letter, sent in the name of the assistant secretary of state, said that foreign legal service is needed in South Korea in order to protect U.S. interests as an increasing number of American companies are investing in Korea, according to Justice Ministry officials. Kim Yong-chol, a specialist on international law at the Ministry, said, however, that Seoul should tell the U.S. side that the market cannot be opened since legal service in Korea, which works basically for the benefit of the public rather than individuals, has fundamentally different characteristics from that of the United States.
