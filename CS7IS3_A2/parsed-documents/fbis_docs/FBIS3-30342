He is not just any Russian, but a Russian who has behind him several million voters, and of course their families -- so a very significant number of Russians -- and since we have very good relations with the Russian Government and the Russian opposition [words indistinct] with the opposition, just as we gladly meet the government. Things are certainly changing in Russia. What I can tell our listeners and the local radio stations is that, unfortunately, in our wish to have peace as soon as possible, we were hoping that peace could come soon. However, the Muslim side has opted for war, and the United States has decided to support the Muslim commitment to war by recognizing the actual situation on the ground that the Muslims have achieved by force of arms. That bothers us as that means there will be more suffering, particularly among the Muslim people, but we should also be glad about it, since if the actual situation on the ground created in fighting is recognized, then it will be recognized for the Serbs as well, and the Serbs control 60 percent of the territory. The Serbs will achieve their aims to a greater extent even though with more casualties than if there were to be peace. We have adopted important decisions at the general staff level. Our people have to be completely mobilized. We are either a nation or not. We are either a nation or we will disappear. Our enemies have to know that it is dangerous to fight against the Serbs, that when cornered, the Serbs have no other choice. We have no choice but to win. We did not want to defeat the Muslims. We wanted them to win on their territory and us to win on ours, and to part our ways. If they do not want to, then it is our duty to defend every inch of our country. There are no more percentages. Nobody can guarantee any percentages to the Muslims, and they will most certainly get much less than they could have had if they had accepted [word indistinct]. [Blagojevic] Asked about the fate of [Bosanska] Posavina and Mt. Ozren at the last negotiations and the coming ones in Geneva, President Karadzic said: [Karadzic] (That is undefined) since we did not want anything like that as we have a lot of work to do with the Croats. [sentence as heard] Part of western Slavonia is under Croatian control so we thought that the entire Bosanska Posavina should belong to the Serbs, and that is what we still think. Therefore every inch of Posavina has to belong to the Serbs. We do not want any corridor, we want a real territorial link between our Krajina, the Srpska republic, and the Serbian Krajina, that is, republic. We could not abandon Mt. Ozren, we even got a significant part of Mt. Ozren back through negotiations. To tell the truth, the Muslims did not feel much like taking Mt. Ozren with so many Serbs there, and such savage and rough Serbs, too, so that, to our mutual satisfaction, we decided that this part of Mt. Ozren should be returned. However, since the Muslims have given up on all this, we have the reason, the rights, and the ability to defend every inch of the Serb land, and the Muslims will get what is left. We cannot compensate them, we cannot guarantee them 33 percent, and let them then fight for more. Every gamble has two possible outcomes, a gain and a loss, and every stick has two ends. If the Muslim leadership has opted for war, and it has, and the United States has decided to recognize the results of their struggle, and it has, then it should all also apply to the Serbs and the Serbs should not complain as they already control 72 percent of the territory, and own 60 percent of the territory. If we do make any concessions, then that will only be a percentage or two of unimportant territory, we will not give away anything important that is Serbian. [Blagojevic] In what context are we to view the latest statement by General Morillion, former UN commander? [Karadzic] That a Muslim state should not be (created)? [Blagojevic] Yes. [Karadzic] That is our big problem, ours and the Croats. Europe wants us to remain in a common country with the Muslims so as to control them. That European calculation is extremely wrong since in about 15 years the Muslims would be in the majority, and they would create pressure, as in Kosovo, for the Serbs and the Croats to move out. Then it would become a great Muslim state in Europe. Trying to avoid a small Muslim state in Europe, Europe is creating a great Muslim state, because of its miscalculations. Europe does not know that, though. We will not accept that. We have nothing against a small Muslim state, but we also have nothing against dividing Bosnia in two parts between the Serbs and the Croats. The Muslims in Tuzla could get autonomy with the Serbs, and autonomy in Zenica with the Croats, although we would rather see a clean partition into three, where the Serbs could enjoy their territories, and the Muslims could enjoy whatever is theirs. [Blagojevic] President Karadzic finally addressed the soldiers in the Srpska republic army: [Karadzic] Greetings to all the fighters. Please, gentlemen fighters, you are the most glorious generation of Serb fighters, and the officers are the most glorious generation of Serb officers. Pay no attention to what we do at the conferences, as all the maps are transient, and only what you hold is eternal. Hold every village of ours, and do not worry.
