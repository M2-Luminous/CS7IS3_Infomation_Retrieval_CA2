FR940620-2-00073 FR940620-2-00045 B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition OCC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others Comments were not and are not intended to be solicited with respect to the proposed rule change, and none were received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with Section 17A of the Act and specifically with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act. 5 That section requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which the clearing agency is responsible. 5 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(F) (1988). The revised standards should make letters of credit deposited as margin more liquid instruments and, consequently, should permit OCC to more safely rely upon such letters of credit. Because the revised standards will induce letter of credit issuers to reexamine clearing members' financial conditions every three months rather than annually as under the prior standards, the financial conditions of clearing members electing to deposit letters of credit as margin should be assessed more frequently. More frequent assessments should facilitate the discovery of any adverse developments in a more timely manner. In addition, because letters of credit will be irrevocable, issuers of letters of credit no longer will be able to revoke letters of credit at times when the clearing members most need credit facilities ( e.g., when a clearing member is experiencing financial difficulties or during times of market volatility). By approving the proposed rule change on a temporary basis through June 30, 1995, OCC, the Commission, and other interested parties will be able to assess further, prior to permanent Commission approval, any effects the revised standards have on letter of credit issuance and on margin deposited at OCC. 6 6 The Commission and OCC currently are studying concentration limits on letters of credit deposited as margin. The Division believes that clearing agencies that accept letters of credit as margin deposits or clearing fund contributions should limit their exposure by imposing concentration limits on the use of letters of credit. Generally, clearing agencies impose limitations on the percentage of an individual member's required deposit or contribution that may be satisfied with letters of credit, limitations on the percentage of the total required deposits or contributions that may be satisfied with letters of credit by any one issuer, or some combination of both. OCC has no concentration limits on the use of letters of credit issued by U.S. institutions. OCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving because the Commission believes it is desirable that the proposed rule change be approved before the expiration of the Commission's previous order granting temporary approval of these modifications to the letter of credit standards. By approving this proposed rule filing before expiration of the prior temporary approval order, the changes that have been implemented pursuant to the temporary approval order may remain in place during the further assessment of any effects the revised standards have on the issuance of letters of credit and on margin deposited at OCC pending permanent approval. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. ยง552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of OCC. All submissions should refer to the file number SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;94&hyph;06 and should be submitted by July 11, 1994. V. Conclusion On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that OCC's proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and in particular with Section 17A of the Act. It is therefore ordered, under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposal (File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;94&hyph;06) be, and hereby is, approved through June 30, 1995. For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 7 7 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland Deputy Secretary.
