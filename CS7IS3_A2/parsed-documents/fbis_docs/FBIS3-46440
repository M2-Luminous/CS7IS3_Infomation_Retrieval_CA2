The new accord will see members of the House of Representatives elected through a combination of 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional representation seats to be distributed in 11 electoral blocs across the country. The new formula will replace the existing multi-seat constituencies. On the question of political donations, the compromise agreement will allow individual politicians to designate one organization to collect funds from corporations. The compromise came after a joint committee of both houses of the Diet (parliament) had failed to settle the past week's differences between the ruling coalition and opposition parties. In a last-minute bid to avoid a political crisis, Takako Doi, speaker of the lower house, invited Hosokawa and Kono to hold a meeting and after two hours they reached a basic accord. It is likely that the compromise plan may be tabled to the Diet for a vote tomorrow, the last day for the current parliamentary session. In the original proposals, the coalition advocated 274 single-seat districts and 226 seats allotted by proportional representation, while the LDP wanted 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 seats allotted by proportional representation. The ruling parties, meanwhile, were in favor of a ban on political donations but the LDP called for limited fund-raising for individual politicians.
