Officials subsequently told DIE PRESSE that consensus was achieved. For agriculture, a "mixed system" is envisaged, containing elements of a single market concept and a concept involving transition periods. This is considered a defensible compromise variant. There is also agreement on the settlement of transit traffic. Austria intends to accept the "environment-friendly" EC demand that bilateral transit traffic, which was originally not considered for the ecological point system, will now be taken into account. Austria now also intends to get a mixed model for the real estate issue (second home) accepted in the membership negotiations. Regulation of Regional Planning Specifically, this mixed model is a combination consisting of a regional planning regulation (including the ban of second homes through the dedication of land) and a regulation of real estate transactions (so that dedicated construction ground cannot be used for second homes). In an interview with DIE PRESSE, foreign policy spokesman Andreas Khol of the Austrian People's Party [OeVP] said he assumes that "another great breakthrough" will be achieved at the EC Council of Ministers' meetings on 6 and 7 February. Then only "a few hard nuts" would still have to be cracked. In addition to Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek, Foreign Minister Alois Mock, and State Secretary Brigitte Ederer, Ministers Fischer, Lacina, Klima, and Weiss also took part in the detailed two-hour discussion on European Union. In an interview with DIE PRESSE, Chancellor Vranitzky said regarding the EU time schedule that the government believes there is a "good" chance of completing the membership negotiations by March. Austria was trying to keep to this goal, said Vranitzky. Regarding the touchy problems that were still open, it would not have been necessary to agree on a common language: "We know anyway what we want." In any case, the chancellor said in the interview, government contacts with EU member states would now be increased at the bilateral level. He will go to Athens on 26 January, because Greece is currently holding the presidency. Mock will be more active at the foreign ministers' level, said Vranitzky. President Thomas Klestil said in a NEWS interview that a delay in the EU negotiations would be "regrettable, but not a tragedy." He said he believed, however, a referendum in June and a conclusion of the negotiations with the EU in March would be possible. He said, prior to the referendum, he would make his position very clear and would "comment very clearly on the pros and cons of the European Union." The EU membership negotiations were also the focus of a statement made by Foreign Minister Alois Mock (OeVP) in parliament on 19 January. He said, if both sides really wanted it, the EU negotiations could be concluded by March. Austria would make "every effort" to achieve this. Mock: "It is a chance we are trying to take. We will see whether we will be successful." However, the government would in any case be guided by the principle that the negotiation result is important. According to the foreign minister, the most difficult problems are related to agriculture, transit traffic, and second homes. But he was optimistic that they would be solved. Mock also made clear, however, that in the agricultural area, the financing problem could not be borne by Austria alone. Regarding real estate transactions, it was indispensable to protect housing requirements for the local people by restrictions in connection with the acquisition of second homes. Mock Praises NATO Proposal The foreign minister also dealt with the Partnership for Peace concept offered by NATO to all CSCE members. He said that this initiative, which implied a possibility for countries to make use of it in an individual way, was of particularly great importance for the Central and East European countries that are currently in a security policy vacuum. Since the stability of these countries is extremely relevant to Austria, Partnership for Peace would also have a favorable and important impact on Austria, said Mock. Austria welcomed this initiative, but was seeking security in integration within the EU, which also implied its "docking with the Western European Union."
