Half of the presidential mission of U.S. business circles headed by Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown that is now in Russia is made up of the managers of leading American companies, among which are such giants as Occidental Petroleum, Rockwell International, AT&T, and others. And, apparently, it is not accidental that almost all the questions raised by the guests during a roundtable meeting with Russian ministers were concentrated on one problem: guarantees for foreign investments in Russia. In responding to these questions, Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin reported that the parliamentary committee on economic policy was now developing a new variant of a law on foreign investments. He expressed the firm conviction that a bilateral Russian-American agreement on protection of investments will be ratified. The range of questions discussed at a meeting Wednesday of the interdepartmental committee on the development of economic cooperation was very wide: power engineering, trade, investments, U.S. technical and financial assistance provided along the line of the Agency for International Development, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), and programs in the sphere of agriculture. Objects of special attention were such critical problems as Russian tariff and nontariff trade barriers, delays with payments, etc. A special working group was established that will examine questions of access to each other's markets. A memorandum of mutual agreement of the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the United States was signed on the establishment of American business centers in Russia, [a memorandum on] the scope of the jurisdiction of the intergovernmental committee on the development of business cooperation, and also joint statements of the cochairmen of the Russian-American Committee--O. Davydov and Ron Brown--on the question of access to Russian and U.S. markets and improving conditions of cooperation in the sphere of the medical industry. The American secretary, well-known as "a builder of bridges" between our two countries, noted more than once that one of the purposes of the visit of such a representative delegation (it is made up of more than 100 persons) is "to listen to the voice of private entrepreneurs and to give American and Russian businesses an opportunity to start direct contacts." However, our observer did not find one representative of domestic private and joint-stock business at even one of the meetings. Even in the council on the development of entrepreneurship under the Government of the Russian Federation they replied to a question on contacts with the American delegation that they...are hearing this for the first time. Well, perhaps they will make up for the omission--if not in Moscow then in Yekaterinburg or St. Petersburg, where the American presidential delegation was continuing its trip.
