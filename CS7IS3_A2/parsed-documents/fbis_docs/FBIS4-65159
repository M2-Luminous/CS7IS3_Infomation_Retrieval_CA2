In a tough speech to the Scottish Conservative party conference in Inverness, reinforced in comments to journalists, Mr Clarke tied the future of the government firmly to the survival of the prime minister. "We will be finished if we do not support the prime minister from now until the next general election and beyond. The Conservative party has remained in power for so long because it has a readily identifiable set of principles, and because it has held together as a cohesive party of government," he said. "The leader deserves loyalty and we will stay in office if we stay behind him." Mr Clarke's warning, delivered before news filtered through to the conference of the death of Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, follows similar declarations of support for Mr Major from Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Michael Forsyth, the rightwing employment minister. The chancellor dismissed claims by Mr Henning Christopherson, vice-president of the European Commission, that UK economic growth was likely to slow from 2.5 per cent this year to 2.3 per cent in 1995-96 because of tax increases. Mr Clarke said Mr Christopherson's analysis -- delivered in the commission's latest assessment of the economic prospects of the European Union's member states -- was "out of date." He said there were plenty of data to show that tax increases were not slowing consumer demand.
