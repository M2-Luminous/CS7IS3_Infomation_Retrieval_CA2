He told INTERFAX that Armenia's armed forces must be removed from Azerbaijani territory, including Nagorno-Karabakh. According to foreign sources, 8,000 Armenian citizens fight on the side of the so-called Karabakh forces, he said. "Azerbaijan's position is absolutely clear: We must liberate our territories," he said. He also pointed out that Baku would like to do so without losses on either side. He believes that this is quite possible given Armenia's goodwill and Russia's determination. Assessing the possibility of locating Russian peace-keeping forces in the zone of the Karabakh conflict, he said that these forces might be located on the Azerbaijani-Armenian border and between the conflicting parties after Armenia removes its forces from the occupied territory. He noted, however, that peace-keeping forces may be sent to a country only on the latter's request. Speaking about the possibility of holding talks in Moscow between the Azerbaijani and Armenian presidents with the Russian president's mediation, Guluzade said that a proper political basis must be created for such talks. "If Russia acts as a mediator, it must find a common denominator for settlement," he said.
