[Peres] No, I don't think so. You know a government is not a hospital, we don't have to take the temperature every morning and we shall be judged by the end of the process which I am sure will be a successful one. [Snow] Now on Monday [10 January] you meet again in Taba with the PLO. Is that a last chance encounter as far as the Gaza-Jericho deal goes? [Peres] We have still a long list of problems that should be solved, we are doing something which is unprecedented, we are doing something that you cannot draw any lessons from another experiment. So it takes time and we encounter problems that we didn't anticipate, but I am sure we shall go down the road -- it may take a month more or a month less, it doesn't matter, we shall arrive at the destination. [Snow] Is one of the biggest problems that's arisen since September been the question of whether Yasir 'Arafat really any longer leads a significant body of Palestinians with whom you can negotiate? [Peres] I wouldn't buy it. I think most of the Palestinians support peace, and maybe they support the PLO because they support peace, not the other way around. They need peace, we need peace, this is the naked truth which will accompany us more and more in the future. [Snow] Are you having to pursue a twin-track approach on this -- in other words are you in fact talking at some level with Hamas? [Peres] No, I don't think so. Hamas is clearly against peace, Hamas is clearly against the PLO, Hamas is trying to kill the people who support peace and to bring an end to peace itself, so I do not seen any room for compromise with Hamas. [Snow] Then presumably speed is of the essence however complex these last negotiations that you describe are. You surely have only got very limited time before you have somehow got to ... [Peres, interrupting] Why? [Snow] Well, because presumably with the passage of time frustration builds, support for Hamas is likely to build and the people with whom you are talking presumably become less relevant? [Peres] I am not sure. Well, anyway we have suggested the plan. The timing is in the hands of the Palestinians, if they want to make it fast it is OK with us, if they want to go slow it is their business. We would surely like to do it as soon as possible and as speedy as we can, but if they will try to postpone, to interrupt, to hesitate, it is their problem. We do not seek in any way to humiliate the Palestinians or to hurt their feelings, on the contrary we would like to see them in a dignified position, feeling well, feeling strong, feeling successful. Our only consideration is the security problems of Israel, but basically we would like to see this Palestinian story becoming a success story. We feel very strongly the better the neighbor feels, the better a neighbor we are having. [Snow] Foreign Minister, you have proved yourself an optimist by ever going to Washington in the first place to shake hands ... [Peres, interrupting] May I ask you, is it right to be an optimist or a pessimist, what can you do with pessimism? [Snow] Let me ask you with your optimistic hat on what are the chances then that this deal will go through and that we will see a settlement say within eight weeks? [Peres] No, eight weeks I wouldn't take, but it will go through undoubtedly. I suggest we have not the slightest reluctance or hesitation about our capacity and our determination for peace. [Snow] But the timetable? [Peres] I don't know, it may take weeks it may take months. I wish it would take weeks, but how can I tell how long it will take if I don't know yet what sort of problems we shall have to negotiate about. Until now I can say that we are able to overcome extremely complicated situations with ingenuity, with creativity, and since we see before our eyes a clear-cut goal, a clear-cut destination, and nobody will move us aside or derail us from the peace process. I am sure we shall arrive at the appointed station.
