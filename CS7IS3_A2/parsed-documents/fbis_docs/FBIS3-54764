They are carrying out their military service today under very difficult conditions. Let all the hopes of the people in epaulettes for an improved, calmer, dignified, and happier life come true. I sincerely wish all the families of servicemen and veterans of the armed forces confidence in tomorrow in the New Year. I extend special gratitude to all the servicemen who are at present courageously, I may say, selflessly carrying out their duties in the hot spots. May 1994 bring peace, quiet, and confidence in the future into each home. May all the bitterness with which the departing year was filled remain in the past, and may shots never ring out in our towns. I wish all citizens of Russia good health, happiness, love of life, and optimism in the New Year.
