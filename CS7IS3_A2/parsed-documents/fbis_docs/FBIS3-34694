Many believed that attaining this objective was not a matter of years or months, but of a few weeks, and then everything would be settled. The negotiations moved to Washington, then returned to the region. The nonpolitical negotiations continued to be held behind closed doors, making it impossible to know much about their results. However, what is leaked indicates that the experts are making great progress in all nonpolitical fields. This is a dangerous sign because it emphasizes that the Israelis want to get everything before even thinking about implementing the Security Council resolutions. The agreement that was signed in Cairo last Wednesday, and the subsequent Israeli statements, are merely naive attempts to extract butter from water. Reading the texts of this agreement does not satisfy the Arab citizen, in general, and the Palestinian citizen, in particular, that an achievement was attained, but that the exact opposite was realized. The Arab-Israeli negotiations are creeping slowly on their knees after their feet have become too tired to carry them. These negotiations are so slow that one can speak about many years before we see a real Israeli acceptance of Resolutions 242 and 338. Therefore, the nonpolitical Arab-Israeli negotiations and the agreements reached in these talks on water and environment, narcotics and smuggling, and school and university syllabuses, radio and television programs, tourism, and many other issues, represent something very dangerous. We hope that the Arab negotiator will refuse to sign anything before something is achieved on the political and military tracks, which have become marathon roads full of thorns, nails, and banana skins.
