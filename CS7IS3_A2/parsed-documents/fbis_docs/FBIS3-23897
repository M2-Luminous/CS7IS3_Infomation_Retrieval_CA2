But it is far from likely that every inhabitant of the region could say with certainty just what comprises the essence of the issue and what it is that our neighbors on the other side of the Amur are striving to attain. Naturally, quite a number of disputes and various positions have emerged on the subject of border demarcation. In this article Ivan Kandaurov, member of the Amur Region Russian Geographic Society, expresses his point of view. A great quantity of material has been written on demarcation of the Russian-Chinese border. But the individual, practical aspects of demarcation remain a secret for inhabitants of the Far East in general and the residents of Khabarovsk in particular. Nor do regular public presentations by Genrikh Vasilyevich Kireyev, special assignment ambassador of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and head of the demarcation effort, provide any clarification. No one disputes that the Russian-Chinese border must be put in order, because according to the Aygun (1858) and Beijing (1860) Treaties, in the interests of China (against whom England and France manifest aggression and there was danger that a unit from a British-French squadron would envelop China's rear using the Amur and Ussuri), the border was determined by the right bank of the Amur and left bank of the Ussuri, i.e., the water surface was controlled, and later assimilated, by the Russian side. According to the present protocol, the border is to be determined according to the generally recognized international principle: on navigable rivers--along the centerline of the main channel; on nonnavigable rivers--along the centerline of the river or its main branch. One would think such a formulation of the issue would suit the Chinese--they would get about 2,000 square kilometers of island territory in an entirely civilized resolution of the problem. However, attempting to take advantage of the unstable domestic situation in Russia, the Chinese desire to annex as well the Tarabarovo-Ussuri island group, whose total area amounts to about 30 square kilometers. Mikhail Gorbachev and Aleksandr Bessmertnykh signed a treaty on demarcation efforts (May 1991) at a time that was not the most advantageous for the Soviet Union (Russia). They were unable to secure a protocol on project implementation which would incorporate the entire border trace without excluding "certain sectors." Reaching agreement with the exception of "certain sectors" owing to the unyielding demand of the Chinese, our side found itself already in an unequal position, and the apple of discord remained for future generations. One of these exceptions is the section of border that runs along the Kazakevichevo Channel near Khabarovsk. A half-and-half decision in this instance is impermissible and fraught with the prospect of further border complications that could have unforeseen consequences. To facilitate the demarcation process, the 4,300 kilometers of border were split up into 10 sectors. There is a hidden danger here that efforts will be coordinated by sector beforehand, causing the overall picture to become fragmented and the problem of border sectors in dispute--the Kazakevichevo Channel for example--to fade from memory. This would clearly not be to Russia's advantage. Quite some time prior to the time demarcation efforts were begun, the Chinese had already decided the fate of the Tarabarovo-Ussuri islands. Thus, page 72 of the atlas of Heilongjiang Province, published back in 1986, shows the Tarabarovo-Ussuri islands as Chinese territory (!). This atlas is distributed at various international conferences, i.e., the concept is being imbued in people of the Far East that the Tarabarovo-Ussuri islands sooner or later will be transferred to China. Moreover, in designating these islands as a part of their territory, the Chinese have informed the entire world that the islands belong to China but are (in fact) within Russia. In other words, it happens that Russia is acting as the aggressor in this instance, having occupied lands belonging to China, and must therefore supposedly return them. The Chinese even invented a name for this island group--the Fuyuang Triangle. The Russians have repeatedly attempted to deepen the Kazakevichevo Channel, to make it navigable and admit Chinese river vessels from the Amur to the Ussuri through it, thereby reducing the journey. But the Chinese categorically object, believing that this is not a border channel, but a channel belonging to territorial China. Therefore, Chinese ships pass through at Chumka--precisely where our neighbors believe the border should pass. In this regard, whereas previously Chinese ships passing from the Amur to Amur Channel and back were accompanied by the Russian border service, now the Chinese exercise free reign. We know from the history of Russian-Chinese relations that these islands have belonged to Russia since the time of the signing of the Aygun and Beijing Treaties. Moreover, Russia has invested significant monetary and material resources in the exploitation and development of arable land on these islands and is utilizing them fairly actively to supply the people of Khabarovsk with agricultural products. The islands are included within the Khabarovsk Rural Rayon and belong chiefly to the agricultural enterprise Zarya. Older residents of Khabarovsk remember how some 20 or 30 years ago the waters of the Amur and Amur Channel met in a powerful current at the Amur (Muravyev) Cliffs. The flow velocity of the two currents was such that it was difficult for a motorboat to travel against them. This no longer happens, because the Amur has changed its course and now flows into the Beshenaya and Penza Channels. While the Ussuri islands are growing due to the formation of an ever enlarging spit which can clearly be seen from the Amur Cliffs even when the water is at mid-stage. Ecology experts have determined that the Amur is changing its course not in spontaneous fashion, but singlemindedly in the direction of the Russian shore under the influence of artful hydrotechnical structures set up by the Chinese on their shores. As a result, well known Damanskiy Island, in mid-stream of the Ussuri River, has been turned into a peninsula by the Chinese and taken away from Russia entirely apart from any demarcation effort, with the silent consent of the Russian leadership. The Chinese are going all out in the resolution of all the border issues and, unfortunately, success is presently accompanying them. If at Khabarovsk the border passes along the Amur main channel, and the Chinese consider that the Ussuri flows into the Amur Channel not at the village of Kazakevichevo but merges with the Amur at the Amur Cliffs, then as time passes Kabelnyy Island and others will join with the Tarabarovo-Ussuri group. And this is no fantasy. With such a solution to the problem, it may turn out that the railroad bridge (and tunnel as well) at Khabarovsk will pass through the territory of our adjacent state. Count Muravyev-Amurskiy, who signed the Aygun Treaty and prepared the signing of the Beijing Treaty, stated: "Russia's presence here is firm and long-standing!" God willing, may his prophecy come true. Genrikh Kireyev, in Khabarovsk in March of 1993, conducted several meetings with the leaders of Khabarovsk Kray in which he told those present that border demarcation efforts should be undertaken in a kind of semi-secret mode, without broad participation on the part of the concerned populace. L. Ivanyuta, former deputy head of administration of Khabarovsk Kray, became a member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs commission from Khabarovsk Kray on a purely formal basis. While Vladimir Vasilyevich Simakhin, chief inspector for geodesic oversight in the Far East (I note--in the entire Far East), lives and works in Khabarovsk, is a professionally trained specialist, and has an excellent understanding of the issues related to the determination of land and sea borders. And I believe his services would prove very useful to the commission of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. But Vladimir Vasilyevich has been spending a great deal of time attempting on his own to get into the commission of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on demarcation of the Russian-Chinese border. He has traveled to Moscow repeatedly, but all in vain. Taking advantage of an extremely favorable environment, the Chinese are hastening to get the demarcation work done, especially in those areas of the southern Maritime region where the border runs along dry land. The situation may change sharply for the Chinese if people accede to power in Russia who put first emphasis on the question of fighting for the interests of great Russia and its indigenous peoples who several centuries ago assimilated this semi-desert territory and initiated "Russian life on the Amur." When Khabarovsk Kray head of administration V. Ishayev stated in one of his interviews--"We will never agree to hand over the Great Ussuri and Tarabarovo Islands," the Chinese consulate in Khabarovsk immediately requested clarification: Was this the official position of the authorities or was the governor speaking as a private citizen? When Viktor Chernomyrdin was in Khabarovsk, he stated that we would not give up one inch of our land, including the islands near Khabarovsk. He stated this clearly in Russian--directly, openly, and firmly. But this is no consolation to the people of Khabarovsk. The problem remains an open issue. At this same conference, he also "removed" the problem of the Kuril Islands. But the development of events has shown that the problem remains. Territorial games have always concealed within themselves danger and unforeseen consequences. I therefore consider it necessary to petition the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a proposal to undertake measures and insert in the protocol an additional point on completing work on the border section which runs along the divide of the Kazakevichevo Channel (near the disputed Tarabarovo-Ussuri islands). This matter must be considered a vitally important issue for Khabarovsk Kray, especially for future generations. The issue should be officially presented before the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the inclusion of V. Simakhin, chief inspector for geodesic oversight in the Far East, as a member of the Commission on Demarcation of the Russian-Chinese Border. Petition should also be made to include G. Levkin within the joint Russian-Chinese working group for Khabarovsk Kray. Levkin is a reserve colonel, a topographer with higher education, a participant in the demarcation of the Russian-Mongolian border, a historian, and a student of local folklore. Until these questions are resolved, the work on demarcation in Khabarovsk Kray should be halted.
