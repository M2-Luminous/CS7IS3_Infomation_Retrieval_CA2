The session decided to elect Wang Chengxi and 29 others as additional members of the CPPCC National Committee. Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, attended the session, which was chaired by Vice Chairman Yang Rudai. According to a briefing, of the additional members, 16 are CPC and 14 are non-CPC members. They include three women, three ethnic minorities, three members of the democratic parties; and one representative from non-publicly owned economic sectors. After the addition, the CPPCC National Committee has a total of 2,097 members. Of them, 834 are CPC and 1,263 are non-CPC members, accounting for 39.75 percent and 60.25 percent of the total, respectively. The additional members are small in number, but they reflect the policy of "overall consideration and all-round arrangement" and are closely related with the current practical needs. Intellectuals account for a fairly large portion of the new members. Among them are academicians, professors, experts, and scholars, embodying the concept of respecting knowledge and talented people. There is also a fairly large number of celebrities from Hong Kong; they, a total of seven, are mostly people who have invested in the mainland and contributed to the country's opening up and economic construction. Paying attention to the arrangement of minority nationalities is a tradition of the CPPCC and a major component of the CPC's nationality policy. The three newly elected ethnic members are personages yielding some influence and having a high status in their respective localities and nationalities. A representative from non- publicly owned economic sectors, who is patriotic, respects his profession, and abides by the law, has also been elected. At the plenary session today, Wang Zhaoguo explained a proposed namelist (draft) of additional vice chairmen and Standing Committee members and election of a new secretary general of the Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee. At the session, Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, delivered a report on progress in the ongoing anticorruption drive. The report consists of three parts: Basic Assessment of the Nationwide Anticorruption Drive Since Last August; Experiences and Practices of the Anticorruption Drive in the Previous Stage; and Anticorruption Tasks in 1994. Noting that the CPPCC National Committee has all along paid close attention to and supported the anticorruption drive, Wei Jianxing urged all CPPCC National Committee members to, as always, care for and support the anticorruption drive by making suggestions, airing views, taking part in work inspections, and providing important clues to help investigate violations of law and discipline. According to him, this year CPPCC National Committee members will be invited to join supervisions and inspections organized by the Central Investigation Groups so that the anticorruption drive can be carried out in a thoroughgoing, sustained, and more effective manner. Vice Chairmen Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, Wang Zhaoguo, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Hong Xuezhi, Zhao Puchu, Qian Weichang, Hu Sheng, Qian Zhengying, Su Buqing, Ding Guangxun, Dong Yinchu, Sun Fuling, and Ann Tse-kai attended the session.
