Not long ago, labor disputes repeatedly broke out in foreign-funded enterprises, and some workers and staff even went on strike. Hence, the National People's Congress (NPC) started deliberating the "Labor Law" from April and is prepared to push the establishment of trade unions in foreign-funded enterprises within this year with a view to developing them into buffer organizations safeguarding worker and staff rights and interests and settling labor disputes. It was reported that from 1979 onwards, there are a total of more than 170,000 foreign-funded enterprises (including joint ventures, Sino-foreign cooperative enterprises, and enterprises solely invested by foreign businesses) with a real investment of $60 billion by Hong Kong, Taiwanese, and overseas businesses. It should be said that these foreign-funded enterprises have played a very great role in the mainland's economic construction and employment and brought about economic prosperity in various localities. However, foreign-funded enterprises have also caused many problems. In recent years, cases of employer infringement of workers' rights and interests and personal freedom frequently occurred. For example, in a Taiwanese-funded shoe-making factory in Fujian Province, Taiwanese businessmen surnamed Chang and Chen tied up and violently beat a female worker surnamed Yu who had stolen two pairs of shoes. Later, they even put the shoes up around her neck before the public and then locked her in a big iron cage, thus arousing public indignation. In another example, a piece of jewelry was lost in a joint-venture jewelry factory in Zhangjiang Township in Shanghai's Pudong New Area, the boss went so far as to order all female workers to take off their clothes so body searches could be made. In another case, a foreign-funded factory in Tianjin went so far as to issue "toilet-going cards" to workers and staff and stipulated that every worker could only go to the toilet for five minutes and anyone violating this rule would be fined. All these cases were violations of worker and staff personal dignity which contravened mainland labor decrees. Meanwhile, foreign employers of foreign-funded enterprises arbitrarily ordered workers and staff to work overtime with little or no overtime payment. In some cases, workers who had worked overtime till the early morning on the next day had to go to work as usual on that day. It is a widespread phenomenon in various localities that workers frequently work 12 to 16 hours in a row. According to the regulations, if workers go to work on statutory paid holidays, such as the New Year's Day and National Day, factory employers should pay them 50 percent or even 100 percent more than their daily wages. However, workers and staff in foreign-funded enterprises do not enjoy this benefit. In this way, labor disputes frequently break out. In addition, in order to seek superprofits, some Hong Kong and Taiwanese businesses often find ways to cut down worker and staff pay when enterprise interests come into conflict with that of workers and staff, such as using factory discipline and rules to hold down or deduct worker and staff pay. For example, although an eight-hour work system has been set as a mainland rule and Sundays are fixed as rest days, many foreign-funded enterprises stipulate in private that workers and staff must work overtime unconditionally, otherwise they will be punished and their pay will be deducted for staying away from work without good reason. In the "staff rules" set by a foreign-funded enterprise in Guangdong, as many as 46 of them are related to pay deductions and fines, and 80 percent of the workers and staff are punished every month! Even more serious is that many small and medium-sized foreign-funded factories generally neglect labor safety and lack protective equipment and fire prevention facilities. Consequently, accidents occur again and again. Last year, when two factories run by Hong Kong and Taiwanese businesses in Shenzhen and Fuzhou caught fire, workers could not escape because there were inadequate fire safety facilities and the front and back doors were locked, thus causing serious casualties. After receiving many complaints from workers and staff of foreign-funded enterprises, last December the All-China Federation of Trade Unions openly called on departments concerned to take measures to protect the personal safety and legitimate rights and interests of workers and staff of foreign-funded enterprises. By the end of last April, the mainland Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Public Security, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions jointly issued a circular strictly prohibiting foreign-funded and private enterprises from restricting worker and staff personal freedom by locking and shutting workshops and worker and staff living quarters. Enterprises committing criminal offenses will be investigated by judicial organs to see whether they have criminal responsibility. Before and after the NPC deliberated the "Labor Law" last April, Guangdong and some other provinces and municipalities responded to the call and made preparations for helping foreign-funded enterprises set up trade unions. The trade unions can be considered as organizations negotiating with employers on improving labor conditions, safety facilities, and pay and welfare, and as the buffer zone of labor disputes to prevent workers and staff from going on strike because of undue demands and to protect employers' and employees' justifed rights and interests.
