In a statement released here, Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the State Duma (lower house of the parliament), noted that the exact number of victims of NATO air strikes at Serb positions near the Bosnian town of Gorazde is still unknown and the military losses and the number of existence of civilian casualties have not been reported. The statement said the air strike against Bosnian Serbs showed that NATO has easily ignored not only the view of Russia, but also the achieved agreements. "We demand an immediate end to the unilateral, unsanctioned use of military force by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and urge the parliaments of all the states of the world to actively contribute to the process of achieving a peaceful political settlement of the Yugoslav crisis," the statement said. According to the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY, the Duma speaker said on another occasion earlier today that NATO air strikes against the positions of Bosnian Serbs may be "an obstacle" to Russia's joining NATO's "partnership for peace" program.
