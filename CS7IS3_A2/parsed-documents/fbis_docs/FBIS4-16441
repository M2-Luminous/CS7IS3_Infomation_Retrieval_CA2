He declared in an interview with Interfax on Saturday that many lawmakers would not sign the document offered by the auditing group. The draft consists of three warnings, unacceptable for many: do not touch, as Zyuganov put it, those who are in power and those who led the country to this state, do not touch the constitution, pulled through by one third of the votes, and forget everything that happened in Moscow on October 3-4. In return, he said, we are promised not to be insulted, but the opposition is not guaranteed the possibility of using media, above all television. This is a straight jacket rather than terms, Zyuganov believes. In his words, the communist faction in the Duma has formulated basic terms conditions for civic concord and is ready to submit them early next week. These terms include a demand to change the economic course, leading to a social disaster. The communists also insist on forming a national trust government, comprising representatives of the various political forces that won the elections on December 12. The current government, Zyuganov said, was formed by one force - first by Russia's Choice and then somewhat expanded at the expense of Unity and Concord Party, which is represented in the cabinet by Deputy Premiers Sergey Shakhray and Aleksandr Shokhin. Besides, as Zyuganov argues, the document must spell out urgent measures to curb the crime, index pensions, compensate for depreciated bank savings, and pay wages.
