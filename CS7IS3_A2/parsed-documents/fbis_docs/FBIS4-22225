A year and a half ago, as the right-hand man of UAPTs [Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church] Patriarch Mstislav, he took part without the knowledge of the leader of his church in dealings sanctioned by the ruling nomenklatura--the infamous unification of the Orthodox churches of Ukraine--and for all that time steadfastly repelled attacks on its blood offspring, the UPTs-Kievan Patriarchate [UPTs-KP] and the defrocked monk Filaret, rescued from political oblivion. The results of the unification, as should have been expected, were lamentable. Instead of two Orthodox churches in Ukraine, there have come to be three. The people did not go to the "unified" church (the UPTs-KP). UAPTs Patriarch Mstislav, demeaned by state bureaucrats and betrayed by his former comrades-in-arms, has died. The autocephalous church itself, which they abolished without its own knowledge, has come under the repression of the authorities. The historical Orthodox Church of Ukraine--the UPTs of Vladimir (Sabodan)--has begun to be blackened in the presidential/Filaret mass media and on Ukrainian television, and the search for "traitors," non-patriots and "agents of Moscow" has started. The heretofore unprecedented stormings of Orthodox cathedrals by Cossacks and UNSO people have shaken the already brittle civil peace in Ukraine. The policies of L. Kravchuk and his team in the field of religion, in short, have led to a crisis in Ukrainian Orthodoxy and a schism in it. The bishops, tired of the lies and unreconciled to the role of puppets to which they have been relegated, have begun to quit the UPTs-KP (there have already been more than ten). One of the founders of the Kievan Patriarchate and the business manager of that church, Metropolitan Antoniy (Masendich), has also finally left. [V. Anisimov] Archbishop, you are one of the founding fathers of the UPTs-KP. Many unpleasant rumors are currently circulating around the unification of the church, which many, including the General Procurator of Ukraine, still consider to be illegal... [Metropolitan Antoniy] I will not conceal the fact that my departure from the Russian Orthodox Church was dictated by patriotic aspirations. The programs of the Liberty and Voice of America radio stations prompted me to that, so that I could leave for Ukraine. You know my activity of that period. I came to Bondarchuk, at the time the Metropolitan Ioann (UAPTs). I of course had the desire to see that the Orthodox Church in Ukraine became independent. At Bondarchuk's they convinced me that the episcopal ordinations of his organization were canonical (I appealed to Metropolitan Andrey and Filaret's now-bishop Daniil on that score). In coming to the UAPTs, I understood that our church would have to be in isolation, but I had no doubt that the Moscow Patriarchate would in time grant autocephaly to the UPTs, and there would be a unified Orthodox Church in Ukraine in union with the Russian and other local churches of world Orthodoxy. Who could suppose that I would become an enemy of the canonical priesthood in which I served for ten years, and they my enemies? That has subsequently been a constant source of pain for me. I have been able to rise high up the ecclesiastical ladder of the UAPTs thanks to Patriarch Mstislav. I did not intend to go to Kiev, by the way, but the patriarch himself sent me there. [V. Anisimov] You became the number two person in the UAPTs and, essentially, have been leading this church in Ukraine? [Metropolitan Antoniy] Yes. I assumed that I would be able to make use of my high position. So as to move closer to the legitimate Orthodox Church, and seek out ways by which the UAPTs would gain canonical status. And everything was moving toward that. But the Metropolitan Filaret was standing in the way. He was the designated successor of the UPTs at the time, and you know his sharp statements against autocephaly. I was on a visited to Kharkov when a report came in that Filaret had gone into retirement. That was a joyous event, of course; I called the Council for Religious Affairs and asked whether it was not time to congratulate the Metropolitan Vladimir (Sabodan). I assumed that it would be namely he, enjoying a great reputation within Orthodoxy, who would head the Ukrainian church. They told me, however, to hold off for the time being. Meanwhile Filaret, having promised to retire, changed course sharply upon his return to Kiev. Rumors moreover began reaching me that Bishop of our church Vladimir (Romanyuk) had begun appearing with Filaret. Romanyuk told me that he had discussed with Filaret questions of bringing the positions of our churches closer together. But there was no talk of a unification with Filaret, since I have known him since I had been a cleric of the RPTs [Russian Orthodox Church] and member of the local synod that had elected Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church Aleksey II, and I had no illusions with regard to Filaret. Events, however, had begun to develop rapidly. The UAPTs was just preparing to celebrate the second anniversary of the synod that elected Patriarch Mstislav. The patriarch, having blessed its holding, was not able to attend. I was given authority at the synod (owing to the absence of the patriarch) to make decisions at my own discretion, after telephone consultations with Mstislav. Then I was unexpectedly called by Filaret's personal assistant, who passed along a request for a meeting. I went. Filaret was in a terrible fright, since the clergy of the UPTs had now come to accept the residency of the designated successor of the UPTs at Pushkinskaya (this was impeded at the time by the UNSO and the police.--V.A.). I told Filaret, "If you do not go, they will punish you, take away your holy office." He brushed it aside: they wouldn't dare to do that, since the church and many of the higher clergy supposedly stood behind him. Then Kiev ceremoniously welcomed the new designated successor of the UPTs Vladimir (Sabodan). His first service was at the Kiev-Pecherskaya monastery, and I of course went to the night services. But some monk recognized me and fell upon me: "You are a schismatic, and there is nothing for you to do here." That stung me very much. After the service I went by Vladimir Cathedral. It was closed (the Filaret people were afraid that the faithful would hand it over to the legitimate church--the UPTs.--V.A.), but a service was underway. They met me joyously, to my surprise. Bishop Spiridon announced straight away that here, as he said, the Muscovites have seized everything, and therefore we will have an association with the autocephalous church, which came to us for help. I did not understand anything. I knew that UNSO had risen in defense of Filaret, but I did not understand what the UAPTs was doing here. Spiridon reported that a unification synod had already been planned, and we would be together. I said "Archbishop, whatever are you talking about, what unification? I am the metropolitan, the business manager for the UAPTs, and I don't know anything." Spiridon answered that Vladimir (Romanyuk) had already agreed on everything with Filaret. But who is this Romanyuk? He is just a vicar bishop, and has no right to agree on anything with anyone. Spiridon came to see me again in the evening at Trekhsvyatitelskaya, and tried to convince me to meet with Filaret. I acceded to his request... Filaret was agitated. I sympathized somewhat: it is hard, I said, to part with the money, with the exarchate building, the Vladimir Cathedral. He got right to the point: "If I transfer to your accounts the money of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, where is the guarantee that you will not take it?" (four billion karbovantsi, according to some reports.--V.A.). I naturally couldn't sleep all night, trying to get in touch with the Patriarch Mstislav in order to find out how to behave and what to do. But I couldn't reach him, either at the office or at home. In the morning, realizing what the consequences of this action could be, I left the city, having resolved not to undertake anything without the patriarch. But I was now not able to avoid it. A delegation appeared in my office at Trekhsvyatitelskaya: Pavlychko, Chervoniy, Porovskiy, Skorik, Ternopolskiy etc. They announced immediately that they had been given the assignment of convening a unification synod of the UAPTs. You know what events are occurring, we must act immediately. I was stubborn: I do not have the right to do that, I said. You must, this is a directive of the President of Ukraine, was the answer. [V. Anisimov] You mean to say that the initiator of the wheeling and dealing for the rescue of Filaret and the donations of Ukrainian Orthodoxy appropriated by him was Leonid Kravchuk? [Metropolitan Antoniy] I had a great many doubts on just that score myself. They were evidently simply using his name. They knew, after all, that I wouldn't pick up the phone and call--is it true, Leonid Makarovich? The deputies, of course, asserted that all of the higher officials coming out against Filaret would be removed from their positions. Kolesnik (the Filaret supporter Zinchenko took his place) and Pilipenko (Procurator General Shishkin, who had protested the unification synod, suffered the same fate a year later--V.A.) really did soon "fall." The deputies moreover promised that the President would hand over Sofiya Kiev and all the rest to us if we would accept Filaret. Kravchuk and Filaret are of course linked by 30 years of joint work in the ideological field, and they say that they are even dacha neighbors (I, by the way, have never had the honor of being in their company and participating in their confidential discussions). I nonetheless do not think that the President has an unequivocal attitude toward the UPTs-KP. I also consented to unification because the deputies assured me that Filaret would be in the leadership for only three or four months, and then they would "carry him off to his rest." It is, after all, a disgrace even for one's own children to associate with someone deprived of his holy office and exposed in the press. Filaret himself said that he would have no claim to authority in the church, but that means that the opportunity has appeared before us for negotiations and unification with the canonical Orthodox Church of Ukraine. [V. Anisimov] You were not surprised that half of the deputy-tempters were Greco-Catholics? What relation do they have to Orthodoxy? Why were they not, say, seeking the unification of their own church with the Catholic Church in Rome and independence from the Rome patriarchate? [Metropolitan Antoniy] That, of course, put me on guard. I declared that I should consult with the Patriarch Mstislav (after all, he cannot stand Filaret). Pavlychko snapped that this was not my concern at all: it would be easier to call the patriarch from the President's residence and smooth everything over. What was left for me to do? I promised the deputies I would report to all the bishops and consult. No, they insisted. We are going to Filaret right now to coordinate the terms of the unification and so forth. They had to go. The conversation with Filaret was reduced to one thing--everyone was in danger. The Metropolitan Vladimir (Sabodan) is gathering a synod at the monastery, after which all of the property would pass to the UPTs. We were thus obliged to outrace them. I was surprised: "But there are three days left. Who would have time to organize a synod in that time?" "Convene immediately for Thursday, and there will be a joint service in Kiev as early as Friday," was the reply. That night I tried again to get hold of the patriarch and even sent him a fax, but there was no answer. Then I called Archbishop Andrey of Ivano-Frankivsk (headed of the largest diocese of the UAPTs). I told him that we were being promised Sofiya and all the rest, and asked for advice. If Andrey had not supported me, then I would not have risked convening the higher orders of the clergy. But he said that the patriarch was abroad, and we evidently had to heed what the deputies were saying. I called around to the bishops, and called them to Kiev immediately. But I did not tell them the purpose. They assembled on Thursday morning (with the exception of Peter Lviv (who was ill) and Vasiliy Ternopol). The deputies came as well--aside from the company already mentioned, Zinchenko came, as well as Viktor Burlakov from Rukh, who today heads something in the SBU. I was informing the bishops when Andrey Ivano-Frankivsk suddenly rose and declared unceremoniously that he would not enter into any unification whatsoever. Larisa Skorik and Romanyuk pounced on the "striker" at once: you, they said, are a traitor, an agent of Moscow etc. But the threats did not have any effect: three bishops--Andrey, Anatoliy (Fialko) and Nikolay (Grokh)--left the synod right then. The ill Peter Lviv was represented by Vladimir Yarema. He went to the synod, which caused a great scandal with Chervoniy. Had there been no pressure from the deputies, and they were still there in force, neither I nor the bishops would have gone for unification for anything. Filaret has moreover asserted that the UPTs bishops support him. But none of the twelve members of the higher clergy went for Filaret. We were to serve in Sofiya on the second day of the synod. And Filaret suddenly announced that I could not serve with the bishops of the UAPTs. That is, those that had received and saved him! Then I had to threaten that I would not only come, but that I would also report who he in fact was--an ordinary monk. Filaret, as you know, by the way, had not yet left the jurisdiction of the Moscow patriarchate. This, I think, is some latest bit of cunning of his, and there is something behind it. The deputies now began to pressure Filaret. He boasted, go ahead, let him call the President, but all the same consented first to serving at the prayer service, and then the liturgy as well. That is how the infamous unification occurred. It was, of course, not legitimate. Our synod, if you go by the charter and the canons, was not legitimate. It did not lead to a unification, but rather to an even greater schism. And Filaret and his deputies are to blame for it. Without them we would have long ago found common tongue with both Metropolitan Vladimir (Sabodan) and with world Orthodoxy. I have always had great respect for both the UAPTs and for Vladimir Yarena (today UAPTs Patriarch Dimitriy I.--V.A.). The Orthodox would have lost all their cathedrals in Western Ukraine if there had been no UAPTs, thanks to which Orthodoxy was preserved in those lands. [V. Anisimov] But the synod "decided to consider" Mstislav as patriarch of the UPTs-KP, and Filaret as his deputy. What were the relations between them? [Metropolitan Antoniy] None whatsoever. You understand for whose sake that was done. The Patriarch could not stand Filaret. I feel great guilt before Mstislav, who did a great deal of good for me even though I acted against his will... There was nothing for me to fear then, of course--go on a boycott. But how could I act against, as the deputies asserted, the will of the President? Having come with Filaret from Constantinople, we should have gone to Mstislav. The deputies, after all, presented the patriarch with an ultimatum: either you accept Filaret, or you stay in complete isolation. Mstislav was staying at the Zhovtneva Hotel at the time, and immediately asked, where is Antoniy? I was of course afraid to go to him, but I went. I explained everything, I told him of the President's request, and he answered, this clears up the picture somewhat, but you deserve to be punished all the same. I prevailed upon him to accept Filaret, and he refused point-blank. Chervoniy, Porovskiy, Skorik came by to see him--for naught. Mstislav finally softened: he is not against unification, he said, but what does he need this "deputy" for, that people are laughing at around the world? Only before his departure was Mstislav compelled to accept Filaret--they spoke one on one for about fifteen minutes. When leaving, the patriarch asked that he be escorted without Filaret. But Filaret went to Borispol all the same. Their meetings were thus always forced. There was simply nowhere for Mstislav to go, even though he could not abide either Filaret or Romanyuk. [V. Anisimov] But why Romanyuk? [Metropolitan Antoniy] I do not know, perhaps because of the undignified behavior of Romanyuk in confinement, there were stories about him, or perhaps hostility that had arisen back in America had an effect. The patriarch clapped me on the shoulder one day and said, "If you want to be my friend, do not mention Romanyuk to me any more." Romanyuk was in general under some kind of hypnosis from Filaret; even now, as the patriarch, he blindly does everything he is ordered. [V. Anisimov] But why first a locum tenens, and then namely he elected patriarch? [Metropolitan Antoniy] When Mstislav died, it suddenly became clear that Filaret wouldn't mind taking his place. Zinchenko, it seemed to me, did not object to that either. I thus had to state bluntly to the "sullied" claimant: you cannot be a locum tenens, since Western Ukraine would break away from us immediately. The faithful and the higher clergy, after all, could tolerate him as a bishop but in no way consider him a leader. Filaret never goes to Lvov or Ternopol. The election of Romanyuk was the sole way out of the situation to preserve the unity of the UPTs-KP. The deputies nonetheless undertook a mighty attempt, at the synod, to drag Filaret in as a candidate for patriarch. Chervoniy, Porovskiy, Skorik et al. were solidly behind him. I do not want to whitewash the communist regime, the plenipotentiaries and so on, but I will say frankly that even the communists did not interfere in the internal affairs of the church, they did not exert any pressure on it. Chervoniy stood at one microphone and Porovskiy at the other at the synod, as if at a session of parliament, and started a cross fire. Only the d√©marche of the former UAPTs bishops (we left the hall) kept them from shoving Filaret into the patriarchy. They then decided to deal with me at the synod. Only the protection of Romanyuk, just elected patriarch (he threatened to pass his patriarch's cowl to the people's deputies) curbed their zeal. The call of Zhulinskiy, who said that all--both Romanyuk and I--should remain in their places, perhaps also played a role. [V. Anisimov] And can a state of affairs be deemed normal when the deputies run the church, and calls come from the President indicating who should stay in what places? [Metropolitan Antoniy] That is normal here in Ukraine. The intervention of forces outside the church into church affairs has crossed all boundaries. The deputies, Zinchenko--they are constant guests of Filaret, they sit in on holy synods and essentially run the church, giving commands to the higher clergy. Zinchenko could even order, say, archbishop Spiridon removed from Vinnitsa. Filaret is also supported by the "power structures"--he is a friend of Nedrigaylo, and an even greater one of Boris Tabachek, a superior of the Vladimir synod. The police, together with the Filaret people, undertake storm-trooper type acts against the Kiev-Pechorskaya monastery. The misfortune of Christianity in Ukraine in general is the fact that various political forces have seeped into the church, and each is trying to use its influence on people for its own ends. The church was not able to dissociate itself from them in time. As a result the UAPTs has its own politicians, and the UPTs-KP has its own. This is a tragedy. If all denominations were to assemble and say, that's enough, let the politicians engage in politics, the church has its own purpose--to go to the hospitals, schools, prisons, almshouses, children's homes--then the church would not be split into pieces, and the stances of the conflicting sides today would move closer together. That is just why I left the UPTs-KP: I do not want to be the screen behind which someone's political capital is accumulated. I signed some piece of paper at one time for Levka Lukyanenko. Today Chervoniy, Skorik, Porovskiy, Zinchenko etc. need the UPTs-KP first and foremost. [V. Anisimov] You are saying very harsh things. You would agree that faith is an intimate matter. To get into the souls of people, to provoke a schism of the Orthodox for the sake of some "political capital," is just too cynical. [Metropolitan Antoniy] You see, they will again be put forward for parliament according to the districts where they have seized the cathedrals, where the UPTs-KP has support among the population. Take Ternopolskiy, as far as I know he is being put forward from Ternopol Oblast... Why, say, are Chervoniy or Porovskiy not going to Eastern Ukraine? This same Porovskiy, after all, worked a great deal in Crimea on its Ukrainization. Why doesn't he stand there? They even lie to their own voters. Chervoniy, for example, knows that the Rivne area does not support Filaret. And after the synod, coming to Rivne, he says to the faithful face to face, you know I voted for Romanyuk at the synod, but archbishop of Rivne Roman supported Filaret. That was to discredit the higher clergy in the eyes of the people. That is even though I will testify that everything was the other way around--it was precisely Chervoniy himself who insisted on the candidacy of Filaret. Our tragedy is the fact that non-church people have attached themselves to the church. They have nowhere else to go. Both Porovskiy and Chervoniy are former Komsomol workers, and Zinchenko, as far as I know, got through the elections in Vinnitsa Oblast on the democratic platform of the CPSU. The situation changes, what can they do? They wisely decide to head for the church. And if they had come to the church with pure feelings, with repentance, that would have been noteworthy. But they came in order to rule once more, and to foist their own foolish policies onto the church. I am not sure that any of them has even read the Bible at all. And the people's deputies have given the churchmen a thankless role: exploiting the patriotic feelings of the faithful, creating a base for the elections by deft parliamentary maneuverings. I am thus convinced that to remain in this church and lie to the faithful is a great sin. Filaret receives humanitarian assistance from the former army of the GDR, he clothes and shods the Cossacks of Chervoniy, and they storm the cathedrals for Filaret--there's a good example of mutual support for you. It is not for nothing that Porovskiy has somehow flattered the all-powerful Filaret--how I used to hate you, he says! But now I am ready to get on my knees before you. [V. Anisimov] And what about UPTs-KP Patriarch Vladimir (Romanyuk)? [Metropolitan Antoniy] He has no support among the bishops with our departure. And Filaret rules the ball. According to information that is still unverified, he is doing everything to drive Romanyuk to drink. [V. Anisimov] But it is no secret, after all, that Romanyuk loved to drink even when a bishop, is it? [Metropolitan Antoniy] Unfortunately. But he had a heart problem after the events in Lutsk, and he limited his use of spirits. I am for some reason convinced that Romanyuk is leaving. I respect him as a person who has been persecuted, and I think that he does not want to dance to Filaret's tune for very long. [V. Anisimov] So then why does the UNSO support Romanyuk? [Metropolitan Antoniy] I must honestly admit that I do not know, although Romanyuk really does have a great deal of influence on it. [V. Anisimov] But after all, you also took part in seizing cathedrals, for example in Ternopol? [Metropolitan Antoniy] I am not guilty of the events in Ternopol, I give you my word. I was talking with the bishops and clergy at the church when Chervoniy gave the command to the Cossacks to seize the home of UPTs bishop Sergey. First he appeared before the clergy with a proposal to organize a Ternopol Cossack host and announce a collection of funds for those purposes. Then he went to Sergey, where there were a bookkeeper, guard and domestics. Then the Cossacks stood up for the ataman himself. The forces were unequal, and after a small skirmish the Cossacks drove everyone from the gates. Chervoniy sent a courier to the autocephalous clergy: come and lend a hand, he said, we are taking the house for you. I wanted to go there at once, but my car was blocked. I think that was a planned provocation against me by Chervoniy, so as to portray me as a terrorist: wherever Antoniy appears, there is a battle immediately. The next day the building was returned to the UPTs. [V. Anisimov] How many parishes are there in the UPTs-KP in Ukraine today? [Metropolitan Antoniy] One and a half thousand. This is an influential organization only in Western Ukraine. If the Kiev diocese, which numbers some hundred active parishes (another hundred on paper), leaves the UPTs-KP, then Filaret's church will simply cease to exist. I feel that a house built on sand will not last long. Falsehoods and lies will out all the same. This church will inevitably disintegrate. [V. Anisimov] So why have you not returned to the UAPTs or not gone to the UPTs, like the other bishops? [Metropolitan Antoniy] I studied at a seminary of the Russian Orthodox Church, and served as a clergyman in it for ten years... I returned to the canonical church, far from Filaret and his intrigues and provocations. I feel that Ukraine will have its own autocephalous, canonical Orthodox church, and that will be the UPTs of Metropolitan Sabodan. The church should be with the people, and if the people have come out for independence, then their church should also move toward independence.
