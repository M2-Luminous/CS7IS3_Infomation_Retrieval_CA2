The spokesman said that President Li Teng-hui is not persona non grata. Besides, his visit to Thailand was a private visit; he was not even the guest of the Thai private sector. There is no reason at all for Thailand to prevent President Li Teng-hui from visiting the country. Concerning Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan's meeting with President Li Teng-hui when he visited Thailand, the spokesman said the meeting was private. Regarding the luncheon hosted by House of Representatives Speaker Marut Bunnak for President Li Teng-hui, the spokesman said it was a parliamentary affair and the government had no business interfering with it. The spokesman for the Prime Minister's Office reiterated that Thailand is a free country, and anyone who is not persona non grata can visit. The government, meanwhile, has reaffirmed its one China stance, and hopes that the PRC does not become too worried about the issue. The spokesman said he believes the Foreign Ministry will be able to make China understand this.
