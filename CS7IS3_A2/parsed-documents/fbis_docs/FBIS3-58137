It will extend the EC's Single Market to Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, members of the European Free Trade Association [EFTA]. Richard Needham, Minister for Trade, Welcomed the Launch of the EEA "The EEA will bring new export opportunities for UK companies. The EEA covers 17 countries extending from the Arctic to the Mediterranean. It removes single market nontariff barriers, such as national standards, for businesses selling to some 370 million consumers, in an area representing 40 percent of the world's trade. Although not a Customs Union, the EEA will provide for free movement of goods, services, capital and people. By taking on 1,500 of the EC's single market measures, the EFTA states will have to open areas of their markets previously closed to UK exporters. For example: - Public purchasing contracts will have to be open to our companies; - Many of EFTA's technical standards for products will have to be aligned with those set by the EC; - The EFTA states will be subject to rules on competition and state aid based on the Community's rules; - Financial services markets will be opened up giving UK firms greater freedom to open branches in EFTA states; - UK professionals will be able to practice in the EFTA states without the need to requalify; - UK companies will benefit from EFTA co-operation in EC programmes on R&D, education, youth and training, small- and medium-sized enterprises, tourism and audiovisual services. "UK companies are well placed to take advantage of the Agreement. In 1992 we made 5.7 billion pounds of visible exports to the EFTA states that will participate in the EEA. The Agreement will enable UK business to build on that excellent performance." Notes for Editors 1. The European Economic Area Agreement was signed in Oporto on 2 May 1992. Entry into force had to await ratification of the Agreement by all the participating EC and EFTA states. The last states to ratify, France and Spain, did so on 10 December 1993. 2. Switzerland, also an EFTA member, decided in a referendum in December 1992 not to participate in the EEA. The need to amend the Agreement to exclude Switzerland [in a Protocol signed on 17 March 1993] delayed the original target date for entry into force (1 January 1993). Liechtenstein will join the EEA at a date after 1 January 1994 yet to be decided, due to the need to make special arrangements arising from its close trading ties with Switzerland [with which it has a customs union]. 3. The UK ratified the EEA on 15 November 1993. The Agreement will be implemented in the UK by the European Economic Area Act 1993. 4. Since the EEA Agreement was signed, negotiations on full EU [European Union] membership have started with four of the participating EFTA states -- Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden. The Edinburgh European Council set a target for the entry of these four applicants into the EU by 1 January 1995.
