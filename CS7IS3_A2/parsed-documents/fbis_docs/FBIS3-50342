The high-ranking VJ officer further said: "We are not excluding the possibility that citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia -- former members of the VJ among them -- are fighting on the side of the Army of the Serb Republic as volunteers. We are certain that both the domestic and the world public are aware of the fact that a large number of mercenaries, fanatics, adventurers, and volunteers from the Islamic countries are fighting against the Serbs as members of the Muslim army in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Volunteers from the FRY, as free people, cannot be denied the right to decide on their own fate and fight for the survival of their people, especially since Islamic fanaticism has acquired planetary proportions in its struggle against the Serbs. VJ troops and heavy weapons have not been moved towards Bosnia or any other state. They are deployed exclusively on the sovereign territory of the FRY, in accordance with assessments on the creation of the most favorable conditions for the defense of the sovereignty and peace of the FRY and its citizens. The latest accusations against the VJ directly justify these precautions," said the spokesman for the VJ general staff.
