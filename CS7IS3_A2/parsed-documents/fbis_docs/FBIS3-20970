The effects on the material induced by a laser pulse are produced in a very short period of time and in small areas. Exact knowledge about these effects is important for optimal laser utilization. However, there are two goals in observation. First, the observation procedure must possess high magnification. It should also possess high temporal resolution in order to be able to represent the effects of individual laser pulses. Professor Oleg Bostanjoglo and his colleagues from the Optical Institute of the Berlin Technical University (Strasse des 17. Juni 135, 10623 Berlin) have now developed a high-speed electron microscope (EM) linked with a pulsed laser which possesses the necessary properties. The device makes it possible to depict precisely laser-induced crystallization and vaporization processes. According to Bostanjoglo, large effects can be produced in small target areas by irradiating material with pulsed lasers. The high heating and cooling rates lead to the formation of new phases and structures in the irradiated materials which are not attainable using other methods. The technical utilization of the laser is only in its infancy, but has already led to important applications. These include the boring of very small holes, the labeling of components, the hardening of metal surfaces and employment in digital optical read/write memory. Until now the electron microscope has been of only limited use in the investigation of microscopic effects, since while it is sensitive to structure and possesses high resolution spatially, in conventional use it possesses only low temporal resolution. The Berlin scientists have thus converted a commercial electron microscope into a high-speed apparatus.In principle, rapid-exposure photographs can be made in two ways. In continuous operation the sample is constantly irradiated by the electron beam, that is both during and after the laser bombardment. With the help of a scintillator-storage-oscilloscope combination as a detector the individual phases can then be observed with high temporal resolution. The second possibility is that of producing rapid-exposurejphotographs of laser processing with the help of an image enhancer. These photographs are produced by pulses either from the source of illumination or from the image enhancer.In order to investigate the direct effect of the laser beam on the sample, a Nd:YAG laser is combined with the high-speed EM. The laser*beam pulse is focused on the sample in the EM by a laser objective and a deflecting mirror which has a hole for the electron beam. The laser beam and the electron beam run in parallel in the same direction and thus make it possible to investigate the laser effects in real time in a controlled way. The Berlin high-speed electron microscope makes it possible to take rapid-exposure photographs with illumination times from five nanoseconds. The interval between pictures is between 30 nanoseconds and a few microseconds. Both reflective EM investigations of massive materials and transmission EM observations of thin layers can be carried out. The individual pictures can be combined into a "film" in order to observe the dynamics of laser-induced material transformation. Investigations with the high-speed EM have thus far been directed towards research on crystallization processes in semiconductors, structural changes in metals during laser processing, and laser-induced vaporization of thin layers. These researchers aim to achieve a better understanding of laser processing procedures like removal, alloyage, recrystallization, grain formation and vitrification. The projects are being supported by the German Research Association.
