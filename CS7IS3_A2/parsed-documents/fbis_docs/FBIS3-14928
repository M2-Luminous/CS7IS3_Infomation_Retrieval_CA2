Ilyukhin found "it difficult to understand from the oblique formulations of the decree what caused the dismissal of the FCIS director general." He assumed that the real cause were the last September and October events when the former Security Ministry "showed adherence to the Constitution and doubted the constitutionality of the presidential decree 1400 of September 21." Ilyukhin thought that this was also the reason why a decision was made last December to dismantle the ministry and transform it into the Federal Counterintelligence Service -- with much smaller powers. The dismissal of Golushko might displease the FCIS personnel. "It is the president's usual technique, to have an agency dismantled by somebody he does not like and then dismiss him."
