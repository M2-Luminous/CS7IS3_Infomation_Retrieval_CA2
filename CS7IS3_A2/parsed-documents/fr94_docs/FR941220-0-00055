FR941220-0-00055 FR941220-0-00010 Erosion from poor land use practices causes extensive topsoil erosion and subsequent siltation of stream bottoms. Sources of siltation include timber clearcutting, clearing of riparian vegetation, and those construction, mining, and agricultural practices that allow exposed earth to enter streams. Light to moderate levels of siltation are ubiquitous in many streams of the Etowah River system which have populations of the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter. Siltation problems are severe in many tributaries that have or probably had populations of the Cherokee darter, including Allatoona Creek, the Little River system, Settingdown Creek, Pumpkinvine Creek, and portions of Shoal Creek (Cherokee County), Sharp Mountain Creek, Long Swamp Creek, and Raccoon Creek. Siltation and dust from marble quarries in Pickens County are also major problems in Long Swamp Creek, the only known site where the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter are found together. A rock quarry has been proposed for Stamp Creek in Bartow County. If permitted, this quarry may have an adverse effect on the Stamp Creek Cherokee darter population. The extreme isolation or absence of populations of the Cherokee darter in Settingdown, Allatoona, and Raccoon Creeks and the Little River also strongly suggests localized extirpation of populations. These intermediate streams probably once supported populations of the fish. Much of the Little River system is heavily affected by large silt and bed loads; the remaining fish fauna is depauperate and at many sites dominated by species tolerant of degraded habitats. The Cherokee darter and Etowah darter are obligate benthic species living, foraging, and spawning on the stream bottom. Hence, their well-being is directly tied to benthic habitat quality. Negative effects of silt on benthic fishes were summarized by Burkhead and Jenkins (1991). Silt reduces or destroys habitat heterogeneity and primary productivity, increases fish egg and larval mortality, abrades organisms, and alters, degrades, and entombs macrobenthic communities. The geological strata drained by the Etowah River, particularly in the middle and upper portion of the system, contain micaceous schist. The erosion of this substrata adds an extremely abrasive mica component to the silt which must render this silt even more noxious to benthic organisms. Current State and Federal regulations preventing silt from entering streams are lacking, inadequate, or not rigorously enforced. The current rate of development in the counties surrounding Atlanta is very high. The most rapid development appears to be in Gwinnett, Cobb and Fulton Counties, but it is also high in Cherokee County, which is in the heart of the Cherokee darter's current range. The effects of creeping urbanization may be seen as far away as Dawson County, where the majority of Etowah darter populations, as well as some Cherokee darter populations, are known. One of the principal concerns to the continued existence of the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter is the trend of converting farmland into localized subdivisions in areas relatively remote from Atlanta. Associated with increased development and land clearing is increased siltation from erosion, accelerated runoff, and transport of pollutants into the Etowah River system. The tributaries harboring the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter are crossed by numerous road and railroad bridges. These stream crossings are potential sites for accidents which could spill toxic material into streams. Spills of toxic chemicals at such crossings could cause catastrophic fish kills and local extirpation of these species. The high number of bridge crossings over Cherokee darter and Etowah darter streams increases the probability that such an accident will occur in the future. Attending the urbanization associated with the growth of the Atlanta metropolitan area is a proposed bypass that would circumnavigate Atlanta to the northwest, connecting Interstate 75 with Georgia State Route 371. The bypass would cross several Cherokee darter streams in portions of Forsyth, Cherokee, and Bartow Counties. It will also traverse the Etowah River at the lower portion of the Etowah darter's range. Bridge construction sites, some located in the upper Etowah River watershed, would be potential sources of sedimentation to Cherokee and Etowah darter habitat. In addition, since this roadway is not being planned as a limited access highway, the project will foster development not just at major road intersections, as occurs with interstate highways, but along the entire corridor. It has been reported that 75 percent of Georgia's landfills will reach capacity in five years ( The Atlanta Journal/The Atlanta Constitution, February 23, 1992). Several landfill sites have been proposed within the range of the Cherokee darter; one such site occurs between two Cherokee darter streams: Riggins and Edward Creeks, Cherokee County. On the banks of the upper Etowah River, within the known limited range of the Etowah darter, the Sanitfill Pine Bluff landfill is being constructed. Refuse may ultimately be received from as far away as New York. When this facility reaches its full potential, it will purportedly be the largest landfill in the eastern United States. While modern landfills are purportedly designed to contain runoff, it seems doubtful that such landfills would actually retain barrier integrity for decades to come. B. Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. In general, small species of fish, such as the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter, which are not utilized for either sport or bait purposes, are unknown to the general public. Therefore, take of these species by the general public has not been a problem. Publication of this rule will inform the general public as to the presence of these two darters in the Etowah River system. Considering the restricted distribution and small populations of the Etowah and Cherokee darters, it would be easy for vandals or unscrupulous collectors to eliminate or seriously impact populations in specific stream reaches if their exact location were known. The distribution of these species has therefore been described only in general terms for the purposes of this rule. Federal protection will serve to minimize adverse population impacts from illegal take, but the Act's penalties are not likely to act as a complete deterrent to such actions.
