Malaysia bought a Super Puma from Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN) [National Aircraft Industry] in 1989 for VIP use. The helicopter crashed in Sungai Petani, Kedah, two weeks ago while on its way to pick up Anwar in Kangar. Science, Research and Technology Minister B.J Habibie, who heads the IPTN, also offered to provide the crew for the aircraft. Anwar said Habibie felt that initially, the Indonesian crew might be useful. He said he informed Suharto and Habibie that the offer was very touching and Malaysia welcomed it. Anwar said he would brief Dr. Mahathir on the offer for follow up action.
