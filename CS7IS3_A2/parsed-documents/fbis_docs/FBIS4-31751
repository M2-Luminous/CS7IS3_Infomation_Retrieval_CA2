Discussed was also the behavior of "S" Parliamentary Club Head Zbigniew Romaszewski, who supported the competition's candidate in supplementary elections to the Senate. The unionists believe that the president should officially ask the Constitutional Tribunal whether the neopopiwek law is in accordance with the Constitution. They recall that "S" demands that the administrative control of wages be abandoned. Wages should be regulated through collective agreements; we are worried by the president's statements; he says that he is prepared to sign the neopopiwek law, due to the strikes and wage demands. The economic results of the last two months prove that despite the fact that there was no neopopiwek, inflation did not increase, said "S" Spokesman Piotr Zak. "S," which did not submit its own lists of candidates, appealed to its members to take part in the 19 June self-government elections. "Unionists should back their colleagues or lists of oppositional groupings," Zak explained. It was recalled that the only "S" candidate in the supplementary elections to the Senate in the Elblag Voivodship is Waclaw Bielecki. The teacher from Sztum was also supported by seven opposition parties, from the Union of Freedom to the Center Accord and the Movement for the Republic. In the meantime, Senator Zbigniew Romaszewski, head of the "S" Parliamentary Club, became involved in the election campaign of a competitor -- Edmund Krasowski of Gdansk, who currently does not belong to any party. Romaszewski's behavior encountered protests from almost 30 plant commissions. "I would like to recall that the National Commission fielded Waclaw Bielecki. The involvement of an "S" senator in the campaign of another candidate is a violation of the union's procedures." Romaszewski was reprimanded by KK Deputy Chairman Leszek Szwec last week. Although he was asked to withdraw his support, Romaszewski took part in the campaign of a competitor. The unionists criticized the Sejm for amending the law on the protection of conceived life.
