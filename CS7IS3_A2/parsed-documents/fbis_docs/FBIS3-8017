We will get on with our work. We will continue negotiations on a final agreement in Vienna and try to finish our work by 15 March. We have signed a preliminary agreement on the Croat-Muslim federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and on the confederation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. It will be a very strong union. An agreement on the economy, currency, customs, and other issues has been concluded. As for the UN Protected Areas [UNPA's] in Croatia, we are expecting a very active mandate on the part of the UN Protection Force in the forthcoming period, especially with regard to the Croatian borders, disarmament, the establishment of communications, and the peaceful reintegration of UNPAs in Croatia's legal system. We are ready for talks with local Serbs about local autonomy and we are ready for international supervision, by the United Nations, the Council of Europe, and European Union observers, over human rights, especially the rights of the minorities in Croatia. As for the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, we largely support NATO's actions so far and we will continue with the talks. Croats and Muslims will continue negotiations with the Serbs in order that the Serbs can either join the federation or that some other agreement can be reached with them.
