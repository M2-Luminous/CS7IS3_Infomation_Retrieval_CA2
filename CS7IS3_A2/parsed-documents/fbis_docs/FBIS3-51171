[Ruckauf] I am convinced that Santiago del Estero has not been a "victim" of the transformation process. What should have been done there was just not done. There was a chaotic government, very bad mismanagement of the economy, and an astronomical financial crisis. [Beladrich] For you then Santiago del Estero is a unique case? [Ruckauf] I did not say that; but it is very different from the rest because all the ingredients were right for an explosion. Think back to January 1993, the salary roster amounted to 20 million pesos; in October it escalated to 36 million pesos, while income amounted to some 5 million pesos... Other provinces have problems regarding the income-expenditure ratio, but no province had such a bad ratio as Santiago del Estero. [passage omitted]
