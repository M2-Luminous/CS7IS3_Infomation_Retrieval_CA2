Elias] [Text] Mmabatho March 10 SAPA -- A stayaway in Bophuthatswana on Thursday [10 March] turned Mafikeng and a giant shopping centre in Mmabatho into virtual ghost towns. Central Mafikeng was quiet with few people on the pavements and most stores closed. Mmabatho's shopping complex Mega City had a few people strolling in the malls but all the shops were shut. Nearby government offices also appeared to be deserted with little sign of activity. The Universiy of Bophuhatswana [Unibo], where students and police clashed on Wednesday, was also almost deserted with a few students continuing to man the gates that were barricaded on Wednesday. The barricades across the street at the entrance to Unibo had been removed, and only a garbage skip, a number of road signs and other debris remaining. Youths had erected barricades at the entrance of Soweting township between Mafikeng and Mmabatho and were not allowing anyone into the area where, on Wednesday night, running battles between youths and police were reported on Wednesday night. A spotter plane circled the area on Thursday.
