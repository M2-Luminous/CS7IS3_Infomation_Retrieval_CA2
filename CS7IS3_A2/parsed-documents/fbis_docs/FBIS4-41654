He recalled that BNF had once appealed to presidential candidates Karpenka and Shushkevich to withdraw their candidacies in support of [BNF Chairman] Zyanon Paznyak. Karpenka was forced to do that, but Shushkevich did not take this step, and the democratic forces now have to pay for the shortsightedness of such a policy. Still, even if there had been no disunity among democrats, Ivashkevich believes Lukashenka would still have had a better chance for victory. "Our citizens still want to try the taste of communism," the BNF secretary said, "let them do that." Asked what tactics the BNF will use in the second round, Viktar Ivashkevich replied as follows: "We will not participate in the dispute between the communists and Komsomol members (this relates to Kebich and Lukashenka -- BELAPAN). The front will concentrate on the consolidation of its ranks and preparation for the parliamentary elections."
