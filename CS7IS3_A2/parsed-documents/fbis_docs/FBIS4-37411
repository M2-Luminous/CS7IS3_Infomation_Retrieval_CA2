It is known that such signs should be shown by Israel. Syria has frequently proven its real desire to achieve peace. It has constantly worked for the success of the U.S. and the international efforts, as part of the Madrid conference and according to its established bases. What has happened so far, however, conflicts with these bases. The just and comprehensive peace to which the U.S. administration committed itself has become separate partial deals. The Washington talks were stymied in favor of secret talks here and there. In addition, the Security Council resolutions, which are supposed to organize the peace process, were deliberately ignored. Israel continued to intensify the situation in southern Lebanese areas. It did not hide the fact that its escalating attacks are intended to terrorize Lebanon and pressure Syria. Under these circumstances, observers naturally wonder about the promised U.S. role. Washington is supposed to be the first to defend its initiative and adhere to its commitments, and, consequently, halt the continued Israeli sabotage of the peace process, in accordance with the agreed bases. Politicians and observers know it is impossible to achieve peace in the Middle East without Syria, and that the attempts to circumvent Syria and ignore its basic role in the region will lead the peace process to a real impasse. While it is in the interest of the Middle East to achieve a state of peace that gives it an opportunity to dedicate its resources to development, it is definitely in the interest of the United States that the aspired peace is firm and well-established, rather than a mere truce that cannot withstand events and developments. A firm and well-established peace requires a minimum level of justice, fairness, and honesty. Syria has always made it clear that Israel's full withdrawal from the Golan, southern Lebanon, and the other occupied territories is an inevitable prelude to the establishment of peace. The Security Council resolutions actually stipulate that Israel should withdraw and that the Israeli measures of annexation, Judaization, and settlements are null and void. The U.S. initiative itself provides for exchanging land for peace. Israel, however, has thus far refused to commit itself to full withdrawal from the occupied territories. It has only hinted at the possibility of a partial withdrawal from the Golan. It also announces daily that it has annexed Jerusalem once and for all, in addition to important parts of the West Bank, under the guise of a greater Jerusalem. To prove its rejection of the substance of the peace process, namely, returning the occupied territories, Israel shells southern Lebanon every day and threatens to escalate its acts of aggression. Saving the peace process from deliberate Israeli sabotage is a U.S. and international responsibility. The United States has the clout it will take to implement the Security Council resolutions. Without doing so, peace in the Middle East will remain a deferred project. The only way to achieve peace is a daring and decisive international position that removes Israeli belligerence from the region's atmosphere.
