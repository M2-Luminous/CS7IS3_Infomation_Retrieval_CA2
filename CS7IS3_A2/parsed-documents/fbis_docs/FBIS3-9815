In addition to that, the visit of British Prime Minister Major, and his view expressed in the talks that the first principle of the London conference (forcefully taken territories are not to be recognized), at which he was presiding, and the statement to a CCN [as published, probably CNN] journalist after the meeting, that pressure ought to be exerted on Serbs, is what makes the recent days politically harmonized. The made-in-America beginning of peace in Bosnia is bringing about currently the most important thing -- a chance for peace. The United States is neither a country of sentiment, nor of charity, nor of the generous Slav soul, and even less of the self-loving, rigid, frustrated diplomats of the former great powers, who tried to cure their spinster-like neuroses by dealing with Bosnia. The United States, which fortunately did not turn proletarian, has simplified the Bosnian crisis, breaking it down to its tiniest components, and rewound the entire film back to its beginning. And the beginning of everything was the Serbian aggression, in those April days of 1992, when the Serbian army massively set off across the Drina River, following the example of great Soviet tank offensives in World War II. In only 10 or so days, by fire and sword, with streams of blood and incredible crimes, that army took hold of Bosanski Brod, Zvornik, Foca, Visegrad.... At the very beginning the Americans unmistakably distinguished between the good guys and the bad guys. What happened later in Bosnia-Herzegovina, under the rule of European mediation, is well known. Americans, the masters of simplification, have gone much further: The good guys will live together, while the bad guys may join the good guys, but the war criminals must be brought to justice. I ask the readers not to insist on subtleties, or details, of all those Balkan mysticisms by which Belgrade has so skillfully befogged the war in Bosnia. Milosevic wanted to turn his classic aggression into a civil war, and to misrepresent all his conquests as though they were done in self-defense.... Therefore, the paper that was signed in Washington is a result of the systematized chronology, and of the determination that the world should finally start dealing with things the way that Europe should have dealt with them as early as April and May 1992. The Washington agreement means also the end of diplomacy's being an aristocratic play. Lord Carrington, Lord Owen, and citizen Stoltenberg made a mistake while cribbing their exam-paper in mathematics, and all the time they believed they were right, until they themselves fell victims to their delusion. They mixed up apples and pears, that is, the aggression and the legitimate resistance of a sovereign country. The Washington initiative has definitely pensioned them off. Bosnia-Herzegovina, just like the phoenix, is slowly and with difficulty rising from its ashes. The new interior arrangement of Bosnia is just being designed. The sooner the Serbs join the negotiations and give back what they seized, the more comfortable their future home will be for them. But let us not fool ourselves that the war is over just because the peace pipe was so joyfully smoked on Capitol Hill. If Sarajevo is no longer so savagely shelled, while Bihac, Maglaj, and Olovo still are, that does not mean we should be satisfied that the war, perhaps even a more fierce one, has moved into the interior of the country. There will be no peace in Bosnia without peace in its most distant hamlet. There will be no peace in Bosnia unless all those who were expelled and displaced in the process of ethnic cleansing (read: genocide) return to their homes. For that reason I believe that the Washington agreement is but a first step toward a just solution. Because we are wiser, given the experience of one war, and more cautious, given the prospect of peace.
