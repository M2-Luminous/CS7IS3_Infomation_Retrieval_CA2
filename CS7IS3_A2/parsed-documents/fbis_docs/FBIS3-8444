The Cabinet adopted a statement expressing its great alarm and distress regarding the president's speech, which it considers to be an outrageous attack on the fundamental institutions of our young state that have been formed on the basis of democratic elections; the attack damages the name and status of the Slovak Republic abroad and significantly destabilizes the internal political situation, which is already rather complex. The Cabinet on principle rejects the president's speech as confrontational and unprecedented, contradicting European political standards and human ethics and going beyond the constitutional powers of the president of the Republic, even more so because this Cabinet deserves credit for the formation of the independent and sovereign Slovak Republic and bears main responsibility for its development. The Cabinet will submit the speech by the president of the Republic to a thorough analysis and will inform the citizens about its outcome.
