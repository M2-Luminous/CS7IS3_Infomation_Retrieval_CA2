FBIS4-58187 "drnes084_s_94007" FBIS-NES-94-084 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 SOUTH ASIA Iran Western Media Said `Biased' Against Muslims Western Media Said `Biased' Against Muslims LD2904203094 Tehran IRNA in English 1818 GMT 29 Apr 94 LD2904203094 Tehran IRNA English BFN [Text] Tehran, April 29, IRNA -- When an explosion rocked a Maronite church in Beirut on February 27 just after the al-Khalil [Hebron] massacre the Western media immediately blamed Islamic groups. But the recent arrest of former Lebanese Christian warlord Samir Ja'ja' in connection with the church blast that killed 11 people dispels the suspicions against Islamic groups and brings the culprits to light. It is certain that the Zionists instigated the church blast to distract world condemnation of the massacre of 60 Palestinians in the Ibrahimi Mosque in occupied al-Khalil during Ramadan. The leader of the Phalangist party, George Sa'adah, said on March 24 that the Christians had to be ashamed of committing such a crime against the church. It is, however, quite strange that the Western media did not make much noise about the perpetrators of this henious crime and did not compete with one another to call them terrorists, as it always does with Muslims, even if they are not convicted and their responsibility for such incidents not proved. When the Zionists announced that the massacre was the act of a "mad person," the Western media repeated the version like a parrot as a confirmed fact, even before a judicial enquiry was conducted. The Zionists announced the same justification when the al-'Aqsa Mosque was set on fire in 1967. They claimed that the perpetrator, a Canadian Jew, was "mentally deranged," just as they did in the case of the American-born Goldstein, the murderer of al-Khalil. As a general rule the Western media forgets its reasoning power and neutrality when Zionists make any claims, no matter how illogical they may be. It tries to promote the false image of the Zionist state as the "only democratic state in the Middle East," ignoring the fact that it is a state built on terrorism and brutal force. Shabra and Shatila, Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim, al-Khalil are just a few names in the long list of terrorist activities perpetrated by the Zionist state. The Beirut church incident is one more example for Muslims that the Western media is neither fair nor neutral. It is biased against Islam and working hand-in-glove with the interests of the Western world.
