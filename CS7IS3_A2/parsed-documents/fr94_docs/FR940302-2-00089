FR940302-2-00089 FR940302-2-00064 (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The Exchange requests that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) thereunder. 2 Specifically, the Commission concludes that the proposed rule change promotes just and equitable principles of trade by creating uniform trading hours for all Amex narrow-based indexes, thereby eliminating the possibility of investor and market participant confusion. 2 15 U.S.C. 78f (b) (5) (1982). The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change proposal prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register so that the change in trading hours can become effective as soon as possible, allowing the Amex to implement uniform trading hours for all Amex narrow-based indexes. 3 3 The Commission notes that it did not receive any comments when the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. amended its rules in order to change the trading hours of its BioTech Index from 4:15 p.m. to 4:10 p.m., New York time. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32937, 58 FR 5002 (September 28, 1993). IV.
