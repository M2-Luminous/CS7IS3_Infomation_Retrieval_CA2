Chavan, today ruled out any economic and political package for initiating the political process in insurgency-hit Jammu and Kashmir saying such a package could be given only after the installation of an elected government, report agencies. Talking to journalists here after laying the foundation stone of a seven-storeyed headquarters of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), Mr Chavan said the government had no objections to having a dialogue with Kashmir militants. But, he made it clear that talks could be held only under the constitution. "Going beyond the constitution is just ruled out," he asserted. The home ministry has evolved a country-wide intelligence network to counter the threat posed by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan. Talking to journalists in Jammu last night the internal security minister, Mr Rajesh Pilot, said that the ISI was trying its best to destabilise and disturb the peace in the country and recent arrests of some activists revealed that they were planning sabotage and create disruption at a number of places in the country. "We have evolved a co-ordinated approach involving intelligence agencies all over the country to meet the challenge posed by the ISI," he added. He said that the ISI would not be allowed to succeed in its designs and declared that a lot of success has been achieved through this co-ordinated approach in checking its activities. He said to check the influence of the ISI in the North-Eastern and "operational command" of seven states had been formed. Fresh instructions have been given to the IB to meet the senior police and civil officials once a week at the district level to have a clear picture of the situation. "We should be able to prevent a certain event from taking place instead of waiting for it to happen," he added. Mr Pilot said that a decision regarding starting of a political process and reactivating the administration in Jammu and Kashmir would be taken by the Prime Minister in a few days after consultations with all political parties. Mr Pilot indicated that the idea of appointing "political advisors" had virtually been given up due to opposition from certain quarters. He said that he had conveyed to the prime minister the need to evolve a certain political mechanism for the Kashmir Valley. "Political process takes you towards normalisation as politicians can go down to the grassroots level to look into the grievances of the people. Mr Pilot said that he favoured a political advisory council consisting of politicians and having certain administrative powers to solve the problems of the people. He said to speed up the developmental works in the state special high level teams from various ministries were visiting the state. "We have already settled about 14,000 of the 18,000 insurance claims cases in the state. Others will be settled very soon." Mr Pilot said that the Centre was also thinking of setting up of a Kashmir infrastructure reconstruction fund to speed up development activities in areas badly hit by militancy. "The prime minister is also in favour of such a fund and final touches are being given to it," he said. Mr Pilot said he had conveyed to the prime minister the feelings of various political leaders, including Dr Farooq Abdullah and the state Congress president, Mr Ghulam Rasool Kar, over the delay in announcing some kind of political, administrative and economic package for the people of Kashmir. Describing the situation in Doda as "complex" Mr Pilot said security forces had been instructed to re-define their strategy and results would follow soon. Mr Pilot said that although there were limitations regarding the availability of forces, he had ordered additional BSF [Border Security Forces] and CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force] troops for the state. Referring to some provocations by Pak troops along Indo-Pak border, he said "India is a peace-loving country and we will not be provoked by these pinpricks. However, he said if Pakistan stretched India's patience too far, it would be bad for that country." TOINS [Times of INdia News Service] adds: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) today demanded that the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, visit Kashmir and take some firm steps to restore normalcy in the state. The party suggested that the government prepare an action plan. The party spokesman, Mr K.L. Sharma, said the situation in the state was grave, and the Prime Minister should take personal notice of it. He said the government's claim that the situation in the Valley was gradually improving was a "cruel joke." Meanwhile, the high-level Central team headed by Mr K.R. Venugopal, secretary in the prime minister's office, today held discussions on the overall development of the state with the governor, Gen K.V. Krishna Rao. An official spokesman said in Jammu the team was with the governor for nearly two hours and issues covered related to Central schemes, rural development, health and education and ways and means of speeding up various works in the state.
