Vrkic's claims are at the same time interesting and frightening. Precisely because things might well turn out the way Vrkic predicts, we carry the letter in full: ``Mr. Granic! ``Prompted by the latest events around Gorazde, and in the interest of protecting the Croatian state interests, I propose that your government draft and submit to the UN Security Council a proposal suggesting the passing of a special decision -- resolution -- that would expand the area of protected zones in Bosnia-Herzegovina to include Bosnian Posavina, or more precisely, the free enclave around Orasje. ``It is more than obvious that the Serbs intend to expand their corridor in Bosnian Posavina militarily (their generals discuss this openly) and are bringing in large quantities of heavy arms in order to carry out preparations for the final conquest of all of Posavina. This game includes sporadic attacks on Zupanja and the region along the Sava River on the Croatian side, aimed at provoking the Croatian Army, which would give the Serbs an alibi for the final assault on the free territory of Posavina. ``Our government's proposal, together with one simultaneously submitted to the UN Security Council by the Bosnian Government, would reveal the goal of the Bosnian Serbs in time. If the Security Council were to accept the initiative proclaiming a protected zone around Bosnian Posavina (the enclave of Orasje), this would prevent the Serbs from carrying out their plans and conquering Posavina until the Security Council, the European Union, the United States, and Russia agree on how to protect Croatia and the Bosniaks from the Serbian onslaught. ``The loss of Posavina would not only mean the loss of territory populated by Croats, it would also be free territory through which the Serbs could unite Serbs in the occupied Croatian and Bosnian areas with Serbia. The loss would moreover result in a new wave of refugees in Croatia, which is further reason for alerting the relevant factors in international politics,'' reads Ivica Vrkic's letter addressed to Mate Granic.
