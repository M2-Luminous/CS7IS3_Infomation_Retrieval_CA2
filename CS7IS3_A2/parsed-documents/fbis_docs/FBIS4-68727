The letters are different. To the president: "Participants in the Business Roundtable of Russia are convinced that the interests of Russian property owners are alien to you..." To the prime minister: "Participants in the Business Roundtable of Russia note with alarm a certain distancing of the government from the needs and concerns of the Russian entrepreneurs...." The letters differ but the essence is the same: The entrepreneurs want to have their own organ for administration and coordination at the state level. The authorities would also like to have some organ for management of the entrepreneurs. But the entrepreneurs, in turn, do not want what the authorities want. Incomprehensible? Let us begin at the beginning. One cannot say that our domestic businessmen are functioning without state oversight now. Russian entrepreneurs have at least seven nannies. First, the State Committee for Industrial Policy and Entrepreneurship. Second, the department for organization of management of property and entrepreneurship in the government apparatus. Third, the committee for support of small enterprises and entrepreneurship under the State Committee for Administration of State Property. Fourth, the Federal Fund for Support of Entrepreneurship in Antimonopoly Policy. And there are also the corresponding departments in the Ministry of Economics, the Ministry of Finance, the president's apparatus... We know what happens with seven nannies. Russian businessmen, gathering as early as October at the constituent congress of the Roundtable, decided that they need a single chief. Something like a minister, or in the extreme case a state committee chairman. So they wrote in their resolution: "An important step toward strengthening the union of entrepreneurs and the government would be the transformation of the currently existing Council for the Development of Entrepreneurship under the Government of the Russian Federation into an organ of state administration--the State Committee for Affairs of Private Business." The businessmen asked and the authorities responded: There immediately appeared a project for the creation of a kind of Federal Center for the Development of Entrepreneurship with its own scientific research institute and All-Russian Exhibition Center (VDNKh) as a base. The enterprises, however, howled: We do not want a bureaucratic "superstructure," we ourselves want... "The terrible thing was that an organ for directive management of entrepreneurship was created," explains the official secretary of the Coordinating Council of the Business Roundtable of Russia, Aleksandr Orlov. "Although one can understand the bureaucrats: The sphere of state business is being eaten away and the management structure is spreading. The version of 'reorientation' toward private business seems very tempting. It is another matter that the idea was stillborn: The entrepreneur can only trust another entrepreneur and then not all the time. But a bureaucrat... In general private business "formed a solid front"--and the idea of a federal center died a noble death. But... "We learned recently that this plan had been exhumed," says Aleksandr Orlov. "And now they are trying to push it through in a new version, in the form of some kind of 'consolidation commission.'" In the opinion of the businessmen the motive force for the plan came from bureaucrats in the structures of power, who understand that sooner or later Russian entrepreneurs will achieve the creation of the kind of coordination-consultation organ they need. And then the "seven nannies" will have nothing to do. And who wants that? An unseen war is now in progress in the corridors of power--the bureaucrats and the entrepreneurs are constantly exchanging "responsive-warning blows," trying to work to get ahead of the enemy. Ivan Kivelidi made his next move today by proposing the draft of the presidential edict "On the Creation of a Federal Public-State System for the Development of Free Entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation." The main point of the plan, of course, is to form in the government structure a federal administration for affairs of entrepreneurship which would participate in the processes of development of draft laws and normative documents, coordinate financial support for small and medium-sized business, assist entrepreneurs in acquiring state orders, etc. Actually, they are proposing the creation of a legal lobbying structure which defends the interests of private business at the government level. And not only at the government level. The draft of the edict envisions the creation of the position of adviser to the president of Russia on affairs of entrepreneurship. In general, it seems, Russian private business no longer has much hope of a favorable disposition on the part of the government. In previous letters from Ivan Kivelidi to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin one can read, for example, these lines: "No recommendation, no warning, and no information we have presented to the Council of Ministers has ever been heeded or accepted." Or: "Unfortunately, the Council for Development of Entrepreneurship has received neither a reaction nor a response from the government apparatus to the memorandum submitted to you previously. The conviction is growing stronger that certain forces are deliberately isolating Russian business circles from the government...." Consider that Kivelidi wrote these lines while holding the position (public) of chairman of the Council for Development of Entrepreneurship under the Government of the Russian Federation. That is, this was not some kind of stranger. But, as he wrote in another message to the prime minister, "the apparatus lobby turned out to be stronger." Now Ivan Kivelidi is the chairman of the coordination council of an organization which includes more than 80 movements, unions, and large private firms and banks of Russia (for example, the Most group, Moscow Real Estate, the Stolichnyy Bank, the RSPP, the International Brokers Guild, the Volga Union of Business Circles, the Union of Entrepreneurs of the Northern Caucasus, etc.). But so far it does not seem that this "lobby" has gained any respect in the White House. Who knows, perhaps in the Kremlin the Business Roundtable of Russia will find more attentive patrons.
