Rees] [Text] Virginia March 20 SAPA -- The African National Congress [ANC] would give priority to its supporters when it provides jobs after the April election, the ANC Women's League president, Winnie Mandela, said on Sunday [20 March]. "We will prioritise for our comrades. We are going to provide employment for all of you, starting with the comrades who served in prison for our cause." Speaking to several thousand supporters from Meloding township outside Virginia and neighbouring Mandela Park sqautter camp, Mrs Mandela laid heavy emphasis on the ANC's aim to provide houses. "I cannot believe the shacks I saw," she said, launching a fierce attack on National Party housing policies and its migrant labour system. "It is these inhuman practices that compel us to remove the De Klerk fascist regime." Mrs Mandela said the ANC would build decent houses for everybody. A better life was planned for all South Africans, with priority for the victims of apartheid. "We will provide you with jobs and education facilities, put people back to work to create a growing economy, and will provide services, health and education," she said. Mrs Mandela said the lack of housing and services had reached crisis proportions, adding that the ANC's main aim was to focus on the 7.5-million squatters and their filthy townships. As at her people's forum meeting in Bloemfontein on Saturday, Mrs Mandela allowed only five questions from the crowd.
