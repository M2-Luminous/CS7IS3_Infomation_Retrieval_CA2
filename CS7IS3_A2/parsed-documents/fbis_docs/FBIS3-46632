But this year, Nagata-cho is strangely calm, and the dietmen are uneasy. Deliberations on political reform bills in the House of Councillors are not making progress, and the dietmen hear leaders of both ruling and opposition camps making unsettling comments like "the lower house should be dissolved and a general election conducted" if the bills fail to get passed. On 17 December, Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], and Wataru Kubo, general secretary of the party, met at party headquarters. Party Leaders With Aching Heads One said: "With things in this state, there is no other choice but to dissolve the Diet and hold a general election." The other agreed, "Maybe we should start getting ready for it." But they need funds to prepare for a general election, and the party's vault is empty. One senior party secretariat official said: "We need at least 1.2 billion yen in election funds just for the party headquarters." The party raised only a little over 1 billion yen for the last general election held in July -- 600 million donated by supporting trade unions and the balance borrowed from banks. The party is not sure when it can pay back the outstanding bank debts. The senior secretariat official said in anguish: "How can we raise the needed money?" The secretariat first thought about providing 1 million yen to each current lower house member in the year-end operational funds. But they were unable to come up with the 76 million yen necessary for that, and had to give up the idea. Things have not been going well with the SDPJ recently, anyway. Some within the party think the party should avoid the situation of dissolving the Diet if possible. They say if the party starts preparing for an election, it could give an impression to other parties that the election is forthcoming, thus causing alarm. Their thinking is that there is no reason why the money-short SDPJ should act rashly. Within the coalition camp, even Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] has not provided year-end "gift expenses" to its members. The ostensible reason for this is that the party has no money, but one senior party member admitted: "If they go back home and run around using the money, it can put fire in the mood for Diet dissolution." Local Constituencies Are Not in the Mood The fact is that local districts are not in the mood for another general election yet. A senior Shinseito member said: "If I go back to my district and suggest an election, all I hear is `what do you intend to do about economic stimulus measures?'" A Komeito official said: "The supporters' mood is that we had an election only half a year ago; do not even talk about another election." Speaking at a gathering held in commemoration of the late Dietman Shigeru Hori on the evening of 20 December, Shunpei Tsukahara, who is in charge of finance at the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], said: "I was afraid of how much political donations I would be able to raise from corporations. But the funds for the latter half of this year have come in. In addition, the banks have agreed to extend our debt payment. If the election is to come, we have ample money. Please rest assured of that." In September following the changing of hands in government, the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan [Keidanren] decided it should stop recommending its member corporations donating to political parties. And at the time of the July general election, the LDP had to borrow about 14.5 billion yen. With the current economic woes coming on top of that, the LDP's treasury should be hard-put as well. LDP Forwards Money Through Banks Anyway, insisting that the lower house can be dissolved any day, the party financial division got banks to accept extension of its payment of 4.5 billion yen due this year. The party's calculation is that "if it has about 10 billion at its disposal, it will be able to manage the next election somehow. Tsukara's remarks about "resting assured" probably meant that the party would be able to cope with a financial pinch that comes at the end of a year. On the following day -- 21 December -- the LDP gave out the traditional year-end "gift expenses" of 3 million yen each to about 210 upper and lower house members of the grade who have not been named to cabinet posts yet. But now being a time when political reform is so widely talked about, the party leadership agonized over whether it should distribute the money until the last moment. With speculations on the Diet's dissolution rising and with the party Diet members calling for funds, the party eventually decided to give out the money as it has done in the past. However, the amount given out this year was smaller than in previous years and it was forwarded through banks where money flow can be said to be highly transparent. Apparently, the party was concerned about how the public will see it. Now, there is the question of whether or not the lower house will be dissolved. No doubt, the deliberations on the political reform bills in January foretell a danger comparable to trying to foretell who will win in a duel of warriors. There are not enough days for the bills to be acted on, while the gap between the ruling and opposition camps is not narrowing. The coalition parties often fall into disarray. There is no denying that the situation is grave, and that if the bills do not get passed, political responsibility will be asked in the form of the cabinet resigning or the Diet dissolving. Shinseito General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, who is a pillar of the ruling coalition, declared on 20 December that he was going into a "rest" and has not showed up since in any official meeting. Among the ruling coalition, there are many speculations about this, and one Social Democratic Party official asked, "Could he be doing something about a showdown in January?" The LDP is poised to be tough. Party General Secretary Yoshiro Mori declared: "An opposition party must be able to respond to the call for Diet dissolution at all times." But a senior member of the party's Obuchi faction admitted: "All that we can say is we will respond. We now have less power to initiate Diet dissolution from our side." With so many general contractor-involved scandals being brought into the open recently, one official said: "We are not too confident about winning in an election." On 21 December, a plenary session of the party Tax Research Council was held at party headquarters. They had orange juice ready for 80 people. But only 25, including senior officials, were present. Until last year, some 100 Diet members had attended such events. With representatives of industrial organizations and officials concerned of government offices also attending, people used to overflow into corridors outside the hall where the meeting was held. The dietmen sense the rising air for the Diet's dissolution. Many of them have gone back home, and are running around their districts.
