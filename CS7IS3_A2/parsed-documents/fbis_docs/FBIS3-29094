The meeting was attended by representatives of more than 20 political parties and forces. The director of the International Affairs Department of the Communist Party of Syria who is member of the Political Bureau in his speech said international solidarity should be extended to Korea which stands with dignity against the United States which tries to force it to open its military sites. Just is the stand of Korea that it can never concede its sovereignty and not open its military sites, he stressed. He said the United States must come out again to talks with Korea and, by responding to the demand of Korea that the double standard be discarded and the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula be solved comprehensively, it should help to secure stability in this region and realise a peaceful reunification of Korea. A solidarity message to the great leader President Kim Il-song was adopted at the meeting. The meeting adopted letters to the U.S. president, the U.N. secretary general and the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
