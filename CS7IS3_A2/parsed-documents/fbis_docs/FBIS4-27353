Previously, checks were made of the dismantling time and recycling possibilities for each model in its domestic Products Design Division, but beginning in April, it introduced an environment inspection evaluation system with specific target values, and also widened the scope to offices overseas. Manuals targeted at Product Planning Division have also been newly prepared and consideration of the environment is promoted consistently from the planning stage. A recycling research committee has also been established with an eye to the future and they are putting together a guide with next spring as the goal. Checksheets for product design introduced by the company are being prepared for each division such as television and audio. For televisions, a total of nine items are checked: packing, energy consumption, harmful substances, use of plastic, use of recycled resources, reduction of resources used, product life, dismantling time, and recycling possibility. Previously, inspections were by the O-X checklist method, but beginning in April, a quantitative evaluation containing specific target numbers was introduced. Combined with this, overseas offices with design divisions have begun to use it.. Sony has prepared inspection manuals for product planning divisions that are in charge of research and development. They introduce an explanation of the laws and regulations on recycling and what items the design divisions will be checking. Explanations cite actual examples of products with consideration of the environment. The recycling research committee is comprised of head office staff, centering on designers in the AV (audiovisual) Equipment Division, and persons in charge of the FA [factory automation] division. There are six to seven core members, and they are promoting research on recycled resources and recycling such as actually trying to disassemble discarded televisions from various firms, with the goal of giving feedback to design. Sony established an in-house global environment committee in 1990, and has promoted the undertaking of environment problems.
