At a public rally in St. John's this week, the party presented its 16 candidates for the poll, constitutionally due by March. Political leader Baldwin Spencer said: "The people of Antigua and Barbuda .... Are ready to take our country back." He added: "We cannot claim to be a nation when we have not developed a nation economy. We cannot claim to be a nation when we are not in charge of our own affairs. We cannot claim to be a nation when we are dominated by foreign interests." The parliamentary opposition leader admitted that "the challenge before (the party) is not easy." Spencer charged that the ruling Antigua Labour Party (ALP) "has failed miserably .... to do great things for the country." The UPP's deputy political leader, Tim Hector, said the party was planning a national demonstration against the governor general's decision to pardon a government minister who was given a prison sentence after the court found he was involved in illegal mining of sand. "We call the demonstration in support of justice against the pardon, against the governor general, against Hilroy Humphreys. I expect you to be there in great numbers," Hector told the meeting The party's campaign theme is "time for a change -- people first".
