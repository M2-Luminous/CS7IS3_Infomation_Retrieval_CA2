The opponents have increased and the supporters decreased since the last opinion poll in May. At the same time another poll shows that the undecideds in North Norway are about to become opponents. If the replies in the poll are to be believed, a majority of the Norwegian people will say no to EU membership regardless of what happens in the referenda in Finland and Sweden. In our poll 44 percent said no and 35 percent said yes to the following question: "If Sweden and Finland become members of the EU, how will you vote?" So the supporters of Norwegian EU membership are losing ground following the government's presentation of a negotiation outcome that is very good, particularly as regards our fisheries policy. The opinion polls from Sweden indicate that on that side of the border it is the proponents who have finally gotten on the offensive. Granted, only 3O.5 percent are as yet saying yes, while 40 percent say no. But this is an improvement of 4.5 percent for the proponents and a loss of 4.8 percent for the opposing side. And then there is the peculiar situation with 59.4 percent of the Icelanders saying yes to an EU membership the country has not even applied for yet. The majority are giving the fisheries resolution Norway obtained as their reason for saying yes. It is a healthy Norwegian trait to be skeptical of the authorities and the politicians. But at this point the skeptics must also ask themselves what the alternative would be to participating, along with Finland and Sweden, in that European community on whose door even Iceland is now knocking. Because, contrary to what the Center and the Socialist Left parties are saying, the alternative to participating in the fora where our common European future is being forged is not to carry on as before. Whether you like it or not, we already are in a new, more demanding reality than only a few years ago. The great challenge for Norwegian farmers is the requirements that issue from the revised agreement on tariffs and trade. It is the GATT agreement that draws up the broad international regulations matrix that both the EU and we will have to respect. Of course the Norwegian opponents have a right to say no. But they should also try a little skepticism towards their own reasoning. Because those vital Norwegian interests that they claim to protect by saying no are also the EU proponents' basis for saying yes at the upcoming referendum. Having said that, we also want to say that it is the EU proponents who should see this latest poll as a challenge. We have six months to go until the referendum. But that battle is lost unless the Norwegian supporters of the EU go on the offensive the way their counterparts in Sweden have succeeded in doing.
