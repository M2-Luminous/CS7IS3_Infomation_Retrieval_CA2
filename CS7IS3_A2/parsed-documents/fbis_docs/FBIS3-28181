FBIS3-28181 "dreas024_c_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-024 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Feb 1994 North Korea Russian Ambassador to DPRK on Nuclear Issue SK0402064694 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0505 GMT 4 Feb 94 SK0402064694 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0505 GMT 4 Feb 94 Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [Text] On 1 February a news conference was held at our country's embassy in Russia concerning the 31 January statement by a Foreign Ministry spokesman. Present at the conference were reporters from newspapers, news agencies, and radios of Russia. Son Song-pil, ambassador of our country, made a statement at the news conference. He explained the details of the Foreign Ministry statement. He pointed out that the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula has been raised as a grave issue today because the United States, deploying more than 1,000 nuclear weapons to South Korea, staged commotions about suspicions of our nonexistent nuclear arms development and has intensified the nuclear threat to us now more than ever before. He said: The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New Year address taught that the reason our nuclear issue is loudly talked about by the United States and its followers is a result of the antisocialist and anti-Republic maneuvers persistently pursued by the United States. Therefore, the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula is an issue that should be resolved only through talks between us and the United States. With a view to evading such responsibility, however, the United States insists that the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula be resolved between the North and the South of Korea, and between us and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The United States, being unable to stand our principled demand any longer, was compelled to come forward to negotiate with us. He pointed out that a joint statement, which had affirmative significance in resolving the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, was announced during the first round of DPRK-U.S. talks last year, after which a certain progress was made in the second round of DPRK-U.S. talks. He continued: As the result of 18 rounds of working-level contacts between the DPRK and the United States, the two sides have reached an agreement on basic issues. We agreed that the United States will suspend the Team Spirit joint military exercise and we will accept limited-scope [chaehandoen pomwieso] nuclear inspections to ensure the continuity of safeguards. We agreed to discuss the package solution plan, which we raised, during the forthcoming third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. However, the United States, at a decisive moment when a bright vista for a complete resolution of the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is being opened up, is leading the situation to a catastrophe by overturning agreements made with us. This is not only a flagrant infringement of the agreements made at the DPRK-U.S. talks, but is also a shameless breach of faith against the dialogue. As the conditions under which we had to withdraw from the Nonproliferation Treaty still remain, the word of full-scope inspection, as well, is inconceivable. Not only this, the United States is continuing military conspiratorial plots against us behind the scene of the talks. The United States is scheming to stage another type of military exercise in case the Team Spirit joint military exercise is not staged and to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea. All facts clearly show that the new war provocation maneuvers in South Korea are more unscrupulous and that the United States has no intention to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula by peaceful means and is also tenaciously running wild to crush [apsal] our Republic. We cannot overlook such pressure and threats by the United States, nor can we yield to them. In this connection, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country expressed, in a statement, our principled stance. In the statement the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman warned that if the United States reneges on promises made to us, we will not be bound to the promises made to the United States; that if the United States has no intention to hold DPRK-U.S talks, we will not try to hold them either; and that if the United States chooses another way, we will take a commensurate countermeasure. We are fully prepared to respond to dialogue with dialogue and to war with war. [urinun taehwaenun taehwaro chonjaengenun chonjaenguro taedaphal mandanui chunbiga toeoitta] The United States should renounce the delusion that only it has the right of choice and to act discreetly. Then, he answered questions raised by reporters.
