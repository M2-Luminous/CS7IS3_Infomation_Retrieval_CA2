FBIS4-52257 "dreas089_d_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-089 Daily Report 9 May 1994 South Korea Development at `Dangerous Point' Development at `Dangerous Point' SK0905110994 Seoul YONHAP in English 1052 GMT 9 May 94 SK0905110994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- Despite its lingering economic difficulties, North Korea has invested heavily in uranium mining and production, a recent North Korean defector said here on Monday. "I have no idea whether North Korea presently possesses nuclear arms because they have been developing them in utter secrecy. But, I can tell North Korea's nuclear development has reached a dangerous point," the defector, Kim Tae-ho, said in a press conference. In the North, Kim, age 35, had worked at the Atomic Power Industrial Ministry. He was the head of a waste water disposal team at the Namchon Joint Chemical Industrial Co. run directly by the Atomic Power Ministry. He said uranium ores are being mined at several mines including the one in Sunchon, South Pyongan Province: January industrial mine at Pyongsan, North Hwanghae Province: and Wolam mine at Kumchon, North Hwanghae Province. "The uranium ores from these mines are shipped to two uranium refineries at the April Industrial Co. in North Pyongan Province and Namchon Chemical Co. in North Hwanghae Province," he said. The re-refinery August Industrial Co. in Yongbyon, Kim said, extracts plutonium for nuclear weapons and performs work related to the production of uranium fuel rods. He said that Namchon Chemical Co. has about 8,000 workers and turns out 8010006040ure uranium. "Many of the workers there are exposed to radioactivity, complaining of vocational diseases such as liver ailment, depilation and leukosis," the defector said. Productivity at these workshops, however, is extremely low due chiefly to superannuated facilities, he said. For instance, Kim said, uranium ores transportation is sluggish as many trucks are idled due to the lack of tires and mechanical troubles are reported often at mining equipment. He said he was born in Jilin Province, northern China, because of which he had been discriminated against. "Besides, I was involved in a swindle case, which made me decide to defect to the South," he said. Two youthful brothers who came to the South along with Kim Tae-ho spoke of terrible food conditions in the North. Hwang Kwang-chol, 20, said that due to food shortage, women in childbed are often stricken with serious diseases and it is not rare babies fail to walk even at two due to malnutrition. Hwang said his own mother is serving a 15-year prison term after she stole a bag of corn from a neighbor in 1987. "Together with my younger brother, Kwang-il, 18, I crossed the Tuman River last June and had since been living in Yanji before we boarded a South Korean freighter with the help of an ethnic Korean in China," Hwang said. The three North Koreans arrived in South Korea last Saturday.
