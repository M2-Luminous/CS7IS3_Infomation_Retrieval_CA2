I. Kozik, P. Ye. Tverdokhleb; UDC 681.325.65:535.232.65] [Abstract] A method for designing an optical associative memory device (OAMD) in the form of an integrated microcircuit using electro-optical thin-film modulators, integrated-optical splitter, a and light beam integrator is proposed. Estimates are made of the fundamental parameters of the microcircuit. It is demonstrated that the OAMD can be made in the form of a multilayer thin-film structure with optical interconnectors. Works are carried out now at the Institute of Automatics and Electrometry practically in all directions of the microcircuit development. Different models of light beam splitter are being studied. A splitter mock-up is developed for 16 light beams exhibiting a nonuniformity of diffraction efficiency smaller than 5%. Technology is mastered for producing high-efficiency diffraction optical elements. Ferroelectric films of strontium barium niobate are synthesized. A construction is proposed of a thin-film light polarizer with the polarization ratio of 50:1. Experimentally, a 20:1 ratio was obtained. Figures 6, references 16: 9 Russian, 7 Western.
