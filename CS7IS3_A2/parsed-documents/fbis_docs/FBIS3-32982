That year, during the consumption boom caused by the Cruzado Plan freeze, Brazilian industry grew by 10.5 percent. The projection was made by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) on the basis of results obtained for the month of November, when production climbed by 2.4 percent. That percentage, which was higher than expected by IBGE's experts in the Department of Industry (Deind), means there has been a 4.3 percent growth in only two months. To Silvio Sales de Oliveira, manager of Deind's Data Analysis Group, the explanation may lie in the uncertainty generated by the acceleration in the inflation rate, which caused retailers to postpone their purchasing decisions until the end of the year. It is for the same reason, in his opinion, that December production will probably attain at least this same level. What is more complicated to understand is how, in a year when the inflation rate exceeded 2,500 percent, production rose almost as much as under the Cruzado Plan. Here is where two important actors come in. The leading role was played by the far-reaching adjustment made by industry, which achieved significant gains in productivity. Playing a secondary role was the surge in demand that started in September 1992, initially motivated by uncertainty regarding the behavior of inflation, and later by the change in wage policy, which gave workers some measure of real gains that were of special benefit to the consumer durables industry. From January to November, production of those goods--notably automobiles and home appliances), grew by 40 percent, followed by capital goods for agriculture (tractors and other inputs), at 37.4 percent. There are questions about the early months of 1994. Silvio Sales believes production may hold up for two months, but with some tendency to decelerate. The projection made by the 11 economists who participate in the qualified information system set up by the Regional Council of Economics (Corecon) is that January production will be 3.4 percent above that of January 1993. This would be a modest growth, compared with what happened last year. But it all depends, largely, on what happens to inflation, and Corecon's projections are that the rate will be 39.5 percent this month and 39.6 percent in February.
