Apart from Prime Minister Silajdzic, today's talks were also attended by Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic and Mariofil Ljubic, deputy chairman of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly and chairman of the Constituent Assembly. At the end of the talks, Antonio Martino and Dr. Haris Silajdzic gave statements. [Martino in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] This is my first visit to your country. I was looking forward to visiting Sarajevo to see for myself the marks of war on this city. I wanted to meet the prime minister as soon as possible, to exchange views, and to find out what the perspective is for a complete and satisfactory solution to this crisis. I have now been informed about the views held by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government as to the solution to the crisis and the end of the war in the entire region. We also discussed the coming summit of the G-7 in Naples. A constructive and satisfactory debate is expected to take place there on the Bosnian problem. I look forward to coming to this city again in more peaceful times. [Silajdzic] We are pleased to have received today the delegation of the Italian Government led by the foreign minister. I will very briefly tell you what we discussed. Of course, we discussed peace and the work of the contact group. As for the contact group and the solutions that it will offer, we said that, first and foremost, the external borders of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a 1000-year-old state cannot be open to discussion. What is open to discussion, what the contact group is doing, is the internal reorganization of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We added that the international community should not legitimize genocide as [words indistinct]. We said that we expected the international community to protect the external borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Serbia and Montenegro. That is where the main problem lies. We also said that we expected a lot from the coming G-7 summit in Naples on 8 July. These are countries that are the most responsible for the world order. Order cannot be maintained if aggression is allowed, if change of borders is allowed, if genocide is allowed, and so on. Therefore, we expect a lot from the Italian Government, we expect it to contribute to that summit, we expect it to give a constructive contribution. We have to turn a new page in history, to (enter a period) in which genocide and aggression will not be possible. [Latinovic] Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino then went for a walk in the city. After that he was received by Dr. Mustafa Efendi Ceric, reis ul-ulema of the Islamic Community of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
