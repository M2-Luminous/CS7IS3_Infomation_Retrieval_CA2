The military sources reported that the northern commander of the military axis in Ta'izz had asked the northern units on the battlefronts to send a military crew to collect a cable which he described as extremely important. The sources confirmed the arrival of this cable to the fighting areas at 1730 today. It has become clear that the cable contains orders that the war operations are to continue and that the cease-fire is to be ignored. Meanwhile, the sources have reported that the Popular Resistance in the (Amlin) center in al-Dali' Province repulsed an infiltration attempt by a gang of the regular forces of the military ruling regime in Sanaa two days ago [8th June]. The Popular Resistance succeeded in defeating the gang and forced it into retreat after destroying two military crews and capturing a large lorry carrying military supplies and ammunition belonging to the forces of the military regime in Sanaa. Meanwhile, the Popular Resistance is gaining strength in the various areas in driving out the aggressive invaders.
