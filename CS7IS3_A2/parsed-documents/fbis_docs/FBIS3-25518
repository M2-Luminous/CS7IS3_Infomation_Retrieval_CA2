Abdoulaye Wade and Landing Savane were arrested at their homes, and are now being questioned on their possible involvement in last Wednesday's violence, which caused the death of six people, including five policemen in Dakar. The very next day [17 February], Interior Minister Djibo Ka said that the meeting organized on the same day by the CFD [expansion unknown], a coalition of opposition parties, had encouraged violence. Abdoulaye Eliname Kane, the communications minister and government spokesman, this evening confirmed this version. Among other things, he told Nicolas Ballique why the two opposition officials were arrested: [Begin Kane recording] During the meeting, several speakers, either directly or by interrupting those who had the floor, called on the crowd to march on the palace. The organizers did not discourage them. What we fear is that....[pauses] A communique says that the organizers understand the demonstrators' decision to march to the palace. Given this, I believe that it is the duty of the relevant authorities to look for a link between these tragic events and this organization. This movement did not come from nowhere. It came from the meeting that took place on 16 February on the Avenue du General de Gaulle. On the route taken by the demonstrators, several instruments were found. The basic purpose of these instruments was to kill, to injure, to massacre. They rule out the thesis of spontaneity. [end recording] Abdoulaye Wade's party, the Senegalese Democratic Party, is suspected of involvement. The movement has reacted and denounced what it called the continuation of the government's drift toward authoritarianism. As for the Muslim organization Aira [as heard], Moustarchidines Wal Moustarchidate, which was banned by the authorities the day after Wednesday's violence, it has denied any involvement in the riots.
