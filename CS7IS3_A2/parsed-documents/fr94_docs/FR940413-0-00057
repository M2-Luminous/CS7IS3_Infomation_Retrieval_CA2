ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is proposing to revoke a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole, alkyl polycarboxylate based on receipt of new data. The data indicate that the substance will not present an unreasonable risk to health. EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date of this rule is May 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan B. Hazen, Director, Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;543A, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Telephone: (202) 554&hyph;1404, TDD: (202) 554&hyph;0551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of August 15, 1990 (55 FR 33296), EPA issued a SNUR establishing significant new uses for 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole, alkyl polycarboxylate (P&hyph;88&hyph;1460). Because of additional data EPA has received for this substance, EPA is revoking this SNUR. I. Background The Agency proposed the revocation of the SNUR for this substance in the Federal Register of September 15, 1993 (58 FR 48346). The background and reasons for the revocation of the SNUR are set forth in the preamble to the proposed revocation. The Agency received no public comment concerning the proposed revocation. As a result EPA is revoking this SNUR. II. Rationale for Revocation of the Rule During review of the PMN submitted for the chemical substance that is the subject of this revocation, EPA concluded that regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient to make a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substance, and EPA identified the tests considered necessary to evaluate the risks of the substance. The basis for such findings is referenced in Unit I. of this preamble. Based on these findings, a section 5(e) consent order was negotiated with the PMN submitter and a SNUR was promulgated. EPA reviewed testing conducted by the PMN submitter for the substance and determined that the information available was sufficient to make a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substance. EPA concluded that, for the purposes of TSCA section 5, the substance will not present an unreasonable risk and subsequently revoked the section 5(e) consent order. The revocation of SNUR provisions for this substance designated herein is consistent with the revocation of the section 5(e) order. In light of the above, EPA is revoking SNUR provisions for this chemical substance. When this revocation becomes final, EPA will no longer require notice of any company's intent to manufacture, import, or process this substance. In addition, export notification under section 12(b) of TSCA will no longer be required. III. Rulemaking Record The record for the rule which EPA is proposing to revoke was established at OPPTS&hyph;50582 (P&hyph;88&hyph;1460). This record includes information considered by the Agency in developing this rule and includes the test data that form the basis for this rule. IV. Regulatory Assessment Requirements EPA is proposing to revoke the requirements of this rule. Any costs or burdens associated with this rule will be eliminated when the rule is revoked. Therefore, EPA finds that no costs or burdens must be assessed under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), or the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ).
