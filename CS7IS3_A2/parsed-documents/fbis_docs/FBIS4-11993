Some of them, he added, fled to the border strip and from there to Israel and then Australia. He added: The judiciary will decide on the matter; investigations continue and those found to be involved will be taken to court, regardless of who they may be. He added: We will not cover up for anybody and our judiciary is independent. The judicial investigator issues arrest warrants and instructs the security agencies to apprehend the suspects, he said. He noted that the new press law will give the press more freedoms and will restrict the arbitrary questioning of journalists as well as the suspension of a paper before a trial is held. He stressed the need to organize the audiovisual media, which are a legacy of the war and which continue to operate from a militia-minded point of view.
