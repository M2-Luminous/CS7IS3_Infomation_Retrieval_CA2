Questions regarding measures to prevent abuses and criminal phenomena in the course of privatization were brought up for discussion, but in fact problems in privatization overall constituted the subject of consideration. Only 2,390 facilities have been privatized over more than two years. These comprise 11.3 percent of Group A enterprises and 10 percent of those in other groups. One of the most important tasks is the privatization of incomplete construction projects. There are about 55,000 such facilities, but only 52 are listed for privatization! The main practice in privatization consists of redemption and leasing with redemption. Other forms of destatization are not held in high esteem. Auctions and competitive bidding are seldom conducted. One other significant aspect: Only 706,000 Ukrainian citizens, i.e., 2 percent, took advantage of privatization certificates. Session participants noted that the privatization process is clearly being hampered by ministries and organs of local authority. Defective legislation also interferes in this regard--in many instances a mechanism for carrying out this process is lacking. In the view of Oleksandr Zavada, chairman of the Ukraine Antimonopoly Committee, the whole problem lies in the fact that even state enterprises are not upholding state regulation (of prices, resources, etc.) and payment of taxes (90 percent of income). We need not even mention private enterprises. In a number of cases, change in ownership is impossible due to a breakdown in the technology chain. Many people are convinced that privatization will not proceed until the state stops subsidizing poor workers. Abuses are flourishing magnificently against the background of all these difficulties. Benefits afforded by legislation to labor collectives are being actively exploited. Shady businessmen engage in money laundering under this cover, and foreign investors operate in a fashion which is not best for us. The impression has been created that someone is forcing privatization to "falter." Leonid Kravchuk even posed the question: "Perhaps they are deliberately proceeding in this manner, engaging specifically in plunder?" Minister of Economics Roman Shpek explained that a struggle is still underway in society concerning whether or not to conduct privatization. He noted that over the course of a year the Supreme Council has never been able to examine the program for this operation. The committee adopted an appropriate resolution. It is planned to accelerate the development of proposals on the introduction of amendments and additions to existing legislation on matters of the privatization of property of state enterprises and land, and accelerate presentation of these proposals to the Cabinet of Ministers. The same applies to proposals on establishing responsibility for violations of the legislation on privatization and presentation of these proposals for confirmation by the Supreme Council of Ukraine. A great deal depends on the new parliament. As the president expressed it, the parliamentarians must either halt the privatization process entirely or place it on track as required.
