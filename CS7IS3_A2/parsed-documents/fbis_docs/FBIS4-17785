As told the speaker of the Armenian parliament, Babken Ararktsyan, immediately after Bleyan's appearance numerous calls started to come from Karabakh and Armenian combat divisions in which indignance was expressed with Bleyan's statements. "Such claims affect the national interests of Armenia," observed Ararktsyan. A deputy from Nagorno-Karabakh, Roles Aghadzhanyan, called Bleyan's statement provocative. He acknowledged that there are volunteers from Armenia fighting in Karabakh. "However there are no Armenian troops in Karabakh," said Aghadzhanyan. At the same time, the chairman of external relations committee David Vardanyan reminded that Bleyan is free to express his viewpoint. "I do not share his position, however the deputy cannot become a persecution object," he said.
