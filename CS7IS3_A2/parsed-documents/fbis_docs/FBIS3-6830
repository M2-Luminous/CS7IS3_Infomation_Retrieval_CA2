"I don't think such measures were spelled out," he said of the government's decision on February 25 to compile the package of measures to address the Japan-U.S. trade disputes. Fujii was speaking at a regular press conference after a morning cabinet meeting. "The centerpiece will be the four key measures and the actions in three priority areas" of the stalled trade framework talks with the United States, Fujii said. His comments in effect ruled out recent remarks by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura calling for inclusion of tax and other macroeconomic measures in the forthcoming package. The four key measures cited are deregulation, boosting imports, facilitating competition through stronger enforcement of the antimonopoly law, and expanding government procurement. The three "framework" priority areas are insurance, automobile and auto parts, and government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment. Fujii has repeatedly told the U.S. side that Japan would conduct a "full-fledged" tax reform, including permanent tax cuts, as the ruling coalition has vowed to do so by the end of the year. He has also repeatedly said that the latest 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package would put the economy on the path of full-scale recovery in the coming fiscal year. Fujii said he and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen agreed to tackle bilateral trade talks in a "cooperative mood as we did at the APEC meeting." The finance minister and Bentsen held talks on Friday in Hawaii ahead of a two-day meeting there of finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Fujii stressed, "the greatest importance for the government is to clearly show its voluntary measures this month." U.S. officials have indicated that the U.S. would assess the possibility of resuming the stalled framework talks after reviewing the market-opening package Japan promised to compile by the end of this month. On increasing international tension involving North Korea's nuclear issue, Fujii said his ministry will follow the government's decision in line with any United Nations resolution. He was referring to possible suspension of bank remittances from Japan to North Korea if the UN decides on trade sanctions against Pyongyang.
