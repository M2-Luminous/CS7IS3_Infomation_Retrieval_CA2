The vessels may have approached North Korean coasts to investigate Pyongyang's military communications and various types of radio waves, the sources said. Nuclear-powered attack submarines of the U.S. Navy made a record 17 calls last year at White Beach port in Japan's southernmost prefecture of Okinawa, according to local authorities. Such U.S. Submarines called at sasebo port in nagasaki prefecture, southwestern Japan, 10 times in 1993, close to a record 11 calls the previous year, the authorities said. Already this year, sasebo port has received visits by such submarines on nine occasions, they said. Yokosuka port in kanagawa prefecture, eastern Japan, had received the largest number of calls by such vessels in the past, but saw only 15 visits last year, about half the annual figures of 1989 and 1991, they said. Recently, many submarines have made port calls for only an hour or so on each visit, informed sources said, apparently to hand over data and fetch equipment needed for further information gathering.
