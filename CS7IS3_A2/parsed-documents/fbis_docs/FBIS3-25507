Official government spokesmen could not be reached for comment on a report carried in an independent newspaper in Blantyre. The NEW EXPRESS said a group of women scheduled to meet with Dr. Banda had been prevented from seeing the president when they arrived at the presidential Sanjika Palace last week. The newspaper quoted members of the delegation as saying they had been barred from meeting the president because he was in poor health. The National Consultative Council, which also sought a meeting with the Malawi leader, also failed to secure an appointment. A Western diplomat reached for comment by telephone from Johannesburg said rumours had been circulating the country about Dr Banda's illness, but he added he could not confirm the news report. In an apparent bid to scotch the reports, Health and Foreign Minister Heatherwick Ntaba last week told the official media the president was in good health. Dr Banda, believed to be in his 90s, underwent surgey to remove excess fluid from his brain last October. After a break during which the Presidential Council ran the country, he resumed leadership, but he appointed new ministers to control several ministries that had been in his hands for about three decades.
