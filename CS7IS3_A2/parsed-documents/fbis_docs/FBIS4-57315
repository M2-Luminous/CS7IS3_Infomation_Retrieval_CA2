The meeting, chaired by Lage, Machado Ventura, and Alarcon, discussed the budget, self-employment, local industries, the illegal sale of homes and vehicles, and other issues. As you can see, some of these issues are very current and of great interest. Nevertheless, I would like to focus on the budget alone. Finance and Prices Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez gave good news at the meeting, although right now it consists only of promising indexes. Rodriguez stated that in general, the management of the budget in the provinces in the first two months of 1994 shows encouraging signs. It is only a two-month period; nevertheless, it undoubtedly reflects that the imbalance -- which, as is often stressed hurts the country greatly -- is being corrected. Fifty-one percent of the nation's budget is managed in the provinces -- in other words, administered by the local People's Government. The Administrative Councils are in charge of controlling it, ensuring that only the amount budgeted is spent and that revenues match anticipated income in order to reduce the imbalance between revenues and expenses, which surpasses 4.2 billion pesos nationally and contributes to rarefying the national economy. Jose Luis Rodriguez also stated that calculations showed that fewer expenses and greater revenues were being registered. This is even more healthy. Rodriguez pointed out that irksome subsidies were on the way out, and that in general terms, a reduction of 6 percent has taken place in the deficit. Good news, just like hearing someone's fever is dropping. We cannot forget that this process has been called a healing of the internal finances. With an elevated budget deficit and an excess of currency nearing 12 billion pesos circulating, we have to admit that the national economy is experiencing problems similar to an illness. Rodriguez announced that so far Holguin, I might add, is the only province in the black in terms of revenues. In other words, it spends less than what it contributes to the budget. He also mentioned Cienfuegos, Las Tunas, Granma, and Santiago de Cuba Provinces as having a similar situation, but being supported by state subsidies. Another bit of news was that billing and payment management has improved. Minister Rodriguez stated that unsettled accounts diminished by 440 million pesos during the first quarter of 1994. Even better. However, the most important thing is that on this occasion guidelines were drafted to ensure that financial indiscipline does not make a comeback, because it would be unacceptable for this to reoccur in the provinces, where the finances are blooming much taller and stronger.
