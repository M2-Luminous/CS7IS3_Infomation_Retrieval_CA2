Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev today stated his point of view on the prospects for such meeting. [Kozyrev] It seems to me that this idea is gaining more and more support. Late last night I had a telephone conversation with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, where he said it should be well prepared and that this meeting, proposed by the Russian president, provided an answer to the main question confronting us at the moment -- how to prevent the bird we have managed to catch in Sarajevo slipping from our hands. [Voskoboynikov] Are you planning a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher? Quite a lot of issues worth your discussing seem to have accumulated lately, such as Bosnia or the Ames affair. [Kozyrev] I would like to say that it was a proposal of the president, who suggested a serious discussion of strategic matters with President Clinton. With us it is, as it were, as if a car were going along the road of partnership, but when a sharp bend occurs on that road, then it starts vibrating because it lacks various mechanisms. A stabilizing device is needed. A stabilizing strategy for mature partnership -- that is what it is all about. It was with this in mind that a meeting of ministers was proposed. At the moment we are searching for the best solution, but it is a fact that I received an official invitation today.
