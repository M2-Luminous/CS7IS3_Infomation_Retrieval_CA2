The dynamics of the main indicators of the standard of living show that in the past year the bulk of the population have been able to adapt to the new conditions. According to estimates, in 1993 the real monetary income of the population increased by more than 10 percent as compared to 1992. An especially fast rise of this indicator (almost 30 percent) was observed in the first half of 1993. An inflation jump in the third quarter slowed down the dynamics of real income. At the same time, comparing the distribution of the population by income level at the end of 1993 with the analogous period of the preceding year (in constant prices) shows a certain increase in the share of persons whose material situation became relatively better. One of the main social consequences of economic reforms last year was a considerable increase in stratification of the country's population by income level. The gap in per capita income between those in the top 10 percent income bracket and the poorest population groups measured at the end of 1993 a factor of 10.8 as compared to 8.7 in December of the preceding year. It is estimated that the top 10 percent of the population accounts for 30 percent of all income in society; in December 1992 it was 25 percent. The index of income concentration (the Gini coefficient) increased by the end of 1993 to 0.350 as compared to 0.256 in 1991 (0.327 in December 1992). The accelerated rise of this indicator over such a short period of time points to an extremely swift polarization of society. Despite continuous increases in social benefits, there remains a sufficiently large social group in the country whose income does not provide for an acceptable consumption minimum. By the end of 1993 there were 54 million persons (36 percent of the total population) whose income was below the subsistence level, including 4 million (3 percent) with income below the physiological maintenance level. In the poor category are mostly families with many children and incomplete families with children, families with a high burden of dependents and labor remuneration close to minimum wage, single pensioners, and the disabled. In the environment of a production decline and cutbacks in centralized imports of consumer goods, market saturation mainly took place through goods brought in by commercial structures and physical persons from near and far abroad. Imported products became more competitive in relation to domestically produced ones; this includes first and foremost household electronics and industrial goods.
