"We have enough things to discuss," a senior Foreign Minister official, Viktor Gogitidze, told Interfax on Friday. According to him, two big packages of issues will be discussed in the course of talks Rabin will have with President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. "This will include primarily Russian-Israeli relations. Solid legal foundations will be built for them for the first time ever. Several bilateral agreements, accords on cooperation in such areas, as culture, science and agriculture among them, are expected to be signed in Moscow," the diplomat said. The other package includes issues connected with a settlement in the Middle East, he said. "Rabin's visit to Moscow is particularly important, since it will take place at the conclusion of negotiations on Gaza and Jericho. We intend to discuss the possible ways out of the complicated situation the negotiating process has reached, so that agreements on Gaza and Jericho could be signed in the next few days. This would be conducive to lowering tensions in the occupied territories," Gogitidze said. According to him, "participants in the talks will focus on the Syrian direction." "Much in the efforts to gain peace and stability in the Middle East will depend on how the things will move in that direction. Unfortunately, movement in the Syrian direction slowed down of late," the diplomat said. "Therefore we intend to discuss separately the Israeli vision of settlement, what is needed to break the stalemate in the negotiating process, what Russia can do as a cosponsor of the peace process and a country that maintains close ties with both Syria and Israel." Interfax's interviewee also mentioned Russia's intention to get "first-hand information" as to what Rabin meant concretely when he proclaimed willingness to remove Israeli settlers from the Golan Heights in exchange for peace with Syria. "This is a totally new development of events," he said. When asked whether Moscow intends to exert "pressure" on Rabin, as the PLO leader, Yasir 'Arafat, who visited Moscow recently, wanted, Gogitidze said: "As a cosponsor of the peace process Russia refrains from exerting pressure on anyone. What is needed is a compromise that would suit both sides. Nothing should be pressed on any side. What has been pressed on someone will never be carried out."
