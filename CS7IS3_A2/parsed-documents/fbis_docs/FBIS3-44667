How strong is the momentum of development for the corporation in this new year of progress, both in reform and opening up and in economic development? With this question in mind -- a question that concerns many readers -- this correspondent interviewed Jiang Xinxiong, general manager of the China National Nuclear Corporation. "Speeding up structural reform and promoting development, both in science and technology and in economic power -- these are the targets for our corporation in the new year," said Jiang Xinxiong by way of opening the conversation, and already holding forth: "Only thus can we match with the corporation's line of thinking on development, genuinely maintain our status as a hi-tech force commensurate with our country's nuclear status, build a new nuclear- powered electricity system and a nuclear industrial system capable of meeting the demands of national energy development, and create a diversified operating mode and production force with a greater market share. Only then can we make new contributions to the development of the nuclear industry in the next century." Showing deep gratitude to the tens of thousands of the corporation's workers, he said: "In 1993, thanks of the efforts of one and all, we scored good results." Since its second grid- connected generation last March, the Taishan nuclear power plant has maintained steady, high-power operations, generating a total of 1.73 billion kwh by the end of last year, reaching 65 percent of its capacity. This feat has received good comments from experts inside and outside the country. The work design on the second-phase project is in full swing, and an almost 1,000-m tunnel has been bored. The No. 1 generating unit of the Daya Bay nuclear power plant is operating normally, achieving its full-load operating capacity on 27 November 1993. Jiang also stressed that the corporation's research and development department had achieved a number of results, nine of which were awarded Eureka Prizes at the 42d Brussels International Invention Fair. China's uranium enrichment technology and equipment also have achieved breakthroughs. China has built up a workshop producing components for an imported 900,000 kw water-pressurized reactor, which passed the examination of the importer. This signals China's ability to produce domestically and in a systematic fashion the fuel components for 300,000-, 600,000-, and 900,000-kw nuclear-powered generators. The adoption of the underground submersion [rong jin 3310 3190] and piled submersion [ye dui jin 0396 1018 3190] methods in uranium mining cut the average cost by 30 percent. Jiang Xinxiong also talked about the Chinese nuclear industry's effort to open overseas markets, the export of nuclear products for peaceful purposes, nuclear technology, and engineering projects. He said the project to export nuclear power plants to Pakistan had been going well since the completion of the first-phase concrete cement grouting last August, which had prompted talks between Pakistan and China on building a second 300,000-kw nuclear power generator. Contracts have been signed for the export of two 300,000-kw nuclear power generators to Iran. Last year, the foreign-exchange earning exports of the corporation's nuclear industry arm grew 75 percent from the previous year. General Manager Jiang changed the subject: "This year is a good opportunity for the corporation to speed up development." He also believed that deepening reforms and switching nuclear industrial firms' operating mechanisms are the keys. Through pilot projects in modern corporate systems and through moves to push enterprises toward the market, enterprises will grow stronger internally and workers will get incentives. Only thus can enterprises adjust to the new socialist market economy system. "This year the corporation is focusing on large-scale projects. Civil engineering work will start for the two 600,000-kw generators in the second phase of construction at the Taishan nuclear power plant, and the No. 1 generator at the Daya Bay nuclear power plant is in its final preparatory stages and will be in commercial operation in February. The corporation will further strengthen overseas cooperation, and will create conditions to propel toward the construction stage the export of nuclear power plants to Pakistan." General Manager Jiang said: This year, the corporation will concentrate its energy on giving play to its superiority, actively participating in market competition, and opening up overseas and domestic markets. It will work toward the targets of raising the annual gross nuclear industrial output value by 22.1 percent, and of raising the proportion of the gross output value of civilian products throughout the industry. He said with deep feeling: "This year happens to the 40th anniversary of the founding of China's nuclear industry. We should celebrate this glorious day with new successes!"
