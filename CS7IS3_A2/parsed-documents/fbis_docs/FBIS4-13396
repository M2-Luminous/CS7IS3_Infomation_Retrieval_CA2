Why is there this connection, and do you believe this is justified? [Al-Masri] Certainly, the Jordanian measure is justified, and maybe it should have been adopted before this time. This is because the losses inflicted on Jordan and the Jordanian economy are intolerable. Imposing such an embargo on al-'Aqabah is also unjustified. We do not believe such harassment at the Tiran Straits and the Port of al-'Aqabah is related only to the implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions against Iraq. We believe such an issue has other dimensions that might be related to the entire peace process. For some time now, since right after the end of the Gulf war, we have tried to reach an understanding with the U.S. Administration, and other concerned governments, about this issue. Jordan was very patient, but nothing was achieved. A certain measure had to be taken. This measure was the safest, the best, and the most logical, namely, to link our resumption of the peace negotiations with a solution to this issue. [Habib] Does this mean that if Washington does not respond positively to this Jordanian condition, Jordan will withdraw completely from the peace talks, as the House of Representatives requested? [Al-Masri] Jordan's policy toward peace is still a strategic one. I believe the al-'Aqabah issue will be resolved. I believe there is now a clear understanding of Jordan's position and the reasons behind Jordan's complaints. There are clear and strong signs, not only from Washington, but also from several Western capitals and from the UN Security Council, indicating that such an issue will be resolved soon. Resolving this issue will reflect positively on Jordan's stand toward the peace process. The peace process is a comprehensive process that is related to the entire region, not only to Jordan. I believe all the parties, the Arab and the international parties, understand the meaning and importance of peace, and the importance of the success of the peace talks, and consequently, of resolving the problems of the region and Jordan. [Habib] At the outset of talk about the siege on al-'Aqabah, you spoke about pressure. Do you believe that through this, the United States seeks to drag Jordan into signing a peace treaty with Israel? [Al-Masri] It is no secret that the United States, and Israel as well, wish Arab states would sign treaties or separate agreements. It is also not a secret that they would like Jordan to be one of the first states to make such a separate step. Over the past few weeks, the world listened to His Majesty King Husayn's statements in which he clarified Jordan's stand and said Jordan cannot conclude a separate deal, and that it does not agree to do so. Neither can it accept partial solutions, because this will neither be a just nor a comprehensive solution. Such ideas were put forth by some U.S. Administration officials. However, Jordan's stand is clear. I think it will not change. [Habib] In your opinion, what are the alternatives which guarantee the implementation of the international embargo clamped on Iraq, without making Jordan pay for this embargo? [Al-Masri] We, as Jordan, are not concerned about finding alternatives to the UN Security Council's, the international community's, or to any other side's embargo on Iraq. We are only concerned about the implementation of what is related to us. Regarding other things, let others find alternatives and solutions to them. At any rate, we comply with this embargo satisfactorily. However, the harassments of al-'Aqabah-bound ships do not just affect goods for Iraq, although they are legitimate goods and get the approval of the Sanctions Committee in advance, but also affect Jordanian commodities. There is proof and there are statistics that explain that the volume of Jordan's imports has not changed a great deal, particularly concerning banned imports to Iraq. Jordan's imports have not changed, the figures have not changed from what they were before the Gulf war. Consequently, it is clear that Jordan's trade with Iraq is not as big as those who impose the embargo on Jordan claim. [Habib] What is the volume of the losses as a result of the embargo? [Al-Masri] Hundreds of millions. I believe these losses reached some $2 billion that were primarily sustained by the Jordanian consumer. [Habib] King Husayn has said, on behalf of Jordan, that none of the parties involved has proved it is up to the responsibility of facing the challenges of peace. Amman is also interested in this peace operation. To what extent can Jordan be held responsible for delaying the attainment of definitive agreements with Israel? [Al-Masri] Jordan is one of the parties involved in the Arab- Israeli conflict. It is true that Jordan has a unique position and special leverage regarding the issue and the operation of settling the conflict. But, Jordan is only one of the parties involved. Therefore, every party should assume its responsibilities. As I have said, we believe in a just peace. We want to attain peace that recognizes rights, that safeguards Palestinian rights, and that will settle all the disagreements and the issues between the Arabs and Israel. When such disagreements and issues are settled, then Jordan and the other Arab parties will become ready to achieve the aspired objective of peace. However, it is impermissible to blame Jordan for obstructing this. If we want to achieve a just peace, it should be a comprehensive peace. Approaching one of the parties and bringing pressure to bear on it to attain a separate peace will not achieve the aspired goal and will not realize the strategy of peace, a peace that should be stable, just, and lasting. [Habib] The 13 April deadline has passed and the Israeli Army remains in Gaza and Jericho. Palestinian-Israeli negotiations foundered. What does Jordan have to say about this? [Al-Masri] Regrettably, the agreements that are being reached do not hold. Such agreements should be reached after more serious and careful study. The Arab-Israeli conflict and the settlement of the Palestinian cause on the Palestinian track cannot take place through general agreements and on large talking points. The agreement should proceed from the base upward. This means that understandings in advance should be reached on all the issues and disagreements, so the two parties will ultimately reach an agreement they will publicize. The opposite took place. Agreement was reached on major talking points and the agreement on details was left for later. The agreement foundered and we reached the present state of affairs. I believe that agreements should be respected, and the question of the 13 April deadline should have been met. Any delay, uncalled for obstacle, or procrastination will affect, and has actually affected, the credibility of peace and the possibility of moving further toward the other fronts and toward settling broader problems. [Habib] Then is this what Jordan avoids by refusing to sign a peace treaty with Israel, that is, not to be in the same situation? [Al-Masri] Yes, we said that we should agree on all points of disagreements in accordance with all issues and talking points so that we will eventually reach a general agreement that all parties speak about. [Habib] What is your position on the violence and counterviolence that swept the occupied territories and Israel? What do these actions mean? What is their influence on the peace process? [Al-Masri] What is taking place in the occupied territories is not unexpected. It is impossible to assume that security and political settlements will coexist inside and around Arab population centers on usurped Arab territories -- not just occupied, but usurped and confiscated. We cannot expect the situation to continue normally, especially since the citizens there see that there are negotiations that do not lead to a substantial result. The presence of settlers inside and around Arab population centers will surely lead to violence from both sides, because the settlers are ideological settlers who believe that the land on which they build settlements is theirs, that it is the land of greater Israel, which they want to maintain. On the other hand, the Palestinians and the Arabs do not accept this logic, and they have to reject it. If a citizen has the means to defend--whether it is a peaceful or armed means--he will use it. This is what is going on in the occupied territories. I think this will not stop with the Hebron massacre or the bombs and booby-trapped cars. It will continue until this situation is corrected, and until there is an Israeli recognition that the occupied territories are really occupied, without the presence of Israeli enclaves or disguised Israeli sovereignty there. Until then, I think violence will continue from both parties. As for the influence of this situation on the peace process, it has an impact and may obstruct the peace process and place it in trouble. It may prolong the process and prolong the pain before reaching any understanding--if we can say that the whole process will lead to an agreement and understanding. [Habib] What are the alternatives to the peace process? [Al-Masri] The alternatives are frightening and dangerous. The only alternative is the escalation of violence, pain, and instability in this region at a time when the world and all its regions are moving toward, and are concentrating on boosting, economic development, and entrenching security and social stability. In this case, this region, and probably Africa, will be the only explosive regions in this world. [Habib] U.S. assistance to Israel and Egypt remain as they are, but the Jordanian share is being reduced. It was announced in Washington that only $7 million will be given to Amman. How do you interpret the U.S. position? [Al-Masri] I don't think that the subject of assistance--whether economic, technical, or even military--is important to me or to Jordan. Probably, U.S. assistance in the past had some importance, but now I don't think it has any importance. Therefore, $7 million, or more, or less, will not affect the political line and will not give any lesson or sign. Even if this assistance is canceled altogether, it will probably be better. [Habib] Don't you say that this meager assistance is one of the U.S. ways to pressure Jordan? [Al-Masri] Seven million, even if you double it several times, will not affect the Jordanian economy or the course of Jordanian policy. Therefore, I don't want to consider this measure to be of importance to Jordan. I want to fully ignore it.
