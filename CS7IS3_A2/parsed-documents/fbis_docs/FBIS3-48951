Drnovsek told Ljubljana Television that so far it has been Slovenia alone that has initiated talks, `sticking by what is termed a soft stand.' That was why Slovenia decided to `cool off relations for Croatia to realize that this problem must be of joint concern,' said Drnovsek. In recent months, Slovene-Croatian relations have been broken off entirely, as was asserted also by Slovene Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle. One-time firm alliance between Ljubljana and Zagreb in breaking Yugoslavia has been affected by a series of outstanding territorial and other matters [sentence as received]. The central problem is posed by a future sea border in the Piran Bay. Both sides adhere to their origiinal stands -- Slovenia insists on the current border, Croatia on a redrawn border. The settlement of the sea border issue, analysts believe, might engage also an international arbitration. In that case an additional weight would be put on what are at this time only minor territorial questions.
