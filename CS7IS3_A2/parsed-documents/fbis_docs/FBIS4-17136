The communists won 86 seats, while the left bloc as a whole had more than one third of the votes in the parliament. In the words of Petro Symonenko, the KPU revealed itself as a significant political force. The communist faction is counting on fruitful cooperation with other factions and with nonaffiliated deputies. Petro Symonenko said: "We are entering parliament as a constructive force. We have a constructive platform that is aimed at creating conditions for a normal life for the people of Ukraine." It was reported at the news conference that more than 10 million citizens of Ukraine had voted for the communists during the elections to the Supreme Council, which in the party leadership's opinion, is proof of the adherence by a significant part of Ukraine's population to the ideas of socialist justice, internationalism, and an equal union of independent states. Regarding activity in parliament, Petro Symonenko noted that the communists would not give in to provocations by nationalists who "continue to frighten the people with supposedly the communists will paralyze parliament's work by submitting for discussion the issue on state symbols." In the words of the KPU leader, for the communists, the Supreme Council's first steps will be the formation of parliamentary and government structures, as well as the implementation of an economic program that envisages the introduction of state regulation in the basic sectors of industry and agriculture, introduces changes to the taxation system that, in the communists' opinion, is directed against workers and changes to the financial and credit systems etc. After this, the communists intend to submit for the parliament's consideration the issue of repealing the ban on the KPU and on returning assets that for the most part have become the property of commercial structures. Petro Symonenko informed journalists that in the near future, a meeting is expected to be held with Leonid Kravchuk, president of Ukraine, at the latter's instigation. The KPU also proposed that Ivan Plyushch form a working group to prepare the work of the new Supreme Council. This was agreed. It was stressed that the communists are taking part in the presidential campaign only for the sake of publicizing communist ideas among Ukraine's population. In the event of a communist contender being elected (Petro Symonenko's candidacy has been approved), he would do everything to ensure that power in Ukraine belonged exclusively to the councils. Replying to questions from journalists regarding the division of the Black Sea Fleet, Petro Symonenko said that in order to resolve this problem it would be necessary to return to a defense union with Russia, within which the problem would be resolved peacefully. Replying to a question about Ukraine's place in the world, Borys Oliynyk, KPU central committee member, said relations with other states should be built on the basis of equality.
