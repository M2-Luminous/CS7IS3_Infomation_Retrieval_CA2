An Intermediary Between the LDPR and GMM Has Been Caught in an Attempt To Defraud a Bank" -- last three paragraphs are commentary by Mikhail Leontyev] [Text] As SEGODNYA's correspondents have learned from reliable sources, over the past weekend the economic crime unit of Moscow's Southwestern Okrug uncovered and prevented a major financial fraud. According to the police, on 3 May [as published] two young men tried to obtain a credit of 600 million rubles at Perm and Samara banks, producing documents from the First Federal Bank and Transkredit-bank. An investigation showed that the businessmen had used forged documents, and they were soon detained on suspicion of fraud. The two men are Kazachenko, 25, unemployed; and Travkin, who described himself as an LDPR assistant deputy chairman in charge of international affairs. During a search $231,000 in cash was confiscated from the detainees, as well as four copiers, a Remington pump gun, and two hand weapons. We shall report more on the case in one of our next issues. Especially interesting in this apparently banal crime story is the fact that it is linked directly to reports of the Zhirinovskiy party's being financed by certain subcriminal groups, notably the well-known "Dutch trust company GMM," owned by Nenakhov. According to information from responsible sources, the above Maksim Travkin, who earlier worked for Nenakhov, was an initial link in "informal" financial relations between GMM and the LDPR. The emergence of Travkin as adviser to the LDPR deputy chairman for international affairs (Aleksey Mitrofanov, who is the next link in the same chain), as well as in lists of Zhirinovskiy party official parliamentary delegations, coincided with Zhirinovskiy's open lobbying in favor of GMM. It is enough to recall the LDPR leader's letter to the premier asking to rein in financial bodies ostensibly hampering the activity of a well-reputed company, and also his letters to state TV companies demanding that they resume GMM advertising, which was suspended following a letter from the Ministry of Finance. (Incidentally, Zhirinovskiy's letter for some reason produced an impression only on the Russian TV and Radio Company, which fulfilled his instructions diligently). As for the information about an attempt to obtain credit with false documents from the First Federal Bank, the meaning of "false" is yet to be clarified. The fact is that this bank is simply one of the semi-fictitious legal entities organized by Nenakhov. His firm's accounts have been seized by the tax authorities, which serves as legal cause for refusing to return money to GMM clients.
