Next week, Leonid Makarovych was asked, Ukraine's new parliament will begin work, and you are intending to make an initiative to postpone the June preterm presidential elections. Has this initiative already been fully prepared, or will it require some explanations of your standpoint? This is the Ukrainian president's reply: [Kravchuk] Not only how we will elect a president, but also what people, and with what powers, and what power we will form. This is a fundamental position. They say we have the law on the president [words indistinct], and that the president's status is determined. I am not saying that [word indistinct]. But in this case, all structures, all the way down to village council, should be compatible with each other. For example, if there is the president in Kiev with his present powers, that is, he is the head of the state and the executive power, while oblasts will have parliamentary structures -- which is actually the case, because according to the adopted law on formation of the power, it is purely a parliamentary structure -- then we have the president in Kiev, but without leverage and structures in the provinces. Therefore, one should change either the adopted laws or the law on the president. That is, the draft constitution says that the president is the head of state with certain powers, so we should coordinate these two laws: the law on the president and the law on forming self-governing and [word indistinct] power structures. There are no ambitions here. One just has to do it. If one doesn't, then the executive structures will be ruined after the elections. No vertical chain of command is envisioned. The adopted law does not so much as mention the president, if you read it carefully. At some point, it only says that state functions will be delegated to local government institutions, and that in this respect they will be answerable to the Cabinet of Ministers, but not to the president. In other words, when this law was examined by the Supreme Council, there was a revolutionary hatred for the president, and one could already feel that the president is not necessary as such and that his powers should be reduced, if any remain, to those of a representative figure. At present, however, things are different. So, this is why I say: let us bring everything down to a logical structure, changing either this or that. Then one could go to the elections. As for my position, why exactly I decided to run in the presidential elections. First, it is everyone's right to make such a decision, and it is not prohibited either by the constitution or by the law. Second, I began to be accused of supposedly opposing elections because I was said to be afraid of elections, and this idea has now gone spread through the country. Thus, in the present case I am going to speak in favor of canceling the elections (?at the level of) [words indistinct], who has decided to run as candidate for president. These are the main points, but there are also other ones. I just want us to make a responsible decision based on democratic principles. Why am I turning to the Supreme Council? But who else if not the newly elected Supreme Council can today resolve those issues? Can the new Supreme Council avoid reforming the power, the political reform in Ukraine? It cannot. This is its obligation, responsibility, and right. It is normal when the newly elected parliament initiates a relevant action based [word indistinct] on the law, order, and constitution. [Naumenko] The president of Ukraine was asked to explain the situation connected to the forthcoming visit to Kiev by Russian President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin -- this was agreed by Leonid Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin in Moscow during the last meeting of CIS heads of state and heads of government -- and also the statement by Crimea's President Meshkov that the Black Sea Fleet supposedly comes under the exclusive authority of Russia and Crimea's government. [Kravchuk] I consider that our relations with Russia, with Russia's president, and with the Russia Government, are constructive. As to the fact that there was a (?corresponding) statement, it was interpreted slightly incorrectly. Boris Nikolayevich did not refuse to visit; he said only that he will pay the visit when the acute problems have been resolved. Then there is the problem of the Black Sea Fleet. I think (?he did the right thing). When there is much that has not been resolved, it is somewhat illogical to sign, for example, a treaty on friendship, partnership, and cooperation when there are acute problems. Well, I support the Russian president's view that a treaty can be signed only when all the issues have been resolved. Anything said by other persons, including Crimea's president, is merely a personal position, his personal viewpoint. This personal viewpoint cannot be the fundamental one in relations between Russia and Ukraine today. I have always stressed, and I stress now, that I would very much like (?Crimea), its president, and the [word indistinct] officials to understand that relations between two states, two peoples, [words indistinct]. Whoever wants this relationship to be one of [word indistinct] and partnership should make efforts to bring this about, and anyone doing this will be a source of pride and a person of great significance for his people, but not [word indistinct] if he makes matters more acute and creates confrontations. [Naumenko] Do you consider, Leonid Kravchuk was asked, that the previous years of your presidency were years of constructive cooperation with the previous Ukrainian parliament, or was it time wasted in fruitless arguments and in the inefficient opposition of legislative and executive structures. Here is the head of state's reply: [Kravchuk] I have said already and have no other point of view on this, that if we had managed from the very beginning, from the very first steps, to reach accord -- it cannot be a consensus, this is ruled out -- but accord and constructive work in parliament, constructive work between the parliament and the government, between the president and parliament, I am convinced that we would have done far more, far more, in the area of legislation, in the area of executive discipline, in the area of reforms, market reforms, and in setting up democratic power institutions. We would have done much more. But this did not happen. All the time and in most cases [word indistinct], our relations were (?based) on mutual accusations. The executive structures blamed the legislative structures, sometimes simply undeservedly, and the legislative structures blamed the executive structures. This then became a kind of norm. Meetings began, sittings began, but everything proceeded in an atmosphere of mutual accusations. This did not bring any benefit. I hope, I want to believe, that this parliament (?will take) its first steps toward constructive work. There can be no unity there, because there are different people with various views. But what is fundamental is to attempt and see the necessity for constructive [word indistinct] with the government, the president, and with all other power structures. This is the main thing needed to achieve progress in solving economic and to social problems, and foreign economic problems [words indistinct]. [Naumenko] As is well known, the left-wing forces won a considerable number of deputies' seats at the elections. What is Leonid Kravchuk's attitude to the communist idea in general, the president was asked, has it changed at all? [Kravchuk] The Communist Party, the communists, and the communist idea are different things. I have never been a resolute opponent of, let us say, the right, (?if one may put this question), the right of the individual to believe in one or another idea, be it in communism or capitalism. This is everyone's right. There is the organization of the Communist Party itself. This is now a structure. There are (?all sorts of) structures, which arm themselves with an idea and want to put it into practice. No one can prevent anyone doing this in a constitutional way and within the laws of the state. As you have probably observed, when I (?left the party) in (?1991), I never [words indistinct], did not say that the communist ideology is an (?enemy ideology), that the Communist Party is a criminal organization. I have not said this. [passage indistinct] As far as individuals are concerned, some individuals of the current Communist Party are (?a worry), because they are of the red mayor type, that is they want revenge at any cost. If (?for example), you did not defend the Communist Party, then you are a traitor. If you left the Communist Party, you are a traitor. [Words indistinct] because the party envisages the right to join the party and to leave the party, and no one has the right to apply pressure. If this is democratic [words indistinct]. This is my attitude. I have an appropriate attitude to individuals, and I consider this a [word indistinct] standpoint. If one is to take this position, then the prospects [words indistinct]. (?He knows) that if he wants to leave he will be insulted, revenge will be taken, pressure will be applied, he will be called a traitor and then even persecuted [words indistinct]. Who will join such a party? We simply cannot generalize about this, but should look at specific things. This is my position. I cannot speak against any organization which acts within the framework and the boundaries of the constitution and the law. If an organization does not obey the constitution and the law, there is the procurator's office to deal with it, there is the Justice Ministry, and there are other legislative, legal, and law enforcement bodies to handle matters within the framework of the law and the constitution. [passage omitted] [Naumenko] On the eve of possible presidential elections, the relationship between Leonid Kravchuk and [former Parliament Speaker] Ivan Plyushch is a matter of great interest among people. What can the head of state say about this? This was the next question to Leonid Kravchuk. The Ukraine president was also asked to comment on the fact that for some reason our Ukrainian listeners, the Ukrainian audience and population receive most new information on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament from the newspaper IZVESTIYA. [Kravchuk] Ivan Stepanovych [Plyushch] has said that he will declare his candidacy and I told him that everyone has the right to run president. Ivan Stepanovych and I were together for four years in all. We sat at the table together for one and a half years, I as chairman and he as first deputy. In the last few years he was chairman [words indistinct], and naturally there were contacts between the chairman and the president. I know that Ivan Stepanovych has his standpoints, his point of view. This is normal. In my speeches I have never made any kind of personal observations regarding the Supreme Council chairman, regarding Ivan Stepanovych -- not once; nowhere; never -- because I believe that debates should be direct. [Word indistinct] debates do not bring any benefit. If there is no (?reply) when people sit opposite each other and have the possibility [words indistinct] to exchange points of view, this is normal. One has his point of view, the other has another point of view. [passage indistinct] I would say that the [trilateral nuclear] agreement is being implemented, that none of the three sides has any [words indistinct] to cast doubt on the agreement, which (?has been signed). Let us say that Ukraine is fulfilling its obligations, Russia is fulfilling its obligations, and the United States its fulfilling its obligations. Whether their dates coincide, whether their volumes coincide, sums of money, warheads, fuel elements, dates, and times is another matter. There are corresponding problems here. There are both objective and subjective problems. But they (?are being resolved). As far as deactivation is concerned, we are acting in accordance with the agreement. The agreement does not envisage complete deactivation; [words indistinct] gradual (?deactivation) is envisaged for the present. But we are fulfilling those obligations we have assumed, and will continue to fulfill them in the interests of (?this) trilateral agreement. This deactivation does not mean the withdrawal of warheads, you understand; it means their stockpiling [skladuvannya], if one can use this word, at S facilities. We are interested in these warheads being stockpiled. We are also interested, because, not having a direct and full control over silos, over nuclear warheads -- I do not have full control, I do not have technical control, because this technical control is located directly in Moscow -- I am interested in their not being on alert status [na boyevomu cherhuvanni] because this is more peaceful both for Ukraine and for the United States, especially as they are all aimed [word indistinct] at the United States of America. That is, I am in favor of deactivating them, deactivating them. As for what the state of play is today, on today's date, [words indistinct], I do not know exactly whether [word indistinct] 46, 36, or 26. The point is not [word indistinct]. The point is that we are fulfilling our (?contractual) obligations. [Naumenko] One of the questions to the Ukrainian president contained a request to comment in detail on a package of US assistance to Ukraine, dealt with during the Ukrainian head of state's March visit to Washington. Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk explained in this connection, as follows: [Kravchuk] It can be said that this has been discussed -- our problems and mechanisms for implementing the documents we signed in Washington, as well as Bill Clinton's letter -- during yesterday's meeting with the delegation headed by Burns. The point of the letter is that we should begin to act in three primary directions. The first direction is to use the $350 million designated for economic assistance -- not the $350 million for the dismantlement of nuclear weapons -- the $350 million for economic assistance. This is the first direction. The second one is the development of investment programs -- where could these funds be used directly. The third direction is the development of trade between Ukraine and the United States. Bill Clinton believes that this delegation should work in Ukraine in these three directions. During the meeting, we conceptually worked out our proposals, and, before the meeting with me, the delegation had had appropriate negotiations and consultations with governmental structures, including the Foreign Ministry. Thus, the point is how to use the $350 million, beginning immediately, without further delay. There was another proposal. You will recall, when the U.S. President was here, he said that the United States would grant this loan to support small business. Now, this figure has been put at $150 million. Then, the talk was about $50 million, now the amount has increased to $150 million. However, I want you, all of us and all those who are listening to us, to understand one thing. There is state assistance, state loans granted by other countries to Ukraine. These loans are granted under guarantees. They must be returned, and of course, the interest must be paid. The level, or the specific gravity of these forms of assistance is dozens, or even hundreds times lower than private companies' investments. For instance, Hungary recently received assistance from other states amounting to five [words indistinct] well about (?$150 million), while private investments have up to date come to $3.5 billion. Every year, the United States invests more than $50 billion abroad. However, who does it? General Motors, General Electric, Johnson and Johnson, Pepsi Cola, and others do it, meaning companies which have colossal capabilities. These investments are of a different nature. They come to a country, set up enterprises and joint ventures, with the state in such cases not undertaking any immediate guarantees. That is up to a joint venture. It is either viable and competitive, trading, selling and earning money, or its competitors and [word indistinct] (?displace it). I want you to understand that this is not the most important thing. The most important thing is to create in Ukraine conditions for investments of private capital. [Naumenko] (?On the subject of) plummeting production and inflation processes which, it is true, have lately been successfully placed under strict state control, the Ukrainian president was asked about his vision of economic development in Ukraine (?in the very near future). [Kravchuk] [passage indistinct] Comparing statistics, it is even greater, rather than less severe, in other CIS countries. However, I would like to say one thing which is very important. For instance, Ukraine was the first CIS state to have suffered a blow of the energy crisis, (?which called into question our very independence). You may remember how quickly prices, inflation etc. rose. Today, we (?have reached), let us say, [word indistinct]. It is simply impossible for energy and other prices to rise any higher because nobody will any longer buy the goods that are manufactured. If it is twice (?the price) [words indistinct], it is simply impossible. We have withstood that (?pressure). (?It is over now). We have withstood it. Now at rock bottom, as they say, we can and have begun gradually to advance. What does advancing mean? This means, and you can see for yourselves, that inflation has now fallen. Production in some areas is still falling, but there are increases too. New sectors are appearing. Last year, for example, 22 percent of industrial output was produced by lease enterprises. We now have up to 4,000 large enterprises that are subject to corporatization, i.e. setting up (?public limited [vidkrytyy]) companies. As many as 2,000 or so medium- and large-size enterprises have been privatized. In other words, there has appeared (?a demand) for the establishment of new economic forms and new forms of relationships, which enables me to speak of our ability to contain the situation and advance toward the unification of [words indistinct]. We should advance, and we have the opportunity to do so in the (?present) situation. I understand that it will be not easy, difficult [words indistinct]. [Naumenko] Because Ukraine will shortly have a newly formed government, the Ukrainian president was asked to dwell in greater detail on possible key personnel changes and replacements in the make-up of the government. [Kravchuk] You see, choosing people now and [words indistinct] cannot be a purely personal matter of the president. I believe that when we begin nominating a prime minister, I think it will happen before the presidential elections -- a newly elected legislature has to nominate a prime minister -- I will hold the widest-possible consultations with the various factions, the deputies' groups, and I will not only hold consultations but I will have to know the distribution of forces; that a particular candidate will be accepted and voted for because, to put it simply, I can nominate just anybody. However, where are the guarantees that this person will be accepted? Therefore, after the consultations, after such far-reaching discussions, I believe this could be done with respect to any name. Currently, we have no big claims, let us say, to such candidates as, well, just to anyone who is [word indistinct] submitted for the consideration of the Supreme Council and receives the Supreme Council's approval. However, I must know the opinion of the deputies' corps and the factions' -- socialist, communist, or democratic -- standing on the issue. All this should be agreed upon. By the way, there are no specific paths for Ukraine. In all countries of the world, before a candidate is nominated for a post, the nomination should be discussed and agreed upon. When the voting is held, I am sure that this candidate will receive an acceptable number of votes. The other thing is that I will convince the deputies, the factions, and groups that this candidate is the most proper person for this reason or that. I will convince them, but not simply by saying that I want just this man and nobody else, and if you do not agree, I will not nominate anyone else. This cannot be done. I did not have the opportunity to discuss with the deputies the question of a candidate for prime minister. I want to invite on 10 May, firstly, the group of deputies who proposed moving the date of elections, and also those who want to come to me on 10 May and hold an open discussion. I will elaborate on my position, why I think such and such, and they can speak out on their positions, and ask me questions. Well, they could raise the issue of the prime minister; perhaps this question will be raised. Therefore, we should not make a secret out of this. If we go openly to the Supreme Council, this cannot be a secret: These are not -- how should I put it -- palace tricks, this is a serious position which should be (?occupied by a person who is capable of holding this position). This is not simple. This person should be ready [words indistinct]. What I am saying now is that this will be done on the basis of urgent consultations with all factions, leaders, and groups. After this, a joint decision will be adopted. [Naumenko] The problem of housing in Ukraine's armed forces is certainly one of the most acute problems of our society. [Words indistinct] my journalist colleague thinks, reducing officers personnel. [Kravchuk] We need our armed forces to ensure the protection of the state. This corresponds with, let us say, our (?concept) and doctrine approved by the Supreme Council. [passage indistinct] As for social security, we have a program to provide officers [words indistinct] the armed forces, and also a program to retrain them. [passage indistinct] That was the leading topic in the United States of America: Of the money we are being allocated to eliminate nuclear weapons, the main proportion today has to be used to provide officers with (?proper housing). [passage indistinct] There are many opportunities for construction. There are building contractors who can now do this immediately [words indistinct]. So I cannot say that everything is ideal there, but the program [words indistinct]. [Naumenko] In the range of economic issues, the condition of government settlements with the agrarian sector of the economy is of key importance. The following is the Ukrainian president's answer: [Kravchuk] [passage indistinct] So, we are capitalizing on every opportunity to solve as fully as possible the problem of settling debts to the countryside, of supporting the miners, (?and of) subsidies we have allocated. [passage indistinct] We will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Ukraine and next year the 50th anniversary of the victory. I would like to say -- (?I have already said) -- that Ukraine will fully participate in all actions within the framework of the CIS. I now have an appeal by (Ivan Oleksandrovych Herasymov's) organization of veterans to determine our position with regard to decorations and medals, and this we are working on. So, it is about support both material and moral, because the people who were in the war at that time deserve that attitude toward them. By the way, the last shots fired in Ukraine -- I mean in combat operations -- were heard in 1944; fortunately none have been fired since then. [Words indistinct] we have not yet fully realized what it means that whole generations -- let us say, (?several generations) -- have not seen and do not know what war is [words indistinct]. This is our great victory -- that we maintain peace and calm in Ukraine. (?Credit) here, you know, must in honesty be given to the veterans. [Words indistinct] and know what those people lived through and how much they suffered and how many wounds they bear today. [passage indistinct] This will enable them to speak out and tell us about their hard life and about what they lived through, so we can make everybody respect them. This, you know, is the culture of our society and its future. [passage indistinct].
