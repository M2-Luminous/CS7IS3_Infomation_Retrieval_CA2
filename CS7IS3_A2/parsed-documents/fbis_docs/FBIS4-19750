From Barajas airport in Madrid, here is our correspondent Hector Arenas. [Begin recording] [Arenas] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana described the meeting in Rio de Janeiro as one of the most important between the EU and South American countries. This meeting is taking place after the approval and signing of the Uruguay Round. Foreign Minister Solana added that this meeting between Europeans and South Americans belonging to the Rio Group starts taking into account that last year the EU increased its investments in the American continent. They are now 33 percent, higher than the 30 percent made in the emerging Asian countries. Furthermore Solana highlighted the importance Spain gives to its relations with South American countries, not only economically but also politically, in the state reforms and in the battle against poverty. [Solana] It has to do with what we could call sustained development -- sustained development in the fight against poverty in the first place, and second, what we could call the measures for reforming the state, modernizing the state. We should remember that there is a cooperation far more important than the economic one -- especially for those countries with a growth of more than 3 percent; in other words, the countries of the Rio Group. Now there is an interest in cooperation, in helping with modernizing the state and its institutions. [Arenas] Solana underlined his frustration from the recent Bosnian-Serb attacks on the population of Gorazde. After these attacks, Spain and the countries searching for a solution to the conflict in Bosnia have decided to act together on two main fronts: to answer the request by the UN secretary general to extend the Sarajevo model to other safe areas and to coordinate a diplomatic initiative. And finally Solana announced that Spain was the first country to manage to get all of its citizens, mainly nuns and priests, out of Rwanda. [passage omitted] [end recording]
