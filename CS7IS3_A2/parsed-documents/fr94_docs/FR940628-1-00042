FR940628-1-00042 FR940628-1-00008 40 CFR Part 52 [OR&hyph;38&hyph;1&hyph;6335b; FRL&hyph;4998&hyph;9] Approval and Promulgation of State Implementation Plans: Oregon AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Oregon for the contingency measure plan for carbon monoxide (CO). The implementation plan was submitted by the state to satisfy certain Federal Clean Air Act requirements for Grants Pass, Medford, Portland, and Klamath Falls, Oregon. In the Final Rules Section of this Federal Register , the EPA is approving the state's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this notice. DATES: Comments must be received by July 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to: Montel Livingston, EPA, 1200 6th Avenue, AT&hyph;082, Seattle, WA 98101. Documents which are incorporated by reference are available for public inspection at the Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. Copies of the state's request and other information are available for inspection during normal business hours at the following locations: EPA, 1200 6th Avenue, Seattle, WA 98101, and the State of Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, 811 SW., Sixth Avenue, Portland, OR 97204&hyph;1390.
