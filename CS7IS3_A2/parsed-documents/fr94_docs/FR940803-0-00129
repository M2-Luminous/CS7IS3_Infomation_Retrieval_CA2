FR940803-0-00129 FR940803-0-00040 23. A new §600.510&hyph;93 is added to subpart F to read as follows: §600.510&hyph;93 Calculation of average fuel economy. (a) Average fuel economy will be calculated to the nearest 0.1 mpg for the classes of automobiles identified in this section, and the results of such calculations will be reported to the Secretary of Transportation for use in determining compliance with the applicable fuel economy standards. (1) An average fuel economy calculation will be made for the category of passenger automobiles that is domestically manufactured as defined in §600.511(d)(1). (2) An average fuel economy calculation will be made for the category of passenger automobiles that is not domestically manufactured as defined in §600.511(d)(2). (3) An average fuel economy calculation will be made for the category of light trucks that is domestically manufactured as defined in §600.511(e)(1). (4) An average fuel economy calculation will be made for the category of light trucks that is not domestically manufactured as defined in §600.511(e)(2). (b) For the purpose of calculating average fuel economy under paragraph (c), of this section: (1) All fuel economy data submitted in accordance with §600.006(e) or §600.502(c) shall be used. (2) The combined city/highway fuel economy will be calculated for each model type in accordance with §600.207 of this section except that: (i) Separate fuel economy values will be calculated for model types and base levels associated with car lines that are: (A) Domestically produced; and (B) Nondomestically produced and imported; (ii) Total model year production data, as required by this subpart, will be used instead of sales projections; (iii) The fuel economy value of diesel-powered model types will be multiplied by the factor 1.0 to correct gallons of diesel fuel to equivalent gallons of gasoline; (iv) The fuel economy value will be rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg; and (v) At the manufacturer's option, those vehicle configurations that are selfcompensating to altitude changes may be separated by sales into high-altitude sales categories and low-altitude sales categories. These separate sales categories may then be treated (only for the purpose of this section) as separate configurations in accordance with the procedure of paragraph §600.207(a)(4)(ii). (3) The fuel economy value for each vehicle configuration is the combined fuel economy calculated according to §600.206 except that: (i) Separate fuel economy values will be calculated for vehicle configurations associated with car lines that are: (A) Domestically produced; and (B) Nondomestically produced and imported; (ii) Total model year production data, as required by this subpart will be used instead of sales projections; and (iii) The fuel economy value of diesel-powered model types will be multiplied by the factor 1.0 to convert gallons of diesel fuel to equivalent gallons of gasoline. (c) Except as permitted in paragraph (d) of this section, the average fuel economy will be calculated individually for each category identified in paragraph (a) of this section as follows: (1) Divide the total production volume of that category of automobiles; by (2) A sum of terms, each of which corresponds to a model type within that category of automobiles and is a fraction determined by dividing: (i) The number of automobiles of that model type produced by the manufacturer in the model year; by (ii) For gasoline-fueled and diesel-fueled model types, the fuel economy calculated for that model type in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or (iii) For alcohol-fueled model types, the fuel economy value calculated for that model type in accordance with (b)(2) of this section divided by 0.15 and rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg; or (iv) For natural gas-fueled model types, the fuel economy value calculated for that model type in accordance with (b)(2) of this section divided by 0.15 and rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg; or (v) For alcohol dual fuel model types, for model years 1993 through 2004, the harmonic average of the following two terms; the result rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg: (A) The combined model type fuel economy value for operation on gasoline or diesel fuel as determined in §600.207(b)(5)(i); and (B) The combined model type fuel economy value for operation on alcohol fuel as determined in §600.207(b)(5)(ii) divided by 0.15 provided the requirements of §600.510 (g) are met; or (vi) For natural gas dual fuel model types, for model years 1993 through 2004, the harmonic average of the following two terms; the result rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg: (A) The combined model type fuel economy value for operation on gasoline or diesel as determined in §600.207(b)(5)(i); and (B) The combined model type fuel economy value for operation on natural gas as determined in §600.207(b)(5)(ii) divided by 0.15 provided the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section are met. (d) The Administrator may approve alternative calculation methods if they are part of an approved credit plan under the provisions of 15 U.S.C. 2003. (e) For passenger categories identified in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section, the average fuel economy calculated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section shall be adjusted using the following equation:
