Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] Federal Manager Josef Cap has announced a final offensive by his party before the referendum on Austria's entry into the European Union [EU] on Sunday [12 June]. According to a new SPOe poll, 35 percent say they will "definitely" vote for entry, while 20 percent say they would "most likely" vote yes. Another view is seen if one asks about the attitude of relatives and acquaintances: 38 percent advocate it, while 27 percent oppose. At a news conference on Friday, Cap reported on the results of an IFES [Institute for Empirical Social Research] telephone poll among 600 Austrians. Fifteen percent will "definitely" vote for entry. During this last phase, the SPOe will, above all, address women, because 24 percent of them (as compared to 47 percent of men) are definitely for EU membership. Even 55 percent of the voters of the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] believe that Chairman Joerg Haider is not interested in Austria but rather in the strengthening of his position for the Nationalrat election. The SPOe's arguments for the last week before the referendum are: Without the EU, tens of thousands of jobs will be lost, and Austria is "twice as safe" in the EU. Cap made the appeal that 12 June should be "free from any domestic policy constraints." Austria's future is at stake, he said.
