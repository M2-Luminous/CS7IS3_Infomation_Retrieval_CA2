This ought to make it clear there was no divisions in the party which swept to victory in the 1989 election and took power at independence the next year, SWAPO Secretary General Moses Garoeb said. He said SWAPO was confident of winning at least a two-thirds majority in the 1995 elections, conceding that this was not good for democracy. "Perhaps we will have to create our own opposition." The Namibian political opposition was weak, he said, but this was their own fault for "being puppets and traitors during the liberation struggle". SWAPO's Central Committee is to discuss its election strategy and the financial and political state of the party at its congress on Saturday.
