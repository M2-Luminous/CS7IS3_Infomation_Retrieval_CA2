He told reporters that the two countries were in contact on Monday [20 December] in New York and the DPRK had put forward a new plan in view of the U.S. suggestion proposed on 10 December. The spokesman, releasing no details of DPRK's proposal, said nevertheless that it was ``reasonable'' and would ``satisfactorily help solve the nuclear problems on the Korean peninsula.'' The DPRK and the U.S. have failed to reach any agreement during their regular ``contacts'' throughout December. Meanwhile, the United Nations Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is reportedly traveling to the DPRK on Friday following his visit to the Republic of Korea. He is the first UN chief to visit DPRK in the past ten years and is expected to hold talks with DPRK leaders on the deadlocked nuclear issue.
