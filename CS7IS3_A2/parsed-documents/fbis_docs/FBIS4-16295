Zhirinovskiy and A. Moiseyev, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, concerning the active debate on the future development of Kaliningrad Oblast among Russian and foreign circles. The letter states that no Russian can remain indifferent toward the oblast's future, because the latter is responsible for Russia's geopolitical situation, the reliability of its borders, and the stability of economic relations. The LDPR proceeds from the fact that the fate of Kaliningrad is a historical reality that emerged after World War II. Kaliningrad is part of Russia and it will remain so forever. However, some people are currently trying to distort the official party stand by speaking about LDPR's alleged readiness to make concessions to other states in the Kaliningrad issue. This is an open fraud. Its aim is obvious -- to force the constituents to turn away from the party and degrade the importance of its victory in the 1993 parliamentary elections. Residents of Kaliningrad and its oblast must know that the LDPR speaks out for the immediate resolution of the regional economic problems, the buildup of the military and trade ports, the development of relations with foreign partners, and the surmounting of transit difficulties through the adjacent territory. At the same time, the party notes that any economic reforms and experiments are senseless if they infringe upon the Russians' rights, who are turned into second-rate people attending to rich foreigners. Such reforms are doomed, and the LDPR will offer a tough resistance to them. Enjoying support from millions of its constituents, the LDPR is ready to work in the interests of the residents of Kaliningrad and its oblast.
