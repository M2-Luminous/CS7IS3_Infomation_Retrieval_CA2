In statements to Radio Cadena Nacional (RCN), from Cartagena de Indias, where he attended the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Chiefs of State and Government, Castro said "the principal cause is that the people want to emigrate." Dozens of Cubans have entered the Belgian and German diplomatic and consular missions in the Cuban capital in the past few days requesting "political asylum." "They do so," Castro told RCN, "to promote illegal departures from the country and to promote incidents in order to reap political dividends." He added that "in our country, whoever wants to leave can do so."
