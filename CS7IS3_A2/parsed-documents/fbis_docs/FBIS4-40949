Varennikov faces charges of high treason and conspiring with the aim of seizing power. Varennikov is the only leader of the 1991 coup, who did not agree to being granted political amnesty, announced by the State Duma on February 23, 1994, and who demanded that the trial be continued. The cases against the other defendants were terminated. Varennikov denied all charges brought against him during the preliminary investigation and in court. His interests will be represented by lawyer Dmitriy Shteynberg. Shteynberg's request for terminating the case in the absence of any criminal content in Varennikov's actions, was turned down, because only the court may take such a decision. Among the witnesses who are expected to appear in court are former commander in chief of the Soviet airborne troops Vladislav Achalov, Russia's Deputy Defense Minister Boris Gromov, former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev and former Soviet defense minister Dmitriy Yazov. The hearings will be chaired by Major-General Viktor Yaskin.
