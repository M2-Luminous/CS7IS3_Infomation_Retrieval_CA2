The commentary referred to remarks by the American President. JANA's editor for international affairs commented on this saying that "opinion and remarks expressed in this commentrary reflect the colonial viewpoint of the USA towards other peoples especially peoples who are endeavouring to build and assert themselves and take their decisions freely. This is a narrow-minded viewpoint leading the USA to mock international law and consider independent states as if they were her colonies or companies which she controls their resources. When American officials talk about changing other regimes, they should not forget that the American regime is the one which deserves to be change for it is founded on injustice, exploitation, persecusion of minorities including [words indistinct], racial discrimination and aggression. The remarks made by American officials against China, the Great Jamahiryah, India, North Korea, Iran and Cuba and other peoples who are genuinely independent contain a scent of aggression. The peoples against whom America declared her hostility and uncovered her plans towards them, should get ready in anticipation of the aggression which the American radio remarks said it was being planned. America [words indistinct] from the political stances she has been follwing that she is against all values and principles of freedom. She endeavours to distort civilisation and fuel wars. America commits daily tens of inhuman crimes against mankind civilisation. She threatens international peace. The peoples of the world continue to remember the crimes of America in Vietnam, Korea, Angola, Mozambic, South Africa, her strategic alliance with the Israelis against the Arabs, her instigation of conflicts in South America, her support for dictatorial regimes in South America, her promotion of drugs in the world and her acts of political assassination like that against the late president of Chile Salvador Allende. All free peoples and active forces are required today to see the true nature of America who uses a colossal arsenal for the realisation of her designs and exerting pressure on other peoples through intimidation, terrorism and bribery so as to abandon humanitarian values and surrender to american domination.
