Commander Bertrand de Lapresle said the first meeting of a joint Croatian-Serb commission to assess the Krajina ceasefire went off Friday without a hitch and was a "big success." The meeting was held in a "positive and constructive climate," commented the French UNPROFOR commander, who said he was "very happy" about the "goodwill" shown since a ceasefire was signed March 30. De Lapresle said the ceasefire terms had been respected but did not specify how far the two forces had withdrawn from the front line. He said they had gone "a long way in the right direction." According to the accord which took effect Monday, each group was to pull back 1,000 metres (yards) from the front line by Friday 0700 GMT, leaving a buffer zone to be patrolled by UNPROFOR. The withdrawal of heavy weapons was also due to be completed by Friday. Fighting has been going on for more than two years between Croatian authorities and the self-declared Krajina Serb republic, which occupies a quarter of Croatian territory and which wants union with Serbia. In Turanj itself, which passed into Serb control in 1992, most houses have been completely destroyed by the fighting. De Lapresle said a further meeting would be held "very soon" to resolve problems in the four zones placed under UNPROFOR control, which needed "high-level decisions." Earlier on Friday, Croatia's semi-official agency HINA reported that General Janko Bobetko had complained about Serb forces holding some positions in contravention of the peace agreement. In a meeting with De Lapresle, Bobetko said the Serbs were holding a position near the airport at Zadar on the Adriatic coast, where its guns also threatened the Zemunik airport recently reopened by Croatian forces, HINA said. He also complained that Serb forces were blocking access to Jasenovac, a historical site where 600,000 Jews and Serbs were massacred during World War Two by Croatia's Nazi-backed Ustashis. A delegation of Croatian Jews who wanted to visit the former concentration camp to commemorate the Holocaust were not able to reach Jasenovac Friday, according to the agency. It said the UNPROFOR commander promised to take up Croatian concerns with Serb officials.
