The APC's latest communique, which appeared today in a paid advertisement, stated that its deputies will fully join the Assembly sessions "to support any constitutional amendment bill that entails profound and substantial changes." The MDN, APC, and UDC were expelled from the National Opposition Union [UNO] for failing to support the plan for a political movement to demand to hold elections for a constituent assembly. The MDN stated in a communique dated 30 December that "it is not possible to continue using the same strategy used in 1993, and that active participation in the National Assembly is necessary to keep the electoral pledge it made to the people of Nicaragua." "We regret that the partisan and personal interests of some parties within UNO wish to ignore the 1990 mandate of the people and call for the election of a constituent assembly to change the government, something that is not mentioned in any UNO document," the MDN indicated. The MDN feels that summoning a constituent assembly is not viable, "let alone changing the current government." The APC, in turn, stated that the country's need to make substantial changes in its legal system prompted it to participate in the National Assembly. "It is essential that we approve laws to definitively settle all disputes that place obstacles in the path toward an adequate climate of confidence for investments, such as the solution to the ownership problem," the APC communique noted. Another reason the conservatives headed by Miriam Arguello and Francisco Anzoategui gave for returning to the National Assembly was that the dispute that has lasted over a year in the Assembly prevented the approval of legitimate laws. In congressional circles, Arguello's appointment as chairwoman of the commission in charge of studying and issuing a report on the constitutional amendments is taken for granted. The APC board of directors stated in its communique that it has decided to maintain relations with parties, institutions, and trade groups that wish to make a positive effort to find the path toward solving the nation's problems. The board members affirmed they will maintain the party's independence regarding their positions and decisions in line with their principles and programs. The expulsion of the UDC, APC, and MDN from the UNO ranks and the announcement of marches in favor of the constituent assembly are creating internal friction in parties such as the PSD [Social Democratic Party]. During a meeting of the PSD National Executive Center [CEN] yesterday, there was a heated debate about the party's official position to support the summons to a constituent assembly. The Social Democratic Women's Front today harshly criticized PSD Secretary General Alfredo Cesar, accusing him of taking the party to extremist stances. The social democratic women issued a communique asking that a general assembly be held to hold new general elections to replace or confirm the current CEN and to consider the PSD's participation or exclusion from UNO.
