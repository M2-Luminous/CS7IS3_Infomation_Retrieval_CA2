The figure covered technology transactions registered across the country. But does not include the Tibet region and Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. The technology market was first introduced into China nine years ago. And the paid transfer of science and technology has helped the country's development, according to Han Deqian, Vice-Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC). The government has helped the market by introducing competitive mechanisms and protecting intellectual property rights. And the market boom indicated that China's technological market had "entered a new era," Han said. The boom was spread right across the country last year with each of the 25 provinces, autonomous legions and cities dealing in at least $11.5 of technology transfer contracts. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which saw a 105 per cent jump in its technology trade over the previous year, was singled out by Han. But Beijing stayed at the top of the table with a contract volume of over $400 million. Of the 29 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in the survey, 28 witnessed expansion of their local technomarket. And the average value of individual contracts rose by over 30 percent to $9,700. This indicated a remarkable improvement in the level and quality of the traded technologies, Han said. China will focus on improving the management, legal, supervision and investment systems for the technological market. And it will aim to establish a competitive and standardized technomarket, Han said. Full support would be made available to train techno-agents and to develop the market's intermediary institutes. The technology market is an important part of China's market economy, he said. And it was keeping pace with a country, which was taking off economically. In the past years, the central and local governments have pushed Chinese scientists and technicians to devote themselves to the commercialization, industrialization and internationalization of technology.
