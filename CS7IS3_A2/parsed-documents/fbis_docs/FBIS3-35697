Twice the barricades outside the White House have been dismantled but they still stand firmly in people's awareness, dividing them into two hostile camps. The flames of confrontation are not being left without fuel. The trial over the State Committee for the State of Emergency case is continuing -- an absurd trial of people who tried to encroach on power in a state which no longer exists. From their uncomfortable dock the accused have already moved to seats in the Federal Assembly, having received a vote of confidence from voters. Yet the trial is still continuing and an attempt is being made to persuade us that this is some supreme justice and public benefit. Investigations are also developing into the events of 21 September through 4 October in Moscow. If they are conducted objectively then they are bound to go beyond the framework of a criminal case involving the organization of mass riots and will force us to return to the sources of the event, to political assessments of the two sides' actions. The question arises: Why is all this necessary? Why have we, in other cases so tolerant of failure to comply with the laws, suddenly used the ancient principle of "let justice be done even if the world comes to an end!" The voting in the State Duma on the question of an amnesty for the participants in the events of August 1991 and September-October 1993 revealed a most unexpected disposition of forces: The proposal received no support not only from their political opponents but even from some of those who ideologically and organizationally are quite close to the State Committee for the State of Emergency members and the Lefortovo prisoners. The motives? "Let them be patient for a while," I was told later in the corridors. "These trials keep the opposition in good shape, enable it to maintain a useful tension in society." I have already written repeatedly about how radicals at opposite political flanks unexpectedly merge and how much they need each other. Some need rousing slogans for demonstrations, other pretexts for calling for the struggle against "communofascism." I allow myself to disagree with one other widespread argument: An amnesty will mean an admission of guilt. In legal practice the most diverse forms of amnesty are known, including those which simply offer to end legal proceedings or investigation. Such an amnesty could be a way of drawing a line under the past, a step toward national conciliation. As we know, that is the path which was taken in the past in post-Franco Spain, in Argentina, and in some other countries. By rejecting the persecution even of those who were involved in mass repressions and by rejecting the idea of retribution, people there gained something greater -- civil peace and stability. What awaits us in the immediate future: an aggravation of political confrontation? Crowds taking part in meetings under the slogans of "freedom!" on the one hand and "shoot them like dogs!" on the other? Or the peaceful respite the country needs so much? To a considerable extent that depends on how the amnesty question is resolved.
