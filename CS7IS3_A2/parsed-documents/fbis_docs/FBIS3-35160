The Israeli authorities warned the Palestinian leaders that they might be attacked by members of fanatical Jewish organizations. The Palestinians sources said the warning was repeated following the recent progress in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and the imminent implementation of the transitional period. The sources pointed out that Israeli rightist groups and parties are very critical of the statements made by al-Husayni and other figures pertaining to the Palestinian determination to establish a Palestinian state that has its capital in Jerusalem.
