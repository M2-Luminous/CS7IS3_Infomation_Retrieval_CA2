Reporter Marash Mirashi was present in court for Albanian Television: [Mirashi] [20-second audio outage] and gave his own explanations. After affirming the innocence of Manush Myftiu, he asked the court to reach its verdict, just as Prosecutor Fana had, in his summing up, in calling for a five-year suspended sentence. Riza Icka, defense counsel for Adil Carcani, said practically the same thing. Kleanthi Koci, defending former President Alia, characterized Alia's trial as unconstitutional and called for his total acquittal. Meanwhile, Ilir Selenica, defense counsel for Rita Marko, called for a not-guilty verdict for his client. He stressed that the summing up had presented a malicious view of Marko. The prosecutor had demanded a 10-year prison sentence for Marko, while on almost the same charges, a five-year suspended sentence had been demanded for Carcani and Myftiu. In his final statement, the defendant Marko said essentially the same. Analysts consider such cases as clear contradictions. Roland Permeti, defense counsel for Simon Stefani, asked the court to find his client not guilty, based on the arguments that he had presented to the court. A six-year sentence for Hekuran Isai would be very harsh, his attorney Selenica said. The charges against him are built on exaggerated statements that do not hold water. Arben Vane, defense counsel for Aranit Cela, said that it was impossible for a lawyer such as Cela to have committed deeds that ran contrary to the law. He requested that a not-guilty verdict be passed for this defendant. Attorneys Luan Behri, Arqile Lole, and Vladimir Bineri also requested not-guilty verdicts for defendants Zylyftar Ramizi, Rrapi Mino, and Veiz Haderi. Chairman of the Court Celiku then asked to hear the final statements of the defendants. The last communist president, Alia, stressed that the charges were a result of state pressure. He then converted his final statement into a political speech, similar to those of 1990-91, but this time without any applause from his devotees. Defendant Simon Stefani submitted his final statement in writing to the court. Then the other defendants, Isai, Ramizi, Mino, Cela, and Haderi, spoke, all demanding to be acquitted. At the end, the court withdrew to consider the verdict, which will be announced at the next hearing at 1700 [1500 GMT] on Tuesday 28 June.
