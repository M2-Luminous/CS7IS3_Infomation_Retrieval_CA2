FR941019-2-00124 FR941019-2-00080 (1) such conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect_ (A) on trade or commerce which is not trade or commerce with foreign nations, or on import trade or import commerce with foreign nations; or (B) on export trade or export commerce with foreign nations, of a person engaged in such trade or commerce in the United States; 52 and 52 If the Sherman Act or the FTC Act applies to such conduct only because of the operation of paragraph (1)(B), then the Act shall apply to such conduct only for injury to export business in the United States. (15 U.S.C. §§6a, 45(a)(3) (1988). (2) such effect gives rise to a claim under the provisions of [the Sherman Act or the FTC Act], other than this Section. Illustrative Example C Situation: Companies E and F are the only producers of product Q in country Epsilon, one of the biggest markets for sales of Q in the world. E and F together account for 90% of the sales of product Q in Epsilon. In order to prevent a competing U.S. producer from entering the market in Epsilon, E and F agree that neither one of them will purchase or distribute the U.S. product, and that they will take ``all feasible'' measures to keep the U.S. company out of their market. Without specifically discussing what other measures they will take to carry out this plan, E and F meet with their distributors and, through a variety of threats and inducements, obtain agreement of all the distributors not to carry the U.S. product. There are no commercially feasible substitute distribution channels available to the U.S. producer. Because of the actions of E and F, the U.S. producer cannot find any distributors to carry its product and is unable to enter the market in Epsilon. Discussion: The agreement between E and F not to purchase or distribute the U.S. product would clearly have a direct and reasonable foreseeable effect on U.S. export commerce, since it is aimed at a U.S. exporter. The substantiality of the effects on U.S. exports would depend on the significance of E and F as purchasers and distributors of Q, although on these facts virtually total foreclosure from the Epsilon market would almost certainly qualify as a substantial effect for jurisdictional purposes. 3.132␣Jurisdiction in Cases Under Subsection 1(A) of FTAIA To the extent that conduct in foreign countries does not ``involve'' import commerce but does have an ``effect'' on either import transactions or commerce within the United States, the Agencies apply the ``direct, substantial, and reasonable foreseeable'' standard of the FTAIA. That standard is applied, for example, in cases in which a cartel of foreign enterprises, or a foreign monopolist, reaches the U.S. market through any mechanism that goes beyond direct sales, such as the use of an unrelated intermediary, as well as cases in which foreign vertical restrictions or intellectual property licensing arrangements have an anticompetitive effect on U.S. commerce.
