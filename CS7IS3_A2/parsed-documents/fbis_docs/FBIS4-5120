The Khmer Rouge lost their ruby- and timber-rich headquarters of Pailin in a government offensive just over two weeks ago, and the government's call for a total ceasefire before roundtable talks can be held remains in force. "If we want to have talks now, talks must be in a different mood," co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh said this week. "Now the Khmer Rouge have nothing." The Khmer Rouge's public face, Khieu Samphan, has requested an audience with the king and is expected to arrive in the Cambodian capital within the next few days, Royal Palace officials confirmed. His presence, however, is not likely to lead to talks unless he is willing to offer a surrender, that is if Prince Ranariddh and his co-Premier Hun Sen can maintain their strong positions militarily and politically. But the 71-year-old king has cancer, and wants to be remembered as the uniting force of a divided Cambodia after he dies, according to diplomats and observers. The cancer has spread to his bone marrow and King Sihanouk has been undergoing chemotherapy in a Beijing hospital. But he is returning to spend about a month in Cambodia in order to celebrate Khmer New Year with his compatriots on April 13-15. Diplomats as well as Cambodian Government officials had believed that King Sihanouk was likely to die by mid-1994 and would return to Cambodia for his final days. But recent reports from the Royal Palace say the king's cancer has gone into remission. However, they warn of a possible stroke from arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. His arrival at Pochentong Airport on Friday will be shrouded in secrecy. Prince Ranariddh, Hun Sen and acting head of state Chea Sim will be the only people allowed to greet him upon his arrival, Royal Palace officials said. The diplomatic corps, brass band, lines of bowing Cambodian officials and throngs of journalists who normally greet King Sihanouk at the airport have been told they are not invited. Even the crowds of flag-waving schoolchildren who are normally trotted out to the roadside to cheer his speeding motorcade have been told not to come. King Sihanouk has gone bald due to months of chemotherapy, and palace officials do not want him photographed. Whether he will walk of his own accord off his plane or be carried off, will be left to speculators or spies to say. A special room has been set up at Calmette Hospital in case he needs emergency medical attention, and French doctors were asked to disinfect his room to cut down on the possibility of infection, [word indistinct] sources said. The king will only be able to receive visitors for one hour each morning and one hour each afternoon during his stay. The diplomatic corps hopes for at least one window of opportunity, as do chosen "representatives of the people" who traditionally ask the king to solve their problems during the Khmer New Year.
