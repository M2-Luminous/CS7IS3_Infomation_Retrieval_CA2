The explosion, which occurred early this morning at the garage door of Barbagelata's home, located in a residential district of Montevideo, caused fairly serious damage to the house and neighboring buildings, but no one was injured. A commando called the Guard of Artigas, which presumably groups retired military men and officers on active duty who have ultra-rightist leanings and who are linked to the old de facto regime (1971-1984), claimed responsibility for the attack in a call to EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO newspaper, and justified its action with its repudiation of "the corrupt judicial system." After the attack, police found a Guard of Artigas pamphlet that contains harsh criticism of recent sentences that have been handed down by the Judicial Branch. Paules, who was also president of the Military Circle, has been sentenced to eight months in prison. The sentence, which was confirmed by two judicial instances, was handed down for the crime of "disrespect for the president," due to his harsh criticism of President Luis Alberto Lacalle on 21 October.
