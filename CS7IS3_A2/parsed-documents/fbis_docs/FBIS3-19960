"We have no such fears," Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd told me when he received me at the Foreign Office. "We had a meeting here last week, attended by a number of experts, to discuss what could happen in Italy after the elections. The conclusion was optimistic. We are all suffering from some degree of political malaise. Freed from the fear of the Cold War, people are more critical of the political system. This applies to Britain and America (consider Ross Perot), France and Germany, Spain, Japan, and Italy: There is the same feeling that the system must change. But this is no cause for alarm. I know Italy, and I know how adaptable and imaginative you are. A different system will emerge, and new people, too; but I see nobody ready to leap into the saddle of a white charger to impose an authoritarian system." Douglas Hurd does know Italy well. He is a former diplomat. In fact, the final phase of that career was in Rome, from 1963 to 1966, before he left the diplomatic service for politics. I asked him what advice he would give whatever government is formed in Italy after the elections. "I believe," he told me, "that the most important task for all of us in this decade is to achieve the maximum integration with Central and East Europe. And Italy is in a very favorable position in this regard, with its formidable experience. This is why, with Foreign Minister Andreatta, we proposed initiating a political dialogue with the new democracies of the East, even before they join the European Union [EU]; and this proposal has been accepted. Italy meets all the conditions for performing an important role in all fields -- economic, political, strategic. Then there is the matter of maintaining good relations with America; both you and we are well placed. We must also conduct a good philosophical discussion on the future of the EU with a view to the conference to revise the Maastricht Treaty in 1996. These are the three things on which to concentrate." What about domestic policy? "In domestic policy, the problem that worries all of us is the budget. You are in difficulties, and so are we. This is why Italy is also eager to reduce the EU expenditure (now that it has become a net contributor) -- maybe not using the same tone as Mrs. Thatcher, but using similar arguments, though Italy is an enthusiastic member of the Union." [passage omitted] Most of my conversation with Mr. Hurd was devoted to the subject of Europe, once again "in crisis" following the demand by London and Madrid that the Council of Minister's voting system not be changed -- as all the rest propose --after the accession of the four new members: Sweden, Austria, Finland, and Norway. London and Madrid are demanding that within the Council (in which each of the four major states commands 10 votes, the rest proportionately fewer, down to Luxembourg's two) the "qualified minority" remain 23 votes -- as it is now, out of a total of 76 -- instead of increasing to 27, out of the new total of 90. That is, they are demanding that two major countries plus one minor one (instead of two major and two minor) continue to be enough to veto majority decisions on such issues as environmental and health policies. This problem, though relatively unimportant (in practice no decisions have ever been imposed on two major countries), has nevertheless created an overheated political atmosphere in Britain, with a view to the June European elections. The anti-Europeanist wing of the Conservatives are threatening to rebel if Major and Hurd yield on the 23-vote qualified majority. For the Major government, which is not in good health, a defeat in the European elections could prove fatal. So, week after week, a decision has been deferred, and there is a danger that the enlargement will be deferred, too. I told Hurd that the last time I had been in the room was exactly 14 years ago, to interview then Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington, in the midst of the crisis sparked by Mrs. Thatcher, who "wanted her money back." He was interested to read the clipping from THE TIMES which headlined the interview: "Dangers of a Family Feud." At that time I asked Lord Carrington whether Britain's membership in the Community was in jeopardy; can the same question be asked today? "Definitely not," Hurd replied. "Nobody now is asking it; our membership is irreversible. We have worked on enlargement for so many years, and we certainly do not intend to abandon it. But serious matters are at stake, such as the ratio between population and the number of votes in the Council, and it is better that we do not venture into such deep waters and that we leave these matters to the revision conference in 1996." Hurd said that the "centralist" vision of such founding fathers as De Gasperi and Monnet -- which was valid for making a conflict between European countries inconceivable -- is now rather dated. "We are witnessing," he said, "a conflict not between Europeanists and anti-Europeanists, but between two equally Europeanist visions: One is more centralist, while the other envisages a central core and a number of different structures and sectoral policies that need not involve everyone. This variable geometry is possible, as long as there is this core, even though we do not all see it the same way and I do not know now what we will decide in 1996. We are just at the start of a great debate. But it is not only the centralist vision that is Europeanist; so too is the other one, that of those who do not want national states and parliaments to surrender more and more powers to the center and have in mind something more difficult but equally European -- a decentralized system based on subsidiarity, better suited to the Europe of today." With regard to voting in the Council of Ministers, Hurd said: "We already have a compromise between different principles, and the future system will be a compromise, too. We want to conclude the problem over the majority vote quickly. But we cannot race ahead while we are still digesting Maastricht: The EU has been in existence for only three months. We cannot immediately start talking about the next change whenever anything changes; and this is not the time for a major philosophical debate or to entrust the matter to a committee of wise men. This is a problem for the governments to resolve." I reminded Hurd that in a famous speech in the fifties Anthony Eden said: "We feel in our bones that we do not belong to Europe." Have the bones of the British changed, or are they still the same? He replied: "Of course they have changed. Even Mrs. Thatcher knew that she was European: Even her bones were different from Eden's, because she belonged to a different generation. When I attend a Council of Ministers session -- which happens rather too often -- I know that this is the right place for a British foreign secretary. But we must create a Europe in which we all feel comfortable." In our conversation we also discussed Yugoslavia (like everyone else, Hurd too feels "anxious and frustrated," but he denied that everything has failed: Most of the aid and the blue helmets have come from Europe; but it is necessary to improve the mechanisms of European foreign and security policy, in which he said he is "fully in favor") and Russia. Hurd agrees that space must be made for Russia within G-7, by turning it into G-8 for political matters: "We must be vigilant but open, ready to involve the Russians that want to work with us, such as Kozyrev: If the Russians are left out, they might not cooperate."
