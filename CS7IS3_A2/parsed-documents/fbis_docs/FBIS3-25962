On the surface, the "tide" produced quite a few negative effects, such as traffic jams, population pressure, worsening law-and-order conditions, and poor public hygiene. However, behind such superficial problems, there were also many favorable factors, and its contributions to the national economy must not be neglected. The "tide" involving 15 to 20 million migrant laborers from the countryside is a special socioeconomic phenomenon in the Chinese mainland. Rural laborers move in large numbers from poor and backward areas to economically developed areas. This is not only an major way to shift the surplus rural labor force, but also an effective way to develop and utilize labor resources and to promote employment in the countryside. Although movement of rural laborers in large numbers into cities may cause many problems for cities and urban communities, most rural laborers who have come to cities maintain the virtues of working hard, leading a simple and honest life, and being kindhearted. They sell their labor and strive to get rich through hard work. They are willing to undertake all kinds of heavy manual labor. In particular, such dirty, exhausting, and dangerous jobs of collecting night soil, removing garbage, dredging sewers, and moving stones, which few urban residents are wiling to do, are now mostly undertaken by laborers from the countryside. As some people said, if all rural laborers leave, some cities may certainly become paralyzed. In the mainland, rural laborer have not only contributed their strength and sweat to urban economic development, but have also built "roads" and "bridges" for raising the rural people's living standards to the level of being comparatively better-off. After working hard in cities a number of years, some rural laborers master certain market information, production skills, and management knowledge; at the same time, they also accumulate some money. Then, they return home and set up shops, plants, or businesses. They thus become a new force for developing township and town enterprises and promoting the rural economy. Many of them play an exemplary role locally in getting rich. According the data provided by the Rural Enterprise Bureau of Jiangxi's Ganzhou Prefecture, in the first 10 months of 1993, laborers returning home from work in cities set up 1,200 factories and business companies in their home areas, and made a total investment of some 40 million yuan. These institutions offered 100,000 jobs to local people. As another example, more than 5 million rural laborers from Anhui Province supported economic construction in many provinces, and half of them mastered skills. Skilled rural workers from Anhui's Wuwei County set up more than 30 enterprises after returning home, and they all achieved satisfactory business results. Some even export their products to overseas markets. In addition to running enterprises after returning home, many rural laborers also helped their home areas promote sales of native products and seek employment channels for the surplus labor force in their home areas, as they became better informed and had more knowledge and connections. At the same time, they also introduced capital, technology, and skilled manpower back to their home areas. For example, more than 10,000 rural laborers from Gansu's Zhengning County worked in more than 30 trades in more than 20 provinces and regions throughout the country. When earning money, they also brought a large quantity of technical information in the fields of crop farming, animal husbandry, building materials production, and processing industry back to their home area. According to incomplete statistics, between January and November 1993, they brought back over 1,200 pieces of valuable economic and technical information. With the help of their information and connections, the county sold one-third of its farm produce to other localities, set up 13 shops and plants, dispatched over 1,000 batches of rural laborers, and increased local peasant income by over 30 million yuan. When they were working in economically developed cities, many rural laborers also received training or studied by themselves, thus improving their educational and technical conditions. Some people attended night schools to take secondary-school courses or even took college courses by means of correspondence and television. For example, about 600,000 out of the more than 1 million rural laborers from Anhui's Fuyang Prefecture working outside their home area have taken different forms of vocational and technical training. A young girl who worked as a household assistant in Beijing learned medical knowledge and skills from her employer. In 1988, she returned home and run a factory producing more than 10 types of medical-related products, which were sold at home and abroad. Along with the industrialization and urbanization of the rural economy in the Chinese mainland, the significance of the "tide of rural laborers" for the development of urban and rural economies is getting more and more prominent.
