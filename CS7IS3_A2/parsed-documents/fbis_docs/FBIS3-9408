The Ministry also shed light on some cases in which the investigation against Defense Ministry employees came to a halt precisely because of the blockade by the Defense Ministry. Gojko Bervar reports: [Begin recording] [Bervar] Minister Bizjak, Mitja Klavora, the head of the Criminal Police, and State Secretary Borut Likar first armed themselves with a tape of the first contact between the Defense Ministry and the operational communication center of the interior minister in the Smolnikar case. From the tape, one really cannot conclude that it implies rejection. On the contrary, the Ministry of Internal Affairs constantly tried to convince the representatives of the Defense Ministry to take Smolnikar to a police station in Domzale. However, further discussion proved that, at the time of the contact, the members of VOMO [Defense Ministry Security Organ] already had Smolnikar in Kardeljeva Street in Ljubljana [VOMO headquarters] and that they were calling the police, I quote, to avoid a fuss. [no reference to close of quotation as heard] Mr. Gasper, as a representative of the Defense Ministry identified himself, even said: [Gasper] The thing is that we should have questioned him a little more. [Bervar] At the news conference Minister Bizjak said that this was not the first case in connection with Defense Ministry employees. In all these cases, ranging from the suspicion of arms trafficking, some [word indistinct] thefts, suspected embezzlement in Orbis enterprise [manufacturing submachine guns] and even in the well-known cases of the public letter by the Civilian Initiative and the explosives placed under the car of Member of Parliament Jelincic -- in all these cases the investigation came to a halt because of the lack of cooperativeness and, in some cases, the prevention of further investigation on the part of the Defense Ministry. The Interior Ministry first warned the prime minister about all this at the end of last year. They also drafted a special report that, in its conclusion, points at (?ambiguities) in the legislation; however, a meeting that would clarifying everything did not materialize, also because the acting VOMO director assured Mitja Klavora that he does not have any such instructions from the defense minister. Ivo Bizjak also dismissed the possibility that any sort of subversive organization would be active within the Ministry and said that there is not the slightest proof for this. Milan Smolnikar is not an employee of the Interior Ministry and all hitherto investigations by the police were within the boundaries of legal procedures, they said at the news conference. However, they have established the activity of a group of people within the Defense Ministry, consisting of various organizational units of this Ministry, which, besides illegally prescribed tasks on the field, also engages in special tasks that are not the responsibility of this Ministry, some of them precisely in Ljubljana.
