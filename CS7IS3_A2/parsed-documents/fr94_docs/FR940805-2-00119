I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Act, the Chicago Stock Exchange is amending the rules for its institutional matching system, the Chicago Match (formerly known as the Match Market Exchange Facility). II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The CHX submitted to the Commission Amendment Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 to request that the Commission amend its proposed rules relating to the proposed Chicago Match System (``Chicago Match''). The purpose of Amendment No. 4 is to further amend the proposed rules relating to the Chicago Match by (i) changing the cross price of the match to the mid-point between the consolidated best bid and offer regardless of the size of the spread; (ii) reporting to the consolidated tape or NASDAQ the cross price plus or minus the average liquidity fee for each stock stated in 256ths; (iii) limiting the maximum liquidity fee or liquidity credit (received or paid) to 1/2 of the spread of the consolidated best bid and offer at cross time (regardless of the size of the spread); and (iv) not permitting orders to sell short to be entered with a liquidity fee. As stated above, this amendment changes the proposed cross price for the Chicago Match. As initially proposed, all matched orders will be executed at a random time within a pre-determined ten minute window period at the market price at such time. The market price will still be calculated based upon the spread of a particular issue. However, rather than changing the price depending on whether there is a 1/8, 1/4, 3/8, etc. spread and determining whether there is an order imbalance, Amendment No. 4 proposes to have the Chicago Match calculate the market price as the mid-point between the consolidated best bid and offer regardless of the size of the spread. For example, if the consolidated best bid and best offer for stock X was 20&hyph;20 1/8, the cross price would be 201/16. As a result of the above change, Amendment No. 4 also changes the way trades in the Chicago Match are reported to the Consolidated Tape or NASDAQ. As proposed, the Exchange will report one trade for each stock executed in the Chicago Match. That trade report will include the total number of shares executed in that stock and a price equal to the cross price plus (or minus) the volume weighted average of liquidity fees paid (or liquidity credits received) for that stock. Also as a result of the above change to the cross price, limited price orders, orders with a liquidity fee or credit entered in cents, and orders that are entered with a liquidity fee or credit relative to the consolidated best bid or offer or as a computed quantity (in addition to liquidity fees or credits entered in cents) will be eligible to be displayed orders. The Exchange will assign numeric values to these orders based on the then current consolidated best bid and offer. It is anticipated that initially the Exchange will update this information at least every 15 minutes or such less time that is possible.
