The committees will keep watch on the procedures for biddings and receive complaints from companies that fail to get contracts, the officials said. The move came in response to a series of major corruption scandals, which exposed rampant, illegal collusion between politicians and big builders to fix public works contracts and deflect official investigation into bid-rigging. The committees, which comprise five experts, will advise the ministry's local branch heads. They will monitor and assess fairness of the qualifications for bidders for the public works contracts given by the local construction bureaus.
