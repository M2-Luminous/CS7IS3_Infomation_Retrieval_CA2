"The case of Wei Jingsheng is by no means an issue of human rights," spokesman Shen Guofang told a weekly press briefing. "Human rights does not simply mean releasing a criminal, which is totally irrelevant to human rights," Shen added. The spokesman's remarks fuelled speculation that Wei may face fresh criminal charges following his arrest April 1. The Chinese authorities have said Wei, who was released in September six months shy of a 15-year jail term for "counter-revolutionary" activities, is currently being investigated for "suspected new crimes." No official charges have yet been brought against the 43-year-old dissident. Shen made similar distinctions concerning the brief detentions of pro-democracy activists in Beijing and Shanghai during the recent visit of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. "They are not democracy activists. They are criminals, most of whom are still on parole. "Therefore, during such parole the Chinese legal authorities have every right to take action," Shen said, adding that the detentions "had nothing to do with the visit (of Balladur)." However, of the four dissidents detained during the French prime minister's visit -- Xu Wenli, Wang Fucheng, Bao Ge and Yang Zhou -- only Xu is still currently on parole. Shen also said the Chinese authorities were having difficulties handling lists of political prisoners handed over for their consideration during visits here by foreign dignitaries such as US Secretary of State Warren Christopher. "After some investigation, we found a lot of problems with such lists. Some people simply do not exist and some people have already been released," Shen said. "We often check the contents of such lists with those visiting leaders and we found that even they did not have a clear idea about the source of such lists and the people named in them," he added.
