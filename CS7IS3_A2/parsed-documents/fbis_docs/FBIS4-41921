You should congratulate me for a small victory -- the Commission for Fighting Corruption is now able to come out from the underground and work openly. We came out today. I should say that the commission was joined today by a very large group of people's deputies who will officially cooperate with this commission. We have big apprehensions as to whether the second round of presidential elections will be held at all. We expected Vyachaslaw Kebich to withdraw his candidacy; by the way, some journalists were already reporting this at 1500. We are actually afraid of this happening. That would be the first step toward a disruption of the second round, because later it will be easy to control people going to the polling stations. They will simply be forbidden, by leaders and other officials, to go to the polling stations. If you go to your polling station despite all the obstacles, it will mean that you are going to vote for Lukashenka. That is, it will be a very personal-style nationwide vote in the second round. However, this has not happened. We also receive information from all those circles, which have started to scatter; they run [words indistinct] to our team, as well. They report that [words indistinct] Kebich will withdraw his candidacy. We thought that this would happen today, yet it did not. This is one of the main topics discussed by Kebich's team. I think that these people scarcely have any chance of winning in the second round. A disruption of the second round would lead to the Hryb scenario. According to the Constitution, if the presidential elections are declared invalid, [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Hryb will come to power. Well, it is surely better and more convenient [word indistinct] than that Lukashenka. I had a very lengthy conversation with the head of the Central Electoral Commission about the next round of elections. This round may be held on 7 [July], but the Central Electoral Commission fears that the technical side of the preparations will be disrupted and that appropriate measures will be taken to disrupt the elections [words indistinct]. For example, a lack of ballots at the polling stations in due time may disrupt the second round. This means that the election may be declared invalid. Abramovich [head of the Central Electoral Commission] will be the person to blame, but, still, the elections could be declared invalid.
