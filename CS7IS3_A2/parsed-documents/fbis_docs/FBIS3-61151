The papers report that Armenian parents, upset with the latest decision, urged the Armenian Patriarchate in Istanbul to appeal the decision. The two dailies publish on their front pages on 23 November the text of an appeal, in Turkish, by the boards of trustees of Armenian schools in Istanbul to the Ministry of Education. Copies of the appeal were sent to Turkey's president, the speaker of the Turkish parliament and the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The appeal states that the right of private Armenian schools in Turkey to teach in Armenian stems from the Treaty of Lausanne which Turkey signed in 1923 with Allied Powers ending all hostilities. The appeal quotes the relevant articles of the treaty guaranteeing the right of the use of Armenian in private Armenian schools and adds that this right was codified by Law No. 625 on Private Educational Institutions and that it is also enshrined in the 1982 Constitution. The appeal concludes that, as a result, "the administrative measure dispatched to our schools by the Training and Education Council [of the Ministry of Education] has no legal or judicial basis." The appeal adds: "We request respectfully that, in view of the reasons enumerated above, this administrative measure which has caused great distress to our schools, students, their parents and our community be reviewed and repealed." A front-page editorial in MARMARA by the paper's publisher Robert Haddeciyan on 26 November says that the controversial decision by the Ministry of Education jeopardizes the mission of the Armenian schools in Turkey and notes that no Turkish government, even during the "darkest days for democracy," repressed the right of Armenian schools to teach in Armenian. The editorial says: "We do not wish to mention the Treaty of Lausanne here, because even if there was no Treaty of Lausanne, today's democratic Turkey would gladly permit our schools to use Armenian as their language of instruction without hindrance because this is what the doctrine of this era requires even in the case of groups which are not considered minorities. In any event Turkey did not wait for the democratic ideas of today to bloom to respect the principle of permitting Armenian instruction for 70 years. However, today, with an unexpected and astounding step and an approach that contravenes principles of the modern era, our schools have been instructed to stop teaching in Armenian, except for the Armenian language. It is very odd." The editorial questions the motives for such a decision saying that the use of Armenian in Armenian schools has not in any way harmed Turkey or instilled disloyalty among Turkish citizens of Armenian ancestry. The editorial concludes: "We would like to hope that the appeal of His Holiness the Patriarch to the Governor [of Istanbul] will have a favorable outcome, although we believe that the Governor's Office is not the correct authority to which such appeal should be addressed because the issue arises at the level of the Ministry of Education. However, if the said appeal does not produce the desired outcome, His Holiness the Patriarch must think about other appeals and measures."
