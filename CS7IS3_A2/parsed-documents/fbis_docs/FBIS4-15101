As Vasyl Shpitser noted, the mayoralty has reached a new level of cooperation and assistance to the city. Since IDA is subordinated directly to the U.S. Government, it can be said that the Lvov Administration has begun cooperation with the U.S. Administration. Cooperation with the Lvov Administration will proceed according to a drafted program. The project "Municipal Finances and Management" is to be implemented first. As project director Eric Chatwind stated, the project includes several programs. The agency's permanent adviser is to arrive in Lvov, and will assist the Lvov Administration for two years. Moreover, also expected are advisers on specific issues who will arrive during the implementation of the project. Lvov specialists will attend special courses in the United States, and scientific seminars will be held in Lvov. In the near future, the U.S. side will grant to the Lvov Administration $2 million to purchase computers and other equipment necessary to ensure regular operation of the mayoralty. Additionally, the agency will help the Lvov Mayoralty to receive a considerable 17-year loan from the World Bank, which will be used for municipal needs. I promise the mayor that we will bring with us all the knowledge in municipal management that exists in the United States, and that we will share this knowledge with you, Eric Chatwind pledged. Lvov has won the right to implement the U.S. project in a tough competition among such cities as Kiev, Odessa, Mykolayiv, or Ternopil.
