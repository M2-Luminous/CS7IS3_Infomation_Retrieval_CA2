Colombia would like to again become a serious country, a country that wishes to become internationalized, a country that does not want populist politics but wants to modernize. The minister became a terrorist target due to what he represents. The idea is to intimidate all of those who would like to modernize this country. The minister, therefore, represents a threat to them, the guerrillas, who are incapable of convincing the Colombian people with their laconic language, with their message of violence and terrorism. Obviously, they oppose all changes in this country; they do not want this country to feel sure of itself or leave violence behind. [Moderator] A question by Carlos Ruiz from Caracol while Javier Cardenas of Super gets ready. [Ruiz] Mr. President, the American community awaits your statement regarding your candidacy to the post of OAS secretary general. Will you accept the nomination that certain countries have proposed? [Gaviria] I still do not know if I will accept. It is public knowledge that several countries, several governments, have expressed interest that the Colombian president be nominated to the post of OAS secretary general. I am listening to some of the arguments and have spoken to numerous heads of state, and the foreign minister has made consultations. When we estimate that the time is right, we will make a decision, considering not Cesar Gaviria's personal interests but the country's interests, the nation's interests, and we will see whether the country is interested in holding the seat of OAS secretary general. That is why public opinion should realize that I would be representing the country as a Colombian candidate and not simply as my personnel aspiration. [Moderator] The next question is by Javier Cardenas of Radio Super while Carlos Ruiz of Caracol gets ready. [Cardenas] Mr. President, what is your reply to the people who say that you are negotiating the post of OAS secretary general in exchange for allowing the installation of U.S. military bases in Colombia? [Gaviria] I believe those affirmations are ridiculous, simply ridiculous. I understand there can be people who may question the presence of advisers or engineer personnel or people who are helping to fight drug trafficking in Colombia, and I would be willing to reply to such a question. The Colombian president does not negotiate the country's position, however. The president defends the country's sovereignty, defends the country's interests, even though the president can understand that in certain cases there can be legitimate doubts and concerns. In other cases the president sees certain intentions to protect drug-trafficking interests; unfortunately, in these comments all sorts of opinions become intermingled. There are the concerns of those who legitimately have concerns, worries, and doubts, while there are some who may worry that the country will continue its antidrug--trafficking struggle. Unfortunately, many recent rumors are seemingly promoted by the latter. [Moderator] Next question is by Antonio Jose Caballero of RCN while Sabina Hernandez from Toledar gets ready. [Caballero] Mr. President, are you willing to reply to the other part of the question? Public opinion is listening. Why did the gentlemen come to Juanchaco Base? What are their specific tasks? Why did U.S. airplanes overfly Barranquilla yesterday while people complained--especially after they overflew the airport? [Gaviria] With pleasure. You have asked me two questions, but I will reply with pleasure, because these are related topics. In Colombia there is a U.S. military presence engaged in civilian work, advisory work, maintenance work, training of Colombian troops, and, on other occasions, their own training. Colombia approved a law back in 1947. There are numerous agreements, memorandums of understanding, and accords. These U.S. military missions have taken place during every administration. The specific case of Juanchaco is covered by a memorandum of understanding signed by Defense Minister Rafael Pardo and the U.S. ambassador for joint engineers corps exercises. I would say that the building of a school and hospital are subproducts of a joint engineer corps training. The same goes for the building of river ports, such as the one built in San Jose del Guaviare, another being built in Puerto Lopez in El Meta Department, and others that are planned in Magangue even though there is still an agreement that these are tasks of an engineering corps nature, which are backed by an agreement between both governments. Regarding the overflights yesterday, those were duly authorized flights that are part of the struggle against drug traffickers. The Colombian Air Force has authorized them, which is legal. The Civilian Aeronautics Directorate was duly notified, and because these airplanes have radars, they report to the control towers of the Colombian military base in Barranquilla; therefore, as far as the president of the Republic knows, everything had been agreed within the procedures. There was no violation. These airplanes--which were authorized by the Colombian Air Force--did not have to report to the control tower, and the Colombian flights were not in danger. That is the information the president has received from the Director of Civilian Aeronautics, as well as from the defense minister; nevertheless, the Civilian Aeronautics Directorate is conducting an investigation and will release some information, but the information I have received today from the commander of the military forces, acting defense minister, as well as from the director of Civilian Aeronautics totally coincides to what happened, and, as far as we have been able to verify, those flights involved no irregularity. [Moderator] Sabina Hernandez from Todelar Radio poses a question, and Azucena Lievano from the "24 Hours" newscast prepares her question. [Hernandez] Mr. President, after this morning's attack on the finance minister, it was reported that other cabinet members, other government officials have been threatened. Isn't it worrisome that we have these types of violent deeds and threats against high-ranking government officials? [Gaviria] Of course, of course it is; and the country must know and always remember that in this country there are guerrilla groups dedicated to terrorism, that the individuals who perform public duties--not just the members of the government but other types of public duties, such as journalism and other activities, people linked to the private sector--must take relatively important security precautions. The government is taking many precautions but cannot fully guarantee anyone's security. As I already said, these are desperate actions by Colombian guerrillas, aimed at trying to show that they still at least have the terrorist force, even if their military force has been undermined, and statistics clearly show this. They want to show that even if the number of kidnappings in Colombia has been reduced significantly, that the number of guerrillas in jail has grown rapidly, that the number of soldiers killed in combat is much less than the numbers of previous years, that even if we have so many successes to show in the struggle against drug traffic, against the guerrillas and against terrorism, they have even more capacity for producing personal attacks such as the one against the finance minister. [sentence as heard] [Moderator] Azucena Lievano asks her question, and Diana Mateus of the [word indistinct] Radio. [Lievano] Mr. President, Rafael Santos' column in EL TIEMPO says that he feels that Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin is looking for a seat for the president of the Republic with the nation's resources and in the presidential plane, which is touring some countries seeking votes for you at the OAS. What is your response to this? [Gaviria] I answered that question in part, but I think it would be good to broaden the response. This country, as part of its modernization process, must also modernize its international policy. Countries do not get automatic positions at international organizations, rather, through the support they get and by presenting their candidacies as candidacies of the country. If the country continues to adhere to the idea that the aspiration or possibilities of its nationals to aspire to organizations of governments, such as this one, we would simply never have access to the international organizations. [sentence as heard] The other individuals who have nominated themselves for this office--and I have not--have the full support of their governments. A foreign minister has been campaigning for several years, and no one from his country has told him he is undermining his country's interests or asked him why he does it. The other one is a former foreign minister, and he did so in the same manner and he has all the support of the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry. These are things that form part of the learning process the country has to undergo to overcome its provincialism and to understand that for a country it is important to get international positions. I believe this country should feel honored, because other presidents and other governments believe their president can be secretary of the organization of all the American states. What the foreign minister is doing is being done for the country; she is involved in a consultation process. She has also carried out extensive processes to achieve progress in Colombia's cooperation with Caribbean nations; that is a process to which we have been committed for quite a while. You have seen the president travel to Trinidad and Tobago; you have seen the president travel to Jamaica. You have seen how the country has tried to amend something that represented a critical mistake in our international policy, meaning, turning our back on the Caribbean. There are other Caribbean countries on the continent--Venezuela, Canada, the United States, Mexico--which have an active presence there. Unfortunately, because we have always looked toward the Andean mountains and never toward our seas and outside our country, we had that attitude of ignoring and turning our back on the Caribbean. We have now changed that attitude and are looking toward the Caribbean; we are working in the Caribbean. In my opinion, what the foreign minister is doing is useful for the nation, and it has been done based on something that benefits the country's interests rather than its president. [Moderator] The following question is from Diana Matheus of Radio Santa Fe. William Parra of CMI is next. [Matheus] Mr. President, if your nomination to the post of OAS secretary general is confirmed, aren't you afraid this might provoke political confrontations, particularly with the Costa Rican Government, whose president and foreign minister have stated this might result if you accept this nomination to the OAS post? Also, if you are not elected, will you play the fool, as some presidential hopefuls have stated? [Gaviria] First of all, I would like to make something clear: I have made no decision; you are asking a hypothetical question. Second, the Costa Rican president and his foreign minister have clearly stated that there could be no confrontation between the two countries. It would be a friendly and normal dispute within international relations. I believe the country would hurt itself greatly if it were to think that the only way to be present at an international organization would be by getting unanimous votes. A country would do itself a disservice if it were to believe that it cannot compete or that if it loses it is a national tragedy. No. To be part of the community of nations is to understand the rules of democracy. It is to understand that one can participate, can present candidates, or can win or lose. I am not speaking about my personal case. I am talking about any case or any candidate presented by Colombia. Colombia cannot tie itself down to the anachronistic idea that if a candidate is presented it is due to personal not national interests and that a candidate cannot be presented unless there is a certainty that he will win. If that certainty is not there, what would the international community think? What kind of an attitude is this? I think these are very big misconceptions about a country's international policy. A country that wants to have a presence in the international scenario must be willing to face these contingencies. It must present candidates, nominate its nationals, fight for them, and abide by the rules of democracy. I am not talking about my personal case. I must examine all factors, listen to commentaries. I must read what the columnist wrote yesterday or the comments made by distinguished presidential hopefuls. You must be certain that I will assess them, but this does not mean that the country should cling to such anachronistic ideas, ideas that are very foreign to the country's interests. I think that to refuse to have an international presence, to fail to participate in international organizations, and to feel that it is indecorous to compete is very bad for a country. [Moderator] William Parra will ask the next question. Pablo Mantino of Colprensa will prepare his question. [Parra] Mr. President, there are certain analysts who are saying that the attack on the finance minister is a way of reminding the government of the guerrilla presence or a way of pressuring the government into a dialogue. Your government has favored the policy of repression. The doors to dialogue have been closed for the time being. To what extent will your government be willing to implement again the peace policy? To what extent will we be on the verge of witnessing elections that will again be violent, elections with attacks on the candidates, not by drug traffickers this time but by guerrillas? [Gaviria] The Colombian president--this president--has never shut the door to political solutions. I believe in them, and I think that they will bring peace to this country some time in the future. The guerrillas can be certain of one thing, however: The government's policy will not change as long as there are terrorist attacks and bombs. On the contrary, this is convincing us further of the need to insist on our policy of strengthening intelligence and the public force, insisting on creating counterinsurgency battalions and mobile brigades, and strengthening our justice. This is all attacks like this produce. Another thing they produce is the nation's indignation, the people's rejection of guerrillas. I am certain that there is not a single good citizen--good citizens are the majority of the people in Colombia--in this country who does not reject an attack like the one this morning. If the guerrillas think they are going to change this nation through attacks, they are very wrong. All they are doing is isolating themselves further. [Moderator] The following question is by Fabio Pantino, followed by Maria Claudia Pena of LA PRENSA. [Pantino] Mr. President, the Socialist Renewal Movement has warned that the Antikidnapping Law is a legal stumbling block to any agreement with the government. What can the government do to dispel any apprehension by the Socialist Renewal Movement? [Gaviria] My answer is that that is a discussion we must hold at the negotiating table with the Socialist Renewal Movement. Sooner or later we will come to a point where we must hold a discussion on that issue; we will have to find a solution at the negotiating table. The position of the government, the government negotiator, the peace adviser, and the government minister is that-- as cited by the Congress of the Republic--kidnapping will not be a [word indistinct]. We have to hold discussions with the movement at the negotiating table, and I would not like to draw conclusions on what the negotiations would be like, nor am I at liberty to interpret the movement's position. Nevertheless, the government's position has been that one, and that position is supported by the president of the Republic. The antikidnapping law cannot be set aside during discussions with the Socialist Renewal Movement. [Moderator] The following question is by Maria Claudia Pena and will be followed by Hugo Barter from Univision. [Pena] Mr. President, in case you do decide to run for the post of OAS secretary general and in case you are elected, would you be willing to resign as president? [Gaviria] I would like to say that I have not thought about that. Hypothetically, if I were to run and win, I would expect the position to be compatible with the conclusion of my presidential term. If I do decide to run, those within the OAS organization in charge of making decisions will have to remember that my presidential term ends on 7 August 1994. In this respect, I would have to request congressional permission to travel, and I am sure there would be no problems. [Moderator] It is now Hugo Bartlet's turn, followed by Ana Fernanda Valderrama from the "National" newscast. [Bartlet] Mr. President, during this last stage of your administration, what will be the objective--militarily speaking--if at this time the guerrillas have become public enemy number one concerning terrorism? [Gaviria] We do not plan to change our policy toward the guerrillas due to what took place. The guerrillas have been conducting terrorism for a long time. Maybe they have not conducted any terrorist attacks such as the one against Minister Hommes for some time. Their activities within the urban area were mostly restricted to explosions and some bus burnings. This attack makes it more unusual, however, and places the guerrillas in a more recalcitrant position than what they had previously adopted. They have now resorted not only to terrorist attacks but to selective attacks. Somehow this will serve to remind the country how the guerrillas really think. The guerrillas believe that the process of more democracy and modernization can tolerate violent acts. This attack gives us a picture of the real nature of the Colombian guerrilla movement, how it thinks, how cruel it is, how merciless it is, and how its back is completely turned to what national reality really is. That is what it has shown us today. This stresses that the policy we have followed so far is the most appropriate. [Moderator] Ana Fernanda Valderrama, followed by Fancisco Celis of EL TIEMPO. [Valderrama] Good afternoon, Mr. President. The Colombian Government has not hesitated on numerous occasions to forward protest notes to other countries due to abuses against Colombians in other countries. Concerning Venezuela there have been numerous reports of abuses along the border, however, and abuses against Colombian prisoners in that country. There was a report recently related to a helicopter that crashed in Colombian territory. Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin traveled to Venezuela, and just when everyone was expecting a protest note it never came. Why does the Colombian Government hesitate so much when it comes to this case? [Gaviria] Relations between Colombia and Venezuela are excellent. President-elect Rafael Caldera has also said the same thing. There will be more and more incidents as our economic and political relations continue to grow. We cannot respond to every incident through protest notes unless it is absolutely necessary. The Venezuelan authorities--their foreign minister, defense minister, president, attorney general-- have all heard our versions of the facts, our report. They have offered to investigate them and have undertaken their own investigation. We trust that those responsible will be punished if our version of the facts turns out to be true, as I think it is. We have the duty, however, of having a constructive relationship with a nation whose relations are good, with whom we have a common destiny, and we are not undermining our sovereignty or the rights of Colombians by not sending a protest note every time there is an incident. We also have to remember that over there they also have problems, that there are Colombian guerrillas who kidnap stock breeders and Venezuelan citizens, that there are Colombians who are linked to drug-trafficking networks and that they have been extending their drug-trafficking activities to that country, that there are Colombians who have links to the robbery of vehicles. What if Venezuela did the same thing to Colombia? That for every incident or every kidnapping, or every such situation, every stolen car, they sent a protest note? No. The two nations cannot work this way. These are two sister nations that have excellent relations. What we try to exhibit is if there is comprehension and understanding in a relationship, things can be talked out; they are discussed, analyzed; commitments are made. If for every incident we sent a protest note, we would not be helping the relationship between the two nations. Therefore, the foreign minister--after talking to the defense minister, the attorney general, the president of the Republic, and the president-elect--decided that a protest note was unnecessary and, thus, did not deliver it. [Moderator] Francisco Veliz asks his question, and Jairo Gomez of the "Seven O'clock Newscast" prepares his. [Veliz] Mr. President, the country will receive important revenue from the sale of the Bank of Colombia and the absorption of the cellular telephone system. What will happen with those funds? To what field will it be assigned? [Gaviria] Concerning the funds from the Bank of Colombia, there are resources that belong to the Guarantees Fund, which is the institution that backs all the financial system in case of problems, and there are resources that belong to the nation; they are ordinary government resources that must be used in public projects once they are integrated into the national budget. Concerning the resources of the cellular telephone system, most of them are assigned to the social telephone system, but, of course, the government and Congress together could designate how they will be used. Those are two processes that are using totally open mechanisms and which, once completed, concerning the Bank of Colombia, it will be sold after finding the best bidder. Concerning the cellular telephone system, it will be given to that enterprise that offers the most resources to the Colombian state to help in the fulfillment of social objectives [words indistinct]. [Moderator] Next question by Jairo Gomez of the "Seven O'Clock Newscast," followed by (Giles Gastowait). [Gomez] Mr. President, what makes you the best candidate for the OAS secretary general, the support of the United States and Canada? [Gaviria] I am not the one who should say I am the best candidate. I evaluate the expressions and opinions of other countries and governments. Some of them are public; they come from countries of South America, North America, and it is obvious that to participate in the process, there will have to be support from the Caribbean and Central America; otherwise it would be very difficult to be OAS secretary general. I am evaluating all of those opinions. It has been the governments of certain friendly countries that have issued certain opinions regarding the Colombian president. I am not the person who should make that statement. Certain foreign governments, through their spokesmen, have made those statements. I think the most common reason is that certain countries want a former Latin American president for secretary general. They have many reasons to believe the OAS must move in that direction. There are others who have [one-second break in reception] of the modernization processes in Colombia, commitments with certain economic policies. There is something I would like all those present here to remember: Look at Colombia's voting record at the OAS or the United Nations or at any other international organization. I ask you to judge whether Colombia's international policy is independent. If there is one thing this administration has done, it is to implement an international policy that is completely independent. The criticism we have received is generally due to just that--the independence we have exhibited and the autonomy of this nation. But also for that reason we have found the support of countries that have attitudes that are quite different. There have been many occasions when the U.S. State Department did not agree with Brazil or Mexico on Latin American problems or world issues, but that did not prevent them from agreeing on this occasion. We have a long tradition of independence in matters of international policy. If the president of Colombia can find some kind of support, it must be based on that record--its tradition of having a very independent international policy. Therefore, all those suspicions that have been emerging will not affect the truth, the way Colombia votes at international organizations. The way Colombia votes is the way the president of Colombia thinks. Those little insinuations that have been made over the past few days cannot undermine our international policy, because our foreign policy is there and is evident in treaties, decisions, public statements, and votes at international organizations. [Moderator] Guiles Casuay will ask a question. Cesar Mauricio Velasquez will prepare for the last question. [Casuay] Good afternoon, Mr. President. EL TIEMPO published yesterday an article saying that the Presidency was worried about the progress of the talks for the surrender of the Cali Cartel bosses; is that true? How do you view the [words indistinct]? [Gaviria] We have our own views about the policy of turning over to justice those who are linked with the cartels, the cartels of Valle del Cauca, the Coast, or so many drug-trafficking organizations existing in Colombia. Each has its own responsibility. The prosecuting offices have their own scope of responsibilities. They are clearly prescribed in the Penal Code. The Penal Code establishes its duties and responsibilities. The government has other responsibilities, such as security at jails, [words indistinct] decisions on how long should an inmate stay in this or that jail. The government is very committed to the policy of [word indistinct] justice. It must be understood that for the government to give certain guarantees, people should confess their crimes; that must be their cooperation with justice. Of course, the individual must go to a high-security jail if it is a dangerous criminal. On certain occasions we have had arguments with other organizations, the Attorney General's Office, or the prosecuting office. I am quite certain, however, that only by listening to other points of view can we design a policy that will respond to the country's interests. The guarantees that the government could eventually give should only be given in exchange for an effective cooperation that will serve to punish criminals, dismantle the drug cartels, and maintain an active attitude in the face of the drug-trafficking problem and a consistent policy that is the only thing that can make us overcome this problem. Unfortunately, if one ignores the problem or does like the ostrich hiding its head, ignoring the problem or allowing criminal organizations to grow in the face of our indifference [words indistinct] Colombia in the past and its effects were disastrous. I believe it is much more positive to follow a policy of being firm and clear, not ignoring drug-trafficking cartels, facing and fighting them. The operations by our public force and our justice are also positive. An essential part of this policy is the [word indistinct] of the surrender policy. The criminals, cornered by the action of the public force, will surrender to authorities, confess their crimes, and undergo a just trial. They will be given guarantees, and this will help us dismantle the criminal drug- trafficking organizations. [Moderator] Cesar Mauricio Velasquez will ask the last question. [Velasquez] Mr. President, certain politicians have said they cannot reach more than 170 municipalities in the country to conduct their political campaign. Don't you think the event that occurred this morning plus the fact that certain territories are off limits to politicians and even the Armed Forces are part of the pressure exerted by the guerrilla groups to resume negotiations with your government and the next? [Gaviria] I understand very well it is risky to participate in politics in Colombia. I have experienced this and know what kind of difficulties and risks politicians must face. Fortunately, our political leaders defy those risks and challenges, and they travel to the 170 municipalities and.... [pauses] They are not 170, there could be more, much more. The guerrilla groups have some kind of presence, whatever it may be, in 500 municipalities all over Colombia, practically half of Colombia's municipalities. Our political leaders defy that. They have always defied this, and they go there and take risks and get elected, and the political groups that somehow supported the guerrilla movement are noticeably rejected. They practically have no political presence whatsoever, because the people reject them. Just as it has happened on so many occasions, I am sure the political leaders of this nation will face those risks, defeat violent groups, and let no one intimidate them despite the evident acts of guerrilla violence. Mayors have been killed; that is why we will resort to the Public Order Law to appoint military mayors, because we cannot continue to play the guerrilla groups' game. They kill mayors and society remains defenseless and simply replaces them with other mayors so they can kill them also, or so they can force the mayors to give in to their demands. No! The public order law certified by the Attorney General's Office states clearly that mayors are being killed by guerrilla groups. There is clear evidence in this concern. We will have to resort to that instrument. We will use it in a Boyaca Department municipality and in a Casanare Department municipality. We are determined to protect political leaders so that we may be able to state they face no risks. We hope.... [pauses] We are sure that will be the case, meaning, our leaders will face those risks. We will prove to the violent groups in our nation that our democracy and those who represent it, with the peoples' support, are more powerful then their dirty and violent weapons and their message of violence and hate.
