Even though the visit to Burkina Faso by Velayati and the high-ranking political delegation accompanying him is the second phase of our foreign minister's tour that began on Tuesday, the delegation actually stopped in two countries before arriving in Burkina Faso. In addition to meeting and talking with officials of Guinea, the delegation stopped briefly at the airport in the Chadian capital, Ndjamena, on its way to Burkina Faso and talked with the Chadian foreign minister. During the meeting between the Iranian and Chadian foreign ministers, Chad requested that the Islamic Republic of Iran assist in exploiting its oil resources as part of cooperation among countries of the South. This request is vitally important to Chad, especially after the discovery of an important oilfield in southern Chad. In Guinea the Iranian delegation held detailed talks on economic, political, and cultural cooperation between Tehran and Conakry, including discussions on cooperation in the exploitation of bauxite mines, energy, the construction of hydro-electrical dams, and the construction of railways. In Burkina Faso our foreign minister and his delegation met with the prime minister and discussed political and economic relations between the two countries. During this meeting, the initial basis for the expansion and consolidation of economic and commercial cooperation was laid, and with the formation of a joint commission in this field, a new era began in the economic cooperation between Tehran and Ouagadougou. To acquaint the government and nation of Burkina Faso with our country's high economic potential, it was decided that a trade exhibition including products and industries of Islamic Iran be set up in Ouagadougou. Iran's diplomatic activities in Africa are of interest to political experts and analysts for various reasons. The first is that this diplomatic initiative by the Islamic Republic of Iran strengthens the position of Muslims in Africa, especially in Black Africa. The second is that this activity is significant to the expansion of South-South relations vis-a-vis the array of forces by the North against the South. The third is that meeting mutual needs in the economic, cultural, and political fields and helping deprived countries, especially with experts and know-how from the rich scientific and industrial experiences that our country has among the Third World, is an important objective in our country's diplomatic policy. At any rate, Tehran's new look toward Africa has attracted the attention of many political experts.
