SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has established an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56 FR 2190, January 22, 1991; and 58 FR 9230, February 19, 1993). One area the ARAC deals with is air carrier/general aviation maintenance issues. These issues involve mechanic certification and approved training schools outlined in parts 65 and 147 and the maintenance standards for parts 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, and 35 aircraft, engines, propellers, and their component parts and parallel provisions in parts 21, 43, 91, 121, 125, 127, 129, 133, 135, and 137 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), which are the responsibility of the FAA Director, Flight Standards Service. Task Specifically, the working group's task is the following: Review Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, parts 43 and 91, and supporting policy and guidance material for the purpose of determining the course of action to be taken for rulemaking and/or policy relative to the issue of general aviation aircraft inspection and maintenance, specifically section 91.409, part 43, and Appendices A and D of part 43. In your review, consider any inspection and maintenance initiatives underway throughout the aviation industry affecting general aviation with a maximum certificated takeoff weight of 12,500 pounds or less. Also consider ongoing initiatives in the areas of: maintenance recordkeeping; research and development; the age of the current aircraft fleet; harmonization; the true cost of inspection versus maintenance; and changes in technology. If deemed appropriate, draft for ARAC a notice of proposed rulemaking for the task proposing new or revised requirements, a supporting economic analysis and other required analysis, advisory and guidance material, and any other collateral documents the working group determines to be needed. Reports A. Recommend time line(s) for completion of the task, including rationale, for consideration at the meeting of the ARAC to consider air carrier/general aviation maintenance issues held following publication of this notice. B. Give a detailed conceptual presentation on the task to the ARAC before proceeding with the work stated under item C below. C. Give a status report on the task at each meeting of ARAC held to consider air carrier/general aviation maintenance issues. The General Aviation Maintenance Working Group will be comprised of experts from those organizations having an interest in the task assigned. A working group member need not necessarily be a representative of one of the member organizations of ARAC. An individual who has expertise in the subject matter and wishes to become a member of the working group should write the person listed under the caption for further information contact expressing that desire, describing his or her interest in the task, and the expertise he or she would bring to the working group. The request will be reviewed with the Assistant Chair of the ARAC for air carrier/general aviation maintenance issues and the Chair of the General Aviation Maintenance Working Group, and the individual will be advised whether or not the request can be accommodated. The Secretary of Transportation has determined that the formation and use of the ARAC are necessary in the public interest in connection with the performance of duties imposed on the FAA by law. Meetings of the ARAC to consider air carrier/general aviation maintenance issues will be open to the public except as authorized by section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Meetings of the General Aviation Maintenance Working Group will not be open to the public, except to the extent that individuals with an interest and expertise are selected to participate. No public announcement of working group meetings will be made. Issued in Washington, DC, on September 23, 1994. Frederick J.
