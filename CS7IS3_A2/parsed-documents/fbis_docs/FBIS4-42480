What do you think of the Commission's white paper on competition and growth? What concrete proposals does your party have in order to combat unemployment at the European level? [Tindemans] I fully support the Commission's white paper. The action plan based upon it and approved by the European Council on 11 December 1993 in Brussels must be implemented as soon as possible as a matter of priority. The plan is not perfect, no plan ever is, but its implementation would make the European Union (EU) a large region able to stand up to American and Asian competition. The EU would become the best equipped region, setting standards in telecommunications, information, and transport. It would provide investors and businessmen with excellent working conditions. The encouragement for small- and medium-sized companies should be welcomed. The idea of an infrastructure and public works plan should not be rejected, but special attention and constant monitoring by European and national authorities is required. [Vanoverbeke] Social Europe seems to leave much to be desired. What can be done about that? [Tindemans] An answer in theory to the question is relatively simple: Europe (except for Great Britain) has approved a social charter. The EU is going to have to take some social measures. The present conflict with Belgian frontier-zone workers in the Netherlands is one example. But I heard Jacques Delors state that the principle of subsidiarity also applies to the social sector. The difficulty lies in knowing when it must be respected. The social debates at the European Parliament were usually the scene of great confusion. But social matters must not be excluded from the EU's competences. The speech by Jacques Delors on 28 May is a good indicator. Maastricht also creates possibilities which have not yet been fully examined. In the area of education, for example. And we must be sure that education in Belgium is among the very best. [Vanoverbeke] When we see the inability of the international community to take effective action in the former Yugoslavia, European common foreign and security policy seems to have got off to a bad start. How can we make it more credible? [Tindemans] Monetary (financial) policy, foreign, and defense policy remain the most sensitive activities of a sovereign state, even if it is a EU member. The situation in the former Yugoslavia is an example of this. The only advantage compared to 1914 is that Russia, Austria, France, Great Britain, and Turkey are not at war but are talking. But, unfortunately, there has been no progress on the ethnic front. It was decided at Maastricht to draw up a common foreign and security policy. This does not yet exist, it is invoked as an excuse, and it will be conducted following the rule of unanimity. Which means that not much will be done. On the other hand, if such a policy proves impossible, we can already predict the birth of small coalitions, heralding a return to the politics of the past. Can we not imagine old alliances forming around the negotiating table which date back to the First or Second World War? Is that what we want? [Vanoverbeke] Are you satisfied with the relations between the European Parliament (EP), the Council and the European Commission (EC)? What proposal would you make for the 1996 intergovernmental conference, when the Twelve have to review the functioning of the institutions? The relations between the Council, the EC and the EP are not good. The so-called interinstitutional dialogue is a farce. We saw that yet again during the enlargement debate. I welcome the proposal to have the intergovernmental conference on institutional reform prepared by three presidents: The president of the Council, of the EC and of the EP. These three would be forced to listen to the institution they head. We would not be obliged to consult the "wise men" who, in the present circumstances, would inevitably be dependent upon their governments. The result of their discussions would necessarily be weak. On 4 May in Strasbourg, I was able to cite four letters from the German chancellor, and the Belgian, Netherlands, and Luxembourg prime ministers. They were in favor of setting up a working party consisting of members of the Council, EP, and EC to be charged with drawing up reform proposals to be submitted to the 1996 conference. I also approve this proposal. The basic philosophy behind the Treaty of Rome was inspired in outlining the role of the EC and the EP. But enlargement has brought a need for increasing democratization. What is the future EP's task, role, and competence to be? How is the EC to be reformed? It has too many members. I have very clear answers to these questions, but negotiations have not yet begun. In any event, the EP cannot be excluded from the 1996 conference which could be either the crowning glory or the end of the Europe of the founding fathers. [Vanoverbeke] The EU sees itself as a grouping of nations with a common commitment to democracy. How should we respond to the present rise of extremists? [Tindemans] The treaties are perfectly clear about this: The EU is a grouping of democratic nations. Each member state must therefore ensure that their democracy remains healthy. This question is now very pertinent in Italy. But the spirit of the times cannot be governed by laws or regulations. On the contrary, they are usually dictated by it. Combating unemployment, ensuring a high standard of education, contributing to a housing policy, dealing with racism and xenophobia, ensuring the internal security of one's own country and of Europe: These are a whole series of proposals which can help create a genuine climate of tolerance and balance. They must permit the rebirth of good sense, at home and elsewhere. [Vanoverbeke] Do you still believe the plan for economic and monetary union (EMU) to be feasible, given the developing economic situation? Should the convergence criteria or the timetable for EMU be reviewed? [Tindemans] I still believe in EMU. I was pleased to learn that the European Council ratified the Maastricht decisions in December 1993 in Brussels. Doubt in this area would have reawakened international speculation. In principle, we must stick to the criteria and timetable adopted in Maastricht if we want confidence to remain intact. It is within this framework that governments and experts must act "for the best." [Vanoverbeke] The European elections are often seen as a test at national level. Does not this trend generate a certain ambiguity, threatening to overshadow the interests of Europe? [Tindemans] We cannot condemn strongly enough this politics of opportunism which consists of presenting the European elections as the ideal occasion to wreak vengeance upon the national government. In Europe, we must implement the white paper, achieve monetary union, and draw up a common foreign and security policy. All of which extends far beyond the context of Belgian politics. Those who seek to confuse the European dream and reality with mere domestic concerns are betraying the most inspiring idea of our century: That of leaving behind us hatred, jealousy, and war between hereditary enemies to prepare, together, a new chapter in European history.
