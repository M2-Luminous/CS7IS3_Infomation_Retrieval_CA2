Cuba will soon hold a new round of talks with British businessmen, sponsored by THE ECONOMIST. One British analyst says that this, among other things, indicates that London gives little importance to Washington's claims of an alleged Cuban collapse. There is more: Cuban Basic Industry Minister Marcos Portal confirmed during a brief visit to several European and northern countries the success of foreign contract oil exploration enterprises that work in Cuba at their own risk. Several European sources report that two new agreements have been signed in London. Qatar, a small, independent, Persian Gulf country that produces a great deal of oil, not only has established diplomatic relations with Cuba but also has decided to send businessmen to Cuba and to work on mutually beneficial projects with our country. The 24th OAS General Assembly has just got underway in Belem, Brazil. Brazilian President Itamar Franco expressed support for the OAS reconsidering its 30-year-old resolution separating Cuba from that inter-American organization. Outgoing OAS President Joao Baena Soares has also expressed support for this. An important group of Colombian legislators, most of whom are from the Liberal Party, the current governing party, will send a message to the fourth Ibero-American summit, beginning one week from today in Cartagena de Indias, demanding the end of the U.S. blockade against Cuba. In addition, a group of U.S. businessmen, intellectuals, and politicians, together with sectors of the Cuban emigre community, will demonstrate against the blockade in Washington on 9 June. Other reports state that Russia and Venezuela are considering the possibility of resuming the supply of oil to Cuba through a formula that would save transportation from Russian ports. Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will arrive in Cuba on an official visit on 13 June. Mexico has always maintained relations with our country, relations that remain in optimum conditions. These are the facts, not rhetoric, that demonstrate that Washington's isolation regarding its anti-Cuban policy increases every day.
