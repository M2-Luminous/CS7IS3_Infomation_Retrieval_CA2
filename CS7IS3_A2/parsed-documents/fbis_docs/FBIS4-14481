What is more, the elections were disrupted in Rostov's two largest districts. So it is that the first session of the "Don Parliament" will bring together not 45 deputies, as planned, but 43. "The victory of the administration over democracy is absolute," Sergey Ivanenko, an eminent political expert from Rostov, said in comment on the results. "Two-thirds of the deputies are top bureaucrats." I glanced at the lists of "lucky winners." And, indeed, there are 10 heads of city and rayon administrations, four holding the office of deputy head, and three leaders of departments which are subordinate to the oblast administration head. There are three chiefs of Internal Affairs Administrations -- oblast, city, and rayon. There is one banker, one counterintelligence staffer, and the deputy chief of a workshop. There are three entrepreneurs, three journalists, three kolkhoz chairmen, and three major enterprise directors. It is interesting that Kozitsyn, ataman of the Oblast Cossack Union of the Don Host, did not appear among the elected -- he lost the election, and this is an indication of the degree of popularity of the Cossack movement in the Don, which has declined in the past year. Of course, there was the inevitable furore. Aleksandr Boyko, a native of Rostov and a senior lecturer in law at Rostov University, does not believe he was defeated. He told me: "If you count up the votes cast in my favor at the 28 polling stations, and such documentation is available, then I beat Karachentsev, head of the administration of Rostov City's Sovetskiy Rayon, by 142 votes. However, the district commission, having spent the whole night sitting at the computer to complete the simple task of adding up the votes, accorded a winning margin of four to him." An official complaint has been lodged, and the matter now rests with the Oblast Electoral Commission. But even if it is upheld, this will not affect the overall situation. As forecast by sociologists, there is no point in expecting a division of powers on the Don. The new parliament will simply be another cabinet, another tier in the bureaucratic pyramid. And, when a session is held, virtually the entire body of the parliament could go to the local governor's office for a detailed briefing. Incidentally, Boyko, a qualified lawyer, considers it unacceptable in a democratic state for "intermediaries" in the form of certain "working groups," set up under administrations at various levels to "give technical aid to the electoral commissions," to come between the voters and the electoral commission. In practice, the lawyer believes, these working groups are exceeding their powers by securing an advantage for their own chiefs. "In their desire to shield themselves from a truly independent legislative power, the bureaucrats have clearly overdone it," political commentator Ivanenko believes. "After all, by law, two out of five deputies in the Legislative Assembly must work on a permanent basis. It is unlikely that any one of the newly elected will resolve to leave their top jobs in exchange for posts which are far less lucrative, laying to rest a civil service career into the bargain. I am convinced that this parliament will simply be unable to begin its work. Furthermore, the Russian Federation State Duma may adopt a law on local organs of power, under which this combination of deputy and bureaucratic functions will be forbidden. What then? More elections?" So, the Don executive can be congratulated. It has become the parliament. The only thing is, will it arrive at the truth in debate with itself?
