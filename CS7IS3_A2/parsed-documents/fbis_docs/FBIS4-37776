FBIS4-37776 "drnes122_l_94008" FBIS-NES-94-122 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Baraq on Terrorism, Significance of Territories Baraq on Terrorism, Significance of Territories TA2206170294 Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew 1400 GMT 22 Jun 94 TA2206170294 Tel Aviv IDF Radio Hebrew BFN [Text] Over the last four months there has been a sharp drop in the number of attacks and disturbances in the Gaza Strip, Judaea, and Samaria. This was said today by Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq to the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Lieutenant General Baraq is not convinced that the present situation will continue over the long term. He says we must prepare for the possibility that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the rejectionist organizations will increase their activity. Our correspondent Tamar Asalem reports from the Knesset: [Begin recording] [Asalem] The Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee was today presented with figures pointing to a decrease in the number of attacks in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip, as well as inside the Green Line. During April, 108 attacks were registered in Judaea and Samaria, compared to 78 in May, and 47 in June. The respective figures for the Gaza Strip were 120 in April, 48 in May, and 10 in June. In the Green Line there were 38 attacks in April, 15 in May, and 5 in June. The chief of staff noted this is a significant drop in the level of terrorism. He added, however, that we cannot rule out a possibility of an increase in the number of attacks in Judaea and Samaria, excluding Jericho. [Baraq] I would not build on this decrease over the long term. I sincerely hope this situation continues to prevail in Gaza and Jericho. We must prepare for the possibility, however, that I will be proven wrong and that Hamas and the rejectionist organizations will try to increase their activity in Judaea and Samaria or inside Israel. [Asalem] Regarding Hamas activity, the chief of staff added his impression -- which is based on the Palestinian impression -- that Hamas influence in Gaza and Jericho is waning. Perhaps this is related to Israel's withdrawal from those areas. The Palestinian police have also played a part in this development. Baraq added, however, that activity in the mosques continues as usual. Asked about extending the autonomy area in future, Baraq said the issue is still far off on the agreement's agenda. Baraq said that Israel's security interest in Judaea and Samaria goes beyond safeguarding the settlers and has to do with deployment for the event of a war on the eastern front. Lt. Gen. Baraq also spoke about the situation in south Lebanon, saying that Israel is doing everything possible to make life difficult for Hizballah by dictating terms for it. [Baraq] Over the recent past, since the abduction of al- Dirani, the Air Force attack, and other successful operations, Hizballah has suffered a series of severe setbacks and lost dozens of its fighters, with many dozens being wounded. Obviously they continue to seek for ways of retaliation. Yesterday they attacked us successfully from their point of view, and painfully from ours. We will have to do everything possible to prevent the recurrence of such attacks. At the same time we must realize that the struggle in the security zone will continue. [Asalem] The chief of staff was asked whether Syrian involvement in south Lebanon is growing deeper. His answer was negative, but he added that in his opinion Syria is pleased with every successful Hizballah attack against Israel. [end recording]
