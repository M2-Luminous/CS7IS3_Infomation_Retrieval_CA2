This also relates to Hizballah activity, which Syria is allowing to continue. What is Syria's policy in Lebanon? Lubrani: Syria undoubtedly regards Hizballah activity in Lebanon as leverage for gaining advantages on its track. Zissowitz: A report in HA'ARETZ this morning speaks about a joint Syrian-Lebanese military operation against Hizballah arms caches in Ba'labakk. Lubrani: I can only say that from what we know, this operation can be considered mere cosmetics. They are trying to prove that they are doing something, but I know nothing about such a thing in practice. Zissowitz: Are there any signs that Syria is trying to curb Hizballah attacks against Israel? Lubrani: Occasionally, as a result of American pressure and in order to appease the United States, Syria attempts to curb Hizballah, even if only for appearances sake. There have been two such cases. During the last elections, there was a period of one month without any serious Hizballah attacks. Recently, in anticipation of the al-Asad-Clinton summit, complete calm was restored. Syria can stop Hizballah attacks if it wants to. Zissowitz: What about the SLA's [South Lebanese Army] operations? This organization suffered many casualties in battles against Hizballah last weekend. Civilians were also killed. Is the SLA's morale flagging? Lubrani: The SLA is undoubtedly facing a process of attrition. Both Hizballah and the rejectionist organizations are trying to undermine the SLA and the security zone. The SLA is having a hard time dealing with this situation, but it is continuing to function and is manning its posts. The SLA is our spearhead in maintaining calm along our northern border. Zissowitz: Is there any truth to the reports that the SLA is bitter over the fact that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is limiting its ability to react to the terrorists' provocations? Lubrani: There is some truth to these reports. It is only natural, however, that they would prefer to react much more firmly to attacks on them. On the other hand, they know that our actions are aimed at trying to preserve the understandings we reached with the Syrians via the Americans. Most of the time, they refrain from reacting, even when they are provoked to retaliate. Sometimes such outbursts do occur, such as the attack on Sidon last Friday. Zissowitz: There were reports of a massacre perpetrated by the SLA in the village of 'Aramta. Lubrani: There was no such massacre. It was invented by Lebanese and Syrian information circles, who turned Hizballah attacks in 'Aramta -- which hit the civilian population primarily -- into an SLA attack against the population of this village. This is an outright lie. Zissowitz: Are you completely satisfied with continuing the cooperation and coordination between the IDF and SLA? Lubrani: I have no doubt that the coordination and cooperation will continue. There are easy periods and more difficult periods. We have already been through such periods. We must realize, however, that we are in the midst of a war of attrition aimed not only at the SLA but at the IDF as well. The SLA is bearing a very heavy load, and we must realize this fact and deal with it accordingly. [passage omitted]
