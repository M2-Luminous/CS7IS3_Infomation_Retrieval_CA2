"When, a year ago, I decided to join the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] electoral list as an independent, I did so absolutely convinced that I could contribute to the task of regenerating Spanish politics," he explained. "Perhaps that was my first mistake. Many people said that I was being used to present an image -- that of the struggle against corruption; and now I must largely agree that they were right," he added. Garzon, who confirmed that he is also giving up his seat as a deputy, harshly attacked the government and reiterated his conviction that he had been used as "a pawn." Garzon, who will return to the National High Court, expressed regret that Gonzalez used him by announcing that he would give him the chairmanship of a committee to investigate corruption. He said that his "ambition" was fulfilled with his post in the struggle against drugs, and that he was "comfortable" at the Interior Ministry during Antoni Asuncion's term. "The proliferation of corruption scandals and the prime minister's passive attitude, with the consequent tension in society, which I believe is justified, caused me to consider the need to resign and not to be a party, even through omission or silence, to that situation," the former number two at the Interior Ministry stated. He sent a letter to Gonzalez 18 April, telling him that unless corruption was tackled thoroughly -- and not through "mere posturing" -- he would resign before 25 April. The 38-year-old judge demanded of the prime minister that the change of attitude which he was demanding be made clear in the 19 April state of the nation debate. Gonzalez asked him to wait to talk with him after the debate, and this took place at the Moncloa Palace on 22 April. The head of government asked him for time to adopt measures and for his cooperation against corruption. "Neither before nor after did he use it, or give me the means to carry it out," the judge asserted. In the state of the nation debate, Garzon was disappointed with respect to the committee on the Filesa affair, and clashed harshly with his parliamentary group and with Justice Minister Juan Alberto Belloch. He said of the latter's conduct that it has left him with "a very bitter and disappointing, albeit expected, taste." Second Letter to Gonzalez In a second letter to the head of government, dated 25 April, the judge accepted the latter's request for cooperation. "That was my second mistake. Since I resigned later, people have pettily and maliciously sought to infer that my resignation was due to other reasons." Garzon complained that he was not consulted about the merger of the Interior and Justice Ministries, which he opposed when he spoke with Gonzalez on 4 May, and the latter explained this plan to him "in passing." "This lack of consideration for what I might think and the fact that I was dispensed with in the struggle against corruption made me see that I was being counted on for nothing; that I had lost the prime minister's confidence for that task and that he did not trust me." The former deputy showed himself especially pained by new Justice and Interior Minister Juan Alberto Belloch's way of dispensing with him from the outset: "This precipitated my resignation and its being tendered immediately, in view of the obvious invitation to do so. There remained no reason for postponing a resignation which I had announced 20 days earlier. All they wanted was to to gain time in order to find a solution which would end my presence in the government," he added. The judge asserted that he would not have given up his seat if he had only had a confrontation with the minister or felt "disappointed" at not being a minister. "I have resigned because I believe that I do not have the prime minister's confidence. Therefore I cannot continue to support from my seat the government or its prime minister, who has preferred to dispense with me," he explained. Garzon expressed his confidence that his relationship with the government from his position as a judge will be "good," and that the government will cooperate with him in the eradication of corruption. Much of the statement by the former secretary of state for the National Plan on Drugs was devoted to corruption, against which, according to him, "firm and surgical measures," which he has not seen so far, are necessary. He described as "short-term" the measures adopted by the government, and emphasized that a single case of corruption can bring down a government. "I am convinced," he stated at another point, "that an attempt will be made to combat corruption, but they do not wish to count on me. With respect to political responsibilities, some have yet to come. So it should be. For instance, the resignation of the state attorney general occurs to me." Garzon, who suspects that he could have "some difficulties henceforth" in carrying through his ideas, showed himself in favor of Eligio Hernandez' replacement and of his successor's being given "greater guarantees of independence." Government's Response Miguel Gil, secretary general for the government spokesperson, showed himself opposed to the former deputy's assertions that Felipe Gonzalez has a passive attitude to corruption. "The government is acting with determination, firmness, and vigor in the struggle against corruption, and is also backing up that determination with deeds, decisions, and practical measures," he said. During his appearance, Garzon came out in favor of setting up specialized police units against corruption, coordinated by the Interior Ministry. According to him, the measures adopted by parliament, "although abundant," are no good for tackling the cases which have proliferated, and so "rapid, but investigatory, procedures should be established."
