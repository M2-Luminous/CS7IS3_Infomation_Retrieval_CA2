According to an investigative survey of the province's 28 towns/counties and 224 villages, the total burden assumed by the province's peasants in 1993 averaged 81.64 yuan per capita, 17.95 yuan less per capita than last year, a drop of 18 percentage points. The reasons for this drop are due chiefly to the following: 1) A drop in the tax load. In 1993, the taxes paid by Heilongjiang's peasants averaged 29.31 yuan per capita, 1.82 yuan less than the 31.13 yuan per capita for the year before, a drop of 5.8 percentage points. Included in this is the agriculture tax of 26.36 yuan per capita, which also showed a drop of 1.3 percentage points over the year before. 2) A drop in collective retention. In 1993, Heilongjiang's peasants paid a retention fee of 28.75 yuan per capita, 4.90 yuan less than the 33.82 yuan per capita for the year before, a drop of 14.5 percentage points. 3) A drop in the overall planning fee. In 1933, the overall planning fee assumed by Heilongjiang's peasants was 13.98 yuan per capita, 0.92 yuan less that 14.90 yuan per capita for the year before. Of this figure, 8.05 yuan per capita was earmarked for public and welfare benefits such as education, family planning, elderly pensions etc., 0.17 yuan less than that for the year before. 4) A 55.12 percent drop in the apportionment fee. In 1993, Heilongjiang's peasants paid 8.86 yuan per capita in apportionment fines, a reduction of 0.88 yuan per capita over last year's 9.74 yuan, a drop of 55.1 percentage points. Of this, an arbitrary apportionment fee of 0.63 yuan designated for peasant services dropped 43.2 percentage points over that allowed last year. While a common effort by Heilongjiang's government at all levels to control the excessive tax burden assumed by its peasants obtained certain results, the responsibility faced by the government at all levels is still awesome. According to incomplete statistics, the provincial rural collective financial strength is still quite weak, with a per capita debt of 53,000 yuan, and carrying loans [tai kuan 2127 2949] of 37,000 yuan per capita. This situation will necessarily slow down the drop in peasant burdens, and poses the hidden danger of increasing peasant burdens.
