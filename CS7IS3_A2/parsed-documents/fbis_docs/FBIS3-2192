Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua told the final day of the national civil aviation conference in Beijing that the sector's leading officials must be strict with themselves and their sub-ordinates. He referred particularly to the air safety responsibility contract signed between directors of the Civil Aviation Administration of China [CAAC] and the CAAC's regional bureaus, carriers, airports and pilot-training schools. The contract is designed to stop accidents and it has set safety targets for each unit, defining the penalties and rewards their leaders face depending on their performance. Zou said civil aviation made progress last year, but he also criticized it for problems such as slack management, the risk of frequent accidents and poor service. And he called on delegates to find new ways to ensure safety in a changing industry. CAAC deputy head Bao Peide said the industry will spare no effort to resolve four major problems--the lack of flight facilities, the lack of ground facilities, the poor quality of some workers, the quality gap between new jet airliners and the country's sometimes obsolete airports.
