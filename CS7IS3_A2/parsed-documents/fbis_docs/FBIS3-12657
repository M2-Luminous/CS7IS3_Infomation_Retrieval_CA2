[passage omitted] In a statement to AL-JUMHURIYAH, As'ad Bayyud al-Tamimi, leader of the Islamic Jihad Movement-Bayt al-Maqdis, said the Zionist crime at the Ibrahimi Mosque was planned and premeditated by the occupation authorities and the troops in charge of guarding the Ibrahimi Mosque. This is has been shown by the fact that the Zionist assailants withdrew freely with all their weapons under the cover of the enemy troops surrounding the Ibrahimi Mosque. Al- Tamimi asked: How can an individual -- as the occupation authorities are claiming -- kill and wound 400 people? He said: We have made a clear and specific decision deeming every Zionist inside the occupied territory a target of our revolutionaries' bullets. He added: We will carry out the Palestinian response inside the occupied territory before the blood of martyrs dries. He urged all other Palestinian factions to stop their denunciations and to embark on real action that restores the dignity of the blood that has been spilled at the Ibrahimi Mosque.
