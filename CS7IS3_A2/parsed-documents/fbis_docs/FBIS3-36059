The law would outline the powers of the National Security Council and the government in managing security-related institutions. The projected Satversme (Constitution) Protection Bureau, the Defense Ministry's military counterintelligence service, the Home Guards informative service and the Interior Ministry's security police are the basic institutions to ensure the national security, under the bill. The laws on the Satversme Protection Bureau and the national security could become a foundation for the country's all-round security doctrine, the committee said. The Defense Committee's bill is designed as an alternative to the Cabinet's counterintelligence plan. Silars claims that the bill is ready for acceptance in the first reading in the Saeima plenary session. The committee meeting was attended by Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis, Interior Minister Girts Kristovskis and related security officers.
