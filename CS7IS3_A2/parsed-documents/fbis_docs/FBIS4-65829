The announcement came from Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, and coarchitect of the 12-month-old steel rescue plan, who left the industry uncertain as to whether this was a tactical move or the end of the plan. Hopes for achieving an essential 5 million extra tonnes of capacity cuts from Italy were scuppered after Mr Van Miert suffered an unexpected defeat at the hands of his fellow commissioners at a meeting on Wednesday [18 May] evening. They were alarmed by the dubious legality of the use of state funds for restructuring at the privately owned Bresciani steel mills of northern Italy. Mr Van Miert said the Italian reductions represented the last hope for achieving a minimum 19 million tonnes of capacity cuts considered necessary to save the industry. "The plan is dead," said Mr Van Miert. "It is obvious we are not going to get near the target. But don't blame us. We tried." But during the meeting, Sir Leon Brittan, the external affairs commissioner, backed by the commission's legal department pointed out that the deal would be difficult to reconcile with European law. It would also jeopardise negotiations for a multinational steel agreement and contravene the subsidies code of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Sir Leon's case rested on the fact that state aid offered to the Bresciani mills in return for the capacity cuts contravened European law. This says that state aid can only be offered to steel companies in return for permanent closure. At Bresciani the aid was destined for companies proposing only partial closure. In spite of Mr Van Miert's strong words and obvious anger, senior Commission officials yesterday stressed that the steel plan's so-called death had been exaggerated. With the crisis in the industry far from resolved, commissioners are unlikely to throw out the package entirely. Nonetheless, big doubts about its viability remain. The 11 million tonnes of capacity cuts achieved so far fall well short of the plan's aim for minimum cuts of 19 million tonnes. Even if the Commission had accepted Mr Van Miert's latest proposals, this would only have achieved, at most, a further 5 million tonnes of cuts -- still well short of the target. In addition, the private, unsubsidised steel sector has been leery of accepting a rescue package that involves giving state aid to subsidised enterprises.
