FBIS4-6619 "dreas078_a_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Coalition Accord Said `Patchwork' Coalition Accord Said `Patchwork' OW2204131794 Tokyo KYODO in English 1301 GMT 22 Apr 94 OW2204131794 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- The primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) criticized Friday [22 April] policy accords by the ruling coalition parties as a "patchwork" of different ideas, and declared the LDP and coalition will face off in the Diet. LDP President Yohei Kono said the coalition parties "cobbled up agreements, putting aside policy differences. (The LDP) can become an offensive... it is important for the party to streamline its array and press hard on the process of the policy accords." Kono also blasted Friday's nomination of Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, head of the coalition's mainstream party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), as its candidate to succeed departing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his resignation on April 8. The Diet's prime ministerial elections are scheduled for Monday. Kono said if Hata is elected prime minister, his administration will be "a Shinseito administration rather than a coalition administration.... There still exists a dual power structure." The comment is an apparent criticism of key coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito secretary general, who led the grouping into selecting Hata as Hosokawa's successor. The LDP president also predicted the coalition will founder over policy discords sooner or later, saying, "it will be clearer whether the policy accords are essential." LDP Party Secretary General Yoshiro Mori echoed Kono, saying, "the coalition patched up a framework for the present but the process and contents are complicated. (The LDP) will clarify differences and inconsistencies of their policies in plenary and Budget Committee sessions in the Diet." Masayoshi Takemura, who heads the coalition's small bloc, new party Sakigake (Harbinger), had mixed reactions to the accords. Although praising the policy framework as a whole, Takemura, who is also chief cabinet secretary, noted ambiguities concerning issues of national security and the Korean peninsula. Regarding wording that Japan will actively join U.N. peace activities, Takemura said, "It can be widely construed as making it possible for Japan to participate in (combat) activities for peace because the wording has not spelled out peacekeeping activities." He also said all 15 Sakigake members will vote for Hata in the prime ministerial election in the House of Representatives. Sakigake, which will reject posts in a new coalition cabinet, has pledged to support the new government from outside the alliance. The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) harshly criticized the policy ties. Kazuo Shii, chief of the JCP secretariat, told reporters the coalition's declaration on an indirect tax hike is "extremely serious." "It is irrational to push ahead without seeking the judgment of voters in election," he said. On North Korea's alleged nuclear development program, Shii said, "there is no reason in punishing North Korea while allowing the United Stated to have nuclear weapons." In a predawn Friday meeting, seven coalition partners reached agreement on major policies after wading through gaps on the two key issues -- tax system reform and Japan's stance on North Korea's suspected nuclear development program. The agreement was a precondition to the nomination Friday afternoon of Hata as the coalition's official candidate for the premiership. The eight-month-old coalition government of Hosokawa will resign en masse Monday morning before the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors convene vote-taking plenary sessions. The seven coalition blocs are the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], Shinseito, Komeito, the Japan New Party, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), the Democratic Reform Party, and Kaikaku no Kai, a parliamentary group of LDP defectors in the lower house. Hosokawa is resigning to take responsibility for his alleged involvement in financial scandals that stalled Diet business for the past two weeks.
