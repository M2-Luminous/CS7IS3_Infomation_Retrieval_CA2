Tatar President and Prime Minister on Prospects for Developing Mutual Relations With Russia"] [Text] Speaking at the latest session of parliament, Mintimer Shaymiyev said that "you have to be a pragmatist and a realist and see what actually exists, not what you want. We are being guided by this approach in building relations between Tatarstan and the Russian Federation." He stressed that the treaty on the demarcation of areas of responsibility and mutual delegation of powers by organs of state power of the Republic of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation is based on the harmonization of the two constitutions -- the Russian and Tatar Constitutions -- and unconditional respect for human rights, irrespective of people's nationality, sex, or religion. "It must be said that what is being produced is a completely new and unprecedented document which pays special attention to the sphere of the realms of competence of the organs of state power of the Russian Federation and Tatarstan." This treaty, Shaymiyev stressed, "will be a testament to the reform of Russia and the renewal of the Russian Federation on the basis of democratic principles and a guarantee of Tatarstan's statehood." Tatar Prime Minister Mukhammat Sabirov observed in turn that he could not conceive of there being no representative in the Russian Duma and Federation Council "able to state the republic's position competently and convincingly." The premier believes that on 13 March (the day of the repeat elections) we must work to ensure that the people turn out to choose worthy representatives. We are to have two people in the Federation Council and five in the Duma. They must be unpoliticized people with good minds who can think clearly, who are committed to their own people, and who can protect their interests. Sabirov talked about the separation from the Federation Council desired by radical nationals as a politician with a firm grasp of the situation: "We can show our pride and say: Politically we are now independent.... But in three or four days or in a week we will be on our knees, saying: We cannot live like this." The premier also cleared up the question of mutual relations with federal organs of power. "Ultimatums are not a path which the people of Tatarstan can take. We must take only the path of routine work, hard, stressful work...of agreements, and of a treaty, which must define the Republic of Tatarstan's special place -- both politically and economically and in all other respects."
