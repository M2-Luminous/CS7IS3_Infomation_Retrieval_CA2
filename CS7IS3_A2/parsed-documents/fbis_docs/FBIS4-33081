The quick response of the workers prevented the fire from expanding to other areas. The fire took place at the catalytic converter plant. [Begin Chief Engineer Ramon Rodriguez recording] The fire was caused by a leak in a soldering joint of the oxygen tower, which, once released, ignited and expanded because the tower continued to provide fuel for the fire. The fire spread to nearby equipment, particularly the sewers of the catalytic converter plant. We believe this fire was not of large or medium magnitude, but of small magnitude. We expect to repair the damage in seven days, focusing on repairing the mechanical and electronic equipment of the butane processing chute. [end recording] Chief Engineer Ramon Rodriguez affirmed that the damage caused by the fire is minimal because the workers are trained to handle such contingencies.
