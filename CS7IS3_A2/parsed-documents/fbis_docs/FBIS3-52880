[passage omitted] [Shakarah] An historic document dated 1932 lists statistics on the Iraqi Army. It says that when Iraq joined the League of Nations, the Army had only two divisions and only 549 officers, 9,320 noncommissioned officers and soldiers, and 794 volunteers. What is the size of the Iraqi Army now? [Al-Rawi] From its formation until the 14 July 1958 revolution, the Iraqi Army was a small one, incapable of meeting the national and pan-Arab requirements to defend the Arab nation and serve its national objectives. The colonialists were trying to impose their control over the Army and use it as a tool to protect their colonialist objectives and schemes and crush any nationalist movement by force. After 1958, the Army began to grow gradually with the formation of new divisions. Then, the 17-30 July 1968 Revolution brought to power a nationalist authority that believes in national and pan-Arab objectives. That authority adopted a long-term policy to rebuild the Army on strong revolutionary bases. Thanks to mujahid leader President Saddam Husayn, may God protect and preserve him, the Army became the revolution's striking arm and vigilant eye that protects the homeland and the people's achievements. The Army was organized on modern, scientific bases, and its combat capabilities and technical methods were improved. The formations were significantly enlarged until today when it has become the fourth largest Army in the world after the U.S., Russian, and Chinese Armies. [passage omitted]
