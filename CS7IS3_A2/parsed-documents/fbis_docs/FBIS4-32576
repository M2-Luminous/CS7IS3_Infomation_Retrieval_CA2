When compared to the adjusted budget at Kc97.151 billion, this amounts to a difference of Kc9.047 billion. In the expenditures column, Kc2.353 billion was shown as savings because the budget anticipated expenditures of Kc121.965 billion and actually expended Kc119.611 billion for social security transfers. The overall positive balance in this chapter of the state budget thus amounts to Kc11.4 billion, according to what Ctirad Ondracka, budget director of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. The excess of revenues was mostly due to insurance premiums paid for workers, which accounted for revenues of Kc100.792 billion, which means Kc7.958 billion more than was anticipated by the budget, which had figured on Kc92.835 billion. The reason was a virtual increase of 600,000 workers over what had been anticipated when the budget was being written, as well as a higher aggregate of basic assessments, upon the basis of which insurance premiums are computed. Higher revenues were also the result of insurance premiums paid by self-employed individuals. Arrears in insurance premiums amounted to Kc2.83 billion (2.7 percent) and were caused primarily by the insolvency of payers. Revenues for old-age pension purposes amounted to Kc80.052 billion; those for hospitalization insurance were Kc13.75 billion, and revenues based on the state employment policy amounted to Kc11.875 billion. Transfers for old-age pensions amounted to Kc72.4 billion, those for health benefits amounted to Kc11.961 billion, and the total paid out in conjunction with employment policy amounted to Kc3.146 billion. Overall expenditures (including administrative costs) were Kc88.647 billion, and overall revenues amounted to Kc106.198 billion. The difference between revenues for insurance and expenditures for pensions, health benefits, and employment policy thus amounts to approximately Kc17.5 billion. In answer to a question by HOSPODARSKE NOVINY as to how this surplus was utilized, Director Ondracka responded that, according to law, the revenues based on insurance premiums are part of the state budget that is used to defray all social transfers, and he said that the law had been adhered to. In terms of expenditures, it is necessary to include the state equalization contribution, which last year amounted to Kc6.1 billion, as well as the state transfers. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs last year engaged in a number of social measures that were not covered by the approved budget. According to Ondracka, this means that, were it not for these revenues based on insurance premiums, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs would not have been able to fund Kc2.8 billion worth of these measures. Jindrich Vodicka, minister of labor and social affairs, noted in this connection that, although some components involving the collection of insurance premiums appeared to be a sort of quasi-surplus, the overall balance of revenues based on insurance premiums and all transfers is negative (revenues of Kc106.2 billion, expenditures of Kc119.6 billion). After including the state equalization contribution in pensions paid out--something that is being readied for this year--there will actually not be any surplus. If, given the current development of unemployment, the contribution for the state employment policy becomes reduced by 1 percentage point, there will most likely even be a mild deficit. These possible adjustments in financing the system of social security are now being discussed with the Ministry of Finance. The government is not considering establishing an independent fund for social security, said J. Vodicka.
