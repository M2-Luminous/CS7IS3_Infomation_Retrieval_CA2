FR941011-2-00138 FR941011-2-00088 In addition, the PHLX states that volatility in the XOC has caused floor officials to grant temporary relief pursuant to Advice F&hyph;6 to allow wider quote spreads in the XOC. In light of the volatility of the XOC, the bid/ask differential of the underlying securities, and the high value of the XOC, 10 the Commission believes that its is reasonable, under these limited circumstances, for the PHLX to widen the quote spread parameters for XOC series priced at $20 or more. The Commission notes, however, that the proposal established maximum allowable quote spreads and that it applies solely to XOC options priced at $20 or more; the Commission expects the PHL to allow the use of the maximum quote spreads only where market conditions justify their application. 10 As of September 22, 1994, the level of the XOC was 581. In addition, the Commission notes that under PHLX Rule 1014, ``Obligations and Restrictions Applicable to Specialists and Registered Options Traders,'' XOC specialists' transactions should constitute a course of dealings reasonably calculated to contribute to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market. Accordingly, the Commission expects the PHLX to monitor trading in XOC options affected by the proposal to ensure that there is adequate market market activity in those series and to ensure that market are meeting their obligations to maintain fair and orderly markets. Accordingly, the commission expects the PHLX to monitor trading in XOC options affected by the proposal to ensure that there is adequate market make activity in those series and to ensure that market makers are meeting their obligations to maintain fair and orderly markets. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 11 that the proposed rule changed is approved. 11 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1984).
