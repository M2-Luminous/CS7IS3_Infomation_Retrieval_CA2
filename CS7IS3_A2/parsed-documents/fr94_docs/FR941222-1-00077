FR941222-1-00077 FR941222-1-00008 The second strategy for waste management assumes facilities with high waste volumes will construct on-site incinerators in which to treat their non-wastewaters, with the remaining facilities sending their wastes to off-site incinerators ($20.3 million/yr). Wastewaters are assumed to be handled in newly constructed treatment impoundments. 3. Potential Remedial Action Costs In addition to dye and pigment production wastes, this listing can affect the management of soils, ground water, and other remedial materials. The Agency's ``contained in'' policy defines certain remediation wastes ``containing'' a listed hazardous waste as a RCRA hazardous waste. It is possible that areas of past dye and pigment waste management, spills, or disposal, which met the proposed listing description at the time they were placed on the land, still may have contaminant concentrations which exceed ``contained in'' levels. A person who disturbs such material can become a generator of RCRA hazardous waste. The likelihood of this imposing an additional burden is moderate because at least 9 of the 49 dye and pigment production facilities already are permitted TSDFs. Releases from all solid waste management units at these TSDFs, including those that in the future may be found to contain a waste meeting the dye and pigment listing descriptions, already are covered by facility-wide clean-up rules under 40 CFR 264.101. This issue will be more likely to arise from historical off-site management at facilities that were not TSDFs. The pre-tax, incremental cost of corrective action liabilities has been estimated at less than $8.8 million.

Wastewaters are handled in newly constructed treatment impoundments. 13Numbers may not add due to rounding.
