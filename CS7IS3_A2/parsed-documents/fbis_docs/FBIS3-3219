They requested that while taking measures to maintain an overall balance between supply and demand this year, the state control price hikes to an extent tolerable for the people. At the same time, they pointed out: An undercurrent lurked in the midst of price reform. Brandishing the banner of price reform, some people took the opportunity to wantonly raise prices, hiking bus fares and increasing prices in disguised forms. Deputies vividly depicted such an occurrence as "riding without a ticket" [wu paio cheng che 2477 4384 0042 6508]. The phenomenon of "riding without a ticket" is especially marked in the service industry. It may appear in various places, ranging from parking a bicycle and making a telephone call to hotel services and house renovations. When the people became more inquisitive and began questioning the validity of the hikes, it was couched with the fine-sounding terms of "we are now undergoing price reform." This sort of "riding without a ticket" price reform is highly pernicious. Deputies and committee members pointed out sharply: This kind of behavior has created confusion, defamed the reform, and also increased the people's burden, and adversely affected the stability of society. When introducing a series of price reform measures, the state must consider the people's ability to withstand certain increases. Price readjustment should proceed in an orderly manner and step by step. However, "riding without a ticket" may appear at every level and out of the blue. Confronted with such a situation when least mentally prepared, people tend to pay additional charges out of their pockets. If we let this kind of phenomenon drift freely and go unchecked, will our price reform not go upside down? Deputies and committee members proposed: This phenomenon of "riding without a ticket" must be resolutely curbed, and we must not be soft in handling this matter. Instead, we should resort to legal, political, and economic means, and deal with it in a comprehensive manner. As soon as such a case is detected, we must investigate and deal with it accordingly. To deal with the tactic of "fishing in troubled water" adopted by those "riding without tickets"; and those taking advantage of the situation to indiscriminately raise prices when the public are not clear about service industry charges and the price of some commodities, some deputies and committee members suggested we set up a consultation center so that if the people are doubtful about the prices of certain commodities and services, they may telephone to seek clarification and avoid being taken for a ride by someone "riding without a ticket."
