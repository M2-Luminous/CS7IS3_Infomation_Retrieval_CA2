Yesterday, the Agriculture Ministry announced that in addition to petroleum Colombia will sell rice and African palm oil to Cuba within the framework of new negotiations. Later, Colombia will also export other products, including pork, chicken, and grain. In exchange, Colombia will receive technological and scientific advice for the agricultural and fishing sectors. To strengthen relations with the Castro regime, Deputy Agriculture Minister Santiago Perry Rubio; Jose Ernesto Macias, the ministry's marketing director; and several officials from the Colombian Corporation for Agricultural Research [Corporacion Colombiana de Investigacion Agropecuaria], the Veterinarian Products Enterprise [Empresa de Productos Veterinarios], the National Fisheries and Agricultural Institute [Instituto Nacional de Pesca y Agricultura], and the Colombian Agricultural-Livestock Institute met with Cuban Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan Morales and Cuba's vice ministers of agriculture -- Daniel Fajardo Cubelo and Abilio Cardenas Garcia. The main types of cooperation agreed upon by the two delegations include Cuba's designing, building, and starting operations at a pilot fermentation plant to produce means of biological control [medios de control biologicos]; setting up a joint project to obtain banana varieties resistant to black sigatoka; and holding negotiations on ways to produce rice and palm oil on the island. Also, Colombia agreed to cooperate in developing solar energy and wind power in Cuba and to give advice in the field of veterinarian medicine. Colombian Agriculture Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo will soon meet with his Cuban counterpart Alfredo Jordan Morales in Havana to ratify these agreements. [passage omitted]
