He was addressing a public meeting at Oudtshoorn. Richard Ingram sent us this report: There was a small but attentive multiracial audience for Dr. de Beer at the Democratic Party's first multiracial meeting held at the town in many a year, and it was held in Oudtshoorn Civic Center, a place that was taboo for nonwhites for many a year. In answer to a question, he said his party would work with any parties to vote against the ANC [African National Congress] if it was the majority party and threatened to do anything harmful to South Africa. Answering another question in Afrikaans, Dr. de Beer said a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] was just not viable. He also addressed the latest concessions by the ANC and the government to the Freedom Alliance on the draft constitution in their effort to try and get the alliance to take part in the coming election. [De Beer] Ladies and gentlemen, the question of a double or a single ballot paper is not just a plaything, a coin to be tossed upon a table, to be gambled with. The question of a double or a single system brief -- a ballot paper -- is a matter of moral conviction. But there's no serious doubt that the rights given in the constitution which is before us now, which has been adopted by Parliament, are inadequate. They must be increased, and they must not be increased because Frank Mdlalose wants it or because Ferdi Hartzenberg wants it.
