Import tariffs on 660 out of 1,300 farm products are expected to be cut during the second half of this year, but not by a significant margin, a COA official said. The average import tariff on agricultural products is expected to be cut to 20.5 percent from the current 21.6 percent before the end of this year, moving closer to targets set by a number of foreign nations, particularly the U.S., the official said. A Taiwan mission, led by Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng, has left for Washington for the second round of U.S.-Taiwan trade negotiations under the GATT framework. The U.S. negotiators, who have asked Taiwan to cut import tariffs on agricultural products to under 20 percent, are expected to agree with Taiwan negotiators on a range between 13 percent and 20 percent, a formula modeled after precedents set by South Korea and Japan, the official said. The Taiwan negotiators will proceed to Geneva on May 16 to attend further tariff reduction talks with officials from five countries, including Canada. Taiwan has held negotiations with more than 10 nations since March to discuss tariff and non-tariff trade issues related to Taiwan's GATT membership. Among the issues discussed, tariff cuts on agricultural products have been a major concern. So far Taiwan has held tariff reduction talks with Hungary, South Africa, Brazil, New Zealand, Turkey, Australia, Chile, Egypt, Singapore and Switzerland with a view to accelerating Taiwan's entry into GATT. The 12-member European Union is also scheduled to hold bilateral tariff reduction talks with Taiwan in May, and will most likely use the results of the second-round Taiwan-U.S. trade consultations as reference for its own negotiations with Taiwan. Taiwan, which was admitted as a GATT observer in September 1992, is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.
