This program aids in the promotion of technological innovation with small and medium-sized companies and industrial concerns in those regions of Europe that are "slow developers" or which have been affected by industrial decline. The Fourth STRIDE Conference recently held in Metz gave an overview of the 104 French projects involved in STRIDE. Running since 1992, these projects, which should be completed in a few months' time, are worth a total of 240 million French francs. Aid awarded by the program goes mostly to bodies such as chambers of commerce or teaching establishments looking to develop awareness and training programs in technological innovation aimed at local industry. Daniel Moers of ANVAR [National Agency for the Implementation of Research], one of the French program coordinators, said: "In France, STRIDE has already reached thousands of companies. Thanks to STRIDE, we are seeing an increasing number of small and medium- sized companies and industrial groups coming to ANVAR for aid for innovation." With 26 projects, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region is one of the main beneficiaries of STRIDE in France. Among the bodies in this region implementing STRIDE projects are the Nord Electronics and Microelectronics Institute and the Lille University of Science and Technology, which runs a number of awareness and training programs for small- and mid-sized companies in the field of "intelligent instrumentation." Another major French beneficiary of STRIDE is the Lorraine reiogn, which has 19 projects. These include training programs in electronics, home automation, and production automation organized by the Metz-based center for the research and application of technology for the Lorraine crafts industry. Other French regions have also started up STRIDE projects. In Saint-Etienne, for example, the ARUFOG (association for the research and use of optical fibers and guided optics) is encouraging small and mid-sized companies to start using innovative optical instrumentation and photonics technology for industrial control. The Dantec high school in Lannion is working with local companies to heighten their awareness of laser technologies and to encourage the use of lasers. At Dijon, the regional agency for technological development is working to spread the use of high-energy technologies to the small and medium-sized companies of Burgundy, while in Besancon the technical center for the clock and watchmaking industry is establishing an awareness program in the use of microelectronics.
