"China today faces an excellent situation rarely seen in its modern history," he said in a group discussion about premier Li Peng's government work report. Qiao, who is chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), said that internationally, China maintains good relations with surrounding countries including members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and is steadily improving its relations with Western countries. All new reform measures taken since the beginning of this year are correct, and new problems that have cropped up in the course of implementing these measures can be solved one by one, he told NPC deputies from coastal Zhejiang Province. Qiao, who is also a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, also spoke on such issues as agriculture, establishment of a modern enterprise system for state-owned enterprises, reform of taxation and financial systems, transformation of government functions, and the fight against corruption. On agricultural development, he said, "throughout the 1990s and the next century, we must always give top priority to agriculture as the foundation of the national economy." Qiao stressed the need to take "effective and feasible" measures to help farmers develop both the range and quality of production. Development of the rural economy is not isolated, he said, but must be combined with reform measures that aim to establish a socialist market economy. The Chinese Government has decided to help 80 million people shed poverty by the end of this century, he said, adding that attainment of the goal requires concerted efforts by both central and local governments. Qiao Shi also visited NPC deputies from Anhui and Hubei Provinces.
