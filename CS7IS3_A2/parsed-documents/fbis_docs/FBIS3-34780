Iran turned to a Spanish company to supply it with the diversion technology known as "Diversion" [preceding word in English] after it failed in the past to obtain this technology from the German company Siemens and the Czech company Skoda. Iran accuses the German and Czech companies of submitting to U.S. pressure in their withdrawal from the project to offer their nuclear engineering services. As is known, the Spanish company dealt in the past with the German company Siemens and it has the nuclear engineering expertise available to the German company. The Spanish company participated with Siemens in building the Bushehr reactors in Iran. After the failure of its previous attempts to obtain Western diversion technology, which is more advanced than Russian and Chinese technology, Tehran was eager to submit its new order for Spanish technology in the framework of its endeavors to improve safety levels for the two nuclear reactors it is building with Russian expertise in Gargar and the two reactors (300 megawatts) it is building with Chinese expertise in al-Ahvaz. Nearly a month ago the Iranian Nuclear Energy Commission signed a contract with the Spanish company, under which the latter undertakes to provide engineering services for one of the two Chinese reactors in al-Ahvaz , and a similar contract to provide the same services for the the Russian Bushehr reactor, after signing a contract with the Russians to rebuild it. The deal concluded with the Spanish company totals $80 million. In the first stage Iran hopes that the Spanish company will resume building the Bushehr reactor, 80 percent of which has been completed, before the German company Siemens pulls out of the project. As is known, the capacity of this reactor is 1,000 megawatts. However, Tehran expects now to obtain technology from Spain to divert the Bushehr and Gargar reactors from civilian to military use. Tehran's great interest in these negotiations is reflected in the level of its negotiating delegation, which is headed by Reza Amrollahi [as transliterated], assistant to President Rafsanjani for nuclear affairs and chairman of the Iranian Nuclear Energy Commission, his deputy Mahir 'Alizadeh, and Mohammad Kazem Rasuli, director of the Nuclear Technological Center in Esfahan (ENTC). In charge of the negotiations from the Spanish side are the director general of the Spanish company and his assistant. The director general of the Spanish company participated with Siemens in building the Bushehr reactor. It is worth mentioning that 300-megawatt nuclear reactors are technologically capable of being diverted from civilian to military use.
