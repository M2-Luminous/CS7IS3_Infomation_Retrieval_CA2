At the time, I was working to organize visits north by Hongkongers, in an attempt to improve China-Hong Kong relations, give Hongkongers a better impression of the new Central leadership, and restore Hongkongers' confidence. So the general secretary's frequent statements on particular Hong Kong matters, which were out of line with Hong Kong's realities (at least not in line with them completely), and which left no room for maneuver, had deteriorated my image among Hongkongers to the point where I could hardly understand it and was in great pain. After 4 June, certain prominent figures in the mid- and upper-levels of Hong Kong's Chinese-foreign financial consortiums acted out of a lack of confidence in the CPC and the Chinese Government to secretly brew up a so-called plan for the "leasing of Hong Kong" from the Chinese Government for a decade after 1997. This idea was actually a remake of Britain's plan to "exchange sovereignty for administrative authority" that had come up in the early Sino-British negotiations over the Hong Kong issue. It differed on the return of sovereignty over Hong Kong to China, with the idea of local Hong Kong financial consortiums being for Hongkongers to "lease" Hong Kong, for "rule of Hong Kong by Hongkongers," which would no longer be the "rule of Hong Kong by Hongkongers" as provided by the Basic Law, but would rather be the "rule of Hong Kong" by Hongkongers hired or chosen by financial consortiums that put up the money for the "leasing." The idea of certain foreign-invested financial consortiums was for them to put up the money to "hire" or choose certain people to "run Hong Kong." The second difference was that this administrative authority was "priceless" at the time, with some "offering" $100 million a year, and others $100 million pounds sterling. They streamed to see me to explore this. The Hongkonger financial consortiums acted mostly through their middle-aged delegates, not coming out directly themselves, which was at least my impression. For instance, when Mr. and Mrs. Su Hai-wen [5685 3189 2429] came to see me together to talk about the "leasing" matter, they had already openly published an article in the paper, proposing a plan to "lease" Hong Kong from the Chinese Government for a decade for $1 billion pounds sterling. As to this couple's "proposal" to me, I guessed that they had probably either been sent to me by Su Hai-wen's father-in-law Pao Yu-kang, or had obtained his endorsement. Certain figures from U.S. Japanese, and French business circles also came to see me on this matter, making similar "proposals." What differed here was that they were concerned that the people to be "hired" by Hong Kong Chinese financial consortiums to run Hong Kong would be Britains or of British ancestry. But when I asked them who they would favor "hiring," they would not say, and talked evasively. But whether they were Chinese or foreigners, I told them that: 1) I would agree to report their requests to the Beijing authorities. 2) This is an extremely sensitive matter, with "very litle" possibility of being accepted by the Chinese Government. 3) They should not continue to spread this, particularly not discussing it further in the media or with the press. (I was concerned about the public aversion.) When Jiang Zemin became general secretary at the Fourth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee, he came to talk with me, whereupon I reported the situation to him. I saw that he was listening with great interest so, after my report, I asked him: Should I give him a report on it in writing? To which Jiang Zemin replied very frankly, "yes, send a telegram." I then asked him: "Should I also report it to Comrade Deng Xiaoping?" To which Jiang Zemin noded his head and said "alright." Which was how I returned to Hong Kong and sent a telegram to "the Central Standing Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping." During the Fourth Plenary Session, I neither went to the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, nor discussed this matter with them. Before long, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office held a meeting to discuss its Hong Kong work. Before the meeting had started, Ji Pengfei bought up the telegram about this matter during a chat in his office, which Lu Ping criticized harshly as "the same old formula of turning traitor for personal gain!" When Zhou Nan responded in kind, Ji Pengfei had nothing to say. After the meeting, I happened to be walking along with Lu Ping, so told him that I had sent the telegram because after my oral report, Jiang Zemin had agreed that I should. A few months later, Jiang Zemin again stated publicly in a meeting with certain Hong Kong figures that he opposed this idea. I was quite surprised, wondering why he had not responded for so long. As Hong Kong interest in this matter had slackened, why was the general secretary publicly responding to it again? But I later learned that Lu Ping had complained about it to the Central Committee, misreporting what I had said, by saying that I had sent the telegram because Jiang Zemin had endorsed the proposal. Which is why Jiang Zemin made this public clarification. So agreeing that I should send the telegram was turned into an endorsement of the proposal per se, leading Jiang Zemin to readily believe Lu Ping's one-sided account without verification, and leaving me quite disappointed. At the Fifth Plenary Session, Jiang Zemin gave a political report, and Li Peng also gave a so-called important speech. They raised high the flag of "improvement and rectification," in an attempt to obstruct reform and opening. Jiang Zemin's political report "targeted" a new thing that had appeared in the course of reform and opening--household operations, suggesting the need to ensure that the so-called illegally rich "lose their family fortunes." And township enterprises must be sharply cut back.. with the majority at a group meeting of the Central Advisory Commission taking a stand "in support of" the reports by the new general secretary and premier, while others took another stand, emphasizing the need to observe the law of value. When the group director asked me to speak, I merely reported on the situation in Hong Kong, without taking a positive stand. But as to the "new policy" on household operations, I said that since reform and opening, there had been only policy provisions but no legislation on how to distinguish legal from illegal, so suggested accelerated legislation. There was much private discussion among those in attendance at this meeting, with many holding that the formula favored by Jiang and Li was out of line with current realities, so it would be hard to implement. When someone asked my view, I responded that: "I guess that it will not do, with possibly both local and public resistance. But while it may cause many problems in local work, things will get back to normal after a while." This series of words and deeds by Jiang Zemin and Li Peng left me more disappointed that I could say. I was worried about both Hong Kong and the CPC!
