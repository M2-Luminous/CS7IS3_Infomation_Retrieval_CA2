Masses of our Yemeni people, our heroes in Tawr al-Bahah, our heroic Armed Forces: 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has dug a new graveyard with his own hands for what is left of his routed armies. Tawr al-Bahah is in flames lit by the invaders. Tawr al-Bahah is a new graveyard and a holocaust of death. The invaders are dying without being conscious of death. Now, at this very moment, a battle is going on in which the enemy is registering losses every second and minute. The sons of Tawr al-Bahah are steadfast and our Armed Forces, the forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen are, true to tradition, inflicting blows against the hordes and the routed remnants of the invaders from the land, the air, and the sea. The enemies are perishing but they are dreaming that they are advancing. It is madness and death. They have no other fate except death. God is Great. God is Great. Victory to the Democratic Republic of Yemen.
