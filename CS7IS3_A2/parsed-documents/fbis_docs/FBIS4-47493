N. Borisov, A. S. Nikitin, V. A. Ivanov and I. S. Gaynutdinov; UDC 681.7.062.621.373.826] [Abstract] The development of highly reflective mirrors with small losses in scattering and absorption on the basis of multilayer interference coatings is discussed and the theory of nonpolarizing highly reflective mirrors is outlined. A method for designing and fabricating amplitude-phase anisotropic mirrors with small losses for operation at a wavelength 632.8 nm at an angle 45� is described in detail and copies of phase-controllable mirrors smoothly and reversibly changing phase anisotropy within the limits 10� also are described. Such a mirror is a backing of KU1 glass fabricated by deep grinding and polishing to whose working surface is successively applied (in a vacuum by the cathode-ray method) a current conducting layer, copper contacts for imparting a working voltage and the highly reflective mirror itself. The operating principle is as follows. With the imparting of voltages and a current of definite strength to the contacts the current-conducting layer causes heating of the mirror itself, in which the optical thicknesses of the layers change (these changes are proportional to the strength of the current fed to the contacts). With an increase in the current strength fed to the contacts the range of change in phase anisotropy increases with heating of the mirror to 80�C. The dependence of phase anisotropy on temperature has a reversible stably reproducible character. Figures 4; references 12: 6 Russian, 6 Western.
