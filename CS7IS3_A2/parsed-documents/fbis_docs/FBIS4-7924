FBIS4-7924 "dreeu068__a94011" FBIS-EEU-94-068-A Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Inflation for Mar Marks Two-Year High Inflation for Mar Marks Two-Year High AU0804122794 Sofia BTA in English 1114 GMT 8 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0804122794 Sofia BTA English BFN [Text] Sofia, April 8 (BTA) -- In March the monthly inflation rate was 7.5 percent -- the highest since May 1992, said Prof. Zakhari Karamfilov, chairman of the National Statistical Institute [NSI] at a press conference today. In 1993 inflation ranged between 1.9 percent (in June) and 6.9 percent (in January). This year the monthly inflation rate climb persisted from 3.8 percent in January and 4.6 percent in February to 7.5 percent in March. Total inflation for the first three months was 16.6 percent, which exceeds the 10 percent projected by the National Statistical Institute (NSI). According to Prof. Karamfilov it is still early to project the annual inflation rate, but he believes that the data for April will be indicative in this respect. In March consumer prices went up by 8 percent, marking a 17.2 percent increase from December last year. The steepest rise was registered in the prices of fresh fruit -- 74 percent, followed by confectionery -- 20 percent, vegetables -- 9.9 percent, coffee -- 8.7 percent, and cigarettes -- 23.7 percent. At the same time non- foods went up by 9 percent in March and 18.8 percent in the first quarter of the year. However, these figures are based on data received by March 22, 1994, and do not reflect the surge in prices in the last ten days of March. That is why the NSI conducted an express survey of the prices of 24 foods and 3 non-foods by March 31. The survey covered staple foods and commodities, the prices of which are bound to the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar. The aggregate increase in prices for March was 61.5 percent [figure as received], according to the data of the survey. The price of oranges soared almost two-fold -- 95.8 percent, coffee went up by 69.7 percent, sugar by 42.7 percent, yellow cheese 36.3 percent, white cheese 33 percent, bananas 20.2 percent, and lemons 13.9 percent. The prices of monitored non-foods nearly doubled. Cookers identified the most dramatic rise, going up 2.5 times, followed by automatic washing machines with 2.2 times, colour TV sets 2.1 times, refrigerators 2 times, and vacuum cleaners with 98.4 percent. These are mostly imported commodities and the rise of their prices was an immediate result of the dollar appreciation on the forex market. The prices set in the different regions of the country vary within a wide range. Pork, for example, moves from 45 to 104 leva, beef from 54 to 92 leva, chicken from 45 to 70 leva, some sausages from 54 to 92 leva, sheep's cheese from 70 to 144 leva and coffee from 160 to 310 leva. This trend holds true for non-foods just as well. Another characteristic feature of the current market situation is the wide margin between producer and market prices. According to Prof. Karamfilov, all this comes to show that while the foreign exchange rates fluctuation pushed the inflation rate up, the speculative price growth is a no less powerful inflationary factor. The major factor that brought about the current price jump is the lack of government price policy and the launching of price decontrol before the liquidation of the monopoly state structures, according to the head of the NSI.
