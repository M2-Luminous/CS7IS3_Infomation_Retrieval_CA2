SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 This rule has been determined not to be significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866. Federal Assistance Program The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to which this rule applies are: Commodity Loans and Purchases_10.051.

Environmental Evaluation It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will not have a significant impact on the quality of human environment. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed. Executive Order 12372 This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983). Executive Order 12778 This rule has been reviewed pursuant to Executive Order 12778.

The provisions of this rule are not retroactive. Prior to any judicial action in a court of jurisdiction, administrative review under 7 CFR part 780 must be exhausted. Paperwork Reduction Act Public reporting burden for the information collections contained in this regulation with respect to price support programs is estimated to average 15 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The information collections have previously been cleared under the current regulations by OMB, and assigned OMB Nos. 0560&hyph;0087 and 0560&hyph;0129. The amendments to 7 CFR 1427 set forth in this final rule do not contain new or revised information collections that require clearance by OMB under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 35.
