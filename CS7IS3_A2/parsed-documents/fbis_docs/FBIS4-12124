The group, nearly all from PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah movement, crossed the Allenby Bridge from Jordan at the second attempt after the Israeli authorities at first refused to accept 23 of their 46 relatives. The officials said the group had completed formalities, been issued identity cards and would shortly pass out of the Israeli side of the border post. Another couple of dozen Palestinians were being processed at the Rafah border crossing from Egypt into the Gaza Strip following a deal between Israel and the PLO in Cairo last Thursday. Of the 26, one is a communist, one independent and one from Yasir Abd-Rabbuh's moderate Fida' group. The rest are Fatah men considered vital to efforts to build autonomy in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho. The exiles were expelled or wanted by the Israeli authorities and had fled abroad since Israel seized the territories in 1967.
