The parliamentary state secretary in the Economics Ministry, Kolb, said in a Bundestag debate on Friday [4 March] that a major German supplier "of a foreign country's nuclear program" was detected with the help of telephone surveillance. Since October 1992, the Customs Criminal Investigation Office has applied for telephone surveillance in 11 cases. Five cases led to criminal procedures. In an amendment to the Foreign Trade Law, which went through its first reading in the Bundestag on Friday, the authorization -- limited to 31 December 1994 -- to partially circumvent the secrecy of letters and telephone conversations to allow persecuting severe offenses against the arms trade and export laws, is to be extended by two years. This was criticized by Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] deputy Bachmeier. He said that the new regulation would entail permanent telephone surveillance being granted to the Customs Criminal Investigation Office, which must, however, not be given intelligence service authorities. Activities involving the secrecy of postal and telephone services should only be carried out by the federal prosecutors. In the government's view, the regulation will have to be tried out over a longer period of time. Other amendments to the Foreign Trade Law are mainly aiming at harmonizing German regulations with European Union [EU] rules on the control of dual-use products. They will enable the Federal Exports Office to continue granting export licenses under future EU regulations. The powers of the authorities controlling the observance of the regulations will also be extended to comply with European directives. The SPD considers this measure a "misleading signal" that does not serve the aim of introducing the high German control standards in Europe. Kolb said that in the fields of controlling conventional arms, services, and know-how transfer, the EU partners would not implement the strict German regulations. New EU directives would require German regulations to be changed. The draft law also extends the possibility of exchanging data between the Federal Exports Office and other authorities. So far, the office was allowed to pass data to the customs and criminal investigation authorities. This is to be extended to include the Federal Intelligence Service (BND), the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), and environmental authorities, which has so far only been possible in connection with specific export license applications. According to the government, the details the Federal Exports Office requires from the BND and the BfV are data on foreign customers and arms acquisition organizations.
