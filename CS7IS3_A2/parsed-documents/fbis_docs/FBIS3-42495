And it has already been taken...." Unfortunately, this is precisely the tone of most of the letters coming to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA from servicemen, officers in the reserves, and retired officers without apartments. The hopes raised by the edicts of the president of the Russian Federation "On Measures To Strengthen the Social Protection of Service Members and Persons Discharged From Military Service" (February 1992) and "On Additional Measures for the Financing and Acquisition of Housing for Service Members" (July 1992) and by the law of the Russian Federation "On the Status of Service Members" (January 1993) were first replaced, in their words, by depression caused by the obvious unwillingness of local authorities to pay back to military people their debts for housing and the decline in the rate and volume of construction and then by despair. "For many years, our families have not had roofs over their heads," lieutenant colonels Brestel and Teselkin, captains Popov and Khramtsov, Senior Warrant Officer Kryuchkov, and others (altogether 36 signatures) from Kaliningrad Oblast write to the editor's office. They counted on the law on status but in July of last year Colonel General Valeriy Mironov, deputy minister of defense, signed a directive that permits the dismissal of officers without housing from the ranks of the armed forces. And this is despite the fact that the law prohibits the dismissal of service members who have served 10 years or longer without providing housing for them and the members of their families. In a similar situation were Lieutenant Colonel of the Reserves Valeriy Semushkin (Gvardeysk in Kaliningrad Oblast), who was discharged to the reserves in violation of the law without being provided with an apartment, and majors Belichko and Ivanov (Kemerovo), who were discharged to the reserves under the same circumstances. Alas, here it is not a matter of the "ill will" of the military department. The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation was itself a hostage of our imperfect legislation and lack of a normal practice for the execution of the laws. Let us turn to the content of the law "On the Status of Service Members." Article 22 of the law does indeed prohibit the discharge of service members to the reserves and retirement without the provision of housing. But this same law states (Article 15) that "citizens discharged from military service...are provided with living premies by the agencies of local self-administration in accordance with the established norms within three months at the latest...." Does not the presence of this article in the law infer that...officers and warrant officers without housing will nevertheless be discharged from service? The readers of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA noticed this total discrepancy a long time ago. In their letters, they justifiably note that even today, a year after the passage of the law "On the Status of Service Members," the articles that constitute the so-called housing block do not actually work. And Lt. Col. of the Reserves Andrey Molostov from Orel has good reason to think: "If tomorrow the editor's office receives a report that even one officer or warrant officer discharged from military service received an apartment within three months, then I am certain that it will be published in the pages of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA under the heading `Sensation'...." As for the directive signed by the deputy minister of defense, it does indeed contradict the law. And this was confirmed in the Main Directorate of the General Procurator's Office of the Russian Federation in its supervision of the execution of the laws in the military forces of the Russian Federation, officially protesting it on 8 December of last year. On 30 December, the minister of defense of the Russian Federation revoked it. Overall, of course, the problem of eliminating the lack of housing in the army is a matter of distribution. If only there were something to distribute. Here are some figures. In 1993, it was planned to construct and acquire 82,000 apartments for military people through all sources of financing. And of course the plan for 1993 and the state program for 1993-1995 for the provision of service members and persons discharged from military service and their family members with housing did not completely resolve the problem, although they did at least make it possible to stop the dramatic worsening of the housing situation in the army and to reduce the number of officers on the waiting list to a little more than 100,000 by the end of 1995. The only condition that they were required to observe was the performance of obligations by all sides. But practically from the very beginning of the realization of the state program, the Ministry of Finance put it on strict rations with respect to financing. In the first seven months of 1993, for example, the Ministry of Finance was supposed to finance capital construction amounting to almost 500 billion rubles [R] under the program. But actually only R298 billion were allocated for these purposes. The credits to the Ministry of Defense for housing construction were allocated without the appropriate indexing, which essentially paralyzed the work of the building organizations. And most often the explanation was extremely simple: they said that the state did not have enough money for everything and that it was necessary to be patient.... "But how long can one wait?" write the wives of servicemen of an aviation squadron withdrawn from the territory of Latvia to Saransk (Mordovia) in 1992. "How long can our families stay in hotels and children's sanitary camps? We live in extremely crowded conditions, in housing not suitable for family life and without basic amenities. At the time when the unit was being pulled out of Latvia, we were promised that housing would be built quickly at the new station. In May of last year, the air force command for Moscow District issued specific information, saying that those on the waiting list would receive the first few dozen apartments by May 1993. Alas, we did not receive anything and essentially there is no construction under way--there are no funds. But to live in a hotel they demand the timely payment of several tens of thousands of rubles. Where can we get this money, if our husbands are not paid on time? And there is nothing with which to feed our children...." But this is not all. Many local administrations essentially did not pay their debts to service personnel for housing and were openly scornful of the directives of the president of Russia. And this is despite the fact that in Moscow, Tver, Murmansk, and several other oblasts they were able, despite difficulties, to settle accounts with military people.... Last year the military people failed to receive more than 10,000 square meters of housing space that was supposed to be built with funds from the federal budget. And the prospects are by no means favorable for 1994 either. A decision by the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation specified that this year the construction of housing for military people will be financed at the level of last year. In the context of the state program with a planned increase of 11,000 square meters for 1994, this sounds either like an admission of the unsoundness of the control figures incorporated in it or as disdain for them. In both cases, we are actually dealing with the failure of the program. In the opinion of readers, the problem of the provision of housing to persons discharged from military service has gone over to a second or possibly even lower category. No one is carrying out the enforceable acts providing for the allocation of housing for the resettlement from military posts of persons who have lost their ties with the armed forces. In the military districts and fleets, they are more concerned about improving the living conditions of regular service personnel. "And this is very painful and insulting," reserve officers and warrant officers from the town of Gremikha (Northern Fleet) write to the editor's office, "we served on ships and in units of the fleet for many years and some of us lived all of our lives here, in this town with difficult climatic conditions. And now, when our health resources are just about exhausted, it turns out that there is no place for us in regions with a more favorable climate and with medical facilities more oriented toward people of our age.... Out of 35 reserve officers and warrant officers, only 5 people received the expected housing last year. It may be that they will allocate abundant housing to the fleet but will it reach us here in Gremikha?" Whether or not Gremikha gets housing, this is a question for the command of the Northern Fleet. But of course there is no abundance either in the Northern Fleet or in other fleets and districts. Everywhere they are on starvation rations with respect to housing.... Judging by the mail to the editor's office, those without apartments have long since quit believing that there is no money for the construction of housing. "They can come up with hundreds of millions of dollars for the building of a parliamentary center, but is this the most acute problem in Russia?" asks Stepan Ugolnikov from Saratov. And he draws this conclusion: there is money but there is no order, there are laws but there is no respect for them, and there are responsible persons but they are not taking their responsibility very seriously. And one can find solutions but one must make a genuine search for them. By the way, the editor's office of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has received many proposals on this in its mail. The most constructive of them essentially amount to the following: if there is a particular legislative base, there needs to be a mechanism for the realization of the laws, a mechanism based on the strictest responsibility of officials, administrative heads, managers of ministries and departments, and members of the cabinet of ministers for the execution of the laws. The tasks defined by the programs that constitute state policy with respect to the armed forces must be resolved whatever the difficulties may be.... To a certain extent, the constructiveness of these proposals is relative. This, in a manner of speaking, is the constructiveness of the object of state policy, the human being who does not bring about a solution but expects one. Nevertheless.... Some readers are proposing the allocation of long-term loans at a favorable rate of interest (and possibly no interest at all) to military personnel without housing and to those who have been discharged from military service for the construction of housing, the transfer of all the funds from varous sources of financing to a single customer for housing (the Ministry of Defense), and so on. But Vladimir Sergeyevich Katin, to whom, as he writes, it is painful to see the disorder of Russian military personnel, is proposing to the government and Ministry of Defense that they pay closer attention to the so-called unfinished construction: "At the central farmstead of the joint stock company "Velikopolye" (Smolensk Oblast), there are 10 unfinished two-apartment cottages, which the sovkhoz began to build for its workers in 1989-1990 but did not complete. They should have finished building them on a shared basis with "Velikopolye" and you would have seen that several families of military people would have had a roof over their heads...." But whatever might have been heard, it appears that all of this is nothing new for those who are obligated by their official position to solve the problem of overcoming the lack of housing in the army. They know all of this or at least should know it.... Today it is already obvious that the resolution of the housing problem in the armed forces is not so much a social and economic task as it is a political one. Russia is a state in the process of reform and this process has just begun to get under way seriously. In such a situation, sensible politicians are doing everything they can to strengthen the institutions of power (and the armed forces are one of them). To allow the army or in any case a large detachment of people who comprise it to continue along the path of disappointment in the current authority, along the path leading from hope to despair, is at least imprudent. After all, the palette of human moods is not limited to despair....
