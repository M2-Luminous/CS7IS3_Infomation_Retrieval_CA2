In the past year, we managed to create the conditions for achieving a just solution to the Yugoslav crisis. We succeeded in this because our policy has been just and based on the inalienable right of our country and our people to protect their historical, state, and national interests but also based on the principle of respecting the same rights of other peoples. Today, no one -- neither throughout the former Yugoslavia nor in the world -- can deny Serbia, its citizens, and the Serbian people their persistent and lasting endeavor for peace. We can, therefore, freely say that we quite justifiably expect that the coming year will bring a lasting and just peace. Great mobilization for work and economic recovery are awaiting us in the new year. We expect the implementation of a comprehensive economic program, on which we have been working for some time and whose preparations have been carried out and completed in the last few days, to commence at the beginning of the year. This program aims to curb inflation, stimulate production, make public expenditures and social policy rely on realistic sources of funds, and eliminate speculations. Everyone will have to bear some of the responsibility. This equally refers to the governments at the federal and republican levels, businessmen, trade unions, workers, peasants, and all citizens. Under such conditions, our economic recovery will be possible, and this is why resolving the amassed problems of our economy will be focused on next year. Along with the struggle for economic recovery, we will fight a merciless battle against all forms of crime, because crime is incompatible with the nature of a free and democratic society. Serbia and its citizens and the entire Serbian nation have great potentials for a successful economic and cultural development. Next year will be crucial for the quick realization of these long- term aims. I wish you all much success and a happy New Year.
