SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of September 28, 1994 (59 FR 49484), EPA published an ANPR for significant new uses of lead issued under section 5(a)(2) of TSCA. Significant new use rules for lead would require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import, or processing of lead and lead compounds for uses identified by the Agency as significant new uses. EPA issued this ANPR to: (1) Communicate its intention to regulate significant new uses of elemental lead and lead compounds; (2) identify components of its proposed regulatory approach; (3) request comment on issues related to this approach; and (4) request comment and information on existing uses of lead that would help support EPA's selection of proposed criteria for defining significant new uses of lead. Written comments on the ANPR were to be received on or before November 28, 1994. EPA has received several requests from trade associations seeking a 60&hyph;day extension of the public comment period because of additional time needed to provide EPA with information requested in the ANPR. EPA believes that providing an additional 60&hyph;day period to prepare written comments is reasonable. The Agency, therefore, is extending the comment period 60 days in order to give all interested persons the opportunity to comment fully. Written and electronic comments submitted in response to the ANPR must be received on or before January 27, 1995.
