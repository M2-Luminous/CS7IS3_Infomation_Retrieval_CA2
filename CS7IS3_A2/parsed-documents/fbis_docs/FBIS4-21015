The drug was found packed in several hundred parcels tin-veiled [as received], inscripted in Italian language, and buried in the garden. The police discovered also under the kitchen floor of a home in another village in the Maramures County a Dutch made vacuum packing machine suspected to be employed in drugs packing. While continuing investigations in this area at the north-western border of Romania, the police uncovered an entire ring of drugs smugglers. Some other inhabitants of the same county are suspected to be involved in trafficking a great deal of hashish coming from Lebanon to Constanta, Romanian port at the Black Sea. After a short leg to the packing machine, the hashish was being sent to the Netherlands, crossing the Romanian border in trucks loaded with apples and wine. Over 5 tonnes of hashish are believed to have been conveyed to the Netherlands in three trucks. The investigation continues with some of the suspects placed under arrest.
