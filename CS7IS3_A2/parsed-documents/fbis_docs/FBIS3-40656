The proceedings were postponed until Friday since nothing could be accomplished on the face of the turmoil. Lok Sabha proceedings were postponed four times and Rajya Sabha Proceedings had to be postponed at least three times. The members cried out slogans like "Selling India out to the United States," etc., in reference to India's signing the GATT. IN THE LOK SABHA... Parliamentary Affairs Minister V.C. Shukla pacified the Lok Sabha members and arranged for the Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji to read out a statement on GATT negotiations. The members ignored that and insisted that the consequences of signing GATT be discussed in the presence of the prime minister, instead of following that day's agenda. When the Lok Sabha reconvened at 2 in the afternoon, the members agitated once again and proclaimed that unless the prime minister came, they would not allow any activities to take place. Ram Vilas Paswan of Janata Dal, wanted to know if the premier would come. Mr. Shukla informed them that the prime minister was busy entertaining the Indonesian President and to kindly allow the commerce minister to read the statement. He assured them that there was no problem in the premier himself coming subsequently to the parliament, and that the sentiments of the members would be duly conveyed to him. Janata Dal members insisted that the premier himself come. Somnath Chatterji (CPI-M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist] said that Mukherji should be allowed to read out the statement, and the members could conduct the discussions the next day in the premier's presence. He emphasized that no other matter may be taken up in the meanwhile. After Pranab Mukherji read the statement, the oposition agitated once more that the prime minister come. They proceeded to the center of the assembly hall and shouted slogans. In the midst of their shouting and agitating, the deputy speaker of the Lok Sabha, Mallikarjunaiya attempted to take up other items for discussion from the agenda, and some ministers put forth their issues, but in the pandemonium created by the members, nothing could be heard. Therefore, Mallikarjunaiya announced that he was postponing the proceedings. When they reconvened the same scene followed once more. At 5 in the afternoon, the assembly was postponed for the the third time, and soon after to the next day! RAJYA SABHA... The Rajya Sabha proceedings were postponed three times following the agitation by its members. At 1445, the assembly was postponed for the second time. The Speaker, Najma Heptullah had already requested orderly conduct and having failed to obtain the same, postponed proceedings. When they reconvened, deputing speaker Sayyad Chipte Razi announced that Pranab Mukherji will read the statement on Dunkel, to which there was vehement opposition. No one listened to what Mukherji read. Opposition members rushed to the center of the assembly hall. Since Razi's requests were being ignored, he had to postpone proceedings once more. The question hour was held in the Rajya Sabha inspite of all this. When that was over, Dunkel plan was brought up and there was agitation again. Whenever the house reconvened, there was agitation and so the proceedings had to be postponed till Friday. PRANAB: EXPORTS WILL INCREASE Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji said in parliament on Thursday that, since the new commercial agreements concluded are global in scope, India's annual exports will increase from Rs.31,500 million to Rs.60 billion. One hundred and seventeen countries, including India adopted global trade agreements on Wednesday (15 December). Pranab briefed both houses of parliament on this and said: The global expansion of trading will especially benefit India. There will be no adverse effect on grants, rations, textiles, drugs, or copyright regstration. Textile export quotas have been extended to 10 more years. Even though this in itself may not be satisfactory, the developed nations have assured that this quota will be removed entirely at the end of the 10 year period. This will help the growth and expansion of textiles. The developed countries of the world have reduced the tariff on agricultural products-exports. Therefore Indian agricultural products may be sold at a reduced price in the world market. Japan and South Korea have loosened their hitherto firm stand of not allowing rice imports. They have changed their stand and will allow rice to be imported. The agreements stipulate that not more than 10 percent of an agricultural product's value may be levied as tariff on it, but the tariff India will have to pay is much reduced compared to the amount determined by the member countries, due to special concessions. Therefore, there is no need to fear that agricultural grants will decrease.
