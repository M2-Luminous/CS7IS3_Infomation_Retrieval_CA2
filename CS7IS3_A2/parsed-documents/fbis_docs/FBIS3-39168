This recognition comes when Greek-U.S. relations are on a very good level. Do you believe it could shake these relations? Do you believe this recognition spells a worse course for the Skopje issue? [Papandreou] These are two questions: First, certainly it has some repercussions for Greek-U.S. relations. We have expressed our strong displeasure, but we would like to believe that the wording of the decision that was adopted -- it does not use the word pressure but refers to exercising influence concerning the issue of differences, as they are called in the document, between Greece and Skopje -- may be utilized, I say probably be utilized, positively. This is something we expect but we don't know. On Skopje, you asked a second question.... [Correspondent, interrupting] Does this development spell something worse.... [Papandreou, interrupting] Look, I think it encourages Kiro Gligorov, who does not live the reality. The reality is that Greece is in a position to isolate this country economically if Greece so decides. If it makes that decision, it would mean collapse. We are--in a strange irony--virtually the only Balkan country with no territorial designs on Skopje. Opposition between us and Skopje increases. I believe that Gligorov, no matter how many countries recognize him, cannot escape the basic question: What would Greece do? Greece can do a lot. I believe this will be understood by our friends, our allies, everyone. [Correspondent] Prime Minister, right up until the U.S. recognition of Skopje was announced officially, did the Greek side, did you personally, do anything to avert this action? [Papandreou] Look, I can say this: First, I talked to President Clinton in Brussels. Second, I had high level contacts about three days ago. I don't know, I cannot give details, but I did what I thought was possible and decent on our part. There is also the issue of decency and pride. [Correspondent] Prime Minister, in its recognition announcement, the United States uses the phrase: Differences between Greece and Skopje. I would like you to comment on this placing of an ally on the same footing as a country that until a while ago was hostile to America. [Papandreou] I agree with the reasoning behind your question. This is why we expressed our strong displeasure. We could not return to a dialogue unless our three conditions were satisfied. We follow a policy of two stages, two phases: The first phase concerns the [Macedonian] constitution, the emblem of the Veryina Sun, and propaganda. The second phase then is that we go toward some economic normalization, primarily in the economic sector [as heard]. But dialogue starts on other issues, including the name, on which our positions remain irrevocable. [Correspondent] Prime Minister, Andonios Samaras [opposition Political Spring party chairman] said yesterday that, according to his information, the Skopjeans are giving nothing; they won't even change [their] flag in return. He also discussed either a struggle by the government or its resignation. Would you comment on this statement by Samaras? [Papandreou] I don't think there is any reason to comment on it. There is no reason to comment on it. [Correspondent] Prime Minister, based on information that you already have, do you believe that a concession by Skopje at a later stage based on Greek demands is feasible? [Papandreou] I am optimistic but insistence, patience, and determination, which we have, are necessary. We are prudent but we don't forget our national interests. We have a duty both to the nation and the people. [Correspondent] Prime Minister, could it be that the recognition, this action by the U.S. side, occupies you ahead of your visit to the United States the date for which has already been announced? [Papandreou] No. [Correspondent] Prime Minister, do you think you might propose to the president holding a conference of the political leaders. The official opposition party, through Chairman Miltiadhis Evert, today called at least for the formation of a national council on foreign policy. [Papandreou] Well, it is a proposal. It has some meaning. We will consider the proposal. Concerning a meeting chaired by Konstandinos Karamanlis, there is not actually any objection; it is a matter of time as to when we and, naturally, the president will decide on it. [Correspondent] Prime Minister, would you like to comment on the NATO decision yesterday on Bosnia? [Papandreou] Yes, it is very unfortunate. It is an absolutely wrong, guilty decision, because: How did the Yugoslav crisis begin? Who is responsible for the crisis? Unfortunately, it is [the responsibility] of the European Community, you know. It is a responsibility that Greece, unfortunately, also shared fully. We should not forget this. There are tremendous responsibilities in this. Since 16 December [1991], the course has been charted. Now we have military intervention to implement peace. It is an incongruous scheme. The military intervention has no goal. What is the goal of the intervention? Is it to strike at one of the three parties to the dispute and the conflict--Serbia? Is it designed to make it bend on its knees? What problem would this solve in the region and what are the possibilities of the war expanding? I don't want to be more precise or any clearer this time. But there is a possibility of the war expanding. We adopted a firm stance at the NATO summit, which is why the decision then was quite good. I don't forget, we should not forget, that the European Union's decision on Monday was a great success for the Greek Presidency, I believe. But the same foreign ministers, within the NATO framework, have decided on something that, in my opinion, is a major blunder. [Correspondent] Prime Minister, why didn't the Greek side exercise the right of veto. [Papandreou] It can, it could. It did not exercise it because then we would also have become part of the Yugoslav crisis. We have undertaken a responsibility. We said clearly why we are not participating and we will not allow the AWACS [Airborne Warning And Control System] to move from Aktion or the Greek crews to participate in the AWACS in the event of war. Greece is very, very clear: We are staying out of the military intervention in the Balkans. We consider it disastrous. [Correspondent] Prime Minister, given the major crisis in Bosnia and the possibility of a more general conflagration, how do you judge the U.S. move to recognize Skopje? Does it contribute to stabilization or does it contribute to destabilization? [Papandreou] Our position is clear: It does not contribute to stabilization. What would contribute to that is pressure to have concessions made, that is, to eliminate the aggressive, irredentist nature of this state so that we can return to a dialogue. Then, there would be normalization and a contribution to peace in the region. [Correspondent] You pinned many hopes on the White House. Have they been belied now? Could it be that this option was wrong? [Papandreou] Look, it is not an issue of an option. It was a good--and there is a good--relationship. And a good personal relationship between was created this time between President Clinton and me. But we know very well that no states, certainly not the superpowers, move on the basis of personal friendship or partisan identities or positioning. They move on the basis of strategic interests, as they interpret them.
