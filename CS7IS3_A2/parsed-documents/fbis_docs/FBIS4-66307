Deal Severe Blows at Serious Criminal and Economic Cases, Safeguard Social Stability and Wage Struggles against Corruption Social stability is the necessary pre-requisite and guarantee to promoting the reform and opening-up program and developing economic construction. To punish criminals according to law, safeguard social stability and create a fine social environment for developing the reform and opening-up program and economic construction is the major responsibility of the people's court. The courts at all levels in the province had continued to implement the principle of "dealing heavy blows at criminal offenses" and persistently and unflinching waged struggles to strike at heinous criminals. In 1993, Jiangxi had handled 9,426 criminal cases of the first instance and completed 9,304 of them. Among the 12,807 criminal offenders to whom judgments have already become effective, 33.8 percent of them were sentenced to more than five years of fixed imprisonment, life imprisonment or death (including death penalty with a suspension of execution); 65.5 percent of them were sentenced to less than five years of fixed-term imprisonment, criminal retention and public surveillance or given exemption from criminal sanctions; and 0.7 percent of them were found not guilty. In their struggle against crimes which seriously endanger public security, the courts at all levels paid attention to the following work: 1. They concentrated their efforts on handling major cases. They promptly handled, from the beginning to the end, those criminal cases involving killing, robbery, kidnapping, rape and hooligan activities, particularly major crimes committed by criminal gangs. In all the criminal cases completed in 1993, 43.8 percent or 4,081 cases and 63 percent or 7,856 criminals were involved in the aforementioned offenses. 2. They continued to coordinate with relevant departments to vigorously wage struggles against larceny, train and highway robberies, abducting and selling children, forcing women into prostitution. Proceeding from reality, various localities dealt heavy blows to those crimes on the priority list, and attained remarkable results. In 1993, Jiangxi handled 652 cases involving larceny and prosecuted 1,048 suspects; 282 cases involving the "six evils" and prosecuted 414 offenders; and handled 303 cases involving train and highway robberies and prosecuted 831 offenders. 3. They strengthened their forces to strike at criminal activities, and persistently followed the principle of meting out severe and swift punishment to criminals who serious endangered public security. About 94 percent of the cases wounded up in 1993 were completed within the legally prescribed time limits. The number of heinous criminals sentenced to more than five years of fixed-term imprisonment or death penalty rose 8.4 percent in 1993. To deal heavy blows at criminals is an important aspect of the struggle waged by the people's courts against criminal activities. Economic crimes seriously jeopardized the ties of the party and government with the masses, hindered the reform and opening up program and interfered with economic construction. The courts at all levels in the province had continued to regard the struggle to strike at criminal crimes as something of great significance in combating corruption, in keeping a honest and clean government and in promoting economic development. They firmly adhered to the principle of severely punishing serious economic offenders in accordance with law. In 1993, people's courts in Jiangxi had accepted 990 economic cases of the first instance publicly prosecuted by the procuratorial organs, and completed 944 of them. Except those cases for which appeals were being lodged and those which were sent back to procuratorial organs for reinvestigation or withdrawal, actions taken against 1,865 offenders had already become legally effective, of whom 765 were sentenced to more than five years of fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment and death, 1,100 of them were sentenced to less than five years of fixed-term imprisonment, criminal retention and public surveillance, 114 were exempted from criminal sanctions and 23 of them were found not guilty. Among the criminals convicted, 197 committed offenses involving more than 10,000 yuan each and 56 committed crimes involving over 100,000 yuan each. A total of 5.91 million yuan of economic losses were recovered for the state. In order to further intensify the struggle against corruption, the people's courts in the province had persistently struck at corrupt state functionaries who accepted bribery and engaged in embezzlement. They resolutely meted out punishment on this type of offenses as soon as the cases were accepted by the court and the suspects were proved guilty. In 1993, Jiangxi completed 149 cases of the first instance involving corruption, bribery and embezzlement, accounting for 16 percent of all the criminal cases. Two hundred fifteen offenders were convicted including eight county and department-level cadres. At the same time, actions were taken to severely deal with smugglers, swindlers and tax dodgers and those who faked trademarks; sold and manufactured fake and shoddy merchandise; and seriously undermined the economic order. In 1993, Jiangxi had concluded 109 trials of the aforementioned category, and convicted 184 offenders whose sentences had already become legally effective. In dealing with offenses of this category, other punishments such as imposing fines, confiscating properties and others were also meted out along with other severe punishments so as to prevent the criminals from reaping economic benefits. After the arrangements were made by the second plenary session of the CPC Central Discipline Inspection Commission for the anti-corruption struggle in August 1993, the courts at various levels in the province had exerted even greater efforts in striking at economic crimes. They strengthened their efforts to handle the major cases exposed in the anti-corruption struggle and completed the trials in a timely manner, once the procuratorial organs started the prosecution procedure. They paid full attention to facts and the evidence and handled all cases in accordance with law. They closely followed the principle of "being firm, prudent and accurate," and ensured that all cases were handled properly and carefully. From September to December 1993, Jiangxi had accepted and concluded 517 economic cases, up 90 cases over the same period in 1992. There were 133 major cases involving corruption, bribery and embezzlement for which 11 criminals were sentenced to more than 10 years of fixed-term imprisonment; two of them to life imprisonment and another two to the death penalty with a suspension of execution. In addition, two of the criminals were sentenced to death, pending the approval of the Supreme People's Court. In order to meet the requirements set by the central authorities and the provincial CPC committee to attain achievements against corruption in different stages in the near future, the people's courts in various localities held sentence-pronouncing rallies during which verdicts were passed on a group of major criminal offenders involving corruption, bribery and embezzlement. At the end of 1993, the provincial people's court had taken an unified action to pronounce sentences on a number of major cases which attracted widespread attention of the general public. It made a province-wide group announcement in public and even held a news briefing in this connection. It created a great impact and good social effects on the society. II. Regulate Economic Relations in Accordance With Law, Actively Serve Macro-Control and Develop Market Economy In the course of promoting the national economy with a high speed last year, there emerged some contradictions and problems in China's economic life. Some of them were quite outstanding. The party CPC Committee made a timely policy decision to strengthen and improve the macro-economic control. In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the major policy decision made by the central authorities and maintain the normal economic order, the people's courts at various levels throughout the province adopted effective measures to vigorously strengthen their efforts in trying cases involving economic crimes. In 1993, they handled a total of 38,285 economic cases of the first instance with a total amount of 966 million yuan involved, up 35.7 percent and 129 percent respectively over 1992. We had paid particular attention to handling the following types of cases. 1) We actively handled cases involving state-owned enterprises which were changing the way they operated; protected, in accordance with law, the legal interests of the enterprises and the managing companies by trying cases which involved contracting, leasing, joint operation, merging, shareholding and bankruptcy procedures for various enterprises. We had helped enterprises change the way their operated and establish a modern enterprise system; and provided them with the legal protection to become market-oriented. In 1993, Jiangxi had handled a total of 1,204 cases of the aforementioned nature, accounting for 3.2 percent of the total number of cases handled. 2) We concentrated our efforts in handling cases involving marketing, money-borrowing, financing, investment in shareholding form, patent, trademark and disputes over technological contracts; and helped improve the markets for merchandise, funds and technologies. In 1993, Jiangxi had handled 26,086 cases of this category, accounting for 68 percent of the total number of cases handled. Many of the cases were of a new variety. With the rapid development of the reform program in China and the legislature lagging hind, the courts in various localities extensively conducted investigation and studies, continuously summed up their experiences, and followed the basic principle that they applied laws whenever there were laws in this connection. They applied the policy whenever there are no laws or regulations in this connection. They acted in accordance with the basic principle of the law when both the law and the policy in this connection were not so clear. We persistently handled cases in accordance with the principle of the "three conducive's." 3) We properly handled cases concerning the development of rural economy. In 1993, Jiangxi had handled 2,161 cases involving disputes over the rural contract system, up 3.4 percent over 1992. At the same time, we had also handled a large number of economic disputes among rural enterprises. By means of various adjudicative activities, we had safeguarded the household contract responsibility system, helped rural enterprises improve their management and invigorated the rural economy in an overall manner. In order to keep pace with the new situation in economic development and satisfy the growing needs for the judicial sector to serve the market economy, the people's courts at various levels had improved their services and their work, and provided legal consultations for the development of economic construction. They adopted the following measures: 1. They carried out specialized judicial work in coordination with the macro-control. They took the initiative to help the financial sector collect its loans in accordance with law, support the tax authorities to levy taxes and assist the land office and the transportation department to collect necessary fees. They also helped the various enterprises clear up their debts, assisted people settle their economic disputes, and helped maintain the normal economic order. 2. They simplified the litigation procedure and raise their efficiency in handling cases. They vigorously carried out their mediation work, provided supervision and ensured that all legal procedures were properly followed. They made efforts to reduce some unnecessary steps in lawsuit. In 1993, 69.1 percent of the cases involving economic disputes were concluded through mediation. The various basic-level people's courts handled 12,011 cases involving simple economic disputes. 3. They took the initiative to provide legal services in various enterprises and economic departments at the latter's doorsteps. They sometimes set up liaison offices or send out tribunals to help enterprises and the departments concerned clear up their debts, settle economic disputes, become more competitive on the market, train people to handle legal affairs, run business in accordance with law. Their measures taken were warmly praised by the enterprises and the departments concerned. III. Correctly and Properly Handle Civil and Administrative Cases; and Protect legal Rights and Interests of citizens, Legal Persons and Other Organizations in Accordance With Law To protect the legal rights and interests of citizens and legal persons from encroachment is an important aspect of socialist democracy and the legal system. To correctly and timely handle civil and administrative cases is of great significance in maintaining social stability, promoting production and developing spiritual civilization. Civil rights are basic rights of the citizens and legal persons. With more changes taking place in society and people's mind and with the rapid development of the market economy, contacts among the people have become closer, and there are more civil cases for the people's courts to handle. Particularly with the continuous development of the legal relations in civil affairs, the number of cases involving properties and individual rights and interests is on the increase every year. The work in handling civil cases has become more closely related with economic construction, especially with the development of the market economy. In 1993, Jiangxi had concluded 66,521 civil cases of the first instance, up 32.1 percent over 1992. It had placed emphasis on handling civil cases of the following categories: 1) It handled many civil cases involving marriage and family problems. For many years in the past, the number of divorce cases ranked top among all the civil cases handled. In 1993, Jiangxi had concluded 23,252 cases of this category. With the changes of the people's concept on marriage, family and property, not only the number of divorce cases is increasing, there are more problems in dividing properties, child-care and housing allotment. The people's courts properly handled divorce cases in strict accordance with the Marriage Law, and helped strengthen the socialist system about marriage and family. 2) It energetically handled trials concerning liabilities, real estate and labor disputes. With the vigorous development of the reform and opening-up program and the booming economic activities within the nongovernment sector, there were increasing number of disputes concerning debts, real estate and labor. In 1993, Jiangxi had concluded 13,172 cases concerning debts, 894 cases on houses and 465 cases involving labor disputes. By handling trials of these categories, the people's courts had made the money, real estate and labor markets flourish. 3) It had properly handled civil cases involving disputes on land, forest, water conservancy, ownership of or the rights to use plots for housing projects. In 1993, Jiangxi concluded 330 cases of this category. Most of these cases were in the rural areas. They directly affected production and livelihood of the masses, and at times, problems became quite serious. By properly handling such cases, the people's courts had timely solved the problems, eliminated the factors of instability, helped maintain social stability in rural areas and promoted agricultural production. The trial of administrative cases is an important step in developing the socialist democratic politics. Since the official enactment of the "Administrative Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China" on 1 October 1990, the work of administrative trials has entered a new stage in Jiangxi. The number of administrative lawsuits was on the increase every year, and the scope of litigation is continuously expanding. In 1993, Jiangxi had handled 805 administrative cases, up 21.9 percent over 1992. It had concluded 786 cases in which the ruling of the administrative organization was upheld in 33 percent of the cases, annulled in 20 percent of the cases, and changed in 2.2 percent of the cases. The plaintiffs withdrew suits in 35.8 percent of the cases. In addition, 1,744 cases were handled involving a total amount of 2.43 million yuan, whereas administrative organs had requested that judgements be forcibly executed. In the course of handling administrative lawsuits, the people's courts not only protected, in accordance with law, the legal interests of the citizens and legal persons and other organizations, but also helped and supervised the administrative organs to exercise their functions and powers. They mainly paid attention to the following tasks: 1. They strengthened their efforts in handling cases involving enterprises' autonomy in management, preventing others from infringing upon the rights of the enterprises, safeguarding their market share and interests and helping them change the way they operate. 2. They strengthened their efforts in handling cases which involved land, industrial and commercial administration, taxation, finance, foreign exchange, commodity price and technological supervision and management, and in maintaining order for market competition. Meanwhile, they thwarted improper actions of the administrative organizations and other illegal administrative measures which undermined the economy, punished the enterprises without the proper authority, indiscriminately meting out punishments, recklessly set up roadblocks, collected excessive fees, and illegally increase peasants' burdens. 3. They strengthened their efforts in handling cases which involved public security, shelter and surveillance, re-education through labor and infringement of citizens' rights. They protected, in accordance with law, the interests of the citizens; eliminated the sense of antagonism between the administrative organizations and the public; and reduced the factors of social instability. 4. They strengthened their efforts in handling cases whereas the administrative organs had requested that judgments be executed by force, supported administrative organs in carrying out their work and help them maintain their administrative authority. Cases involving the execution of administrative orders often aroused major public interests, involved the overall situation of state administration, and directly affected economic construction and social stability. In handing cases of this category, the people's courts had persistently followed the principle of being vigorous, reliable and safe. They not only dared to help administrative organs implement their orders, but also carried out a great deal of publicity, re-education and persuasion work to help ease contradictions. During the past year, Jiangxi had steadily and continuously extended their legal services in handling administrative lawsuits. However, the system of administrative lawsuits had not been established too long, the people's courts were still unfamiliar with lawsuits of this category, and some of the judicial cadres who handle such cases still showed sentiments of fearing difficulties. Therefore, to further study, popularize and implement the Law of Administrative Procedure remains an important task in the near future. The people's courts at various levels are earnestly summing up their experiences, overcoming difficulties, continuously improving the environment in enforcing this law and marching forward in handling administrative lawsuits. IV. Rely on Judicial Work, Actively Improve All Facets of Public Security in Society To improve all facets of public security in the society is a basic policy in maintaining a lasting order in our country. It also represents a basic principle of Chinese characteristics in doing our judicial work. In handling trials of all types over the past year, the people's courts at various levels throughout the country paid attention to performing their functions well in carrying out their judicial work, and energetically improved all the facets of public security in society. They mainly performed the following duties: 1) They persistently held open trials, gave widespread publicity to the socialist legal system and called on people to observe discipline and abide by laws. The courts in the province held a total 465 rallies to announce judgments with a total audience of 3.12 million people in the last year. 2) In the course of dealing with the lawsuits, they also made judicial suggestions. When they tried cases of various categories, they discovered that some departments and units had many loopholes and problems in their management system. In light of these loopholes and problems, they made judicial suggestions. In 1993, Jiangxi had made 3,576 judicial suggestions, a great majority of which were accepted by the units concerned. It had attained remarkable social effects. 3) They strengthened their work for juvenile courts. They meted out appropriate penalties on young criminals, while protecting the legal rights and interests of the juvenile delinquents. Meanwhile some juvenile courts also sponsored study classes and parents' schools to educate juvenile delinquents by persuasion and prevent them from committing crimes again. 4) Proceeding from the desire to reform juvenile delinquents and prevent them from committing crimes once again, they often reduced their sentences, put them on probation or released them on parole in accordance with law. In 1993, Jiangxi reduced sentences in 6,490 cases, released 553 juvenile delinquents on parole and put 1,888 of them on probation, accounting for 15 percent of the total number of delinquents. A system was set up in many localities to visit juvenile delinquents on probation or parole after they were released. The juvenile courts also coordinated with the departments concerned and the basic-level organizations to help those on parole or probation to reform and educate themselves. 5) They carried out their mass work well inside and outside the courts, and correctly used legal means to solve various kinds of contradictions. The people's courts at various levels paid full attention to enhancing social stability; implemented the policy of correctly handling the contradictions among the people; and used this policy to guide their judicial work. The civil and administrative lawsuits involve many aspects and are closely related with the masses. Through these civil and administrative cases, the people's courts understood the situation in the community well, made preparations way ahead to help various departments concerned solve various contradictions and problems. In handling civil and administrative lawsuits, the people's courts in the province continued to uphold the principle of conducting mediation to solve disputes, always tried to reason things with both parties in dispute and helped them to accommodate each other and reach agreement on their own accord, to end their disputes and to avoid the accumulation of contradictions.
