The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song sent an historic letter for the ultimate solution of the rural question under the banner of the socialist rural theses to the National Agricultural Meeting and personally attended the meeting to encourage the agricultural workers. The respected and beloved leader's letter is a program of socialist rural construction of our times and a militant banner that makes it possible to develop our country's rural economic work to a higher level. Agricultural workers and other people, bearing deep in their hearts the great glory of receiving the programmatic work that indicates the future road of socialist rural construction, are turning out in the struggle to implement it. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's historic letter consummates the theoretical and practical matters for finally solving the rural question, the most difficult question in socialist construction, by dynamically accelerating rural construction along the road indicated by the rural theses. The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: If we consolidate the position we have already taken up and launch a new battle by making more strenuous efforts, we will win a historic victory in the solution of the rural question, the most difficult question in the building of socialism. Whether we finally solve the rural question under socialism or not is an important matter that affects the future of socialism. Through their long struggle to implement the great rural theses, our party and people have already solved basic problems in socialist rural construction. We are on a high peak that affords the prospect of ultimate solution of the rural question. This is a great victory won by our party and people in their historic struggle for socialism and communism. The tasks of consolidating the position we have already taken up and ultimately solving the rural question in the near future lie ahead. The work clearly indicates the road for intensifying and developing the three revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- will give more assistance to the rural areas, and will promote the overall rural economic work to meet the high demands of socialist rural construction. Every system and content of the work embodies our party's firm will to complete, under all circumstances, the historic task for the ultimate solution of the rural question set forth in the socialist rural theses. Accordingly, the work is a guideline with which our party and people must persistently keep up in their struggle to protect, adhere to, and develop the our-style socialist cause. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's historic work, for the ultimate solution of the rural question under the banner of the socialist rural theses, has a great theoretical and practical meaning in our people's revolutionary struggle and the implementation of the overall socialist cause. The work, above all, is a militant banner that instills into the minds of our people and agricultural workers the conviction of the might of the chuche-based system of the socialist rural economy and the invincibility of our-style socialism and that powerfully encouraged them in the work for consolidation and development. Our country's rural economic system set forth by the great leader is a superior rural economic system under which agricultural workers become masters of production and management and which continues to develop based on the principle of collectivism. We have not witnessed a more superior and advanced rural economic system anywhere in the world. In the course of struggle to implement the rural theses, the feature of our rural areas has changed a great deal and our rural economic system has been strengthened and developed in every domain of politics, economy, and culture to the maximum. The work proudly summed up the decisive victory won during the course of accelerating the three revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- changes in farmers' material and cultural life, and achievements in managing and operating cooperative farms. It also displayed the might and superiority of our rural economic system. In this way, the work powerfully demonstrated that our socialist rural economic system is the one that provides free and creative life to the working people and is a superior system that makes it possible to push ahead with the tasks to assimilate farmers into the working class and industrializing agriculture. From the work, we have come to learn a precious truth that the chuche-oriented socialist road lead by our party is the only road to the agricultural workers' true sense of life, happiness, victory, and glory. The great leader's work is a highly important guideline in effecting a new revolutionary turn in our rural economy and in all sectors of agricultural production. A difficult and enormous task of an unprecedented scale is set for the field of socialist rural construction today. We are carrying out the task of rural construction on a high stage in an acute confrontation with the enemies. The work sets forth the principles, specific tasks, and method for the successful acceleration of this task. The work comprehensively sets forth the struggle guidelines reflecting the new demands of the construction of our rural areas, such as the guideline on vigorously conducting ideological work for the agricultural working people and imbue them with a mind toward revolution, the working-class, socialism, and the chuche idea; the guideline on enhancing the technological and cultural standard of the agricultural working people in conformity with the demand of intellectualizing the entire society; and the guideline on realizing the industrialization and modernization of agriculture on a high level. In particular, the guideline on intensifying the party's guidance in socialist rural construction is of important significance in building the socialist rural base firmly politically, ideologically, and in terms of class. If the tasks set forth in the work are thoroughly implemented, the socialist rural construction will bring forth a new revolutionary upturn, vigorously accelerating the complete victory of socialism. The great leader's work is also an immortal classic work that further developed and enriched the revolutionary theory of the working class on socialist-communist construction with new and original contents. Solving the socialist rural problem is a creative work which no one has ever carried out. The great leader clearly saw through the future of our rural areas with his wisdom of second sight and scientific insight and put forth original ideology and theory for the ultimate solution of the rural problem, thus breaking new ground for the development of the revolutionary theory of the working class. In particular, the great leader comprehensively elucidated in this work the principles, the method, and the timing of transferring cooperative ownership to all-people ownership. This is of important significance in the development of the revolutionary theory on rural construction. Thanks to the theories put forth in the work -- such as the theory on creating the condition for transferring cooperative ownership to all-people ownership, the theory on carrying on this work by county as a unit, and the theory on correctly establishing the form and method of transferring cooperative ownership to all-people ownership -- the way to solve the rural problem ultimately without the slightest deviation has been made available. The great leader's work has now become a powerful weapon to crush the imperialists' sophism that socialism cannot solve the rural problem and the opportunist trend which excludes the revolutionary principles of the working class in rural construction. The justness and truthfulness of the ideology, theories, and guidelines put forth in the work will be thoroughly demonstrated in our practice of socialist construction which vigorously advances crushing the antisocialist maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries. We should wage a vigorous struggle to effect new upsurge in socialist rural construction upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's programmatic work, "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural Problem Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Thesis." All party members and working people should, above all, intensively study and assimilate the profound ideology and theory contained in the great leader's work. Important here is to deeply learn the wisdom of the leadership of the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the greatness of his achievements. The great leader attached great importance to the problem of peasants and agriculture long ago and has made energetic efforts for its solution, and has led all sorts of work, large and small, arising in the development of rural economy. The work sums up the great leader's guidelines of rural construction, which he put forth and verified their might, and comprehensively incorporates the grand idea of rural construction which the leader [suryong] formulated. We should deeply cherish the great pride in accelerating socialist rural construction under the leadership of the great party and the leader [suryong]. All the functionaries and working people of the agricultural sector should deeply study the work in close connection with the specific reality of their county, their farm, and their work team, so that they can further deepen the work of adding luster to the great leader's leadership achievements. To thoroughly implement the task presented in the work it is important for all the people and agricultural working people to firmly believe in the superiority of the chuche-oriented socialist rural economic system and the correctness of our party's socialist rural construction program. Historic lessons of socialist construction teaches that defending socialism results in victory and renouncing it brings about death in rural areas. We should have the firm faith that the popular masses-centered socialism of our own style is the best and make all possible efforts to safeguard, defend, and glorify these noble gains. At the same time, we should implement our party's great rural construction program with the firm faith that we can realize without fail any difficult tasks in rural construction due to the single-hearted unity of our people around the party and the leader [suryong] and the mighty self-reliant national economy, which has the chuche-oriented industries as its pillar. Further deepening and developing the three revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- in conformity with the demands of the new high stage of socialist rural construction is one of the important tasks presented in the work. We should define the ideological revolution as a most important and indispensable requirement for safeguarding, defending, and consummating the socialist cause and should vigorously wage ideological work among the agricultural working people. We should conduct in-depth indoctrination in the chuche idea by closely combining it with the indoctrination in the party's policy, the indoctrination in the revolutionary traditions, the indoctrination in socialist patriotism, and many other forms of ideological work, while putting primary emphasis on the indoctrination in the principle of the chuche idea. In particular, we should concentrate greater efforts on strengthening the indoctrination in class and the indoctrination in collectivism. By strengthening the cultural revolution in rural areas we should constantly enhance the technological and cultural level of the agricultural working people, should thoroughly establish their tidiness in production and life, and should do away with the disparity in the conditions of their cultural life between urban and rural areas. The task that we should carry out in the field of the rural technological revolution is vast. We should further consolidate the success in irrigation, electrification, mechanization, and chemicalization that has already been achieved and should further expand and develop it so that we can constantly enhance the level of industrialization and modernization of agriculture. In particular, we should develop the comprehensive mechanization and chemicalization of the rural economy into a high level. Along with this, we should develop agricultural science, actively utilize its success, and thoroughly implement our party's chuche-oriented farm method. Thus, we should make agricultural production more scientific. To carry out the difficult and vast tasks arising in socialist rural construction today it is important to strengthen urban support for rural areas. We should further enhance the working class' revolutionary spirit, organizational spirit, and cultural level and, thus, should see to it that the working class further strengthen their leadership role in rural construction. At the same time, we should guarantee by all means industrial material and technological support for the rural economy. All industrial sectors should give priority to producing and supplying fuel, energy, equipment, and materials required in agricultural production and rural construction in conformity with the demands of our party's agriculture-first policy. We should brilliantly carry out the historic task of eliminating the disparity between industry and agriculture in economic management activities and of gradually converting ownership by cooperative into ownership by all of the people on the basis of the success gained in the three revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural. Practical experiences in our country clearly show that the party's leadership becomes the lifeline of socialist rural construction and overall socialist construction. All party organizations should pay deep attention to rural problems and vigorously organize and mobilize party members and the working people into the struggle to implement our party's great rural construction program. All rural party organizations should substantially carry out the work of deeply explaining and inculcating among party members and the agricultural working people the profound ideologies and theories elucidated by the great leader in his work. An infinitely bright vista is being opened for our socialist rural construction. We have the most correct socialist rural construction program and the wise leadership of the party and the leader [suryong]. Let all of us vigorously advance for the final solution of the socialist rural problem and for the victory of socialism of our own style by upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's historic letter and with the overflowing faith in victory.
