They must have a fine workstyle, maintain strict discipline, and be assured of adequate logistical support" -- set forth by Jiang Zemin, chairman of the Central Military Commission, so as to raise army building among grass-roots units to a new level. Chi Haotian said: These remarks were made by Comrade Jiang Zemin when he spoke at the All-Army military work conference at the end of 1990. They embody Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on army building in the new period; reflect the objective law governing army building among grass-roots units; spell out the basic condition our Army must have in order to fulfill its historical mission in the new period; and represent the general call for strengthening army building made by the party Central Committee -- the third generation leading collective -- with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and is also a general call for strengthening army building among grass-roots units. Chi Haotian said: The whole Army should use these "five-point remarks" by Jiang Zemin to standardize and guide army building among basic-level units; they should also use them to unify their thinking and guide their work. The masses of cadres and soldiers, especially leading cadres at various levels, should understand them clearly and act upon them consciously. Every grass-root unit should do its work in observance of the requirements set forth by these remarks. In this way, the process of army building among grass-roots units will become a process of implementing requirements. He pointed out: To fulfill these requirements, it is necessary to do a great deal of hard and meticulous work on a long-term basis. Leading organs at all levels and every grass-roots unit must be prepared to perform first-grade tasks and build first-class companies, to create a situation in which everyone suggests ways and means for company building and performs meritorious deeds for the company; to build more and better companies; and to nurture outstanding soldiers. Chi Haotian pointed out: In doing their work, Army grass-roots units should act upon the requirements -- "arming people with scientific theories, guiding people with correct public opinion, fostering people with a noble spirit, and inspiring people with outstanding literary works" -- set forth by Comrade Jiang Zemin; focus on the fundamental task of training soldiers who cherish lofty ideals and moral integrity, and who are well educated and self- disciplined; and strengthen the building of spiritual civilization by concentrating on raising the ideological and moral quality of officers and men. Leading cadres at all levels must take the lead in studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; arm themselves with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his thought on army building in the new period; conduct extensive education on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism among army units; bear in mind the Army's purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly; be firm in their ideals and faith; and foster a revolutionary outlook on life and values. Leading cadres should launch activities to learn from heroes and models like Lei Feng, Su Ning, and Xu Honggang, and strive to practice and disseminate new socialist morality and customs. In building spiritual civilization, leading cadres should take the lead in setting an example and strive to influence and promote, with their good images, the building of spiritual civilization among Army units.
