FR941028-2-00107 FR941028-2-00074 [Finance Docket No. 32594] Pioneer Railcorp_Continuance in Control Exemption_Vandalia Railroad Company Pioneer Railcorp (Pioneer), a noncarrier holding company, has filed a notice of exemption to acquire control, through stock purchase, of Vandalia Railroad Company, a class III rail carrier that leases and operates a former Illinois Central Gulf Railroad line, between milepost 689.83 and milepost 692.54, a distance of 2.71 miles, in Vandalia, Fayette County, IL. Pioneer owns and controls six other nonconnecting class III rail carriers: West Jersey Railroad Co., operating in New Jersey; Fort Smith Railroad Co., operating in Arkansas; Alabama Railroad Co., operating in Alabama; Mississippi Central Railroad Co. (formerly Natchez Trace Railroad), operating in Mississippi and Tennessee; Alabama & Florida Railway Co., operating in Alabama; and Decatur Junction Railway Co., operating in Illinois. 1 1 Pioneer's control of these carriers was the subject of a notice of exemption in Pioneer Railcorp._Continuance in Control Exemption_Decatur Terminal Railway Co., Finance Docket No. 32367 (ICC served Oct. 18, 1993). (That decision incorrectly referred to Decatur Junction Railway Co. as Decatur Terminal Railway Co.) Pioneer states that: (1) the properties operated by these carriers do not connect each other; (2) the continuance in control is not a part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect the railroads with each other or any other railroad in their corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier. The transaction therefore is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. See 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2). As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions set forth in New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist., 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979). Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Donald G. Avery, Slover & Loftus, 1224 Seventeenth Street NW., Washington, DC 20036. Decided: October 21, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26780 Filed 10&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
