FR940902-0-00021 FR940902-0-00008 40 CFR Part 300 [FRL&hyph;5063&hyph;5] National Oil and Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan; National Priorities List Update AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of Deletion of the Revere Textile Prints Corporation Site from the National Priorities List. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announces the deletion of the Revere Textile Prints Corporation Superfund Site in Sterling, Connecticut from the National Priorities List (NPL). The NPL is Appendix B of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan (NCP), which EPA promulgated pursuant to Section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended. EPA and the State of Connecticut have determined that all appropriate Fund-financed response under CERCLA has been implemented and that no further response is appropriate. Moreover, EPA and the State of Connecticut have determined that remedial actions conducted under CERCLA at the site to date have been protective of public health, welfare, and the environment. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dennis Gagne, Remedial Project Manager, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, John F. Kennedy Federal Building, Boston, Massachusetts 02203, (617) 573&hyph;9660. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The site to be deleted from the NPL is: The Revere Textile Prints Corporation Superfund Site. A Notice of Intent to Delete for this site was published March 1, 1994 (59 FR 9742). The closing date for comments on the Notice of Intent to Delete was March 31, 1994. EPA received no comments. EPA identifies sites which appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and it maintains the NPL as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of Hazardous Substance Superfund (Fund-) financed remedial actions. Pursuant to NCP section 300.425(e)(3), any site deleted from the NPL remains eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions in the unlikely event that conditions at the site warrant such action. Deletion of a site from the NPL does not affect responsible party liability or impede agency efforts to recover costs associated with response efforts.
