Take notice that Northern Natural Gas Company (Northern), on September 30, 1994, tendered for filing changes in its FERC Gas Tariff, Fifth Revised Volume No. 1. Northern states that the filing establishes the direct bill amounts by shipper resulting from the Second Reverse Auction pursuant to the Reverse Auction Cost Recovery Mechanism established in Northern's Global Settlement. Therefore Northern has filed Second Revised Sheet No. 68 to reflect these amounts in its Tariff and will commence billing such amounts effective November 1, 1994. Northern states that copies of this filing were served upon the company's customers and interested State Commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.211 and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before October 12, 1994. All protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate proceeding, but will not serve to make protestant a party to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
