The indefinite strike it embarked upon is in its third day. Jean-Claude Franck Medome toured the streets of Libreville this afternoon and has this report. [Medome] This afternoon, Libreville looked like a ghost town. The reason for this is that cabs were hard to find. Cab drivers, who are usually victims of stone-throwing and attacks, preferred to be cautious. This caution is all the more justified because the atmosphere in Libreville varied from suburb to suburb. There was precarious calm in certain areas and persistent tension in others. This is abundant proof that the security forces still have their hands full. The security forces have not only reinforced their positions in areas prone to violence but have also removed the stone, wood, and tire barricades. Furthermore, the Gabonese are worried and surprised by the disturbances and excesses, which started out as a legitimate general strike to call for salary increase [words indistinct] what the future holds. There are other concerns and questions surrounding the number of victims of the disturbances. It has been officially announced that at least four people have died. Two of them were burned alive. It is, however, possible that more people died in the maze of the streets of certain suburbs. It should be pointed out that during the destruction of the National Lumberjacks' Rally [RNB] radio station by security forces, six persons including (Mba Ndakele), political adviser to the RNB leader, and (Andre Heyegei), who is in charge of security, were arrested and are still in police custody. [Paris AFP in French in a Libreville-datelined item at 2010 GMT on 23 February adds the following: "State television, quoting leaders of the security forces' crisis committee, has announced that a senior corporal paratrooper in the Gabonese Army was shot dead this afternoon in Libreville during disturbances which have been going on in several popular suburbs in Libreville over the past three days. ["State television, quoting leaders of the crisis committee also announced that the residence of the leading opposition leader, Father Paul Mba Abessole, RNB chairman, was occupied in the early evening by security forces who were chasing several `armed Lumberjack activists.' An opposition spokesman told AFP that Father Abessole was not at home at the time of the operation and was not arrested. ["It was announced on state television that Father Abessole `is in good health.' It was also announced that `some people were wounded but no one died' during this operation."]
