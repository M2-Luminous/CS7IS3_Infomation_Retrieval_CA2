They may be the only members of the secret military organization to escape imprisonment. They were able to reach a "safe haven" after five months of transiting through Arab and foreign countries. They are now members of the (opposition) National Front for the Salvation of Libya, which they said has had a plan of internal action to bring down the regime and "establish a constitutional democratic alternative" since 1992. The officers, whom AL-HAYAH interviewed in a Scandanavian country, were preparing their departure for another destination, as other opposition members--also Front members--were doing; for them, exile consists of constantly changing locales. What are the facts about the "uprising," the arrests, the secret military organization, and their connection to the Salvation Front? Why do most of the detainees belong to the Warfallah tribe? How was the organization's plan discovered? How did the officers manage to flee Libya? The officers answered these and other questions as follows: Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Muhammad Bashir Salih, 36, was born in Bani Walid. He joined the army in 1978, and was trained in Yugoslavia and Russia. He says that since 1988 he had considered playing a role for change and joined the secret military organization led by Major 'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir in 1991 after the latter told him about it. Salih says that "the Libyan situation is what dictated this course of action to me. We have no state, no institutions, no laws, nor a constitution. Our wealth is being wasted by the leaders of this regime, and the army, which supposedly is based on discipline, following orders, abilities, and a clear objective, is the state's protection. At first, its role was reduced to protecting the regime; then it shrank even further, to suit the interests of guard regiments such as the Deterrent Force and the 9th Brigade, because the regime does not trust its own people. So the units of these regiments are controlled by officers of the al-Qadhadhifah tribe. Warfallah Speaking of the role of the Warfallah tribe in the military mutiny, especially as it is known to support the Libyan regime, Maj. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir, 38, of Bani Walid, has this to say: "Contrary to popular belief, the Warfallah tribe was not with our tribe (170,000 persons), which is large and scattered throughout all the regions of Libya. Traditionally, it has protected the al-Qadhadhifah from raids. It gave them their land in Surt. If you mean the members of the Revolutionary Committees, why, every tribe has its upstarts or opportunists, so this is not surprising." He explained that "even if most of those taking part in military action were Warfallah, that does not mean that other tribes did not take part. A quick look at the names of the detainees shows that they come from every tribe and region. Plus the fact that the objective of the action was not narrow or strictly `Warfalli' in its principles. The proof is that as military officers we all agreed to hand power over to a civilian, in the event our movement succeeded. That civilian would have been Dr. Muhammad al-Muqaryif, and he is not from the Warfallah." Captain Salim Dabnun Muhammad al-Wa'ir, 31, is from Bani Walid, and says that the Warfallah "is a tribe scattered through Tripoli, Misratah, Banghazi, Surt, Sabha, and the south. No Libyan regime can stand against it. The present regime has sought aid from a group of opportunists and chosen them to be what is called an authority, a resource for finding a tribal deterrent for it. It has succeeded in this to a great extent, even though the tribe has been hurt more than anyone." Lt. Col. Salih says that "the city of Bani Walid has stayed the way it is since the Turks left it. It has no water system, no good roads, nor an infrastructure." The Secret Organization How was the secret military organization established? Capt. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir says that he was first responsible for the idea of an organization, "and following my graduation in 1980 the army was assigning tasks whose objectives were unknown. We fought in Chad and Uganda. I lived in Lebanon from 1987 with the volunteers' set-up for the victory of what were called national and Islamic forces, and helping Palestinian organizations. In December 1988, I returned to Libya and proposed the idea of this organization to a group of officers. There were five of us. Then I went back to Lebanon in 1990 and met Col. Mustafa Bil-Qasim in an Arab country, and told him about the organization. We agreed that he would work in one fashion, and I would work in another, in total secrecy. I went back to Libya at the end of 1991 and completed the structure of the organization, which now had 10 men. I believe that the number of members in Mustafa's organization was comparable to our number." Lt. Col. Salih explains, "'Abd-al-Salam studied matters carefully before choosing members. He nominated me in 1990 for organization membership; my comrades were put under surveillance, then 1991 brought my intention and my proper role. I agreed immediately and enthusiastically, because I had patriotic feelings, but order was lacking in the organization. I was not afraid at all, because someone who is afraid cannot think of action anyway, and will look for the easy way out." Capt. Salim al-Wa'ir says, "I graduated from public high school in 1983 and was surprised to find that my official course was to join the army, because in Libya they choose your future career. I left in 1985 and was assigned to Bani Walid in a marine battalion, then I was transferred to the Republican Guard brigade, which has been assigned to guarding the regime since 1986, and I remained part of it until I left Libya. In 1988, I learned of the organization's order from 'Abd-al-Salam, and I gave my consent immediately, especially since a passion for change burned in my heart--against corruption, bribery, domination, control, the absence of institutions, and the perversion of the very concept of government." The three officers agree that they would hold no extended meetings, only brief encounters in a car or one of their houses; there were never more than three persons present at any one meeting. Any talk of politics was forbidden. They had excellent relations with those known for their loyalty to the regime, in order to dispel any suspicion. Salih says, "'Abd-al-Salam told us to coordinate with other organizations--some of us had no knowledge that these organizations even existed." The "Salvation Front" 'Abd-al-Salam says that in 1992 he told Col. Bil-Qasim of the need to open a channel of communication with the National Front for the Salvation of Libya abroad, "because it was the one effective faction, and news of it reached us through smuggled newspapers or broadcasts, and because its members were known in Libya for their honesty and ability, and I agreed to this. "I began to get indirect contacts, from which we understood that the Front had linked up with domestic military action." He continues: "In 1993, a third organization, headed up by Col. Miftah Qarrum Fakkallah (who suffers from leukemia), joined the first two, and one of the members of this organization, Maj. Khalil al-Jidak, surprised Col. Bil-Qasim by broaching this subject with him, of joining the organization, then the picture cleared up and we became three organizations with nearly equal memberships, with a broad network of relations with ranking officers, civilians, and technocrats. We agreed to intensify our contacts with the Front, to speed up our action. Al-Jidak opened up a major liaison channel, and another channel through our brother Sa'd Misbah, who was living in Spain. There were meetings in Europe in which al-Jidak and Qarrum took part with the Front leadership." Salim al-Wa'ir says, "The option of an agreement with the Front gave us added comfort and strength. We saw in their partnership the only solution for the success of our movement, because of their capabilities and their international connections. They were also the strongest faction pursuing the objective of toppling the regime by any means. They rejected dialogue with the regime despite all inducements." Salih believes that "the regime's attacks on the Front and its leaders made us even more intent on cooperating with them. The slanderous attacks on Dr. al-Muqaryif made us even more eager to cooperate with him, despite the constant defamation to which he was subjected. We have a folk saying in Libya that goes, `You cannot hide sunshine with a sieve.'" The Goal of the Operation 'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir continues: "After numerous contacts and meetings, a plan of action was agreed upon, to be implemented by spring 1994 at the latest. I agreed with Bil-Qasim and Qarrum on the broad lines of the plan to topple the regime and the transitional period. There was one goal: to overturn the ruling regime and proclaim the establishment of a constitutional, democratic state, to keep the transitional period short, between two and three years, and that the head of state be a civilian during that period. We all agreed to select Dr. Muhammad Yusuf al-Muqaryif for that job. We also agreed to delegate responsibilities among ourselves during the transitional period, in light of the practical contributions of the groups and persons. Our intention was also linked to the need to seek the assistance of all patriotic and specialized technical elements, especially those not deeply involved in the practices of the current ruling regime." Salih indicates that the choice of a civilian to head the government "served the interests of Libya best of all, because we saw the transitional period as the most delicate in the process of eliminating the regime. It would bring the country back to a new starting point. If we did not proceed on systematic, civilized bases, we might have borne the responsibility for losing Libya another year." The "Elimination" Operation Capt. Salim reveals that the members of the organization planned out a "communique number one" and a plan of action for zero hour, without specifying a clear time, pending the completion of contacts and preparations. He says that the plan required "rapid, lightning-fast action in Tripoli, and from there to neighboring large cities, particularly as those belonging to the organizations ordered basic battalions who had ammunition and advanced weapons. Under their command were individuals of proven courage and experience. The units would move in Tripoli, Banghazi, Misratah (120 km from Tripoli), Tarhunah (80 km), Sabratah (60 km), and Gharyan (80 km). The targets were the command headquarters at Bab al-'Aziziyah, the intelligence department, the Jamahiriyah Security Commission, and centers of guard brigade concentrations. But the regime discovered the operation, and we considered speeding it up, to implement it on 15 October. However, the arrests and confrontations began on 12 October, which led to the outcome, which is known." The Regime's Indications How did the officers know that the regime had discovered the operation? In 'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir's words, "there were several actions on the part of the regime that indicated they knew something about the military organization. Such as: stepped-up surveillance of military men, the assignment of new men into the units, and the consolidation of security units the regime most depended upon (the Deterrent, the Guards, and the 9th Brigade) headed up by Lt. Col. Mas'ud 'Abd-al-Hafiz, commander of the staff of the guard; he was appointed chief of staff. The crossing points on our borders with Egypt and Tunisia were reviewed. Security passes for the military were revoked, a brigade of the guards was transferred to Bani Walid, the intelligence chief Maj. al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi made a tour of the eastern regions, and Colonel al-Qadhdhafi met with relatives of his among former officers in Sabha. They were resident in Misratah, and he formed them into committees, because, as al-Qadhdhafi told them--the first cell of the revolution--in his speech in September 1993, "no one can play with the lion in his mouth." Then there was the meeting of the intelligence director in Tripoli, Jum'ah Bin-Niran, with security officers, in which he told them that al-Qadhdhafi's words indicated there was a conspiracy inside the army, and the movement of military units to agricultural projects." Capt. Salim says, "We felt uneasy, and we understood that a counter-plot was being prepared to thwart ours. We contacted the second organization, and its leader confirmed that his group had not been penetrated, nor had the third." 'Abd-al-Salam explains his belief that the penetration may have occurred in the organization "which had recently joined us because the arrests had concentrated on its members, in one swoop." Perhaps "the regime got some information about the action from a foreign source I didn't know about, or maybe there was some mistake that led to some information leak. Anyway, we did not retreat--we thought about moving up the appointed day, to 15 October." The Arrests Lt. Col. Salih says, "On 12 October, military intelligence arrested Col. Miftah Qarrum, Col. Mustafa Bil-Qasim, Maj. 'Ali al-Kakali, Maj. Khalil al-Jidak, Maj. Ramadan al-'Iyhawri, and others. A lieutenant colonel was arrested in al-Kufrah and another in Gharyan, a major in Zuwarah along with nearly 20 civilians. There were some confrontations with officers during the arrests, and some other units moved in some barracks, commanded by officers from the organization when they heard of the regime's movements toward them, and when they learned of the arrests. Other units blew up an ammunitions dump in Bani Walid, which is where the most violent clashes took place. International wire services described these as "the Bani Walid incidents" or "the Bani Walid mutiny." How They Fled How did they escape from Libya? Salih says, "I cannot tell the whole story, because it would endanger many people. I stayed in Tripoli for two days, then left via a neighboring country, by land, and from there to another Arab country. There I learned that Libyan intelligence had asked its officers to turn me over, but they refused. Then I met with 'Abd-al-Salam and Salim on a Mediterranean trip, and we headed for Europe together." He explained that the authorities arrested his brother, a father of five, the last of whom, named 'Abd-al-Fattah, had been born only one month previous. 'Abd-al-Salam and Salim escaped together. They say, "On the morning of 12 October, we got a telephone call from someone we knew, speaking cautiously, in code, which led us to phone an officer in the organization to warn him, or find out his fate. We went quickly to the homes of some of the organization members, and found intelligence vehicles in front of the homes. Then we went to a person we wanted to ask about, and we found his neighbors and members of his family in a state of anxiety and confusion, and we realized then that the operation was over." They add: "Fortunately, our organization had not been penetrated, for the arrests continued for nearly two months. We thought of leaving Libya, though, on the same day of the arrests. We left with only the clothes on our backs, personal sidearms, and our passports, and crossed the border of a neighboring country with no problem. Our names had not yet been flashed to the control posts. From that country we moved on to an African country, then an Arab country, then a Mediterranean country. There we met Lt. Col. Salih, and all left for a European country." The three officers say that "God is supreme. This was our fate. We did all we could so that truth may prevail. Now, today, we are members of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya, in which we found our brothers-in-arms and in honorable citizenship, and they are all among the finest of Libya's citizens." Officers' Trials 'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir has this to say about the recent trials of the organization's officers, which were shown on Libyan television, in which the officers said that they were spying for America: "This is a scenario we knew about even before it was shown on television. No one in Libya is fooled by it. Those are honorable officers, and their history is well known. If we were agents, we were agents for Libya." He adds: "And the trials--anyone who followed them saw the clear contradiction in the prosecutors' claims and questions. One minute they accused us of wanting to spy against Arab unity; this is an innovation that occurs only in Libya and on Libyan television. The next minute they said we were spying on the man-made river, on behalf of America and the technical consulting office for the river, which is in America--but its technicians know every inch of the man-made river. Then they say we're spying on the al-Rabitah factory, but the regime itself announced nearly two years ago that a fire destroyed the tool factory in al-Rabitah; that the factory doesn't exist. Then they say we're spying on the missile program being developed. But the regime itself said two years ago that it had no such missiles. Libyans know very well that interrogations begin with spying against Arab unity and end with spying on a tool factory. It was a phony interrogation, in which the officers confessed as the result of torture. Plus the fact that someone whose mission was espionage would not go around recruiting these huge numbers of officers and civilians."
