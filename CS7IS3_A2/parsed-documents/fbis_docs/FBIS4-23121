WARNING: VIENNA PLEASE PASS TO BOSNIA FBIS TRENDS-22JUN94-YUGOSLAVIA Former Yugoslavia Former Yugoslavia Show of Solidarity Follows Speech Cautioning Hardliners SUMMARY The declaration by Zoran Lilic, president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), that Belgrade would not continue to pay the heavy price for the Bosnian and Krajina Serbs to maintain an uncompromising position toward a peace settlenient does not appear to have affected their negotiating stances. Despite Lilic's cautionary statements, Bosnian and Krajina Serb leaders have continued to take tough stands on the crises in their regions without any hint of censure from Belgrade. END SUMMARY While suggesting criticism of Serbs who oppose peace talks, Lilic's statements in a June speech in Novi Sad were most likely intended more to reiterate Belgrade's position that it supports a peaceful resolution of the Balkan conflict. Insisting that the FRY (Serbia and Montenegro) needs peace so that the UN will lift the economic sanctions imposed on the country, Lilic warned that "nobody has the right" to drag Serbia and the FRY into the war and "exhaust their own country." He emphasized that the population of the FRY "cannot be the hostages of a single leader" whether he is "from the FRY, the Republic of Srpska" in Bosnia- Herzegovina, "or the Republic of Serbian Krajina" in Croatia. He declared that the people of the FRY have a "justified" expectation of a "successful outcome to the peace talks" and "cannot agree to the option of their endless foot-dragging, sabotage, and blackmailing" (Belgrade TV, 7 June). Most likely trying to avoid open conflict in Serb ranks, Lilic did not specify who was responsible for the footdragging and sabotage of peace negotiations. Lilic's remarks echoed those of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on other occasions when the Serbian president has called--albeit with mixed success--upon the Bosnian or Krajina Serbs to compromise for the greater good of Serbia, the FRY, and all Serbdom. During the negotiations in January 1993 that eventually led to the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia- Herzegovina, Milosevic reportedly warned Karadzic that he "could not hold all of Yugoslavia as his hostage" by refusing to compromise (Vreme, 13 June). Ultimately, Karadzic and the Bosnian Serbs rejected the Vance-Owen plan in May 1993 in defiance of Milosevic's wishes. At the same time, the Belgrade media used the episode to argue that the UN sanctions against the FRY were unjust because, as the Yugoslav leadership had claimed all along, Belgrade's influence over the Bosnian Serbs was limited. When Milosevic sought to persuade then-President of the RSK Milan Babic to accept the Vance peace plan for Croatia, the Serbian president similarly warned the RSK leader that he would not be allowed to hold the Serbs of Yugoslavia as "hostages" to Babic's personal ambitions (Tanjug, 11 January 1992). In that instance, Milosevic proved successful: The Krajina Serbs accepted the Vance plan and removed Babic from office in February 1992. Lilic's remarks apparently had unintended consequences that the Serbian leadership and the Milosevic-controlled media have tried to counter. The FRY President's statements set off a round of speculation in the independent Belgrade media, particularly in the daily Borba, that the speech was symptomatic of a growing rift between Milosevic and Karadzic (Borba, 9 and 11-12 June; Vreme, 13 June). Radovan Karadzic, president of the "Republic of Srpska" (RS) in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Milan Martic, president of "Republic of Serbian Krajina" in Croatia, and other leaders dismissed the matter by asserting that the speech did not refer to them (Vreme, 13 June). In an interview in a Belgrade daily, Karadzic declared that if Serbia is "provoked and dragged into the war" it would be neither because of the Bosnian Serbs intentions nor as a result of their actions. Moreover, he deflected the thrust of Lilic's warning by claiming that the United States is "working to get Serbia and the FRY involved in the war" (Vecernje Novosti, 17 June). On the other hand, Biljana Plavsic, "vice president" of the RS, responded bitterly to Lilic's remarks. She likened him to Serbian opposition party leader Vuk Draskovic, whom she accused of advocating surrender to the "blackmail" offered the Serbs in the peace talks (Borba, 9 June). Several subsequent statements denied the existence of any rift between Belgrade and its allies across the Drina and, at the same time, appeared to be an attempt to tone down--if not deny--the message sent by Lilic's speech. Not long after the controversy over the speech erupted in the media, the Belgrade television news program Dnevnik carried a statement from a local leader of the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia reemphasizing the Serbian position that the Serbs had been victims in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that peace would only come with the international community's and other warring sides' "acknowledgment of the interests of the Serbian people." Zeljko Simic, deputy premier of the FRY, blandly claimed that Lilic's remarks were only intended as a general warning against possible "willful actions of any politician" and that Lilic had not even excluded himself from those who needed to be cautioned. He insisted that Lilic's speech had been delivered "with the aim of sobering both the public and certain significant political individuals" and "warning" them not to put their "personal interests, or even their will," above the national interests of the FRY (Belgrade radio, 13 July). Unyielding Stance The Milosevic regime's response to Bosnian and Krajina Serb behavior since the controversy over Lilic's speech suggests that Belgrade has made no effort to persuade its allies to compromise and, if anything, may have encouraged a renewed effort to stand firm: Quality for Quantity. Neither the Belgrade leadership nor Milosevic-controlled media have been observed to criticize Karadzic despite his recent escalation of Bosnian Serb territorial demands that could dampen hopes for a peace settlement in the near future. Although Karadzic, during his 13-15 June visit to Moscow, suggested that the Bosnian Serbs could agree to the 51-49 percent split of Bosnian territory between the Bosnian government and the Serbs, he insisted that that could happen only if the boundaries of the proposed territorial division were significantly renegotiated (Moscow TV, 14 June). The Serbs, he said, demanded an exchange of territory based on the principle of "quantity for quality" to create "compact territory" (Tanjug, 14 June). Then, in his 17 June interview with Vecernje Novosti, Karadzic backtracked from his Moscow statements, saying that the Serbs could not accept a 49- percent share of Bosnian territory as a "final solution." He also reiterated previous demands that the Serbs be granted control of parts of Sarajevo, suggested that he might also seek control of Tuzla, and discussed the Serbs' proposal for an exchange of territory with Croatia to gain access to the Adriatic south of Dubrovnik (Tanjug, 17 June). Karadzic's uncompromising demands were not reported by the Belgrade media until after he consulted with Milosevic on 16 June, suggesting that the Bosnian Serb leader felt the need to get Milosevic's approval before announcing his latest negotiating position. In an apparent attempt to dispel the rumors of a rift between the two leaders, Karadzic and a smiling Milosevic were shown on Belgrade television conferring amiably on Karadzic's return from a 14-15 [?]June visit to Moscow. Although the report did not broadcast the two leaders' comments to each other, a Tanjug statement read by the television news announcer gave no indication of any deviations from previous statements professing the Serbs' desire for peace and their demand for "equal treatment" by the international community (Belgrade TV, 16 June). No Compromises from Knin. Suggesting that Lilic's 7 June speech also did not signal a softening of Belgrade's support for the Krajina Serbs' demands or negotiating tactics, negotiations between Zagreb and Knin scheduled for 16 June foundered when the Serbs refused to accept the presence of more than two Croatian journalists at the talks. The Belgrade media gave no indication that the Milosevic regime objected to the scuttling of the talks over what appeared to be a minor protocol point. Moreover, suggesting bleak prospects for future talks, Martic has demanded from the Croatian Government "compensation to hard currency account holders" and to the "57,000 pensioners" living in the RSK, warning that such compensation is a precondition for the reopening of the Adriatic oil pipeline shut down by the Serbs since the early days of the 1991 war in Croatia. He also has declared that the pipeline can be reopened only if it were allowed to deliver "Krajina crude oil" to the Pancevo refinery in the FRY (Tanjug in Serbo-Croatian, 14 June). Not only does Zagreb deny the Krajina Serbs' right to pump the oil from oil fields owned by Croatian companies, but it--and the international community--would adamantly oppose such a violation of the UN sanctions against the FRY. Prospects While Lilic's speech served as a reminder that the Milosevic regime intends to retain control of the Serbian nationalist movement in former Yugoslavia, it did not signal a retreat from Milosevic's goal of eventually uniting all Serbs in one state. Although Milosevic is willing to let the FRY make significant sacrifices to obtain that goal, Lilic's speech implies that Belgrade has set limits on the demands that the Serbs should make and the tactics they should use to achieve them. Those limits, however, are apparently intended to rein in only the most extreme demands by Bosnian and Krajina Serb leaders. Belgrade's apparent endorsement of Martic's and Karadzic's toughened negotiating strategies suggests that they have stayed within the limits. At the same time, it helps Belgrade's efforts to win the lifting of UN sanctions to claim that the Bosnian and Krajina Serbs act independently and that Belgrade disapproves of the Bosnian war.
