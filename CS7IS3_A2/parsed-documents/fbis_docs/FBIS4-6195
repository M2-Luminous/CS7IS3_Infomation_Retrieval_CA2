FBIS4-6195 "dreas075_d_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 South Korea Seoul Willing To Talk With DPRK About Loggers Seoul Willing To Talk With DPRK About Loggers SK1804004294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0028 GMT 18 Apr 94 SK1804004294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- The government plans to negotiate directly with North Korea if Pyongyang makes an issue out of Seoul's decision to resettle fleeing North Korean loggers in the South. A senior government official said Sunday there was a strong possibility that North Korea would officially broach Seoul's decision last week to give North Korean loggers refuge in the South. "In that case, the government plans to push direct negotiations with North Korea on this problem," he said. An estimated 500 North Koreans are said to have escaped from Pyongyang-run logging camps in Siberia, many of whom are hiding in various parts of Russia to elude North Korean agents while seeking refuge in South Korea. The official, who declined to be identified, noted that when many East Germans tried to escape to West Germany, the Bonn government solved the problem by negotiating directly with East Germany. The government will cooperate with Russia and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the process of settling the North Korean loggers in the South, he said. But there is a possibility that North Korea, insisting the loggers are "criminals," will demand their repatriation. The government has decided to prepare for this eventuality by checking the background of all North Korean loggers applying for refuge in the South, he said. In addition, the government will introduce a procedure allowing the UNHCR to confirm whether the loggers indeed want to leave their country or settle in nations other than South Korea, in order to prevent Pyongyang from leveling charges of kidnapping against Seoul, the official said.
