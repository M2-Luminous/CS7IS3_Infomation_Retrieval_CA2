Baturin: `The Anonymous Author Is Being Sought'"] [Text] Following a storm of rumors and reports about a "conspiracy" against the president, we sought comments from Yuriy Baturin, the aide to the president for national security affairs. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, information about the "coup" began to reach the editorial office as early as 6 March. Later on, a confidential document appeared, which was subsequently, a week later, published in the newspapers. What are the reasons for the appearance of this paper? Are you taking any actions? [Baturin] This is perhaps the most public of all secret conspiracies of which I am aware. This is precisely why the attitude toward it is not that of one toward a conspiracy, but just that toward a certain political performance aimed at poisoning the atmosphere and creating an environment of suspicion. Two scenarios are possible in this instance. The first scenario: One of those who thirst for power felt that he had revealed himself more than necessary. In this case, more smoke should be blown, as many people as possible should be named, and when this list has become sufficiently absurd in terms of the number of names and their combinations, then any other name will also be obscured on it--this is the smokescreen scenario. Here is the second scenario. This work is a product of an overactive investigative imagination. When there are some signs of feeble encroachments on power, a person assesses them and arranges them in certain patterns: What could this be? Later, all of them fit together for the person and grow in volume. Subsequently, this person himself compiles such a paper and circulates it as extensively as possible, for example, in order to bring this to the attention of the people who, for some reason, do not see these "obvious" conspiracy patterns. The letter is passed from hand to hand in Moscow; radio, TV, and newspapers discuss it. Figuratively speaking, the author sets a house on fire in order to light up its dark nooks and perhaps banish goblins from it. Such techniques cannot be used in our situation, which is quite unstable to begin with. After all, the house would burn down at the same time. Now about the things that are being done. Everything is being done that should be done: Special services and law enforcement organs are looking for the anonymous author. This is precisely what it is called. Once he is found, it will be possible to raise the issue of filing criminal charges, the elements of crime being slander associated with the charge of committing a grave crime against the state. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] However, this episode coincided with the Internal Troops being drawn up to Moscow. [Baturin] When there are troops, the Army, any other coercive structures, they live and move. There is normal life, exercises, redeployment, regrouping. Or would you like all of them to freeze, so that nobody would think that they are up to something? However, all of this may be perceived with suspicion, that is, in keeping with the models of overactive consciousness. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Why does the attending physician of the president not make an official presentation somewhere? [Baturin] The health condition of a patient (good or bad) constitutes a physician's secret. If the president does not want bulletins about his health, even if good, released on a monthly basis, he is entitled to this. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] This is done in other countries. [Baturin] Other countries have a different political culture. I do not want to say that ours is worse; no, it is just different. Nor does it appear possible to change a political culture for the country, say, effective Monday. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Much has been said to the effect that this is not even about the president, but rather about somehow discrediting V. Chernomyrdin. One may hear about certain financial and industrial groups that are envious of Gazprom. The concern has become quite influential, perhaps, with some assistance from V. Chernomyrdin. It is tempting to occupy this niche and to collect the same dividend. [Baturin] I do not want to comment on your hypothesis in any way. It does not quite touch on this letter. However, if you are putting together versions of this kind, we must say that in this case, absolutely improper means are being used. We should then acknowledge that at issue are people who are acting improperly. You are perhaps aware of what this is. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Could the letter have been initiated by people close to the president, as an electrical shock of sorts? Recently, he has withdrawn from current business, in a way.... [Baturin] This question fits within the second hypothesis which I have already outlined for you. However, I for one am not aware of such people in the entourage of the president. This is why I would like not to make such assumptions about the presidential entourage. As far as I know, such methods are not used here. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Is the September edict on the early election of the president on 12 June 1994 still in force? [Baturin] In December, an edict of the president was issued which canceled quite a number of his own edicts and certain legislative acts before the new Constitution took effect. The edict that you have mentioned did not appear on the list of the canceled edicts. However, let us not forget about the transitional provisions of the Constitution in effect in keeping with which the president exercises his powers until the end of the term to which he was elected. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] To tell you the truth, we wrote a commentary on the topic of the "conspiracy." Here is its text: We can surmise the following. In early March (according to some data, on the evening of 6 March), the people "at the top" learned about a certain discrediting action which the opponents of the president intended to carry out on 9 March. A meeting of "a narrow circle" was immediately convened, at which it was decided not only to avert the planned action of the opposition, but also to strike their own preemptive blow. Special services were instructed to collect by way of operations compromising evidence available at the time against the most "blameworthy" politicians, that is, those who openly crave the office of the president. The compromising evidence included both "unguarded statements" of these persons, published in the press, which testified to their angling for the "position," and information obtained from informants who were present during the relevant confidential conversations. All of this information was "chewed over" by a group of analysts, assumed the form of a noncommittal "Version No. 1" which will be superseded by subsequent versions, and disseminated among the members of the State Duma, journalists, and party leaders by means of a fax machine (belonging, as they say, to the Dinamo society). Just so that there would be no telltale signs and so as to cover up and prevent suspicions as to its genuine source of origin, one or two individuals loyal to the president were thrown in and in the second part, the Ministry of Defense "tag" was "attached" to "authentic" information confirmed 100 percent by materials from the special services. Upon what did the creators of this "Version No. 1" count? Apparently, on killing three birds with one stone. First, on letting potential "conspirators" know that the eye of the sovereign is alert and is aware of their apparent and concealed intentions (for the most part, individuals appear on the list who remain in the shadows and do not advertise their views very much). Second, on creating for the people a new image of the "enemy" who hampers the reform course with all his might and on learning about the public sentiment. Third, on shaking up the president by showing him that not everything is good in the "Danish kingdom" and that it is time to become active. [Baturin] This is a very far-fetched version. I can say that I do not know anything about such a meeting; I did not participate in such a meeting or give assignments. Therefore, a choice should be made: Either the aide for national security affairs does not belong to the circle that decides such things, or this did not happen. Thousands of people work here. Even if three people did talk about something, you might call it a meeting, and I might call it just chatter. Nonetheless, I have not heard about anything of the kind. * * * * The competent organs are establishing whether the removal of the president was being prepared. However, changes have occurred in the Kremlin. At the entrance, the guard demanded that the operation of a dictaphone be demonstrated, inspected the tape, and asked whether we had weapons. Quite recently, it was simpler.
