The love and prayers of hundreds of thousands of Orthodox and thousands of other friends are enough, said Archbishop Anastasios. The Archbishop of Albania also stressed that the truth will finally shine and his work will remain as proof of honesty, love, and solidarity among the peoples. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today referred to the statement of Archbishop Anastasios and stressed that the archbishop of Tirana and the whole of Albania always acts on behalf of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. The Greek Government, said the spokesman, is clearly very interested in the rights of the Greek minority in Albania, which is Orthodox Christian in religion. In this sense, the spokesman stressed, we are interested in the smooth operation and exercise of rights by the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church to a degree which includes the religious and worship needs of the Greek minority.
