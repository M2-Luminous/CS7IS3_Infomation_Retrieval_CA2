Haruyuki Nishi, head of financial affairs for the Kyoto municipal government, apologized for the city's oversight in thinking that the school had failed to submit a report required under the National Land Utilization Law. Kyoto police raided 27 locations associated with the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), including the school, believing the school had failed to submit a report on the intended uses of the land. The 43,000 square meters of land was purchased from Kyoto farmers between March 1990 and October 1991 for the relocation of the school building. The land is located in an urbanization control area and the law requires that necessary information must be filed with the municipal government upon transaction of such land. On Tuesday, Nishi said police had inquired in late March about the land transaction and an official in the city's land uses inspection section overlooked the proper entry in the city's ledger. Nishi also explained that since 1987 the city has been computerizing its operations under the law, but the school's transaction had not yet been put in the computer. As the computerization operations continue, city officials will double-check the data to avoid a recurrence of the incident, he added. Earlier Tuesday, Chongnyon members in Kyoto protested the raid and demanded an apology and the return of confiscated articles. Meanwhile in Tokyo, the head of Chongnyon's international division, Kim Tae-hui, demanded an apology and tighter control over "unjust raids and violations of human rights by police authorities." Police raided Chongnyon's Osaka offices in April on suspicion that the association's members disrupted a rally by another group of Korean residents demanding North Korea release political prisoners. Monday's mistaken raid also comes amid a growing number of attacks on students of Chongnyon-affiliated schools, believed to have been sparked by allegations that Chongnyon members send billions of yen annually to relatives in North Korea. The U.S. Government believes that at least some of the money is funneled to the financially strapped North Korean Government and may be used to fund a suspected nuclear arms development program.
