According to the statement, President Kravchuk told a meeting with newsmen initiated by "Radio Liberty" and "Der Spiegel" about the situation in the country and said he considered his participation in the early presidential elections scheduled for June 26 1994 inexpedient. Taking into account that the president's opinion has been widely commented on by both Ukrainian and foreign mass media, the press office points out that "this position of Kravchuk is caused by the specific situation in society and the state system today and prognoses of its short-term development." The press office said the president motivated his decision by the fact that the period remaining until the elections is very short. "It cannot be ruled out that the process of electing and forming the supreme power bodies, both executive and legislative, may exceed the time limits set and overlap with the early presidential and local elections," the statement stipulates. "This may lead to vacuum of power, when the Supreme Soviet is already no more, while a new one has not been created, a cabinet of ministers which could assume entire executive power has not yet been formed," according to the statement. Under such circumstances, only the president can effectively exercise his powers. However, if he allows the elections at the moment, executive structures may break up and the control of the country lost, the statement stipulated. "This is the president's main argument," the press office said.
