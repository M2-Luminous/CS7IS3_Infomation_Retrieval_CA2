Speaking at a news conference today, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov announced that Russia is prepared, and regards it as expedient, to conduct "informal consultations" to prepare an international conference on this problem. The Russian Foreign Ministry last week put forward an initiative to hold such a conference with the participation of Russia, China, the United States, Japan, the DPRK, and the ROK, as well as representatives of the UN secretary general and the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Aleksandr Panov noted that Russia's proposal is currently being closely studied by all interested parties, and none of them has so far responded to it negatively. According to the Russian diplomat, consultations on preparations for an international conference could begin in Moscow in the near future. It is expected that each side could put forward its stand at these consultations. A. Panov stressed that the Russian side starts from the premise that the conference, if it is held, should be thoroughly prepared. Issues for discussion must be drawn up taking account of the interests of both sides. In the view of the Russian diplomat, the problem of "how to ensure the nonnuclear status of the Korean peninsula" should be one of the foremost issues. The issue of confirming the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both Korean states, maintaining noninterference in their internal affairs, and ensuring their freedom of choice of paths of social development should also be discussed. The Russian diplomat believes that a way out of the present situation can be found within the framework of such a multifaceted approach, which supplements steps that are already being taken. A. Panov stressed that the Russian initiative has already played a positive part. In his view, "the furore over this problem has recently abated somewhat," and "an alternative that can be worked on" has emerged. Touching on the issue of the venue for an international conference on the problem of the Korean peninsula, the Russian diplomat said that so far proposals have come in for it to begin work in Geneva, and then subsequently to be held by turns in Pyongyang and Seoul.
