Eguiagaray is on a tour of the Far East, which now takes him to Hong Kong. This is what Juan Manuel Eguiagaray had to say to our radio station: [Begin Eguiagaray recording] I have signed a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese Minister for Electricity [as heard]. It could lead to building electric power stations as well as to working together in the areas of nuclear energy, renewable sources of energy, and in all that concerns our own experience in building up a strong electricity industry and running it. To give you a better general idea, we did not only speak about electricity. I met six ministers who deal with topics ranging from telecommunications to the electronics industry as well as machinery and the chemical industry. I also met those responsible for the State Planning Commission. In most of these areas there is interest in more Spanish involvement in a country where there is still a lot to be done.
