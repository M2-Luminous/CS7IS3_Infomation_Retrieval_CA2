The situation at the diplomat's home remained unchanged during the past few hours in view of the refusal of the occupants to return home and to initiate the normal paperwork to travel abroad if they so desire. The solution, accepted by the Belgian Government, includes the decision by the Cuban Government to allow the evacuation of the residence by the people who forced their way into it without applying legal measures stipulated for this type of action, both in Cuba as well as in any other country, the source explained. The source himself confirmed that the Belgian Government informed the Cuban Embassy in Brussels of its desire to reinforce, with diplomatic and technical personnel, the small mission in Havana. Cuba accepted the request, bearing in the mind the current situation in the Belgian Embassy and the small number of officials working and there. However, the official request for the extra personnel to travel to Havana has not yet been issued to the Cuban Foreign Ministry. Political observers said that the prolongation of the occupants' stay at the Belgian ambassador's residence has weakened their position in view of the lack of support they have received. This has occurred basically because the two governments involved have been in accordance on how to deal with the situation. The departure of four of the occupants, a few days ago, who have not been harassed by authorities, may encourage the remaining occupants to follow this path as the proper way to resolve the problem. At any rate, conversations between Belgian representatives and Cuban Foreign Ministry officials continue to take place normally, as PRENSA LATINA has learned. More contacts are expected in the next few hours.
