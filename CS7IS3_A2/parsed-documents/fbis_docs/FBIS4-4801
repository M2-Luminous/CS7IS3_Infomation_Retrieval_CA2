The Mozambican Committee for Friendship With the People of the DPRK said in a statement March 24 that the United States will be unable to evade the blame for the aborted third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. The statement said: The United States announced to the world a suspension of the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises and the date of the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, but has taken no step to put them into practice. On the contrary, it has committed a brigandish and brazen act of urging Korea unilaterally to implement the agreement. The United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency must know clearly that hostility against Korea is an act of provocation against mankind. If the United States dare provoke Korea, it will suffer a more ignominious defeat than in the 1950s. The Rwandan Committee for the Study of the Chuche Idea and the Rwandan Committee for Support to Korea's Reunification, in a joint statement March 22, charged that the United States invented the "nuclear issue" and has premeditatedly raised it in the international arena in an attempt to isolate and stifle socialist Korea. The statement demanded an immediate halt to its acts of mocking at the sovereignty of Korea. The Society for the Study of the Chuche Idea of the University of Madagascar, the Madagascan National Committee for the study of the Chuche Idea, the Madagascan Institute for the Study of Chuche-based Idea on Literature and Art and the Society for the Study of the Chuche Idea of Journalists of Madagascar in a joint statement March 22 expressed full support and solidarity for the Korean people's just struggle to defend the dignity of the nation and security of the country. The Nepal-Korea Friendship Association in a statement March 23 strongly demanded that the United States think matters over and solve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful way through dialogue in accordance with the spirit of the February 25 DPRK-USA New York agreement.
