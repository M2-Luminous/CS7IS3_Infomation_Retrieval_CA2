"We are worried for our guys and adopt all political and diplomatic measures so that there are as few Russian troops abroad as possible", Yeltsin said during a meeting with Moscow teenagers studying in military schools. The Russian Army would become in the coming years a "mobile, well-organised (force), equipped with latest weapons and armaments and with highly professional personnel", according to the president. Yeltsin called to accelerate the reform in the Armed Forces which he said is going not actively enough. He said that the structure of the Armed Forces would be considerably changed. The number of major units and formations will be reduced, while the remaining ones will be reinforced with personnel and modern weapons and hardware. "Only in this case they (units) will be able to localise any conflicts", the president said.
