Fujimori, who met with Alexander Watson, assistant secretary of state for Inter-American Affairs, justified his refusal to accept the U.S. proposal by noting, as as an example, that the top Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman "could be freed for lack of evidence" should the Supreme Court review his case. The review of terrorism trials "is a risk we cannot accept in the same way that the United States would not accept it if it were in our situation," the Peruvian chief of state added. Fujimori pointed out that the Judicial Branch is not yet "completely reformed" and that the civilian judicial system "is no guarantee that human rights will be respected." Fujimori and Watson met at the Government Palace in Lima. It was a "constructive and frank," meeting according to the U.S. government official at its conclusion. [passage omitted] Fujimori, for his part, expressed his confidence that the meeting has served to "dispel the doubts" of the United States about the human rights and democratization process. Regarding democratization, the chief of state said he told the U.S. official "that the Peru that existed before 5 April 1992 was not viable and that the measures adopted had been necessary." According to Fujimori, this "was a topic that was well understood" by the U.S. Government representative.
