FR940525-2-00091 FR940525-2-00061 In the event any of the equity securities available for sale in cross-trade transactions are attractive to more than one Account, the Optimization Program will automatically allocate such securities among the Accounts on a consistent, objective basis according to the allocation methodology described herein (see Item 14 below). The allocation methodology will be disclosed to, and approved by, the Independent Account Representatives. Since the determination and allocation of cross-trade opportunities among potential Buying Accounts will be performed automatically by the Optimization Program, BFM states that it will be unable to use any discretion to benefit one Account over another Account. 7. BFM represents that since particular equity securities which are sold by a Selling Account in one of the ``trigger events'' described above are often desirable investments (i.e. classified as a ``buy'' or a ``hold'' under the Stock Evaluation Process) for BFM's other Accounts, the opportunity to cross-trade such securities would significantly reduce the transaction costs incurred by both the Selling Accounts and the Buying Accounts. BFM states that these savings result from the fact that the independent broker effecting a cross-trade transaction will effect the transaction for a lower commission. The independent broker will effect these transactions for approximately .5 ¢ per share. By contrast, if BFM were to effect the same trade other than by a cross-trade transaction, the commission would be approximately 2¢ per share. In the context of foreign equity securities, where brokerage commissions are significantly higher, the potential savings on commissions would be even greater. BFM states that cross-trading also avoids the bid/ask differential that would ordinarily occur in such transactions because the price received by the Selling Account for a particular equity security will be the same price paid by the Buying Account. The elimination of any price differential in equity securities that are cross-traded will result in savings of approximately 1¢ per share for each Account. In addition, the ability to use cross-trade transactions to shift equity securities directly from a Selling Account to a Buying Account will enable BFM to implement optimal investment strategies for the Accounts more effectively. First, the allocation of equity securities necessary to bring Accounts closer to optimality would be easier because all ``buys'' will be net position buys for the Accounts without any bid/offer spread. Second, there is a timing efficiency to be achieved if direct cross-trades are permitted. Under BFM's current procedures, if an Account has sold a particular security on a particular day, no other Account is permitted to buy that security on that day. Rather, all purchases of such security are deferred until the next day. Similarly, if an Account has bought a particular security on a given day, other Accounts are not permitted to sell that security on the same day. Under the requested exemption, BFM would be able to net these contemporaneous buy and sell orders on the same day.
