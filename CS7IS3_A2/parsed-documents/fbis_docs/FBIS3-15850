We say "it seems," because politicians get down to work after diplomats finish their job, and the aims of the first often differ from those of the latter. Therefore, it is not accidental that on Tuesday [22 February], Deputy Foreign Minister V. Domarkas, who heads the delegation for negotiations, evaded a definite reply to RESPUBLIKA's straight question whether this really meant accomplished work. "We coordinated everything what can be coordinated on the level of deputy ministers," such was his diplomatic reply. One should interpret it in this way: We have done our job, but will politicians like the result...? Certainly, not all of them. Negotiations with Poland have become one of Lithuania's protracted foreign policy myths, as well as a yielding cow from which most of our radicals like to milk political dividends. The Poles are insidious invaders who day and night think about recovering Vilnius occupied by Zeligowski in 1920. They began to hammer this idea into people's heads long before the declaration of independence. Certainly, there is no fire without smoke. However, Lithuanian political radicals exaggerate Poland's interests in the Vilnius region (anyway, several thousand Poles live here). Some of these enthusiasts looked for and, of course, found certain parallels with Nazi activities in the Klaipeda region in the 1930's. Our patriotically disposed countrymen did not even consider that the situation in the late 20th century in Europe is different from that in the third decade. [passage omitted] Frontiers are falling. Although with creaks, Europe is uniting. Lithuania is also declaring its intention to become a member of the European Union and sign a free trade agreement with it. Even our greatest "Polophobes" approve this. However, one simple truth seems to escape their heads for some reason -- we can reach the long-desired Europe only through our western neighbor -- Poland. Therefore, even the staunchest advocates of Lithuanian "Eurocentrism" should understand that normalizing our relations with Poland and signing a bilateral agreement is primarily more in our interest than in theirs. Instead of assuming the position of insulted historical innocence, we should demonstrate more flexibility and not try to revive the 70-year-old specter of Zeligowski. If we want to become civilized Europeans, we should behave according to their standards. [passage omitted] In the current draft treaty coordinated by diplomats, Poland recognizes Vilnius as the capital of Lithuania and condemns certain historical events in the preamble. However, this is insufficient for those Polish and Lithuanian politicians who feed on political disputes. On the day of negotiations, the Polish Catholic daily SLOWO published an open letter to Polish leaders, demanding that special guarantees for Lithuania's Poles be incorporated in the treaty. In the authors' opinion, first of all, such guarantees should be considered in the talks between the Polish Government and the Lithuanian Poles' Union. One could ignore this letter, if the author was not the blatant and influential organization "Kresy" [territory to the east of Poland formerly under its rule]. Yesterday, we could hear some Lithuanian voices cautiously condemning the treaty as well. Former Foreign Minister A. Saudargas, member of the Christian Democratic Party, deemed it a "unilateral concession" at yesterday's press conference. [passage omitted] We would like to draw the attention of all future critics to the following fact -- on the day when V. Domarkas was shaking hands with I. Biczewski [Polish deputy foreign minister], the latter's chief [Olechowski] was greeting the Russian foreign minister [Kozyrev]. Judging by the comments on Polish television, Moscow is operatively improving its relations with Warsaw. If the latter's ties with Russia really strengthen, while those with Vilnius deteriorate, in what situation will Lithuania find itself? It is worth remembering that before World War II the "Baltic Entente" was not established only because of Lithuania's difficult relations with Poland. This was useful to the USSR and Germany alone. Do Lithuania's great patriots want this situation to recur?
