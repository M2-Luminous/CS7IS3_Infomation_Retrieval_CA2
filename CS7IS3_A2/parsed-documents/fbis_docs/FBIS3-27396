The Communist Chinese insist on defining the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route as a direct, cross-strait route after 1997. Using this as a premise, they have expressed a willingness to grant new Taiwan-Hong Kong air rights that will remain in force after 1997, with Mandarin Airlines, Eva Airways Corporation, and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways jointly operating the route. However, we continue to define this air route as an international one. According to the official, Communist China recently informed us through certain channels that it had no objection to the contents of an agreement proposed by Taiwan regarding new Taiwan-Hong Kong air rights. It signaled its willingness to allow the new aviation agreement to remain valid beyond Hong Kong's great threshold of 1997, by extending the term of the new aviation agreement until the year 2000. Additionally, Communist China did not take issue with Eva Airways Corporation's role in operating the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route, in order to satisfy our demand for "designating several airlines" to operate the route. A precondition for Communist China's acceptance of the aforementioned terms, however, is that we must view the Taiwan-Hong Kong route as a direct route across the Taiwan Strait, or a "domestic route" within China's boundaries, after 1997; that Taiwan may not use aircraft bearing the characters "Republic of China" [ROC] or painted with the ROC's emblem or flag on the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route; and that Taiwan may not take advantage of the air route to implement the policy of "two China's." In other words, China Airlines may not join in the operation of the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route. Currently, we have a substantial difference of opinion with Communist China regarding the definition of the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route after 1997. The official noted: Our position is that although Communist China will retake Hong Kong after 1997, we will define and juristically proclaim Hong Kong and Macao as special regions different from Mainland China, and that continuing flights to those regions by Taiwan's aircraft after 1997 will not be taken as direct flights across the Taiwan Strait. The policy-making official stated: Although we will not challenge Communist China's definition of the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route as a domestic one, we will continue to view it as an international route. This will allow the two sides to define the route differently. With regard to China Airlines' withdrawal from the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route, the official said: The flexible practice of replacing China Airlines with Mandarin Airlines is not without precedent; this is our current mode of air services with Vietnam and Europe. There should be no serious problem provided China Airlines agrees to the arrangement. The official stated: Some people recently proposed that Taiwan, Communist China, and a foreign country jointly finance and establish a new international airline company, which will allow Taiwan, Communist China, and Hong Kong to make use of this joint venture's ambiguous status to diminish the sensitivity of trilateral politics. After 1997, the company will be allowed to operate the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route exclusively.
