The program features the platforms of the Peasant Party of Ukraine and the Socialist Party of Ukraine. Each party has been given a 10-minute slot on the program during which it can present its views. The announcer begins by introducing the Peasant Party of Ukraine and the Socialist Party of Ukraine whose candidates have been nominated to run in the upcoming election to the Supreme Council. The Peasant Party is represented by its chairman Serhiy Dovhan, and the Socialist Party by Oleksandr Moroz, chairman of its political council, and Volodymyr Marchenko, member of the political council presidium. The Peasant Party, according to its chairman Dovhan, has a membership of more than 70,000 members among rural working collectives. He says that the party decided not to join any election alliances with other political organizations. "Our party's position is strictly centrist." He continues: "If our plans and our program are shared by other parties and movements, we are ready to join forces to solve the global task of working out a political and economic course to take Ukraine out of its deep and prolonged crisis." This anti-crisis course, in the Peasant Party's view, must start with the provision for a steady development of the agrarian sector. "Our party has a specific program and will be able to take Ukraine out of the difficult economic crisis within the next two years. We will ensure that our people are provided with food at the level of 1992, and then make sure that Ukraine progresses to a higher grade and becomes a serious food producer on the world market." The party's election objectives are outlined as follows: "First of all, to provide legislation guaranteeing accession to civilized market relations as opposed to the current wild market. Our party recognizes the right to maintain different forms of ownership and economic activity. Unlike some ultra-reformers, we do not advocate the destruction of state enterprises, and state and collective farms during the transition to market relations. They need to be reformed in a speedy and popular way, rather than an elite privatization, and transformed into associations, cooperatives, and joint-stock companies." The Peasant Party supports private farming, however; it believes that forming the necessary legislative and technical base for its development would take many years. "The Peasant Party believes that land should be owned only by those who work it and take care of it. Legislation must confirm the peasants' unconditional ownership of land along with the right to pass it on to their heirs and each peasant's right to sell and buy its share of land within a collective of land-users. Each must have the right to own a garden plot." The party will use all its powers to prevent sale of land for "next to nothing" to corrupt government officials and "capital owners, including foreign ones." The party will press for more government support and subsidies, for "a parity of prices between industrial and agricultural products, without the domination of self-invented credit lines." It will insist on the reduction of taxes imposed on agricultural enterprises, retaining only the tax on land property. The Peasant Party believes that small and medium businesses should be encouraged to help convert Ukraine's industrial facilities to upgrade food processing, attracting also foreign investment for the purpose. The party's main goal, Dovhan says, is the stabilization of Ukraine's economy which, in turn, will strengthen its sovereignty. "In this noble cause, the Peasant Party of Ukraine appeals for unity, national concord and solidarity of all: democrats, Communists, Liberals, or Socialists -- all constructive associations and movements in the name of preserving and developing our sovereign state. "I appeal to my colleagues, party activists, agricultural managers and specialists, please, by all means, nominate a representative of the countryside in every constituency. I call on electors to support the peasants. If we fail to do this, we are in store for the worst." Chairman of the Socialist Party Oleksandr Moroz begins his election broadcast with an attack on his anti-Communist rivals: "What party should you vote for? Who should you give your preferences? Think of what I'm saying. The Peasant, Socialist, and Communist parties are parties of the working people. The others, with rare exceptions, whatever they say, are advocating wild capitalization. Thus, these parties are anti-popular." The party has grown and strengthened its ranks "without the help of the West" in the three years of its existence, Moroz says. Although Ukraine's Government rejected the Socialist party's anti-crisis program proposed two years ago, some of its points are being used in the government's present policy, he says. The Socialist leader appeals for "love and pride for homeland," jobs, and the security lost with the fall of socialism, in contrast to the current situation. He says: "Today's liberalization, privatization, and hyperinflation are mechanisms of robbing the people. It is a planned and conscious robbery by the power of the mafiosi." Some of the proposed privatization plans are viewed as part of that robbery. "We are against turning land into an object of sale and purchase. Look at Russia: in Voronezh, six hectares were sold to the Germans, and these six hectares have already been shipped abroad in wagons. Is it a return to 1942?" Other socialist objectives include the freezing of prices and wages. The present government is being wrongly described as Communist, Moroz says, and its policies should not be confused with the Communist or Socialist party ideas. "It's a lie that Communists are in power. Without touching the president's closest circles, I will name a few from the top power echelon, you make your own conclusions: Yukhnovskyy, Pynzenyk, Lanovyy, Zhulynskyy, Morozov, Ryabchenko, Chernyak, Yemets, Kostenko, Talanchuk, (?Sheshchyn), Markulov -- they are the ones who are deciding our foreign and home policy." "We are accused of being in opposition to reforms," adds Volodymyr Marchenko in conclusion. "It's a lie. We are against the robbery described as reform. We are in favor of reforms that benefit honest people, not the ones executed at their expense. We are for the kind of reforms which will bring power and property to the people."
