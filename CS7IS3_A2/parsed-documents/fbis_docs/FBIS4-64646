It pays tribute to the determination of both sides not to allow extremist elements to pose obstacles to peace; and notes with appreciation the role played by the co-sponsors, the host country and others in encouraging the continuation of bilateral contacts and negotiations. It also calls for the full and early implementation of the declaration of principles, towards which the agreement on Gaza-Jericho is an important step. In the light of this agreement, the Union urges all parties to play a full and positive role in both the bilateral and multilateral tracks of the peace process. The European Union has reaffirmed its continuing commitment to the peace process with its adoption of a joint action on 19 April. This will mobilize the political, economic and financial resources of the Union in support of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace. outstanding among them is the fact that two members of the EU are already taking part in the temporary international presence in Hebron, the confirmation of the Union's willingness to participate, at the request of the parties concerned, in a temporary international presence and the observation and monitoring of elections.
