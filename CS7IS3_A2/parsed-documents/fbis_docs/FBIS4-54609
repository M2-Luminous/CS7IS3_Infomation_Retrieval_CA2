FBIS4-54609 "dreeu085__a94022" FBIS-EEU-94-085-A Daily Report 2 May 1994 ANNEX Slovakia SDL Chairman: Government Cannot Exclude Left SDL Chairman: Government Cannot Exclude Left AU0205102994 Prague CTK in English 0941 GMT 2 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0205102994 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava May 2 (CTK) -- The new Slovak Government which will emerge from early parliamentary elections in the autumn will not be formed without the left coalition, Petr Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL), said in an exclusive interview with CTK on Sunday [1 May]. "The left has won in Poland, socialists in Hungary have excellent prospects and it will apparently not be possible to rule without a social-democratic bloc also in Slovakia," Weiss added. Leftist tendencies in Central Europe have one indisputably positive characteristic -- these parties are not nationalistic and are capable of coming to an agreement and cooperate and thus turn Central Europe into a region of stability and not of potential conflict, Weiss said. He admitted, however, that the prospects of the Slovak left would also depend on the success of the current Slovak Government of Jozef Moravcik. The new government will have first of all to convince people that a businessperson has a chance in this country and that it can be ruled without conflicts and looking for an enemy, he said. Weiss admitted that SDL's participation in ousting ex-premier Vladimir Meciar and mainly that party's coalition with the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), its political antipole, had caused some left supporters to ask questions, although, for example in Austria, such a coalition has been functioning successfully for a long time, he said. However, people have already come to realise that it is necessary and in the interest of the common good, to come to an agreement also with a partner with whom we thought it impossible to come to terms several months ago, said Weiss, referring to the SDL's union with the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH). "Either both sides would again and again return to reproaching each other or we would adopt a different philosophy. We should not hate each other because we uphold different political values and have different political programmes, competing for voters' support," said Weiss, adding that he did not rule out that the current coalition (of the SDL, the KDH and the Centrist Bloc made up of politicians who separated from the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS] would continue also after the autumn elections. "However, we exclude the possibility of union with politicians who base their policies on confrontation and harm Slovakia's good image abroad and thus prevent foreign capital from entering Slovakia. It is impossible to cooperate with politicians who are not willing to observe a long-term compromise with their political partners but who seek to impose their will on them from a position of strength," Weiss said when asked about the possibility of a coalition with Meciar.
