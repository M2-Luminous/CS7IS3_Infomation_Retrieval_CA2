Today, after the collapse of the empire, Russia, its legal successor, is trying to maintain the production and sale of weapons in the world market. How does Ukraine look against that background today? Our correspondent discusses that with Lieutenant-General Lev Hnatenko, first deputy chief of weaponry and chief of staff for weaponry of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. [V. Korol] Lev Mykolayovych, what is the "arsenal" of the Armed Forces of Ukraine today, is there enough powder for our "powderhorns"? [L.M. Hnatenko] The Ukrainian Army is not experiencing any particular lack of weaponry or hardware. All of these are moreover the latest models, which were in service at one time with the weaponry of the former Soviet Army. What sort of arms are they? For example, T-64, T-72 and T-80 tanks, BMP-1, BMP-2, BTR-70 and BTR-80 combat vehicles, MiG-29 and Su-27 aircraft, S-200 and S-300 air-defense systems... This list could go on. The Navy actually does not have an adequate quantity of vessels. I hope that this this problem, however, will be solved in the next few years. That portion of the Black Sea Fleet that goes to Ukraine will give us the opportunity of creating a powerful navy in the future. Approximately ten of the latest ships in various classes have also been laid down at Ukrainian shipyards. [V. Korol] Even if the Army is equipped with the latest models of weaponry and hardware, it is still necessary to prepare for their replacement... [L.M. Hnatenko] Yes, and there are many ways of resolving that problem--first, the creation of new models of weaponry; second, the upgrading of existing weaponry in order to increase its combat potential; and, third, procurements abroad. [V. Korol] Which way is the most favorable for Ukraine? [L.M. Hnatenko] We are now developing two state programs for the creation of weaponry. Minister of Defense General of the Army of Ukraine V. Radetskyy is devoting the most steadfast attention to them. One of the programs is intended for the period to the year 2000, and the other for the long term, to the year 2010. They are oriented toward bringing us as close as possible to a self-contained cycle for the production of weaponry and military hardware. Ukraine unfortunately had almost no assembly plants. Our enterprises manufactured close to 30 percent of various elements and constituent items for weaponry and military hardware. We will thus obviously not have the capability of manufacturing all of these arms independently in the very near future. The solution of the problem of upgrading the weaponry and hardware will be pursued in comprehensive fashion--partly through the development and manufacture of our own weaponry, and partly through procurements abroad and, ultimately, the upgrading of existing models in cooperation with the CIS countries. You cannot get away from cooperation in this case, since most of the design bureaus are located on Russian territory. The solution of the problem of modernization is extremely difficult, and sometimes even virtually impossible, without the technical documentation they have and the necessary coordination. We are also now developing a special program for the modernization of weaponry. We are studying the experience of its operation in the field, which suggests certain solutions pertaining to its further improvement. We are making attempts to set up, as I was saying, joint scientific research with the KBs [design bureaus] that created these or those models. We are carefully studying similar processes in the armies of other countries at the same time. The experience of Israel, which is upgrading the MiG-21 aircraft and giving it better qualitative features, for example, is very useful. [V. Korol] But Lev Mykolayovych, Ukraine has strong scientific and production potential that is working for the Army... [L.M. Hnatenko] Undoubtedly. The first evidence of that, for example, are the products from the Plant imeni Malyshev. It put out the T-34 tanks--the best in the world at one time--and the T-64 also came out of its gates. It is now "bringing to the surface" the T-80 UD tank, which has already won recognition among the military of many countries around the world. The plant also has long-term projects in the corresponding weaponry. The enterprise is also facing great financial problems today. Another giant of the defense industry, the ANTK imeni O. Antonov, on the contrary, is on the rise today. The An-70 aircraft created by that collective has no analogue in the world among aircraft in its class. The aircraft will be in series production in the near future, and almost 40 countries from around the world have displayed an interest in acquiring it. Ukraine has great capabilities--and they are being realized--in shipbuilding. We can build the smallest vessels to missile cruisers. We have also traditionally been strong in electronics, and in radio and instrument building. The appropriate financing is essential so that we do not lose those positions... [V. Korol] Financing--the Achilles heel of our existence... [L.M. Hnatenko] The Army has lived without a budget for two years, and only pay and food are being financed. The situation has changed little this year as well, even though a budget was approved. It provides, as before, for the pay and food for servicemen. We are getting virtually no budget funds for the development of weaponry and hardware. [V. Korol] But there is also extrabudgetary financing... [L.M. Hnatenko] Yes, for example, the sale of military property and hardware or arms, the offering of various types of technical services... The funds obtained from that, however, unfortunately go not for weaponry, but to pay for various debts of our department, the procurement of foodstuffs, medicines, fuels and lubricants etc. Not a single kopeck from extrabudgetary funds has been directed to the development of weaponry for two years. The sense of seeking out extrabudgetary receipts thus is lost, and our reserves for selling are finally being exhausted; there is nothing with which to replace them so far. We can sell property and hardware that has exhausted its service life to the public. The department is flooded with such requests. A mechanism for such sales has unfortunately not been devised--it is not known who should do the selling, who should receive the money, how the documents should be drawn up. The Cabinet of Ministers has to make the appropriate decisions. [V. Korol] Lev Mykolayovych, the question of the gathering of by-products that contain precious metals has not been resolved for a long time as well. That would also be considerable funds... [L.M. Hnatenko] For the simplest of reasons--the Ministry of Defense did not have a structure that would be occupied with that. A department has now been created under the weapons staff for the gathering and processing of precious metals and minerals. The staffers of that department have performed an inventory of most of the units, and have developed a system for gathering scrap that contains precious metals. A new plant was also finally launched at Pivdenmash in May for the processing of precious metals. I very much hope that at least some of the funds that are received from the sale of those products will go to the development of weaponry. [V. Korol] The state order for 1995 is being developed at the Ministry of Defense today. How is it being fulfilled this year? [L.M. Hnatenko] The Ministry of Defense formulated the state order for 1994 in good time. The procurement of weaponry was moreover in a certain order in the documents that were submitted by our department, in conjunction with the Ministry of Economics, for the consideration of the Cabinet of Ministers. But the money was not allocated for specific line items, as was envisaged, but rather as an overall sum for everything at once--foodstuffs, medicine, weaponry etc.; divide it up yourselves, they said. So only eight percent of the necessary amount was allocated for the procurement of weaponry this year. Those appropriations, moreover, did not take into account our debt to the defense industry for 1993. We were forced to cover it from the budgetary funds for this year. [V. Korol] What is the way out of the situation that has developed? [L.M. Hnatenko] There is one way out in this case--additional financing. The Ministry of Defense [MO] has sent the appropriate documents to the Cabinet of Ministers. Our department, despite the financial difficulties, is already working on drawing up the state order for 1995. [V. Korol] Have the financial difficulties also obviously strongly affected the state of military science? Is it realistic to hope for substantial achievements from the country's military scientists in such a state? [L.M. Hnatenko] The scientific potential of Ukraine, including military, is one of the strongest in the former USSR. It is in a pitiful state today. Appropriations of 15 percent of the necessary amount were allocated for this year to the Committee for Scientific Research and Experimental Design of the MO. Those funds are moreover being received very irregularly. And if there is no money, then the science schools will collapse, and many design bureaus will be cut back by 30--40 percent. The outflow of scientists is 50--70 percent for projects in high, science-intensive technologies. The number of staffers at the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine who are occupied with military sciences has been reduced from 25 to seven percent over the last two years. That is a catastrophe. We could lose military science. The Ministry of Defense is doing everything possible to see that this does not happen. We have developed 28 programs of scientific research and experimental design, despite all of the difficulties. They are all directed toward the development of weaponry and hardware. [V. Korol] Perhaps it would be worthwhile, in that case, to designate a few of the 28 projects as the most important ones, and to subsidize at least those in full? [L.M. Hnatenko] Such proposals, as you know, come from the scientists themselves as well. That is an entirely acceptable solution at first glance. By supporting a few collectives, however, we risk losing the rest. Losing them forever. Continuity, after all, is very important in science. We can never, having ruined them, restore any special areas or science schools. [V. Korol] There were large proving grounds in the former Union for trying out new models of weaponry. Where will Ukrainian innovations be tested? [L.M. Hnatenko] We unfortunately have available only certain elements of scientific-research proving grounds and testing centers, which came to us as our inheritance from the former USSR. We want to create a unified state scientific-research proving ground that would include all of the leading test sites. Specialists form the Main Directorate for Science, Development and Testing that was recently created in the Ministry of Defense are currently engaged in the creation of a mock-up of such a proving ground. [V. Korol] But if we find the territory to test models of conventional weaponry, where will we able to test missiles? Where and when will we be able to launch the first Ukrainian satellite? [L.M. Hnatenko] The launch of the satellite--it will be the SICh-1 satellite--is planned for the end of 1995 or the beginning of 1996. It will be put into orbit by a launch vehicle that was manufactured at enterprises in Ukraine in cooperation with Russian plants and design bureaus. The satellite is intended for remote sounding of the Earth. Its launch will begin the practical realization of the national space program. The interests of the armed forces of Ukraine will be taken into account without fail in the fulfillment of that program as well. There are no test ranges for the launch of satellites from Ukraine. We thus intend to restore disrupted ties within the confines of the CIS, and with Russia and Kazakhstan in particular. We are making efforts, at the same time, to set up cooperation with the space agencies of a number of European countries. The Ministry of Defense is planning to sign a "framework" agreement with Kazakhstan on space. They have a cosmodrome and we have rockets, after all. Many Ukrainians are working and serving at Baykonur, and they once expressed the desire to foster the realization of the Ukrainian space program. Kazakhstan, however, as it has turned out, is not able to maintain such a unique space facility alone. Russia, which has leased Baykonur, could do it. If we do not arrange cooperation on this question with Russia, the fulfillment of our program will be much more complicated. [V. Korol] Lev Mykolayovych, perhaps a last question. I am convinced that we will surmount all of the difficulties and create new weaponry for our Army. Will we be able to break into the international market by that time? [L.M. Hnatenko] We are not expecting a cloudless future. Our first swallows will soon appear at international military-trade exhibitions. A mock-up of the T-80 UD tank has been prepared, for example, for an exhibition this summer in Saudi Arabia. Other models are being prepared for the exhibition as well. We are planning to launch a permanent exhibition in Kiev as well. The location has not yet been determined--several options are still under consideration. One of them is at Darnytsya. Models could be seen in action there, on the proving ground of the Darnytsya Tank Repair Plant. We are, finally, hoping to issue a series of advertising booklets in the very near future. Then the whole world will be able to find out about our achievements and capabilities.
