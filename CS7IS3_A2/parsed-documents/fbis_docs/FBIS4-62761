But the Explosions Two Years Ago Have Still Not Been Investigated"] [Text] Vladivostok -- The Maritime Kray marked the second anniversary of the notorious explosions at the Pacific Fleet arsenal in Vladivostok (14 May 1992) with a far more powerful "salute" at the Pacific Fleet air forces central air weapons dump, which is 100 km from the city, near the settlement of Novonezhino. On precisely 14 May, at approximately 1500 hours local time, there were reports from the dump that a fire had started, that the guard was unable to handle it alone. Some minutes later there were explosions -- a first, followed by a second.... According to witnesses, and there were plenty of them, since an electric train from Vladivostok was pulling in to Novonezhino, the third explosion was the biggest. According to Maritime Kray governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, appearing on local television the next day, the explosion at the Pacific Fleet dump was equivalent to that of an atom bomb. At any rate, Vladivostok was rocked, as if a small earthquake had occurred: Windows shook and the inhabitants of housing developments in Tikhaya Bay and Russkiy island felt their floors vibrate. It made a big impression on 66 children from Tokyo on holiday at the "Okean" children's camp. It is on the opposite shore of Ussuriyskiy Bay from where the incident occurred. The shock wave from the explosion blew out all the windows in the central complex, where the young Japanese were at the time. But the guests kept their heads, spilled out onto the street, and organized... a disco. The inhabitants of Novonezhino and other settlements within a radius of six-eight km from the exploding dump -- Anisimovka, Romanovka, Smolyaninovo, and nearby garrisons and way stations -- were clearly not in a dancing mood. Some 2,000 people from Novonezhino, mainly women and children from officers' families, were evacuated by electric train during the explosions, as chunks and fragments of metal whistled by over distances of kilometers. Every minute counted, since the track, embankment, and contact rails were soon broken or wrecked. What can you say about the "theater of combat actions," when, according to information confirmed by the kray civil defense staff, several very long-range projectiles flew from the site of the explosion as far as the city of Bolshoy Kamen -- home, as is known, of the "Zvezda" defense plant, which now specializes in dismantling submarines with nuclear reactors. As on 14 May, a black day for the Maritime Kray, so today, when these lines are being written, there is no information on the victims of the tragedy. There is every reason to believe that the future holds the key, as in the case of the affair of two years ago. For instance, the latest victim of the previous explosions at the Pacific Fleet arsenal was a Vladivostok boy who found a shell two weeks ago. And his was by no means the only death. The casualty radius of accidental explosions in the Pacific Fleet's undeclared war on its own territory against itself and its own civilian population is great not so much in spatial terms as in terms of time. We have been told that no one in the military or in the civilian population was particularly badly affected. There are, though, instances of trivial injuries: Cuts and lacerations and bruises -- no more than that. On Sunday 15 May, thank goodness, the rain came right on time, the fire was doused, and, as the kray leadership reported on the radio, the danger of further explosions passed and it was decided to people should return to their homes. Arond 3,000 people had been evacuated in all. It was also announced that the Pacific Fleet air forces central air weapons dump contained only weapons with powder charges (around 5,000 aerial bombs, guided and unguided missiles, 800 truckloads of pyrotechnics, and an amount of TNT in the dump stores equivalent to two nuclear warheads). It was stated that there were no chemical, bacteriological, or nuclear weapons there. But there is no dump any more following the disaster. The extent of the devastation is such that the facility cannot be resurrected. As it happens, it also contained ammunition made in 1937, long out of date. What the military had failed to do on schedule has been achieved by accident. As for the reasons for the fire at the central dump, so far silence. The investigation of the incident is in the hands of the Maritime Kray Administration of the Federal Counterintelligence Service. But we already know the two main versions of the incident. The first comes from a Pacific Fleet spokesman, and what it boils down to is the traditional spring taiga fires. Apparently, there was a gale on 14 May, which spread the fire to the territory of the protected facility. This version is totally rejected by governor Nazdratenko. According to his information, fire originally broke out not on the outskirts, but in the center of the dump. It was there that the first explosion occurred. Perhaps someone wanted it to happen? Incidentally, local people have their own "domestic" version concerning a unit commander arrested recently for trading in weapons. So now the tracks had to be covered.... Incidentally, the latest major theft of weapons from Pacific Fleet dumps took place actually in the vicinity of Novonezhino. What the competent bodies are going to say about the tragedy and whether they will say anything at all is the big question. The experience of the investigation of the explosions that occurred the year before last at the Pacific Fleet arsenal in Vladivostok suggests that it is not just a unit commander who is covering tracks. In fact, no one has yet been properly called to account for the sudden combat actions on the streets of Vladivostok on 14 May 1992; the investigation into the incident is still not complete.
