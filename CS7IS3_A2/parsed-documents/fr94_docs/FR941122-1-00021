FR941122-1-00021 FR941122-1-00002 As provided in current 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(i) and under our proposal, State agencies would not be permitted to develop a separate standard or decrease the heating or cooling standard for households that receive LIHEA payments. However, a State agency would be able to develop and use a separate heating/cooling standard for households that receive energy assistance other than energy assistance provided under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981. In developing other standard utility allowances, State agencies would be required to include only the allowable costs identified in 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5)(ii)(C). No additional costs could be added. Therefore, under the proposed revision of 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(i), State agencies would be allowed to develop the following standards: (a) A separate standard for each type of utility expense; (b) a standard that includes heating or cooling costs; (c) a telephone standard; and (d) a combined standard that includes electricity, water, sewerage, and garbage or trash collection and is available only to households that incur the cost of electricity and either water or sewerage. State agencies would be allowed to add the telephone standard to a separate standard for electricity, for example, for households that incur both expenses. The telephone standard could also be added to the combined standard to allow use of a standard for households that incur costs for electricity, sewerage or water, and telephone. State agencies could use the heating or cooling standard for households that incur a heating or cooling cost and an individual standard for households that incur an expense for only one utility, such as electricity. Because State agencies may develop a variety of standards, the proposed rule specifies that no household shall receive more than one standard for the same utility expense. For example, if the State agency's combined standard includes the expense of a basic telephone, a household that receives the combined standard would not also be entitled to a separate telephone standard. Households whose only utility expense is for a telephone would be entitled to the telephone standard only. The proposal would require State agencies that develop new standard utility allowances to use FCS-approved methodologies. The State agency would be required to review the standards annually and submit revised amounts to FCS for approval. State agencies would be required to submit methodologies used in developing and updating standards to FCS every 3 years. They would also be required to submit the methodologies when they are revised or upon a request from FCS. We are requiring State agencies to submit methodologies every 3 years so that we will be able to monitor State agency development and use of standards. b. Entitlement to a heating or cooling standard. Another complex and confusing area of policy involving standard utility allowances is determining who is entitled to a standard that includes heating or cooling costs. We are proposing in revised ยง273.9(d)(6)(ii) to clarify and simplify these rules. In doing so, we are attempting to eliminate inequities that exist in the application of current policy. Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(ii) provide that a heating or cooling standard shall be made available only to households that incur out-of-pocket heating and cooling costs separately from their rent or mortgage and to households that receive LIHEA. Renters must be billed on a monthly basis by their landlords for actual usage as determined through individual metering to be entitled to use the standard. Recipients of indirect energy assistance payments other than LIHEA must incur expenses in excess of the payments during the certification period to qualify for the heating or cooling standard. Households in public or private housing with a central meter who are billed only for excess usage are not permitted to use the standard. A household not entitled to the standard can claim actual expenses. As indicated above, provisions of interim regulations published November 16, 1982 (47 FR 51551) and finalized June 21, 1988 (48 FR 28190) limited use of the heating or cooling standard by households in public or private housing to those households whose costs could be verified by separate metering. Previously, households in public or private housing who could verify that they incurred heating or cooling costs separately from their rent were entitled to use the heating or cooling standard. Although these households were no longer entitled to a heating or cooling standard under food stamp rules, they were entitled to the heating or cooling standard if they received LIHEA. Therefore, State agencies had to determine which households would or would not receive LIHEA before food stamp eligibility and benefits could be determined. This presented a problem for State agencies, particularly when there was no easy method for exchanging information with the LIHEA agency. Although this policy has been in effect for some time now, State agencies still experience difficulty in anticipating entitlement to a heating or cooling standard when a household is entitled solely because of receipt of LIHEA payments.
