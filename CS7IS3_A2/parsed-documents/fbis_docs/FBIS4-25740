The threat was made after a meeting in Beijing with pro-China businessmen and trade unionists. They questioned the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office about China's likely response if Hong Kong fell into "chaos" in the next three years as a result of the political reform proposals of the Governor, Chris Patten. Lu would not comment directly on the issue, but said Hong Kong must play a complementary and co-ordinated role with the mainland. "Hong Kong should not use confrontation or antagonism to repel China," he said. "If that happens then I think Hong Kong will perish. It will have no hope." Lu said the Communist Party General Secretary, Jiang Zemin, had made the same point when he met the trade unionists earlier in the day. Lu's use of the Chinese character "wang," meaning literally the collapse of a country, was perhaps the strongest wording yet by a Chinese official to threaten Hong Kong. When he visited the territory last month, Lu said Hong Kong "would be of negative value instead of positive value to China" if pro-democracy forces flourished. He warned then of "chaos and disruption" but stopped short of predicting Hong Kong's collapse. The chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, Cheng Yu-tong, raised the Patten proposals privately with Lu after yesterday's meeting. Cheng said Lu's remarks were aimed at preserving the long-term stability of Hong Kong. "I agreed with him that Hong Kong must not have a confrontational role or become some kind of political city," he said. "If all kinds of political forces are allowed to take root it will not be good for the territory." Lu stressed that in the lead up to the transfer of sovereignty in 1997 work on economic issues needed particular attention. This would ensure that Hong Kong played its role as an economic link to the world for China, which he sees as the territory's main value. "Hong Kong's unique advantage is that it faces the world with China at its back. If Hong Kong wants to make great strides forward, then it should give full play to this advantage and co-ordinate with and complement the mainland economy," he said. Lu made special comment on the Hong Kong government's attempt to control property prices. "The effects of most of the measures will not be seen until after 1997," he said. The Hong Kong government has promised to build between 45,000 and 60,000 public housing flats in the next six years. Chinese officials fear most will be built after the transfer of sovereignty, placing a financial burden on the post 1997 government. "We need to find ways to control property and land prices to ensure a smooth transition and avoid any big fluctuations after 1997." Lu compared the property market to a patient with a fever. "Bringing down a fever should be done slowly. It would be inappropriate to take laxatives to flush it out." The trade unionists will hold a detailed meeting with Lu today which is expected to focus on industrial safety at Hong Kong-funded factories on the mainland.
