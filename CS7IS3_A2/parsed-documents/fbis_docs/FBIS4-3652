In his opening speech, Malaysian Defense Minister Najib Razak said more than 500 firms from 37 countries and regions are participating in the exhibition. The reason why so many firms from all parts of the world vigorously are taking part in this exhibition is that Southeast Asia is one of the world's economic centers experiencing a vigorous growth and that Southeast Asian countries are now carrying out defense modernization. The Malaysian Asia defense exhibition, held every two years, began in 1988. This year's exhibition exceeds all previous ones in scope. Many new weapons and equipment are displayed at the impressive British, German, U.S., and Australian pavilions. Zhang Wannian, chief of the general staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, attended the opening ceremony. He also viewed the exhibition.
