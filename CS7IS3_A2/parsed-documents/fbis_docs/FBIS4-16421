Their implementation may result in peace in case of the sides' agreement, Russian ambassador at large and head of the Russian mediating mission Vladimir Kazimirov told ITAR-TASS here today. In his words, the Russian initiatives aim to terminate combat operations in the Armenian-Azeri conflict zone, liberate the occupied lands and return refugees to places of their permanent residence. As for the plan details, Russia offers to separate the warring sides within three days after cease-fire. In the opinion of Kazimirov, it will take another three days to create a buffer or control zone to house international observers. He is sure these conditions will enable the liberation of occupied Azeri territories and solution of other problems related to the conflict. A wise decision must be taken in order to save human lives, stop the bloodshed and war in the region, said the ambassador. Today's statement on settlement of the Karabakh conflict adopted at the Commonwealth summit has the same aims, said the diplomat. He stressed the statement is a reaction of the Commonwealth state heads to the repeated appeals of Azeri President Geydar Aliyev, who thinks it is unnatural that "two Commonwealth states are at war". Kazimirov said further war in the region is unpromising, it may aggravate the tragedy of the Armenian and Azeri peoples.
