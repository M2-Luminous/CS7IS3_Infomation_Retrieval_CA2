Alain Juppe showed most interest in the Russian plan for settling the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. As Pavel Grachev stated, in accordance with the 14 May agreement, 2,500-3,000 Russian peacekeepers will be sent to the conflict zone. They will take up positions along the Inguri river, Galskiy Rayon, and the Kodorskoye Gorge. Speaking about the prospects for joining the "Partnership for Peace" program, Pavel Grachev stressed that Russia is not demanding special conditions for itself, but believes cooperation with NATO countries must not be limited by a framework agreement. Therefore at his meeting with NATO leadership in Brussels he will put forward a broad package of specific proposals on cooperation between Russia and the North Atlantic bloc countries in the political and military spheres.
