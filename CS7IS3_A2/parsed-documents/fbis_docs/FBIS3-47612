The general framework, the Joint Commission, was set up under an agreement signed by Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri and his Cambodian counterpart Prince Norodom Sirivut. Agreement in principle to set up a "Joint Committee on Boundary" was recorded in a joint communique signed by Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and Cambodian co-prime ministers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen. The Joint Commission is expected to hold its first meeting later this year in Bangkok, according to a delegation source. It remains unclear at this point whether the Joint Committee on Boundary will come under the umbrella of the Joint Commission, the source said. But the boundary committee will deal specifically with questions of borderline by land and sea, he said. The boundary committee was proposed by Thailand in a bid to stem future border problems. "The Joint Boundary Committee will provide an opportunity for both sides to make direct contact at all levels if problems arise," said the source. [passage omitted] Cambodian Defence Minister Tie Banh emphasised the importance of reaching a fair agreement on sharing resources such as gas and oil. Fisheries so far have caused "minimal conflict" but authorities from both countries should try to prevent any deterioration, he said. Issues involving the land boundary he said, were more difficult to settle at this stage because some areas remained beyond control. He argued for better roads linking remote areas, saying "when (we) have routes, all things will follow, including trade and public health". "But this needs a lot of money, tools and human resources. It's not very easy for a poor country like ours to talk about much money," he said. Gen Tie Banh also noted that a permanent checkpoint between Klong Luek and Poipet would be declared open "very, very soon". In the way are technical details on customs and immigration. Customs procedures are important to the transfer of logs, including those in Khmer Rouge zones, to Thailand, a source said. But the Cambodian government is not expected to extend the March 31 deadline for the transfer of felled logs. "They are more interested in joint ventures with foreign logging companies after the deadline expires," said the source. Gen Tie Banh said permanent checkpoints between Klong Yai and Koh Kong, further south, and Chong Chom and Chong Anma, further north, were also under consideration. [passage omitted] The Joint Commission with Cambodia follows similar frameworks for cooperation with Laos and Vietnam. Under a Thai Foreign Ministry proposal approved by Cabinet, the Joint Commission with Cambodia is designed to facilitate consultation and cooperation for mutual benefit in matters of trade, science and technology, and social issues. The Joint Commission is to meet once yearly in alternate capitals and the agreement will be valid for five years.
