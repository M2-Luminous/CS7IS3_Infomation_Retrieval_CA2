While 43 percent of the respondents said Article 9 "should remain as it currently is," 46 percent said the "amendment is necessary" and 5 percent said "positive efforts should be made to amend it." More than half of those polled in the Defense Agency, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Construction, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare said they support the amendment. But there was a wide range of views, including those of moderates in the Ministry of Finance, saying "the Peace Constitution needs to be maintained, but neither must we make its amendment taboo." Those in the Ministry of Home Affairs said: "It is necessary to prepare a system through which the nation can positively participate in international cooperation." Some in the Science and Technology Agency felt "it is necessary to review the Constitution if Japan is to carry out its role in building a new world order in the post-cold war era, a role befitting its national power. But defenders of the Constitution in the Ministry of Transport said: "Article 9 may not be fitting to the current situation, but it should be left intact as an expression of our ideals." The bureaucrats' positive views on international contributions were evident in their answers to questions regarding Japan's participation in peacekeeping operations [PKO]. Fifty-five percent said: "We should refrain from participating in exercises of force, but if we do we should participate in them positively." Thirty-one percent said: "We should be positive about making international contributions, including participation in peacekeeping forces." Meanwhile, only 9 percent said Japan should "rethink" the PKO, and no one said Japan should "stop the PKO immediately."
