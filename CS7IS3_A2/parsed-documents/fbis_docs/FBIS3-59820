I have received a variety of comments on this issue, which is worth examination because of the place that Baghdad has occupied in Arab literature. The names of al-Karkh and al-Rasafah are mentioned in numerous creative works of verse and in entertaining anecdotes. This is something that has aroused in me the wish to tackle the various aspects of this issue, even if with some brevity. An interesting thing about the Arab conquerors is that wherever they went, they took with them their nomadic character, embodied in their camels, their date palms, and their Bedouin traditions. They were eager to maintain their intellectual and material contact with the desert. All peoples send their children from the countryside to urbanized cities to learn refined language and civilized ways, except for the Arabs, who sent their children from urbanized cities to the desert to learn refined language and the Bedouin ways of life. This is what the Arabs did with the Apostle Muhammad, God's peace and prayers be upon him, when they handed him over to Halimah al-Sa'diyah. Arab Strategy When the Arabs established their capitals, they located them on the brink of the desert, as in the case of al-Basrah, al-Kufah, Wasit, Damascus, and al-Ramlah. This was part of the Arab strategy developed by Abu-Bakr, the first caliph, may God be pleased with him, when he instructed his commanders not to allow water to separate him from the Muslim armies. This strategy was the secret behind the impregnable Arab power. If Arabs wanted to raid the enemy, they could catch him. But if the enemy wanted to raid them, they withdrew into the desert's belly, and so he could not catch them. In accordance with this strategy, Caliph Abu-Ja'far al-Mansur built his circular city, Baghdad--the city of peace. He chose for it the western bank of the Tigris River, thus letting the river stand as a defense line separating his capital from the other peoples to the north and the east and leaving his back open to the desert. This is the geographic position of the al-Karkh side, or of al-Karkh when approached from Baghdad. But Baghdad's growth compelled its inhabitants to move to the opposite side of the river, or in the direction of al-Rasafah. Soon, this side became the bigger of the two. Nearly two centuries later, the caliphs moved their palaces and their governments to this side of the river and allowed the circular city that had been built by al-Mansur to disintegrate and collapse, and to let all traces of its walls disappear. There is no doubt that the circular city was not big enough to accommodate the capital of a major empire, which Baghdad was destined to be. The transfer of government from al-Karkh to al-Rasafah was politically and humanly significant, denoting the transfer of the center of influence from Arabs to non-Arabs. Consequently, the Tigris River protected the city's southern and western flanks from the desert (Arabs) and opened it from the north and the east to Iran and Central Asia. From that time on, the caliph became a toy in the hands of non-Arabs. Perhaps we can consider the move to al-Rasafah to be one of the biggest military mistakes committed by the Abbasides. Soon thereafter, Hulago invaded Iraq and found nothing to obstruct his way to an open Baghdad. This geographic position of al-Karkh and al-Rasafah has had an important impact that has continued to exist to this day and that has played its role in our modern history. The al-Karkh side has continued to be inclined toward the desert. It has also been the home of Arabism and Islam, whereas al-Rasafah became a cosmopolitan city (multinational, multireligious, and multiethnic). It became a haven for non-Arabs and foreigners, a playground for entertainment and a place of song, dance, and opulent and sophisticated living. This is the situation currently. There is hardly a non-Arab and non-Muslim home in al-Karkh, whereas al-Rasafah is divided into varied cosmopolitan quarters. It has the Christian Quarter, the Jewish Quarter, the Kurdish Section, the Armenian Camp, and so forth. Tolerance Versus Fanaticism Lifestyles have also been divided along the above lines of division. Al-Rasafah is characterized by tolerance, and al-Karkh is characterized by clannishness and by clinging to tradition. To this day, unveiled women have continued to avoid passing through al-Karkh. When Salwa, my sister, went to visit our old homes in al-Suq al-Jadid with her face unveiled, a storm of protest rose against us, and my sister did not visit the area at all for years. A similar storm rose when the quarter's inhabitants noticed poet Naji al-Qashtini, my uncle, in a carriage, with his unveiled wife sitting next to him. We moved out of al-Karkh in the 1930s, which saw the start of the process of a class emigration. Many people, including my father, may he rest in peace, noticed that the area's sternness and clannishness were no longer compatible with the developments of the time. So they sold their homes and moved to the new development areas in al-A'zamiyah, al-Battawin, and al-Karradah. However, the majority stayed. With time, al-Karkh turned into a stronghold of the advocates of pan-Arabism, such as 'Abd-al-Salam 'Arif, 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Arif, and Naji al-Suwaydi. Inversely, leftist activity spread on the al-Rasafah side, and it is from this side's school that numerous communist, socialist, and democratic leaders graduated, such as Zaki Muhammad Busaym and Husayn Jamil. In 1958, 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim staged his coup, which resulted a few days later in a bitter conflict between the Communist Party and the Ba'th Party, and between the advocates of separatism on the one hand and the advocates of Arab unity on the other. In that conflict, Iraq, and the Arabs generally, faced another chapter of the Karkh-Rasafah polarization. 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim, Wasfi Tahir, and al-Mahdawi were from al-Rasafah and were supported by the advocates of regionalism and the leftist philosophy. These men were countered by 'Abd-al-Salam 'Arif and al-Shawwaf from al-Karkh, and these two were supported by the advocates of pan-Arabism and Arab unity. There was some sort of a psychological conflict between the two sides. Al-Rasafah people characterized al-Karkh people as fanatic and savage, and al-Karkh people characterized the Rasafah people as corrupt and dissolute. My father was from al-Karkh and my mother from al-Rasafah. Whenever he got into an argument or had a quarrel with her, he cursed the hour when he married a woman from "that direction," which is the phrase the al-Karkh people give to the al-Rasafah side. They even refuse to refer to al-Rasafah by name, calling it "that direction." This bias is, in fact, a part of the lengthy historical development of the city of al-Mansur and al-Rashid, and of the inflow of non-Arab and non-Muslim peoples to the al-Rasafah side, which is open to the north and the west, and the inflow of the sons of Arab tribes to al-Karkh, the side that is open to the south and the west, i.e., to the desert. This explains why the people of Najd have persistently emigrated to and landed on the al-Karkh side. This side is not only the closest to them, but is also the side of Arabism, Islam, Bedouin values, and an absence of the elements of diversion that are found on the other side. This is the answer to my question as to why the Najd people settled in al-Karkh and avoided al-Rasafah. We encounter the reverberations of this makeup even in the city's economic life. One secret behind al-Rasafah's expansion is the presence of craftsmen's markets and vocational markets on this side, in addition to the presence of government offices and courts, of course. This is confirmed by the names of some of al-Rasafah's markets, such as the Goldsmiths Market, the Weavers Market, the Brass Founders Market, the Tailors Market, and the Cobblers Market. Arabs despise crafts and vocations. Consequently, no significant presence of such markets is found in al-Karkh. What one finds there are some crafts that are tied to Bedouin life, such as articles needed for camels and horses; Bedouin clothes, such as robes, gowns, and headgear; articles needed for tents, and similar stuff that is sold in 'Alawi al-Hillah. One City The two sides are not, of course, separated totally, because they form one city. This city's caliphs and rulers have constantly tied the two sides, first with one bridge and then with two bridges, to which various modern governments added more bridges. These bridges have played a major role in Baghdad's social, literary, political, and even military life. Ibn Batutah visited the city and referred to its two bridges, saying, "Baghdad has two bridges tied in the fashion we described when we mentioned the al-Hillah Bridge. People, both men and women, cross them day and night. In this regard, they are on an endless picnic." From Ibn Batutah's description of the al-Hillah City Bridge, we conclude that the Baghdad Bridge was built on a number of vessels tied by iron chains to a wooden pole on each side, as he says. As for his reference to an endless picnic, it reminds us that the bridge area has continued to be to this day the area of fashion, display, and watching. It is in this area that young men watched young women. We conclude this from numerous literary anecdotes. It is said that 'Ali Ibn Jahm appeared before Caliph al-Mutawakkil when he, 'Ali, had just arrived from the desert and proceeded to praise the caliph with these coarse words: "You are like a dog in your loyalty and like a billy goat in butting heads with difficulties; "You are like a bucket, may God preserve you for us, and some big buckets are full of sins." Al-Mutawakkil was a wise man, who realized the man's poetic potential and who, at the same time, realized that Ibn Jahm meant well and that he was praising him in the ways he was used to paying tribute in his Bedouin life. So the caliph ordered that Ibn Jahm be given a home on the bank of the Tigris, right next to the bridge. He then summoned the poet six months later and asked him to recite some of his verses. Ibn Jahm proceeded to utter this verse, which is truly famous for its sweetness: "Deer's eyes between al-Rasafah and the bridge have hit me with love from every direction." All this change only six months after watching the eyes of Baghdad's women! A lot has been said about these women's beauty. Ibn Batutah drew attention to this beauty when he said, "Between Baghdad's water and her air, feminine beauty arises." About Baghdad's women, one poet has said: "My heart yearns for its Baghdad and its Iraq; for its gazelles and for the beauty in their eyes; "They strut in paradise as if platonic love were part of the city's qualities." Narrators recount that a woman from the al-Rasafah side was crossing to the western (al-Karkh) side when she was accosted by a young man, who said to her, "God's mercy be upon 'Ali Ibn Jahm." She responded, "And may God's mercy be upon Abu-al-'Ala' al-Mi'arri." Then each went his way. People asked the man what it was that he had said to make her give him this answer. He said that he had asked God to have mercy on 'Ali Ibn Jahm, thus reminding her of his verse, "Deer eyes between al-Rasafah and the bridge...." She responded by asking God to have mercy on Abu al-'Ala' al-Mi'arri, thus reminding him of al-Mi'arri's verse: "Oh how sad, she lives nearby, but the path to her home is strewn with horrors!" Thus, the Baghdad Bridge was a playground for lovers, flirts, and for perfume and medicine vendors; a meeting place for ulema and jurisprudents; and a pavement for Koran reciters and beggars. But even beggars were of a special kind, according to Abu-Ja'far Muhammad Ibn Ja'far al-Bur'i who has said, "I passed by a beggar sitting on the bridge. He was saying, 'A poor blind man.' I gave him a coin and said to him: 'You have wished me nothing in return.' The beggar answered: 'For your charity, it is: Have mercy.' With time, the Baghdad Bridge gained extreme political and military importance. Al-Mansur made the right strategic calculations when he selected the location, considering that the city is situated at the point that represents the shortest distance between the Tigris and the Euphrates and at the center of the route that separates the Syrian semidesert and Najd from Kurdistan's mountains and Iran. For many centuries, the Baghdad Bridge was the only crossing point between the eastern and western sides of the Tigris. It is, of course, the crossing point between al-Karkh and al-Rasafah, each of which represents a human polarization point, as we have already pointed out. Control of this bridge became a major mobilizational objective. A number of skirmishes and battles were staged on this bridge, and I was witness to some of them. In the final days of Rashid 'Ali al-Kaylani's uprising in May 1941, British forces approached the rebellious city. The Iraqi military command hastened to fortify the bridge with some barbed wire, machine guns, and one single, miserable tank. But the bridge surrendered when al-Kaylani's government collapsed and fled. The British then proceeded to open the route, through this bridge, to send supplies to the Soviet Union. The successive governments feared that the "savage" al-Karkh people would cross into al-Rasafah (the seat of the government) whenever a crisis developed. Thus, the government hastened to secure the bridge with soldiers to prevent al-Karkh people from crossing over when Rashid 'Ali al-Kaylani's government fell. The Al-Farhud Operation The al-Farhud operation erupted in Baghdad. As a result, some people were killed and their homes and shops were looted, because they were considered sympathizers with the British. I was in al-Karkh at the time. So, I came out to watch this al-Farhud that was running in the direction of al-Rasafah. But police detachments, which had been deployed on the bridge, opened fire in the air in a desperate attempt to stop the "savage" al-Karkh people from crossing over to al-Rasafah. The same kind of operation recurred in the 1948 uprising against the Iraqi-British friendship treaty (the Portsmouth treaty). This time, I was on the al-Rasafah side, and I saw the police open fire on the al-Karkh crowds, also to stop them from crossing to al-Rasafah. Blood flowed copiously on the Baghdad Bridge. One of the people killed in that incident was Ja'far al-Jawahiri, the brother of poet Muhammad Mahdi al-Jawahiri. Ja'far's death was the occasion for a magnificent poem, of which every educated Iraqi has memorized some verses: "Do you or do you not know that victims' wounds are a mouth; A mouth that makes no claims and that asks for no mercy; A mouth that tells the starving destitute: Sacrifice your blood, be generous." I attended the funeral of Ja'far al-Jawahiri, and I heard the lines of people escorting the funeral reiterate in 'mass frenzy:' "It was on the bridge, on the bridge; the battle took place on the bridge." This government fear of al-Karkh people has its historical justifications. The al-Karkh side has often created problems for the government, especially after numerous members of the 'Aqil tribe settled in al-Karkh. In 1834, the 'Anzah tribe clashed with the forces of 'Ali Rida Pasha, the Ottoman ruler, and emerged from the battle triumphant. Consequently, the tribe gained control of the entire area south and west of Baghdad and camped in the area known as 'Akarkuf. As soon as the 'Aqil tribe, which lived in al-Karkh, heard of the 'Anzah tribe's victories against the Ottoman Army, it felt stronger and was emboldened. So it rebelled against the ruler, took control of the coffee shops overlooking the bridge, and cut off the bridge. A heated, day-long battle then ensued between al-Karkh, which was controlled by 'Aqil, and al-Rasafah, which was controlled by the Ottoman forces. But the ruler's forces were not able to prevail in that battle until they borrowed the British consul's boat and used it as a military boat against the al-Karkh people. In his book, "Social Glimpses of Iraq's Modern History," Dr. 'Ali al-Wardi says, "But something worse than the battle started then. Soldiers rushed into the al-Karkh side to indulge in whatever they wished to indulge in. So they plundered the markets and set fire to them. Then they marched into homes and started looting them. They then proceeded to violate women and to offend them in indescribable ways. Women's screams could be heard from the al-Rasafah side. In one scandal, an Albanian soldier tried to rape a woman who resisted him, so he killed her. The woman's body was taken to Shaykh 'Abd-al-Qadir al-Kaylani's shrine and was deposited at the shrine's doorstep. There, the head of Prophet Muhammad's descendants ordered that she be buried as a martyr." A Little of What Baghdad's People Have Experienced It seems that the al-Karkh side has also played the role of safe haven and refuge for outlaws who have fled to the area and from there to Bedouin tribes and to semidesert villages. Thus, the authorities were unable to pursue and arrest them. Saddam Husayn is, of course, considered a living example of this fact. After he tried to assassinate 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim, Saddam crossed to the al-Karkh side and fled from there to the Arabian Peninsula and then to Damascus and Egypt. The same happened with Mufti 'Abd-al-'Aziz Jamil Zadah, who led on 28 May 1832 the inhabitants of Qanbar Quarter of al-Rasafah in an armed rebellion against the Ottoman ruler. At the time, Abu-al-Thana' al-Alusi went to al-Karkh to urge its inhabitants to join the rebellion. But the ruler's troops were able to suppress the rebellion by turning their guns on Qanbar Quarter and setting it afire. The soldiers then proceeded to loot the mufti's home and to burn its library, which contained nearly 7,000 volumes. When that uprising failed, the mufti crossed over to al-Karkh and took refuge with al-'Aqil tribe, which was able to smuggle him, along with his companions, to the village of 'Anah on the upper Euphrates River and the heights overlooking the Syrian semidesert. The Baghdad Bridge has witnessed momentous historical events in its long history. It has its tragic aspect, which is embodied in the massacres perpetrated on both its sides; in the executions that have been carried out at its ends; and in the suicides that some Baghdadi people (mostly women) commit by jumping off the bridge into the river running under it. But the bridge has its funny side also. Numerous jokes and anecdotes are told about the bridge and about those who cross it, both man and beast. Escaped Bridge Frequently, the violent flow of the Tigris River during the flood days in the spring have torn the bridge away from its moorings and dragged it downriver, with the people atop the bridge screaming and imploring heaven for their safety and the safety of their bridge. The bridge used to be carried away by the current for long distances before the authorities could get hold of it and return it to its location. People used to bring a band to the river bank to play certain tunes that were supposed to return the bridge to its place, as if this bridge were a living creature who could hear their tunes and respond to their call. The late Haqqi al-Shibli told me that he saw the unmoored bridge pass through the al-Karradah Quarter with amazing speed. Suddenly, a man standing on the drifting bridge gestured with his hand and called Shibli at the top of his lungs, telling him, "O man whom I don't know and who doesn't know me, look at me and tell my mother, may God have mercy upon your parents, that the bridge got untied with her son on it and that he doesn't know where he is going!" Oh, what words with which to sum up the aimlessness in which Baghdad's people have lived throughout their tragic history!
