Coordinating Minister of Industry and Trade Hartarto listed the potential areas of cooperation in a speech here Tuesday in a dinner party given to some 600 participants from 20 countries attending the three-day 10th meeting of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC). The PECC meeting began Tuesday. The minister said that the four areas relate to the development of human resources, infrastructures, small and medium scale industries and the private sector's participation in economic cooperation. Cooperation in the four areas, he said, will be concentrated on investment and regional trade, which will be implemented in conformity with the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). "We believe that assistance and support from the governments of member countries will make APEC activities this year useful," he added. According to Hartarto, the decisions to be reached in the forthcoming summit will have a profound global impact as APEC will bring together the East and West countries as well as the North and South nations. APEC, set up in 1989, now groups 17 countries comprising Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei Darussalam, the Philippines, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, People's China, South Korea, Japan, Mexico and Papua New Guinea. The minister further said that the North-South dialogue and economic cooperation will take on a global scale once the dialogue and economic cooperation in Asia and the Pacific become successful. On the first day of the PECC meeting, Hartarto talked about APEC problems, free trade areas and open regionalism. He said that regional trade alliances is now a permanent part of a global trade system and that open regionalism is currently based on regional expansion and global trade. Although designed to support local industries, regional trade alliance is by no means meant to discriminate against corporations from outside the region concerned, he added.
