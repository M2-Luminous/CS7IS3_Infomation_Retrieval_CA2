Garcia] [Text] Havana, 29 Apr (PL) -- After two days of discussions and announcements that were more or less unexpected, a group of emigrants meeting with government representatives expressed their optimism and satisfaction with the first steps in the process to normalize relations. Max Lesnick, a member of the Cuban Change [Cambio Cubano] group and one of 215 participants in The Nation and Emigrants Conference, which is scheduled to conclude here today, views the measures to ease migration policies as positive and beneficial for the entire overseas community. "My presence at the meeting," Lesnick told PRENSA LATINA, "is indicative of my belief that we Cubans must solve our problems without foreign interference. I hope that every step we take will be with mutual respect and with a view toward what is best for Cuba." Foreign Minister Robert Robaina announced yesterday the adoption of several measures to facilitate communication between the emigrants and the country. These measures include eliminating the five-year waiting period required of those who left the island legally before they can visit the country. It was also decided to create an office for emigrant issues, to publish a magazine specializing in migration issues, and to allow emigrants to stay with relatives (instead of having to reserve hotels), and to allow them to study in their country of origin. Businessman Roberto Solis told this news agency of his satisfaction with the decision to allow "our children to study at Cuban universities" and to create an office responsible for looking after and understanding the community. That specific measure, he added, gives us legal support as immigrants in the United States and represents a significant accomplishment to those of us who came to have these discussions. In his opinion, the process of to normalize relations between Cuba and the overseas community got off to a good start because a door was opened that will lead to further communication between both sides. To commentator Marcos Castellon, expectations are high for this meeting because even before the debates ended, concrete and significant results had already been announced. Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said on Saturday that the "process must proceed without haste or pressure and in the most clear-cut manner possible." According to Roberto Carballo, former mercenary of the failed 1961 invasion of Playa Giron and member of the Cuban Committee for Democracy, so far they have made some very significant achievements, but "there is still room for more." Carballo supports a continuation of the process but believes that whatever happens "will depend on solving problems as well as on the United States' lifting of the blockade, which greatly harms the Cuban people." According to Carballo, despite the public rejection of the conference in Miami, "many (he did not mention names) called me to say that they supported my decision to participate because they realize that dialogue with the government is the only thing that can be done." There is a silent majority over there. When they see moments of genuine sincerity to seek solutions, they express their willingness to accept and even to participate in them, he added. One common denominator of this meeting has been the support for statements by the Cuban foreign minister regarding the willingness of authorities "to examine all legal provisions that will ease the way to a normal relationship between the emigrants and the nation." The conference, described by the participants as the first link in a chain, concludes today at the Havana Convention Palace, where the emigrants, government officials, and reporters stand in the corridors and reflect on how the debates are progressing.
