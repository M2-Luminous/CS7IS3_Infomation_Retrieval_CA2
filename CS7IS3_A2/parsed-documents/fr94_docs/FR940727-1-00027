FR940727-1-00027 FR940727-1-00013 5. The proposed rules are set forth at the end of this document. 6. This is a non-restricted notice and comment rulemaking proceeding. Ex parte presentations are permitted, except during the Sunshine Agenda period, provided they are disclosed as specified in the Commission's Rules. See generally 47 CFR 1.1202, 1.1203, and 1.1206(a). 7. In accordance with Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission provides the following: Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Reasons for Action Objectives: This rule making proceeding is initiated to obtain comments concerning proposed rule changes to Part 13 of the Rules to permit a person who has passed the examinations necessary to qualify for a commercial radio operator license, but who has not yet received the license, to temporarily and conditionally perform the functions of a commercial radio operator. Legal Basis: The proposed action is authorized under Sections 4(i), 303(b), 303(g), and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 303 (b), (g), and (r). Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements: None. Federal Rules Which Overlap, Duplicate or Conflict With These Rules: None. Description, Potential Impact, and Number of Small Entities Involved: Any rule changes adopted as a result of this proceeding may affect various small entities that require an individual to hold a commercial radio operator license as a condition of employment. Potentially, small entities could hire commercial radio operator licensees sooner than under present licensing procedures. Any Significant Alternatives Minimizing the Impact on Small Entities Consistent With the Stated Objectives: The Notice solicits comments dealing with and addressing the proposed action, and the Secretary shall send a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rule Making, including the certification, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with paragraph 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Public Law 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612 (1981). 8. This Notice of Proposed Rule Making and the proposed rule amendments are issued under the authority of Sections 4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i) and 303(r). 9. A copy of this Notice of Proposed Rule Making will be forwarded to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. List of Subjects in 47 CFR Part 13 Operator licensing, Radio.
