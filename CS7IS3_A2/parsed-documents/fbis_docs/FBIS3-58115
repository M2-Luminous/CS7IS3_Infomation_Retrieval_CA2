He put on his coat, turned to one of his closest aides, and revealed his good humor with a smile: "But politics is no picnic..." No, the prime minister is not at all worried. In the past 48 hours he has received approval and support from the members of the former four-party alliance, but also from the right and left -- even [Italian Social Movement, MSI, Secretary] Fini said he is willing to accept this government until the elections, as long as the elections take place as soon as possible -- and now the 12 January parliamentary debate no longer represents a trap for Ciampi. When Scalfaro received the prime minister yesterday evening, Ciampi conveyed to him his "satisfaction" with the outcome of the consultations, a satisfaction based on the fact that the parties' "differing positions" are brought together "by a lofty sense of national responsibility." In other words, everyone recognizes the dangers facing the country's economy and international credibility; everyone is aware of how high the stakes are. Strengthened by the support of the president, who has recently discreetly discouraged all attempts to extend artificially the life of the republic's 11th parliament until June, Ciampi is preparing for next Wednesday [12 January] fairly calmly, partly because it seems increasingly evident that it is Scalfaro that will make the final decision to dissolve parliament. The request by the former four-way alliance parties to grant parliament three months in which to reform the procedures for modifying the Constitution, to grant Italians abroad the vote, and to approve the [Justice Minister] Conso bill seems bound not to be taken up. "They could have thought about it earlier," people at the Quirinale [president's office] are saying. There is still a chance for another request -- to postpone the decree dissolving parliament by a few weeks, at least until 30 January, so as to hold the elections 10 April. The official reason -- repeated to Ciampi again yesterday by the SVP [South Tirol People's Party] and the Ladostan Union -- is to permit the approval of a number of laws, including the amendments to the law on the European elections. In fact this justification conceals two other plans -- one "parliamentary," the other political. The former is the motive for a group of some 100 deputies and senators who fear arrest if they lose their parliamentary seats and who want to abolish arrest for a number of offenses. The latter, shared by the DC [Christian Democratic Party], [Fininvest President] Berlusconi, and [Radical leader] Pannella, is to gain at least three weeks in order to permit the proper establishment of the People's Party, to grant the Rooting for Italy group more time to win support, and to continue the gathering of signatures for Pannella's and Bossi's referendum until the end of January. The new factor emerging from these consultations is that the League -- after suggesting that Scalfaro dissolve parliament before the new constituencies were defined, and after announcing the withdrawal of its representatives from parliament as an extreme demand for an immediate election -- is now aiming no longer at 20 March, realistically the earliest possible date, but at 10 April, adding its own voice to those demanding that Scalfaro defer signing the decree a little longer. The League's Senate floor leader, Francesco Speroni, has issued a new threat to the Quirinale ("unless the elections are held 10 April we will return to parliament and engage in unprecedented obstructionism") and [League ideologue] Miglio has again asked Scalfaro to "honor what he said in Bologna," but neither has asked the president to dissolve parliament right away. Now the League would be satisfied with a dissolution at the end of the month. Bossi's haste seems to have vanished into thin air; the League's anxiety seems to have cooled inexplicably. Carlo Azeglio Ciampi revealed to his interlocutors yesterday that he will open the debate on the no-confidence motion with a brief speech ("I will not speak for more than half an hour") and that he wants to hear what all the floor leaders have to say before reaching any decision. According to Rete floor leader Diego Novelli, "the prime minister ruled out absolutely categorically both a reshuffle and a government crisis steered toward a second term." So it is possible that, after listening to the various parties' positions, the prime minister will tender his resignation to the president and initiate the procedures for dissolving parliament. "You must not await the elections," the Greens advised him. After talking with Ciampi, SVP Alto-Adige Deputy Roland Riz, told journalists that he felt that the government "is inclined to hold an election before the European elections." This is nothing new. But then Riz added: "How long before, I do not know. Maybe a week." However, this suggestion was flatly denied by Chigi Palace. Evidently with none of his interlocutors did Ciampi venture to forecast the election date, though it is no secret that the Chigi Palace now regards only the four dates between 20 March and 10 April as realistic. [Rete Secretary] Orlando, Fini, and Cossutta told Ciampi that they prefer the earliest feasible date, namely 20 March, and Novelli went through the calendar with him to show that it is impossible to go beyond that date without risking further parliamentary traps. "There are people in the lower house," he told him, "that live with the fear of going to prison once they leave there, and they would be willing even to start a war with San Marino just to extend this parliament." The prime minister smiled, but made no comment on the observation.
