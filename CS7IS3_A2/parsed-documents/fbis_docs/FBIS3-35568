On the effects of the atrocity on the process of the Gaza-Jericho accord, the head of CSPIR said: The territory of occupied Palestine has witnessed a new move and fervor within the intifada. Though Nazareth used to be considered a safe city for the Zionists so far, it has witnessed popular revolt in recent days.
