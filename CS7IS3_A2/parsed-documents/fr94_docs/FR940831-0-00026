Section 39.13 is amended by adding a new airworthiness directive to read as follows: AD 94&hyph;17&hyph;15␣The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation: Amendment 39&hyph;9010. Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;09&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model F&hyph;28A, F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C2, F&hyph;28F, 280, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters, equipped with main rotor feathering elastomeric Lamiflex bearing (Lamiflex bearing), part numbers (P/N) 28&hyph;14320&hyph;12 or 28&hyph;14320&hyph;15, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the Lamiflex bearing, abnormal vibrations in the airframe and flight control system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following: (a) Within the next 5 hours' time-in-service (TIS) or whenever main rotor tracking and balancing procedures are required more than once in 5 hours' TIS, or abnormal airframe or flight control system vibrations exist, remove and visually inspect the Lamiflex bearing for evidence of delamination in accordance with the Inspection Criteria of paragraph 5.2 in The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Service Directive Bulletin No. 0081, Revision A, dated November 16, 1992. (b) Repeat the inspections of paragraph (a) at intervals not to exceed 100 hours' TIS since the last inspection or during each annual inspection, whichever occurs first. (c) If Lamiflex bearing delamination is found during the inspections required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this AD, replace the Lamiflex bearing with an airworthy Lamiflex bearing before further flight. (d) If any Lamiflex bearing is found that has no date stamped or etched on an end plate, remove and replace it with an airworthy Lamiflex bearing before further flight. (e) No later than 5 years from the date of manufacture of the Lamiflex bearing, remove and replace the Lamiflex bearing with an airworthy Lamiflex bearing. (f) This AD establishes a retirement life of 5 years for the Lamiflex bearing. Note : The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Service Information Letter No. 0097, dated July 1, 1980, pertains to the replacement of the Lamiflex bearing. (g) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Chicago Aircraft Certification Office, FAA. Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager, Chicago Aircraft Certification Office. Note : Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Chicago Aircraft Certification Office. (h) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate helicopters that do not have abnormal vibrations to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.
