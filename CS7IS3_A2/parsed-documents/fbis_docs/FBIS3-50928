The minister said they were on a joint Army-Police control operation. [Begin Gallardo recording] They go upstream and downstream patrolling the Putumayo and San Miguel Rivers. They conduct control operations along the river banks and on vessels navigating the river in an attempt to control and detect drug trafficking activities. [end recording]. The minister confirmed that such activities have been going on for years, and that is why the joint patrols were deployed. The objective is to prevent drug trafficking and guerrilla activities in the northern part of the country, particularly along the Colombian border. The defense minister reaffirmed that the Colombians being held by authorities are the guerrillas who killed the Ecuadoran policemen and soldiers. The guerrillas were found in possession of weapons and jewelry that had belonged to the policemen. [Begin Gallardo recording] One guerrilla said: My grandfather gave it to me. We went to the grandfather's house and asked him if he had given the guerrilla the watch ten years ago. He said no. Then the guerrilla said he bought it at another place. We went there and he had not bought the watch there, either. The watch belonged to one of the slain men. You must understand that guerrillas do not parade around with weapons and signs saying: I am a guerrilla. They hide their weapons immediately. They wear the clothes of common peasants. Their appearance is completely misleading. [end recording] The minister said they look like innocent peasants, but they are really guerrillas who operate in the northern part of the country and who are guilty of killing Ecuadoran policemen and soldiers.
