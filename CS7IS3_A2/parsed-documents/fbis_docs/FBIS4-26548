The seniority with pay has been stipulated clearly in the basic law and there is also financial guarantee in this regard, Lu said, referring to the idea that a fund be set up before China resumes the exercise of power over Hong Kong in 1997. With its promises on this and other matters, the Chinese government will never try to shift its responsibility, Lu told a visiting delegation from the association of the former senior civil servants of Hong Kong, led by former secretary for land and works Chan Nai-keong. Hong Kong civil servants can continue their service after 1997, Lu said. Only the chief civil servants will have to be nominated by the chief administrator of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and confirmed by the central government, which is designed to make the future government highly efficient. During the meeting, Lu Ping also solicited opinions from the group on the links between the future executive and legislative bodies. Some proposed that more Hong Kong civil servants should have access to Chinese courses on the mainland to enable them to learn more about it, with which Lu agreed.
