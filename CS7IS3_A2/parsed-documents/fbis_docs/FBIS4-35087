It is seen that foreign capital is increasing its presence in the domestic market by forming strategic alliances. This will promote the emergence of oligopolies that will limit the free participation of Mexican enterprises. Key partnerships are appearing in the commercial area with Gigante-Fleming; Gigante-Carrefou; Liverpool-K-Mart; Comercial Mexicana-Price Club; Comercial Mexicana-Toys'r'Us; and Cifra-WalMart. The incursion of firms with foreign capital is not limited to a single sector of the economy. They also include the food, textile, and tourism sectors.
