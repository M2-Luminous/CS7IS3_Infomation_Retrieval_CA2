The delegation was introduced to Eduard Shevardnadze by Tengiz Geleishvili, who has been involved for the past five months in developing a program suggested by the EBRD. The visitors expressed surprise that the Georgian Parliament did not confirm Tengiz Geleishvili's nomination to the post of chairman of the Committee of Foreign Economic Relations. Part of the 2 billion ECU [European Currency Unit] allotted by the EBRD to the republics of the former Soviet Union will be used in Georgia to develop private business, revive the economy and industry, improve international telecommunications and reach financial stabilization. Work on a large project is approaching its end. Taking into consideration the current critical situation in Georgia, a team working on this project has made a decision to start work on the Enguri hydropower station, the Rioni hydropower station, and other substations. Some $40 million have been allotted for this purpose. Apart from such priorities, the program stipulates restoration and reconstruction of Georgian sea ports, financial stabilization of Georgian banks, creation of an infrastructure required for starting the republic's industry, and improvement of the network of international telecommunications. This will encourage business and financing of small- and medium-sized enterprises. At the end of the meeting, Eduard Shevardnadze said: We believe that our relations are quite serious and large-scale. I have to admit that we are in a great hurry and therefore, I think we have to work out a joint program, which will determine the exact time and work details. The program will reflect present and future work and if events develop as we hope, normal working conditions will be established very soon, I am sure.
