In the latest issue of NODONG SINMUN, the Workers' (Communist) Party organ, the senior Kim was quoted as saying that he felt a lump in his throat whenever he saw the junior Kim wearing a plain jacket and that people should lead a plain lifestyle like him. Kim also said that Comrade Kim Chong-il does not care much to appear in the limelight, as he thinks all he has to do is to give devoted servitude to the people and the nation. Earlier, the senior Kim also told the party rank and file that Kim Chong-il was "the people's leader" fit to succeed him. In a letter to a national conference of "party cell secretaries" which opened in Pyongyang March 31, the North Korean top leader said that the cause of the party was "honorably carried on under the leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il who possesses excellent personality and qualities as the people's leader," according to the Korean Central Broadcasting Station.
