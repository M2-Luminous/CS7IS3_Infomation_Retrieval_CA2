FR940928-0-00016 FR940928-0-00004 7 CFR Part 1004 [DA&hyph;94&hyph;19] Milk in the Middle Atlantic Marketing Area; Suspension of Certain Provisions of the Order AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Suspension of rule. SUMMARY: This document suspends certain provisions of the Middle Atlantic Federal milk marketing order for the months of September 1994 through February 1995. The suspension reduces the percent of receipts that must be disposed of as Class I disposition by pool distributing plants, provides automatic pool plant status for supply plants and reserve processing plants that were pool plants during the preceding months of September through February, and suspends the limit on the amount of milk that may be diverted to nonpool plants by cooperative associations and by pool plant operators. The suspension was requested by several Middle Atlantic cooperatives and handlers. The suspension is necessary to assure that producer milk historically associated with the market will continue to be pooled and priced under the order without incurring unnecessary and uneconomic movements solely for the purpose of maintaining pool status. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 1, 1994, through February 28, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gino M. Tosi, Marketing Specialist, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, (202) 690&hyph;1366. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Prior document in this proceeding: Notice of Proposed Suspension: Issued August 8, 1994; published August 12, 1994 (59 FR 41413). The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers will continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. This order of suspension is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Middle Atlantic marketing area.
