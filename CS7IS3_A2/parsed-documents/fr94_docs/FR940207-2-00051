FR940207-2-00051 FR940207-2-00028 Project History The Parker Dam Power Project was authorized by section 2 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of August 30, 1935 (49 Stat. 1028, 1039), and the Davis Dam Project was authorized April 26, 1941, by the Acting Secretary of the Interior under Provisions of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 (43 U.S.C. ยง485 et seq. ). The P&hyph;DP was formed by the consolidation of the two projects under the terms of the Act of May 28, 1954 (68 Stat. 143). Davis Dam, which creates Lake Mohave, provides regulation, both hourly and seasonally, of the water releases from Lake Mead (through Hoover Dam and Powerplant) to facilitate water delivery for downstream irrigation requirements and for water delivery beyond the boundary of the United States as required by the Mexican Water Treaty. Operation of the powerplant began in January 1951 with a generating capacity of 225,000 kW. During the period 1974&hyph;78 the generator nameplate capacity was increased to 240,000 kW by rewinding the generator stators. Construction of Parker Dam was authorized for the purposes of controlling floods, improving river navigation, regulating the flow of the Colorado River, providing for storage and for the delivery of the stored waters thereof, for the reclamation of public lands and Indian reservations and for other beneficial uses, and for the generation of electric energy as a means of making the P&hyph;DP a self-supporting and financially solvent undertaking. Parker Dam was constructed by Reclamation with funds advanced by MWD. Lake Havasu, the reservoir created behind Parker Dam, serves as the forebay from which water is diverted into the MWD aqueduct. The aqueduct delivers a major portion of California's entitlement of Colorado River water to southern California and is the diversion point for delivering Central Arizona Project water to Arizona. The reservoir operation is limited to minor storage fluctuations. The dam provides a head of approximately 75 feet for the Parker Powerplant. Reclamation began operation of the Parker Powerplant in December 1942. Although the total generator nameplate capacity is 120,000 kW, the powerplant capacity is essentially limited to 104,000 kW because of operating constraints of downstream physical structures, primarily Headgate Rock Dam. Under contract, MWD is entitled to one-half of the net energy generated by the Parker Powerplant at any given time. All facilities of the P&hyph;DP were operated and maintained by Reclamation until the formation of DOE pursuant to the DOE Act, enacted by Congress on August 4, 1977. Pursuant to section 302 of the DOE Act (42 U.S.C. ยง7152), responsibility for the power marketing functions of Reclamation, including the construction, operation, and maintenance of substations, transmission lines, and attendant facilities, was transferred to Western. The responsibility for operation and maintenance of the dams and powerplants remains with Reclamation. Power Repayment Studies PRSs are prepared each FY to determine if power revenues will be sufficient to pay, within the prescribed time periods, all costs assigned to the power function. Repayment criteria are based on law, policies, and authorizing legislation. DOE Order No. RA 6120.2, section 12.b, states: In addition to the recovery of the above costs (operation and maintenance and interest expenses) on a year-by-year basis, the expected revenues are at least sufficient to recover (1) each dollar of power investment at Federal hydroelectric generating plants within 50 years after they become revenue producing, except as otherwise provided by law; plus, (2) each annual increment of Federal transmission investment within the average service life of such transmission facilities or within a maximum of 50 years, whichever is less; plus, (3) the cost of each replacement of a unit of property of a Federal power system within its expected service life up to a maximum of 50 years; plus, (4) each dollar of assisted irrigation investment within the period established for the irrigation water users to repay their share of construction costs; plus (5) other costs such as payments to basin funds, participating projects, or States.
