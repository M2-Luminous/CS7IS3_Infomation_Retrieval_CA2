Islam is also portrayed as an intolerant and its followers as fanatics craving for war. He said the Western media frequently resorted to tactics of generalization and simplification to portray Islam's image by claiming that the Islamic movements in Algeria and Afghanistan, for instance, were also prevalent in other countries. All these were described as that of Islamic fundamentalists. The Western media went to the extent of describing the victory of the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria in 1992 as the victory of totalitarianism of democracy. Datuk Sri Najib said Islamic leaders are often associated with a negative image even if they had achieved economic excellence for the benefit of their people. He made these remarks at the forum on current challenges in the Islamic world and the role of Malaysia, organized by the Malaysian Strategic Research Center in Kuala Lumpur.
