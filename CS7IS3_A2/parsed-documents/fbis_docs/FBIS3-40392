The European space "Alliance" formed over one year ago between Aerospatiale, Alcatel Espace, Alenia Spazio and Deutsche Aerospace has not grown stronger with time. Quite the opposite, judging from some recent "episodes," which incidentally are not to be credited specifically to any one of the partners, but which raise questions about the true effectiveness of the association the four firms created to build civilian and military satellites, particularly for telecommunications. For example, some express shock at what they call "the Artemis scandal"-- arising from the fact that Alenia Spazio is getting paid to develop a new 2.5 ton-class satellite platform instead of building the ESA's relay satellites (see A&C No. 1443), while the Alliance has in principle decided to standardize its platforms by opting for the Spacebus 2000 and 3000 developed by Aerospatiale and DASA. Another disagreement which is depriving some members of considerable financial support is the "absence" of Alcatel Espace--as well as of the major American partner Space Systems/Loral--alongside Aerospatiale and DASA, promoters of the Nahuelsat company which will take charge of building the Nahuel Argentine telecommunications satellite (see A&C No. 1448). Another similar occurrence is the "questioning" of the SS/L European partners who are still very reluctant to commit financially along with Loral for its Globalstar telecommunications satellite constellation project. As a last incident (to-date), there is the unilateral DASA "initiative" to create together with China, a joint company to manufacture and sell telecommunications satellites and eventually observation satellites, a project which may (to a certain extent at least) compete with the Alliance's activities (see A&C No. 1448). The Alliance therefore has limits which a good grasp of commercial interest will not hesitate to cross. Thus, for example, Aerospatiale is again joining with Matra Marconi Space to build second generation weather satellites (MSG). We are told that "this is a pragmatic decision. You don't replace a winning team." True, if you consider that indeed, in technical and operational terms, Meteosat is a model program. The occasional partnership of Aerospatiale and Matra in space (as well as in missiles, with the Apache) is not in fact as surprising as it may seem: the two firms also collaborate on Helios, Eutelsat 2, and so on. It has even been pointed out that "Matra is both the prime customer and the prime supplier for Aerospatiale!" All of this can be considered rather healthy, showing the adaptability and therefore the dynamism of satellite builders. But in that case, what is the use of an "Alliance"?
