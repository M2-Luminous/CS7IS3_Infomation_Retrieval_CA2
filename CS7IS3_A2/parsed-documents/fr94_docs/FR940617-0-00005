FR940617-0-00005 FR940617-0-00003 In order to guide the federal agencies in implementing the FPPA, section 1541(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4202(a), directs the Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with other departments, agencies, independent commissions, and other units of the federal government, to ``develop criteria for identifying the effects of Federal programs on the conversion of farmland to nonagricultural uses.'' The Department issued these criteria in its current rule implementing the FPPA at 7 CFR 658.4 and 658.5. The FPPA also authorizes the Department to provide technical assistance to federal, state, and local government agencies to develop programs or policies to limit the conversion of productive farmland to nonagricultural uses, and this is covered in the current rule at 7 CFR 658.7. In addition, section 1542 of the FPPA, 7 U.S.C. 4203, requires ``each department, agency, independent commission, or other unit of the Federal Government'' to review its laws, administrative rules, policies and procedures ``to determine whether any provision thereof will prevent'' the federal entity ``from taking appropriate action to comply fully'' with the FPPA, and to ``develop proposals for action to bring its programs, authorities, and administrative activities into conformity with the purpose and policy'' of the FPPA. The Act does not expressly require a federal agency to modify any project solely to avoid or minimize the effects of conversion of farmland to nonagricultural uses. The Act merely requires that, before taking or approving any action that would result in conversion of farmland as defined by the FPPA, the federal agency examine the effects of that action using the criteria which the Department of Agriculture has supplied and, if there are adverse effects, to consider alternatives to lessen those effects. Once the agency has completed this examination, it may proceed with a project that would convert farmland to nonagricultural uses. As originally enacted, the FPPA contained a prohibition against the use of the Act as a basis for litigation. Section 1548 states that the FPPA ``shall not be deemed to provide a basis'' for any litigation '`challenging a Federal project, program or other activity that may affect farmland.'' 7 U.S.C. 4209. In the 1985 amendments to the FPPA, Congress amended this section to allow the governor of a state to bring a suit to enforce compliance with section 1542 (7 U.S.C. 4202) and related regulations. II. Discussion of the Existing Regulations to Implement the FPPA The current regulations were promulgated principally to enable federal agencies, with the help of the Soil Conservation Service (SCS), to measure the adverse effects, if any, of their programs and projects on farmland. The SCS has developed a Farmland Conversion Impact Rating Form, Form AD&hyph;1006, for this purpose. A federal agency considering a project on or affecting farmland completes and submits a Form AD&hyph;1006 to a local SCS office. The SCS determines if the proposed site or sites contain farmland subject to the FPPA, i.e., farmland that is ``prime,'' ``unique,'' or of ``statewide or local importance,'' as defined by the FPPA. If SCS determines that the site or sites are not subject to the Act, SCS returns the form to the agency with that determination noted. However, if SCS determines that the FPPA applies, SCS measures the ``relative value'' of the site or sites as farmland on a scale of 0 to 100, enters this score on the Form AD&hyph;1006 and returns the form to the federal agency. At this stage, the agency prepares a site assessment using twelve criteria set forth in the rule. After scoring each of the criteria and arriving at a total site assessment score, up to a maximum of 160 points, the agency adds this site assessment score to the ``relative value'' score that was supplied by the SCS on the Form AD&hyph;1006. The higher the combined score, the more suitable the site would be for protection as farmland. On the other hand, if a site receives a combined score of less than 160 points, the regulation recommends that it be given only ``a minimal level of consideration for protection'' and that additional sites do not need to be evaluated as alternatives. Although the primary purpose of the Department's regulations implementing the FPPA was to impart these criteria and the guidelines for their use by agencies, the rule, in addition, established the Department's policy as to the farmlands that are subject to the FPPA, and as to the effect that the FPPA could have on private parties and nonFederal units of government applying for federal assistance to convert farmland to nonagricultural uses. With regard to the first matter, the FPPA's definition of ``prime farmland,'' excludes ``land already in or committed to urban development or water storage.'' Section 1540(c)(1)(A), 7 U.S.C. 4201(c)(1)(A). The current regulation, ยง658.2(a), provides that prime farmland is ``committed to urban development or water storage'' if a local zoning code or ordinance or current local comprehensive land use plan designated this land for commercial or industrial use or for residential use that is not intended at the same time to protect farmland. With regard to the second issue, the current regulation, ยง658.3(c), sets forth the Department's determination that the FPPA does not authorize a federal agency to withhold assistance to a project solely because that project was going to convert farmland to nonagricultural uses.
