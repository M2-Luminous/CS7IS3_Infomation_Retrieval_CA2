"President Li would become the third foreign head of state to give a speech to the Nicaraguan Parliament," said Hou Ching-shan, an official with the Ministry's Central & South American Affairs Department, who is fresh from visiting Nicaragua to arrange Li's trip. "It would be the highest honor accorded to the head of a foreign state," Hou said. President Li will arrive in Nicaragua on May 4 and then meet with Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, Hou said, adding that a joint statement will be issued following the meeting. Li will also visit a Taiwan-owned textile factory that employ 1,500 workers, making it the largest single employer of textile workers in Central America. From Nicaragua, Li will proceed to Costa Rica on May 6 to attend the inaugural ceremony for President-Elect Jose Maria Figueres. Li will be awarded a medal by Costa Rica in recognition of his contribution in promoting ties between the two countries. A joint communique will also be issued after a meeting between Li and the outgoing Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon. Accompanying Li on the two-leg visit will be Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu, Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, and Governor Samuel C. Shieh of the Central Bank of China. Nicaragua and Costa Rica, along with five other Latin American countries, submitted a letter to United Nations Scretary-General Butros Butros Ghali last August requesting that the United Nations put the Republic of China's UN bid on the agenda for the 48th General Assembly in September 1993. The request was later voted down.
