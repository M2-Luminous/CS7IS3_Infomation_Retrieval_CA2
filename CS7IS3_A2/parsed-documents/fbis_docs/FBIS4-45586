The Prime Minister told the European Summit in Corfu it was time to bring European policies closer to the people in the wake of a Euro election which demonstrated widespread apathy about the EU's relevance. He said the two key issues were unemployment and crime, and he urged his fellow European leaders to back a new initiative to beat crime and fraud. Mr Major said that since the start of the year enough cocaine had been seized in the EU countries for 24 million individual doses--with a street value of 840 million pounds sterling. "We must protect our young people from this trade and we need a clear action plan," he said. The Major proposals are: --A European convention on intelligence gathering and anti-crime cooperation completed by October --A concerted attack by the newly-created Europol, based in The Hague, and national authorities on drug trafficking and organised crime --The close involvement of the countries of central and Eastern Europe in anti-drug measures --A conference on drugs and organised crime under the forthcoming German EU presidency --Agreement to streamline national criminal laws and punishments for cross-border crime and fraud by the end of this year. Intelligence gathering was the key to success, Mr Major said, but he stopped short of suggesting that Europol should involve an active police force in addition to its role as a data and information exchange system for crime prevention squads in the member states. It was now time to give the drugs problem top priority in Europe, with the accent on education as well as investigation. Mr Major said fraud cost Europe's taxpayers millions every year. He cited a recent investigation which uncovered subsidies of 65 million pounds sterling which were paid out by Brussels in the form of grants for non-existent supplies of wheat. He wants the Corfu Summit to include a firm commitment, particularly on drugs, in its final conclusions tomorrow afternoon. The Prime Minister was speaking in the first round of talks at the summit, following an invitation from Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou to address one of the most pressing problems confronting the EU.
