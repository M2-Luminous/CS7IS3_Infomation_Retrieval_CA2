Pathom Phanityanuson from the Foreign Trade Department does not think so. In a statement contradicting all the optimism prevailing in the business community since the embargo was lifted, he said, "the mutual trade value between Thailand and Vietnam is expected to decline, while the restrictions on commerce are likely to increase." At yesterday's seminar on "The Trade and Investment Policy After the American Lifting of its Trade Embargo on Vietnam", Pathom appeared to be cautious about the positive anticipations of mutual trade ties between the two countries expanding. He said the end to the embargo would instead prompt the Vietnamese government to adjust its economic structure by promoting import ubstitutions and preserving the available raw materials for local investors. In short, this would mean Thailand no longer being able to import raw materials like teak, minerals and ore from Vietnam, while Thai investors would find it more difficult to sell their goods. "The Vietnamese government will likely implement import restrictions via three measures; by setting high tariffs, introducing quotas and restricting the volume of imports in industries it is trying to promote," he said. For example, the Vietnamese government recently announced it will be restricting 16 categories of imports. "Thai investors should therefore make a profound study before deciding to enter into any business in Vietnam," he suggested. [passage omitted] In the short run, Pathom suggested Thai businessmen should adjust their business strategy to cope with the new investment promotions of the Vietnamese government. Instead of expecting to import only raw materials from this emerging economy, Thai investors should cooperate with local Vietnamese businessmen in areas where they can share expertise, such as processed-farm goods or textiles. "Else, we should act as a marketing gateway for Vietnamese sellers in the same way the Dutch resold Thai tapioca exports in the European market," he said. [passage omitted] Dr Sutham Yu-Naitham said Thai investors would be well-positioned to participate in a wide range of services, such as hotels, distribution and human resource development. "Thais have somehow been overlooked [though they have] strong expertise in the service sector." he said. Loxley Plc's Thongchai Lamsum, whose company is already in Vietnam providing household telephone services, thinks differently. While others identify hotels and tourism management as primary service industries for local investors to bring to Vietnam, he identified hospitals and fast food businesses as more likely to succeed. "The Vietnamese have more purchasing power than we think they have," Thongchai said. Like others, he also identified the consumer products industry as a potential candidate for investment. He said others include computers and PABX telephone services, including installation and repair. Narong Chiwangkun, the managing director of Kodak (Thailand) Co Ltd, seemed to agree with Thongchai's identification of potential industries Thais will be able to compete in. "[Were] Thailand a company and I its managing director, I would identify the industries we Thais are to go into Vietnam [with]. Industries which cannot compete need not to go there," Narong said. Several of the speakers said both Bangkok and Hanoi still had certain problems that immediate remedies had to be found for. On the Vietnamese side, problems usually identified are the difficult Vietnamese investment laws, red tape, inadequate infrastructure and poor management. On the Thai side, Vietnamese investors seem to distrust their Thai counterparts. Thai investors, according to several speakers, were viewed as exploiters, rather than as good-willed investors. Le Cong Phung, the Vietnamese Ambassador to Thailand, yesterday affirmed the lifting of U.S. embargo will not bring about a sudden explosion of economic development via U.S. investment there. "Rather, it will psychologically relieve our friends to cooperate and invest in Vietnam," Phung said. The ambassador emphatically said the new situation will not divert his government's foreign policy and economic relations with other countries, especially those in Southeast Asia. "I can assure you we have and continue to encourage and promote the economic cooperation, trade and investment with Thailand. It is our consistent policy,'' he said.
