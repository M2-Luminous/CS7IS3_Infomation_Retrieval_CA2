Muzhitskikh, chairman of the board of the Elektrobank Commercial Bank, under the rubric "Competent Opinion": "The Difficulties Experienced by Commercial Banks Are Not Diminishing"] [Text] Despite the criticism leveled against the Central Bank, commercial banks, and other credit and financial institutions, the banks are ensuring on the whole the normal operation of the economy during the most complicated period of transition from a totalitarian to a market economy, all the current difficulties notwithstanding. This is what V.V. Muzhitskikh, chairman of the board of the Elektrobank Commercial Bank and the author of this article offered to you, believes. However, in his opinion, many problems affecting the banking sector not only remain unsolved but are even being aggravated. Legislation is the first problem. The debate over to whom the Central Bank is subordinated goes on. We need stability in the interests of the strength of our credit and monetary system, the reliability of commercial banks, the exchange rate, and the general prestige of the country. The replacement of Central Bank chiefs, which is easy and poorly substantiated, as we have seen on occasion, cannot be allowed to occur. Within the framework of strict legislation, the Central Bank should have the power to be able, if necessary, to oppose both government structures and local organs in defending the interests of strengthening the ruble and the entire credit and monetary system, all the more so because in keeping with the new constitution, expansion of the rights of local government organs is envisioned. Naturally, under the new conditions we need such a Central Bank and such laws as will ensure normal balanced development of our monetary and credit system and at the same time strengthen the role of commercial banks. Significant success will not be achieved in the absence of this. I do not maintain that the Central Bank is free of flaws. However, on the other hand, I am convinced that this organ should have a special status which should be codified in legislation. The argument over to whom the Central Bank should be subordinated--the president, the government, the parliament, or the Ministry of Finance--is superfluous. Foreign experience indicates that the state of affairs in the economy is far better in countries in which the Central Bank acts as an independent state structure, as compared to countries where the bank plays a secondary role, being subordinated and resubordinated to various government structures. As far as commercial banks are concerned, a number of legislative acts have been developed which envision reinforcing their role. The adoption of these laws was delayed by events everybody is aware of. We have 1,800 commercial banks, for each of which there are two branches on the average. In essence, most of them cannot be considered banks at all. Only some banks--the Mosbiznesbank and certain other banks--have weighty grounds to operate on an equal footing with foreign banks both at home and abroad. Meanwhile, the good performance of a bank does not necessarily hinge on the size of its capital. All kinds of banks are needed, large and small alike; they complement one another and form a unified banking system serving the Russian economy. Much has been said and written in our country about improvements in the operation of commercial banks--computerization, credit cards, and so on. All this is fine; however, a completely different qualitative standard for operation of the banking system is needed. Settlements are the most pressing problem. No matter how much the Central Bank and commercial banks are criticized in this area, the settlement situation will not change until the state of affairs in the economy improves. If an enterprise is insolvent, what has this got to do with the bank, even if the latter delays documents for collection? The state sector of the economy is suffering the greatest economic losses. To this day its monopoly position virtually has not changed; production outlays have not been reduced. State enterprises have long been insolvent. However, taking advantage of their monopoly position, they have continued to demand still new credit. Our bank services the largest enterprises of the fuel and energy complex. These enterprises are still convinced that they will receive funds from the budget to cover their losses because of their monopoly standing. Getting funds from the budget means getting them from me and you. A tribute of 1,000 rubles [R] has been exacted from each resident of Russia in order to cover the losses of the enterprises of the energy complex. We have already come to the decision to stop financing the hopelessly unprofitable enterprises which are being sustained by banks. For this reason, commercial banks are forced to sharply reduce the issuance of credit: they have no right to risk their clients' funds. When they talk about a debt of R16 trillion, they think for some reason that this situation is advantageous for commercial banks, forgetting in the process that a slowdown in the turnover of funds unavoidably brings about excessive outlays for the banks, and that the issue of settlements may only be resolved through the joint effort of the government, the Central Bank, commercial banks, and enterprises. Anyone who thinks that the commercial banks alone and the Central Bank can solve everything is in grave error. The enterprises themselves and the entire economy should be restructured. Each group of commercial banks strives to create its own computer system, without which it is no longer possible to operate. Special satellite communications systems are being designed, but at present there is no money in the country to create a global communications system. Nonetheless, it is unwise to disperse funds by creating local and regional systems. We should pool efforts in this area and gradually create a unified communications and information system similar to SWIFT [Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication] out of regional systems. Providing escorts to clients abroad is the next issue. If we look at foreign experience, all the banks provide escorts for their clients in virtually all countries of the world. This is a quite expensive endeavor calling for relevant cadres and the knowledge of legislation. Practice has indicated that this task will not be accomplished without training specialists abroad. There are opportunities for that. The government of Switzerland has a program for retraining our specialists so that they will later work in our representative offices abroad. The cost of training one specialist comes to $700 a year. This is a feasible sum, and we should coordinate efforts to this end and determine the need for specialists and a schedule for training them. Our country lacks a primary center for cadre training and retraining. In conjunction with this I would like to say that our bank has suitable parcels of land, and we could join together with other banks to establish such a primary center. The Association of Russian Banks could offer assistance in this endeavor. We should be aware that at present we are still getting by with cadres who were trained in the environment of a centralized economy. Training new cadres of bank employees is our most important common task. Nobody will accomplish it for us. The issue of investment is one of the greatest problems. If we exist for another year or two within the same arrangement as at present, an overwhelming number of enterprises which ensure the maintenance of the economy at a certain level will shut down because of the wear on fixed assets. Equipment has been 70-80 percent depreciated in the fuel and energy sector and in metallurgy. The enterprises are in danger of shutting down. Some attach their hopes to banks. However, even if we scrape up all the monies, including statutory capital, this will be nothing compared to what is needed. Where are resources to be obtained? They are available in the country. Many different off-budget investment funds have emerged in Russia. They are disbursed haphazardly; funds are transferred from one region to another, and frequently disappear and get dispersed there. They should be concentrated for investment in the fuel and energy complex, a base industry which ensures the viability of the entire economy. Otherwise, we will be threatened with a reduction in electricity generation and a new increase in rates for it. We cannot agree with the existing system for the distribution of investment. The government commission for substantiating the requests of ministries and departments prepares a decision for the Ministry of Finance. In the process, everybody gets as much as he can grab. It is not economic effectiveness or the speed and security of repayment of credit that are the main arguments but rather the fact that construction has begun. The supporters of this procedure refer to the fact that the collective and the equipment are idle, that funds have already been invested in the construction project, and so on. Meanwhile, there is little accounting for whether it is necessary to complete all construction projects under the current conditions and what the returns from the newly built enterprise will be. Under such conditions, the banks are put at an impasse. Who will pay back their credit? Each new appropriation is processed as a one-time act, while the construction project drags on for several years. We usually say: We will still give you money this year, and we will see about later. Recently the chairman of the State Construction Committee reported that one-third of the facilities had to be shut down. So, why were they financed in 1992, and who will pay back the credit now? The economy indeed needs many of these facilities, but banks cannot invest their resources in this manner. It is necessary to revisit the issue of creating a specialized group of bank-government agents under the Ministry of Finance. They exist in a number of countries and have acquitted themselves well. However, this does not amount to the creation of a parallel government system for the management of state property. Bank-government agents should evaluate locally the effectiveness of investment and opportunities for its quick recovery, rather than be mere transshipment points: We have issued you centralized credit, you clean up the mess yourselves. Nothing like this exists anywhere in the world. The banks under the Ministry of Finance should ensure the safety of investment and study its effectiveness. They should possess a powerful expert and auditor staff. We cannot allow money to be committed to construction projects without an analysis of the effectiveness of its spending and opportunities for recoupment anymore. Here is one more problem associated with investment: guarantees to foreign capital which could be used as a supplemental investment resource. It is feasible to create a banking company to this end. One such company has already been established. It is a very large structure compared to our banks. Its combined capital assets come to R240 billion. Such a company may finance a number of large projects and extend credit to them in many regions of the country on its own, without using the resources of the Central Bank. Banks belonging to the company remain independent and are not subordinated to the government or other structures. In addition to banks, two of the largest state-industrial corporations belong to this company. At present, the company is being registered by the Central Bank. When this process is completed successfully, we will obtain one of the most important structures which, on the one hand, will be able to independently issue guarantees to foreign banks, while on the other hand it will conduct negotiations on behalf of the banks belonging to it about attracting investment to our country. Besides, unlike the previous practices whereby guarantees to foreign investors were issued only by the state banks and the government, the new company will be able to also give such guarantees in cases in which it is approached by banks that do not belong to it. In the process, we should not hope to obtain significant credit resources in the West. The process of renewal of fixed assets has begun there, and they need money themselves. We have sufficient resources ourselves, but they should be raised and pooled, which only the companies are in a position to do. We will not secure major success without creating such companies and using budgetary appropriations correctly, on the basis of repayment. A report surfaced in the press to the effect that a decree on commercialization of commercial banks has been prepared. Upon familiarization with this document it came out that at issue was the transfer to the State Committee on Administration of State Property of all the capital of former state enterprises with all the dividends, and the buildings and structures which the banks are now leasing. This amounts to R40 trillion in current terms. If this decision is made, we will all end up as Mr. Chubays's property. This decision was prepared without the participation of the Central Bank, which once again indicates the government's lack of appreciation for it. So far, we have succeeded in stopping the document, and we are trying to have it amended. Nonetheless, our representatives are still not participating in working on it. How can such an important issue of the national economy be resolved without the banks? It turns out that everybody has converted to joint-stock operations and has undergone a voucher process, but the banks have been forgotten. Now they have suddenly remembered the banks, and want to make the State Committee on Administration of State Property the owner of all banks. What will this bring about? When the capital of banks is bought out with vouchers or in some other manner, the statutory capital of the banks will be softened. A tremendous number of shareholders will come along. Our bank made such an assessment, and it resulted in 103,000 shareholders with registered shares. Our computer took three days to process this data base. Now imagine settlements on contributions, and so forth. In turn, there are almost 1,800 commercial banks! Why was everything reduced to registered stock? After all, there is the tax service, which should control profits from stocks. Besides, mandatory registered stock restricts the circulation of the shares on the stock exchange. While the banking system has still accomplished something under market conditions, the decision in question will set it far back. In this situation, a clear-cut law is needed, rather than rushing back and forth. I think that in all this we could be helped by a unified national association and individual banking associations created on the regional principle, as they now are. The national association could represent us before the Central Bank, the government, and the Federal Assembly and ensure more effective decisions which would indeed take the interests of bankers into account.
