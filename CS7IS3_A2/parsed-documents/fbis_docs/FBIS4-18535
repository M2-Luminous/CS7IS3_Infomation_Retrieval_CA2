We should, therefore, pay attention to the statement made on Thursday, 31 March, by the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman when he announced the visit to Beijing and Shanghai 7-10 April by Mr. Balladur, the first French Government chief to visit China in 16 years, after a quarrel lasting two years. Claiming to be answering a question he was asked on possible contracts which could be signed during the visit, spokesman Wu Jianmin said in his weekly meeting with the press that the improvement in political relations was bound to benefit bilateral "economic and commercial cooperation." This can be interpreted to mean that no contracts will be signed during the visit, described as "important," but primarily aimed, in the mind of the Beijing authorities, at erasing the "mistake" made by Paris in selling arms to Taiwan. This is not really a surprise, but it is rare for China to take the trouble to clarify things in advance to this extent. It is true that Edouard Balladur has made it known that he is not coming to Beijing as a foreign trade representative, but that his visit is of a symbolic nature likely to revive bilateral relations. This may partly explain some of the pomp of the visit. The prime minister will be accompanied in theory by around 30 senior civil servants and around 60 journalists, but also by no fewer than 50 personal guests, including one of his sons, his driver, and two head waiters. During his visit in November, German Chancellor Kohl also brought a large delegation, but one mostly made up of businessmen. Mr. Balladur will reside at the state residence of the Fishermen's Terrace --the former residence of the Manchurian Empire's grand eunuchs, situated in the west of Beijing. Turned into a hotel for foreign dignitaries, it also houses the most select and expensive private club in post-Maoist China. The prime minister and his delegation will be granted the great privilege of entering the Forbidden City by car to visit some of the imperial apartments. In his two days in Beijing, in addition to the Chinese leaders, Mr. Balladur will meet with selected representatives of the French business community, as he will in Shanghai. In terms with the people, he will host a dinner at the French ambassador's residence for several prominent figures, including one of Deng Xiaoping's daughters, the painter Deng Ling. In Shanghai, the prime minister will have a short meeting with local economic officials. If all goes as expected, the political police will prevent him from having to settle the dilemma which the presence in Beijing of prominent dissidents would have presented for him -- most of them, including Wei Jingsheng, were moved elsewhere more than a month ago.
