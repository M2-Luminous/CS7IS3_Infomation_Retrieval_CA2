Many people are discussing the topic: What will happen in China when Deng dies? Deng Once Again Rectifies the Behavior of Senior Leaders Deng Xiaoping arrived in Shanghai at the end of November last year, just as the senior level in China was vigorously carrying out activities to commemorate the 100th birthday of Mao Zedong. These activities were not planned to be on such large scale when the senior level of the CPC made arrangements in May of last year. By last September, CPC elders Chen Yun, Peng Zhen, and others directly intervened and decided at short notice that the scale of the commemorative activities must be expanded. The demand by Chen, Peng, and others was: Mao Zedong was the creator of New China and the founder of the CPC, and today's China is a continuation of China's revolutionary yesterday and a development of the undertaking initiated by Mao Zedong; this history cannot be cut apart. We are all Mao Zedong's students, and what we are doing are the things which Mao Zedong wanted to do but failed to do. We must carry out education of this kind for the broad masses, establish the high authority of the CPC, and establish the authority of the third generation of CPC leaders with Jiang Zemin as the core. It was against this background that the senior level of the CPC launched activities to commemorate the 100th birthday of Mao Zedong in an extraordinary scale, and praises for Mao Zedong rolled like great waves, while some "leftists" within the party who had ceaselessly attacked reform and opening up on the mainland through various pretenses in recent years, also took the chance to "give vent to their anger" and voiced their grievances against the policy of reform and opening up. One of their methods was to blur the difference between the Mao Zedong era and Deng Xiaoping era, obscure the difference between the "socialism" before the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and the "socialism" after the reform and opening up, cover up Mao Zedong's serious theoretical and policy failures and the great disasters they brought to the Chinese people, and attempt to recreate "the fairy tale of Mao Zedong." The wild performance by the "leftist" forces within the party was naturally resisted by persons of various quarters, as well as the people on the mainland. Among the senior leaders of the CPC, Wan Li, the former chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, refused to attend or participate in any activities "commemorating Mao Zedong." Many conditions were conveyed to the Deng Xiaoping Office, and Deng Xiaoping asked after hearing them: "Is Deng Liqun (people call him the underground general secretary) very active? This is a chance for him! It is quite reasonable to say that the things we are doing today are the things which Chairman Mao wanted to do but failed to do in the past, but it is neither thorough, nor accurate. We should say that today we have done many things which were not thought about by our predecessors, or even things they were against, otherwise, there is no need for us to replace "take class struggle as the key link" with "take economic construction as the center," or to replace the planned economy with the market economy, or to emancipate minds, seek truth from facts, and address false cases and miscarriages of justice, or to practice reform and opening up. We must grasp the opportunity to carry out reform and promote development, and at any time and under any condition, things must obey this overall situation, and the commemorative activities in this time must also pay attention to this problem." Ding Guangen, head of the Propaganda Department, relayed this remark to CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin, and immediately made arrangements for various CPC news units to shift the central task to publicizing implementation of the "decision" by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Therefore, shortly after the new year, the activities commemorating Mao Zedong ended abruptly. This may be seen as Deng Xiaoping's rectification of the behavior of senior CPC leaders. Deng Recommends Two Generals Help in Grasping the Army But Deng Xiaoping's health and energy are not as good as they used to be, and he is unable to look at many important issues. A person who knows the inside story disclosed that recently Deng's words and deeds have shown some delicate changes, one of which is Deng has dropped the habit of "disregarding majority opinion" in doing things and paid keen attention to the opinions of the several old men who are still healthy in the party, and increased interactions with them. A particularly obvious change is that he had once become estranged from Wan Li, but he recently went to talk to Wan Li several times, and asked Wan Li to improve relations with Jiang Zemin and Li Peng. He also asked Jiang Zemin and Li Peng to "take more initiative and have a more harmonious relationship with Comrade Wan Li." This spring festival, Jiang and Li each went to Wan Li's residence to greet him, and this is one of the signs. Second, Deng is concerned about Jiang Zemin's role in the Army. Recently, he recommended Chief of the General Staff Chi Haotian and Deng Office Director Wang Ruilin help Jiang Zemin to grasp army work. The rumors that Chi Haotian will be promoted to the post of vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Wang Ruilin will serve as general secretary of the Central Military Commission have kept coming, and it is estimated that this is linked to Deng's arrangements. This move shows Deng's worries about the current situation of the Army. It has been alleged that, since the Yang brothers were stripped of their posts in the Army, there have been big changes and adjustments within the Army, and the ability to coordinate among major military regions, among various arms of the service, and between the Central Military Commission on the one hand and major military regions and various arms of the service on the other hand, has decreased; and because Zhang Zhen and Liu Huaqing, who are responsible for helping Jiang Zemin, have not served in important posts within the Army, plus the fact that both of them have reached advanced age and therefore it is difficult for them to personally oversee the daily work of the Army, the only way to strengthen the Central Military Commission's command and coordination abilities is to let Chi Haotian and Wang Ruilin take up important posts at an appropriate time, to fill the power vacuum between the senior and lower levels of the Army. It is still not known when Chi and Wang will take up new posts. There may still be some twists and turns. But will such a move bring down Jiang Zemin's "highest authority" within the Army? However, without such a move, it is not easy to stabilize the Army. The abovementioned situation shows that Deng is spending more energy on political stability and party unity in preparation for the days when he is no longer around. Can the Authority of the Third Generation Be Established? Deng Xiaoping and other political old men of the CPC have reached a consensus: To maintain political stability in the days when they are no longer around, the most important thing to do is to establish the authority of the "leaders of the third generation with Jiang Zemin as the core." However, like any country which is ruled by a single party, the decrease in authority of the central leadership seems to be a law without exception. Under the current condition that the political power of the CPC is relatively concentrated, establishment of highest authority often depends on personal ability and charisma, but in the situation whereby many political old men are still alive and the promotion of reform and opening up leads to decentralized and diversified decisionmaking, the basic elements for training personal ability and charisma do not exist. Judged from the process of birth of the third-generation leaders of the CPC, they "suffer from an inherent shortage." For example, they had to take the stage hastily and did not have outstanding work merits. At present, Chen Yun's health is obviously better than Deng Xiaoping's, and people are generally concerned that if Deng Xiaoping passes away before Chen Yun, then Chen Yun will actually become the top man in China's political arena. Will China's reform and open- door policy then be rolled back a bit? Will the personnel structure and power pattern of the "third-generation leadership" remain unchanged? When Chen Yun turned up on a public occasion in Shanghai this spring festival to make a speech, there were two points which were very eye-catching: He stressed the need to establish the "authority of the CPC leadership with Jiang Zemin as the core," saying that without such authority great things cannot be done; second, he said that development must correspond to the country's strength, and construction scale must not exceed the country's current ability to sustain it. These two points in fact are an old point of view he has clung to for many years, namely, the need to strengthen the central leadership's planning and control over economic work. It seems that this idea of Chen Yun now enjoys a dominant position at the senior level of the CPC, whereas Deng Xiaoping's remark that "Shanghai can go even faster" which he made in Shanghai, and his basic advocacy of "development is the last word" and "go faster if one can" do not sound as pronounced and prominent as Chen Yun's idea. Zhu Rongji Is Under Increasing Pressure According to analyses by persons close to the decisionmaking organs at the senior level of the CPC, the critical problem affecting the central authoritative status of Jiang Zemin and others is not that they do not have adequate power, but their lack of ability to use power, as well as the declining rallying power of the traditional political system. This year has seen the highest number of important reform measures announced by the senior level of the CPC in more than 10 years, and the width and depth of the reform are unprecedented. Judged from the reform plans that have been announced, we should say that they are comparatively reasonable and correct in terms of a basic way of thinking and framework. But to implement these plans, there are obstacles and difficulties in terms of time, condition, means, and so on, and if these problems are not properly handled, the reform will change direction and shape, or even lead to the result that the old system returns. Many economists point out that the basic way in which the mainland promotes reform plans is the model of top-down administrative orders, and the goal of reform is to decentralize decisionmaking power and build an orderly, standardized, and indirect macroregulation and control system on the premise of strengthening market economy mechanisms. However, the current practice is that the central leadership is ceaselessly gathering and centralizing power, restraining the vigor in localities and enterprises for economic development, and restricting the decisionmaking-power decentralization which is needed for the formation of market economy mechanisms. Between the means of reform and the goal of reform there emerges a relatively big conflict. Speaking in terms of the order of formation of market economy mechanisms, the building of a state macroregulation and control system should be a "post-market behavior." First there should be growth of a market economy, then there can be the need and condition for building the state's macroregulation and control functions. Amid the reform and opening up on the mainland over the past 10 years or so, development of the market has just begun, the framework of the old system has not yet completely disintegrated, and many economic relations have yet to be straightened out and established according to the principle of the market economy. Under this condition, using administrative organization and means to establish state macroregulation and control functions will not lead to an outcome which is identical with the goal of reform. When trying to handle the above-mentioned contradictions, the senior level of the CPC, especially Zhu Rongji, who is in charge of the economy, has met with pressures and criticisms which increase in an unprecedented scale. However, the perplexity currently facing Zhu Rongji is not the contradiction between reform and the forces against reform, but the contradiction between different ways to promote reform. On the one hand, this kind of contradiction shows that on the problem of how to promote the reform, it is necessary for various quarters to support one another and coordinate among themselves, and to have a process of "grinding and integrating," compromising, and eventually reaching consensus. On the other hand, it also shows that within the framework of the traditional political system of the CPC, when the political authority of the old generation retreats and the political authority of the new generation has not yet been established, to ponder problems and do things, the traditional way in which everyone marches in the same pace once an authoritative order is given, can on longer be used. More help should be sought from the democratic style of consultations with various quarters, exchanges on equal footing, and mutual compromises. Regarding this point, people hope that Zhu Rongji should have more awareness, because people pin more hopes on him than other figures. The Authorities Put Stability in the First Position This year, China's reform and development duties are heavy, and its social, political, and economic environments have contradictions and perplexities which are more serious than those in the past. Inflationary pressure continues to increase, the spreading tendency of corruption has not been effectively checked, the situation of law and order is deteriorating, about half of state-owned enterprises are losing money or are in a semi-stoppage state, and the "debt chains" of some 370 billion yuan have once again pushed a majority of state-owned enterprises into a financial and debt dilemma, while the number of unemployed and job-waiting staff and workers rapidly increases, tens of millions of rural laborers move in a disorderly manner to various parts of the mainland, and all these might lead to serious social unrests. Properly solving and handling these problems and ensuring accomplishment of reform and development duties is a serious test to the authority of the senior level of the CPC. The CPC's work principle this year is to uphold "reform, development, and stability" simultaneously; judged from the work procedure, it has put stability in the first position. For the sake of stability, both reform and development must pay a relatively big price in terms of "reducing speed." The senior level of the CPC recently decided that, for the need to stabilize the overall situation, the reform plans to be announced this year must be slowed, and their contents must be adjusted, and some polices must be amended while one or two policies must be suspended. If some reform plans are not accepted by the society when they are announced, they should be shelved. Therefore, the general situation on the mainland this year will not be reform and development "on the doubt;" at most, in the area of reform, it can only be the adjustment of pace, mediation of contradictions, accumulation of strength, and preparation work. In the area of development, it can only be an effort to decrease the inflation rate, suppress the scale of capital construction, continue to carry out adjustment of industrial structure and product mix, and control the development speed within 10 percent, so as to avoid big fluctuations in economic development. 24 February 1994
