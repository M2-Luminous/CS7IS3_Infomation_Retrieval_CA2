Hungarian leaders will very soon meet President Clinton. Hungary would very much like to join NATO, or at least in the Clinton initiative, the Partnership for Peace. [Zhirinovskiy] This is Hungary's private affair; however, I would not recommend that any single country of the globe join military blocs hastily. It would not lead to any good. It is better to remain a neutral country. Regarding NATO membership, even if Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia were to be admitted as members, they would be admitted as tiles on the roof and not as the columns of the structure. [Correspondent] The issue here is security, however, and many say that it is specifically you, Zhirinovskiy, who is threatening the security of the neighbors of the former Soviet Union. What do you say to that? [Zhirinovskiy] I deny it. We do not threaten anybody, especially not in the West--God forbid. [Correspondent] President Yeltsin bowed his head in front of the grave of Imre Nagy. If you were the president of Russia, would you repeat this gesture? [Zhirinovskiy] I do not bow anywhere. I will look, first of all, at the way in which the tombs of Soviet and Russian soldiers are treated. If, as in Sofia, they are covered with graffiti, if paint has dirtied the memorial, I will not bow my head in front of anybody in a country like that. On the contrary, I would leave that country as soon as possible. [Correspondent] Above your head here is a map of Alaska. [Zhirinovskiy] No, that is a historical map. That is what Russia was like 120 years ago. We do not want to restore these borders. That was when the Russian empire was flourishing. Why should we not be proud of the finest chapters of our history? [Correspondent] So this is not a plan for the future? [Zhirinovskiy] There is no question of that. It is only history -- just as the 12 December victory was, for me, the finest day of my life, and 12 June will be the same. This does not mean that I am expunging the rest of my entire life, but they are the two most important and happiest days of my life. It is history--merely history. Heaven forbid that this is the case again. This type of thing is not (?our aim). [Correspondent] You said not long ago, however, that you wished to send 300,000 soldiers to Germany and that Germany would be a poor country because it would be compelled to pay you reparations. If you are able to threaten Germany, which is some distance away, then Hungary, which is smaller and nearer, has more grounds to be afraid. Is that not the case? [Zhirinovskiy] That is an erroneous interpretation. What was the issue at hand? Germany is paying Israel considerable reparations for almost every single Jew who was killed. Why have the Russians, who lost the greatest number of people in the last war and who defeated German fascism, received the smallest reparations? That is why I say: If the relationship between Russia and Germany deteriorates, a review of compensation issues is not ruled out. If I understand correctly, Kohl would have been ready to pay Gorbachev 100 billion marks for East Germany. However, Gorbachev was satisfied with 10 billion. [Correspondent] From where do you get these figures? [Zhirinovskiy] From the press. Gorbachev agreed on 14 billion. [Correspondent] Marks? [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, but they would have given more, so we do not know why Gorbachev requested less for East Germany. What is at issue here is not a military threat. What is at issue is that there should not be dual standards, that there should be a uniform standard in politics concerning reparations, security, national issues, and the economy--only in this sense. This is all I was thinking about when I spoke about these issues--not at all about the use of force or armed forces. Our soldiers will never take a step in the direction of the West. Never. They have nothing to seek in the West. [Correspondent] You spoke differently to the newspaper WELT AM SONNTAG the other day, however. [Zhirinovskiy] I said that we had 300,000 soldiers there, and a suspension of the troop withdrawal was not ruled out if our relationship deteriorated, because it is in Germany's interest for all of the foreign armies--including U.S., French, British, and Dutch troops--to pull out at the same time. Why should only the Russians pull out quickly? Our soldiers and officers must spend the nights in tents in the taiga, on the steppes. Why? Why the haste? This was arranged by Shevardnadze, and where is Shevardnadze now? What did he do with his own country? He ruined his own country. [Correspondent] So WELT AM SONNTAG distorted your words? [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, it distorted them. I was suggesting that a deterioration of the Russian-German relationship is not in Germany's interest, that occupying troops are still stationed in Germany, and we want all of the occupying armies to leave Germany. We will make every effort for the Russian troops to withdraw--but not too hastily because this would give rise to tensions in Russia. This is also contrary to Germany's interests. [Correspondent] Since you have a little time, I would like to ask you a few more questions. [Zhirinovskiy] Please, go ahead. [Correspondent] Where should the Russian borders be in the future? Along the former Soviet borders? [Zhirinovskiy] We will not object if the currently independent areas--the former Soviet republics--ask to be allowed back to the fold. We will examine the question of readmitting them, and then the borders of the former Soviet Union will gradually become the borders of Russia. [Correspondent] What is your opinion of what Solzhenitsyn said--that the Slav republics, Ukraine, Belarus can come back, but it is better if the Muslim and southern republics go separate ways because they would be only a burden for the Russians? [Zhirinovskiy] This reflects nationalistic, psychological, and historical viewpoints. If we consider economic viewpoints and military strategy, however, then there are certain small, specific issues. This, specifically, is what I wrote about in my book The Last Push South. [Correspondent] It would be interesting to read. [Zhirinovskiy] I would be pleased if it was translated into Hungarian. It is now being translated in several countries. It describes everything in detail--my entire geopolitical concept, the nationality issue. [Correspondent] You recently said that there would be many small wars, which have begun to an extent--between Abkhazians and Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis --and that these peoples would be so weakened that they would fall on their knees to plead for their readmittance into the former Soviet Union. [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, that is exactly right. [Unidentified announcer] The book's title is The Last Push South. It is Zhirinovskiy's Mein Kampf. In it, he says that the Russian Army will occupy Afghanistan, Turkey, and Iran, and that Russia will be the master from Istanbul to Kabul. Of course, just like in every mendacious work of this type, it says that this fight will be the last one. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] You also proposed that Macedonia be handed over to Bulgaria. What is your opinion of the current southern Slav conflict? [Zhirinovskiy] The best thing would for all of the foreign armies--including the UN troops--to be withdrawn from Yugoslavia, and for the Yugoslavs themselves--the Serbians and Croatians--to decide their own fate. [Correspondent] What is your opinion of Yeltsin? [Zhirinovskiy] What should it be? He has been the president of our country for two-and-a-half years already. He will retire in two more years, and he will remain in our memory as Russia's first president. [Correspondent] All right, but what kind of economic policy is necessary? [Zhirinovskiy] Another kind, completely different. He is being let down by his team. The Gaydar-Fedorov-Shokhin team must go. [Correspondent] What, specifically, should he do? [Zhirinovskiy] He should change the formula of the economic reform. [Correspondent] But in what direction? [Zhirinovskiy] For example, support for certain regions of the former Soviet Union must be halted. The peaceful conversion of the military industry must be halted. The state sector must not be ruined. The private sector must not be stifled. Crime must be dealt a blow. The situation must be stabilized. There must be an end to the division within Russia along national lines, so that there are only counties. Such reforms would quickly improve our lives. [Correspondent] So the current national autonomous regions should cease to exist? [Zhirinovskiy] Full rights for every citizen--irrespective of nationality. If there is autonomy, it means war--the path leading to war. Well, there are some hotbeds of war in the ruins of the former Soviet Union [word indistinct]. [Correspondent] What is your opinion of Saddam Husayn? [Zhirinovskiy] We have never had any special relationship with him. What happened historically was simply that the Soviet Union invested enormous sums in Iraq. Therefore, Iraq now owes us more than $10 billion, and it is ready to pay this. That is why it is not in our interest to take part in the embargo against Iraq-- just like in the case of the embargo against Serbia and the embargo against Libya. [Correspondent] So you want to change policy? [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, in that we do not participate in embargoes against countries that intend to pay us their debts. [Correspondent] And the pressure exerted on Kim Il-song these days? What do you think of it? [Zhirinovskiy] There is no problem with that. North Korea owes us very little. Perhaps it is not a debtor of ours. We also oppose the spread of nuclear weapons. There would be a possibility for joint action on this. [Correspondent] Not long ago you mentioned a terrifying nonnuclear weapon in the possession of Russia--the elipton. What type of weapon is this? [Zhirinovskiy] This question is for experts. This weapon is stronger than nuclear weapons because its consequences are different, and there is no antidote. This is where its strength lies. There is no way of defending against it. It is the same with the sonic weapon [hangfegyver]. We also have this. What happens is that the cartridge detonates, and the sound is such that it brings down an entire military division. That is it; they are dead. [Correspondent] How does the elipton work? [Zhirinovskiy] The elipton has the same effect. There is no radiation, no fire. There are no wounds. An entire military division simply dies. It is similar to the neutron weapon, but the latter has radiation. It has a damaging effect. The neutrons enter the human body; those cause the destruction. With the former, there is no damage, but all of life is immediately destroyed. [Correspondent] Do the Americans not have this type of weapon? [Zhirinovskiy] No. [Correspondent] No one has it? [Zhirinovskiy] No one. Russian scientists developed it exclusively. [Correspondent] But no one has yet heard about this weapon. [Zhirinovskiy] Because it is secret. [Correspondent] You know, when one speaks with you--and I am thinking of your recent statements abroad--we simply are unable to ascertain how many types of Zhirinovskiy there are. Because there is a Zhirinovskiy who speaks sensibly, and at the same time there is a Zhirinovskiy who proposes to the Bulgarians that they need a new president, who offends entire countries. We are unable to get our bearings with regard to you. [Zhirinovskiy] Things must be clarified in a direct manner. You have come here, and we are now having a chat. I will explain everything if I am invited to Hungary. I will explain that no one should fear anything. Never did I want to dismiss Bulgaria's president. The whole thing was built up by the journalists and by President Zhelyu Zhelev's office. He took fright and really thought that I came for that reason. [Correspondent] And your friend? Did you not recommend your friend, Svetoslav [Stoilov] as president? [Zhirinovskiy] I said to journalists, since they were nearby: Here is my friend, Svetoslav. He is a person who has done very much for Bulgaria, Macedonia, Eastern Europe, and Russia. Such people can become presidents--in Bulgaria and in other East European countries. I was speaking in this sense. [Correspondent] Look here: Russian Hitler. This is written by [name indistinct]. Here is a quote from a British paper. [Zhirinovskiy] Oh, of course! [Correspondent] France warns that Zhirinovskiy is making provocative statements. Here you are in the newspaper clippings: Decoding the Russian Message, How Should We Decipher Zhirinovskiy? This is with what they are preoccupied. [Zhirinovskiy] But here is TIME magazine. They make a very good presentation. They write very well. Other means of mass media present me in a different way, so there you are. The NEWSWEEK article is not so bad, nor is this, either. Look at it. [Correspondent] There are episodes in your life, however, that have not been clarified. [Zhirinovskiy] Please go ahead and ask. [Correspondent] What did you do for a few years in Turkey? [Zhirinovskiy] I worked as an interpreter for eight months. I had work experience for a few months. I was a university student in my final year at the time, and the fifth year consisted of work experience. I gained experience on the radio and television committee, and elsewhere as well. Then I went to Turkey as an interpreter, with a Russian engineers' delegation. [Correspondent] Gorbachev says that the KGB is pulling your strings. [Zhirinovskiy] He says this out of envy. He destroyed the party, the country. He ruined the economy. Then a new party with a young leader appears who succeeds in making advances in the elections. Because of this, he thinks that I am helped by someone-- or by a lot of capital, or by the KGB, as the world's most powerful secret police. They are unable to accept that we are now living through different times. We ourselves created a party. I had very little money. There is more now. With regard to KGB-like bodies, no one is helping me. I would be pleased if I was given money. [Correspondent] So Gorbachev is not telling the truth. [Zhirinovskiy] No, that is certain. [Correspondent] Another thing from your past. Israel supposedly gave you an entry permit as an immigrant. Is that true? [Zhirinovskiy] No, that is a lie. [Correspondent] Israel says this--the Israeli Government. [Zhirinovskiy] It is a complete lie. Of course, show me the supposed relative of mine! If I had a relative there, I would be pleased. But I have no relative there. [Correspondent] It is also said .... [Zhirinovskiy, interrupting] I am Russian--I myself, my mother, my father, and the whole family. Half of them have already died. [Correspondent] It is also said that you participated in the establishment of the Shalom association in Moscow. [Zhirinovskiy] That is also a lie. The establishment of nationality associations was begun in Moscow five years ago by Kurds, Armenians, Assyrians, and so forth. All those who live here. Almost 1 million people of foreign descent live in Moscow. Among them, the Jews also decided to set up a cultural association called Shalom. I then visited these associations one after the other; I was invited and visited them. I am a legal expert, and that was the time that the association's statutes were adopted. I made some comments that they liked. [Correspondent] Are there armed men in your party? [Zhirinovskiy] No, not one--nothing near it. There is not one. I do not even have a penknife. All that I have--I bought this in Austria--is an ordinary exercise device to strengthen one's grip. [Correspondent] So you will use only constitutional means in contending for power? [Zhirinovskiy] That only. Heaven forbid. We have never organized violent action. In Moscow and in all of Russia, our party held the most peaceful rallies. That is history. There has never been violence--not a bit. There has never been a single scuffle. The whole world has been able to see this. Everyone saw these rallies. They were filmed: the most peaceful rallies in Moscow and the whole country; the most peaceful party members; the most peaceful groups of deputies in the regional bodies and at the national level. Everything was in full view. The journalists, however, under the influence of certain international and national headquarters that oppose me, seek compromising facts. They must think up something: Either I am not Russian, or I am (?piarist), or anti-Semitic, or fascist, or communist, or a KGB person. They struggle. They are envious. They are jealous. Even Gorbachev. All that Gorbachev is able to do .... [pauses] He said that supposedly. The paper was here somewhere; perhaps I left it at home. It was meant to show what he concerns himself with, but let's leave it. Let's leave it so that there is no quarrel. The whole thing has to do with sensitivities. I gained an unprecedented victory. I agree with that. The whole world is upside down. Europe is trying to recover. They did not expect a four-year-old party, without special financial support, without the direct support of social strata--kolhoz members, farmers, the military industry--to be victorious in the elections. The instruments of power--the media, money, the powerful levers of influence--are in their hands, and they were still the losers. That is what shocked them, because what happened here was that a military division defeated an army consisting of several hundreds of divisions. Naturally, the army consisting of several hundreds of divisions faints when a small division defeats an enormous army. That fact that one small party completely defeated the country's system was a political shock. [Correspondent] Why does your colorful style terrify the world? They fear you more than the devil. [Zhirinovskiy] What should we do? The whole world is slightly (?spoiled). Here, the communists were harmful; everything is atrophied. In the West, Europe is being Americanized. Everyone eats and drinks. They eat and drink, and then a new, young party appears with a resolute program and with energy. This naturally gives the impression of being new. Everything new generally is a bit frightening because they do not understand what it is--what type of party. I tell everyone in advance to be calm, however. This is a democratic, centrist party. There is no danger, either domestically or abroad; nor will there ever be a danger. There will be only a legal constitutionality--pluralism, democracy, a mixed economy, and human rights. Look only at my life story. The subject of one of my studies was human rights in the modern world. The topic of another of my studies: the writer and the man. Look at what I concerned myself with for 47 years. What did I concern myself with? Was I [word indistinct] a commando? Did I suppress rebellions? Then the price for this would be different. I was a civilian my whole life. I was a soldier in Tbilisi for two years. I served in the staff headquarters in Tbilisi town center from 0900 until 1800 hours. I pushed papers about at the staff headquarters. I was never rebuked for anything. I did not abuse anyone. I did not participate in anything. This is generally known. Please understand: I am 47 years old. I was born after the war. My life and that of my party are open to general view. It is unnecessary to think up anything. [Correspondent] Then I thank you for the interview and for your time. The future will show what Zhirinovskiy means to world. [Zhirinovskiy] Good. [Announcer] After this stream of propaganda, the fuehrer set off for the Kremlin for a meeting of leaders of groups of deputies to the newly elected State Duma. His parting words: Europe do not fear! You know, we feel that we have reason to be afraid of this so-called liberal democrat.
