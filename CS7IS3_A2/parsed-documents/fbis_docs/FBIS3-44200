Can one talk about progress at the talks? [Dos Santos] No, I am not just consulted in this process where a negotiated settlement to the conflict is sought. In my capacity as president of the Republic and commander in chief of the Angolan Armed Forces, FAA, I have a rather important interventionist role to play. So I have intervened in the process since its preparation stage. I have intervened in the assessment of strategies and tactics. My intervention has also had to do with the details of negotiation (?in Lusaka), the observers, and so forth. So my intervention is rather extensive. It could not have been otherwise (?if we are to end) the war, which today affects all our lives. I believe there is a solution. It may not happen as quickly as all Angolans of good faith would wish, but UNITA has no other option than to follow the path of reason now or some time from now. [Reporter] Mr. President: At this stage, one can see that the government is making efforts aimed at creating social stability in government-controlled areas, particularly to help resolve problems linked to the increasing cost of living. Mr. President: How do you think the inflation rate can be brought under control, and how can the country's productive sector be reactivated? [Dos Santos] Well, the government is studying the difficult economic situation facing our country today. Those studies are intended to help correct the macroeconomic imbalances that emerged principally over the course of the last year. It is my belief that, for as long as there is war, it will be very difficult -- perhaps even impossible -- to satisfactorily implement any government economic program aimed at a structural readjustment that will correct those macroeconomic imbalances. Basically, the circumstances [words indistinct] Angola's conditions. (?There is a major war on). There is no movement of people or goods. There is no transportation. There is consumption [words indistinct] the armed forces. On the other hand, there has been an increase in public spending and in the General State Budget deficit. There is no...[pauses] perhaps there is, but it will be extremely difficult to raise the fiscal (?revenue and implement) a war tax or some other tax that will help satisfy the needs prompted by war. In view of that, I think that every measure we take will inevitably be a palliative one lacking depth. Obviously, [words indistinct] discussions by some of our economists [words indistinct] basically, in a symposium, where, I think, the great novelty was the proposal that a tax should be introduced [words indistinct] and so forth. In our opinion, though, we must first make a major effort to create areas of relative political and military stability. Fundamentally [words indistinct] relatively stable area where economic relations can take place. If we manage that, then perhaps we will be able to carry out a program to reduce the macroeconomic imbalances we are experiencing today and to control inflation to a certain extent. The government is making some studies, and I believe that those studies aim precisely at creating those areas of relative stability by means of a military effort and then by achieving complete peace through a negotiated settlement. Whether it be the one or the other, we would then proceed to implement whatever economic programs we could to correct those macroeconomic imbalances. [Reporter] Mr. President: Angola has already felt the effects of having joined the IMF. A report has come out saying that the IMF recently reprimanded the Angolan Government. I would like to ask: How have relations been between the Angolan Government and the IMF? [Dos Santos] There is constant dialogue between the government and the IMF and between the government and the World Bank. There are technical assistance programs under way, notably in the areas of finance, the Central Bank, planning, and so on. Obviously, there have been some differences. We are a sovereign state. We had planned an economic recovery of some three to four years, and those measures (?were) being discussed with the IMF. We also started negotiating with the Paris Club to have our foreign debt rescheduled, but then the situation in Angola changed completely.
