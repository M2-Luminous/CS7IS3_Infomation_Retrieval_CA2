"Everything depends on how the NP behaves itself. I am considering releasing the documents one by one to the media before the election. If F.W. de Klerk and the others want to intimidate other parties, then I will definitely throw my cards on the table. All that I am prepared to say now is that the documents in my possession also contain things that happened during Mr. de Klerk's time as state president," according to Gen. Holomisa. Last year Gen. Holomisa announced at a press conference that he, apart from the now well-known documents concerning the "signal" that the eastern Cape activist Matthew Goniwe and his associates "should be permanently removed from society," also has other documents in his possession on government "covert" actions. The announcement of this "signal" by General Holomisa directly resulted in the reopening of the inquest into the murders of Goniwe and the others on the insistence of President de Klerk.
