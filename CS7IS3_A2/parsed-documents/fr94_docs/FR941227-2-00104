FR941227-2-00104 FR941227-2-00074 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,632] Weldotron Corporation; Piscataway, NJ; Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration On September 28, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration for workers and former workers of the subject firm. The notice was published in the Federal Register on October 7, 1994 (59 FR 51211). The company submitted additional information showing that it sells to dealers not end users and that it has lost market share. Investigation findings show declines in sales, production and employment in fiscal year (FY) 1994 compared to FY 1993. Other investigation findings show that U.S. imports of packaging machinery increased absolutely and relative to domestic shipments in 1993 compared to 1992 and in 1994 compared to 1993. Other findings show that the workers were previously determined to be adversely impacted by imports and certified under petition TA&hyph;W&hyph;26,423 which expired on November 25, 1993. Findings on reconsideration show that Weldotron lost market share for its automatic sealer packaging machines to imported automatic sealer packaging machines in 1994 compared to 1993. Other findings on reconsideration show that several of the dealers surveyed indicated increased purchases of automatic sealer machinery while reducing their purchases from Weldotron in the relevant periods. Conclusion After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that the workers at Weldotron Corporation in Piscataway, New Jersey were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with the packaging equipment produced at Weldotron Corporation in Piscataway, New Jersey. ``All workers of Weldotron Corporation in Piscataway, New Jersey who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after November 25, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.'' Signed at Washington, D.C., this 10th day of December 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.
