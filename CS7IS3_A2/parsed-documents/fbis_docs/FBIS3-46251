Only when the British side displays sincerity by practical action and withdraws the partial constitutional reform bill which had been submitted to the Legislative Council [Legco], will it be possible for China and Britain to resume talks on the arrangements for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong through diplomatic consultations. Zheng made the aforesaid remarks when attending a public occasion at the Chinese University of Hong Kong yesterday morning. He pointed out: The fact that the British side has submitted the partial constitutional reform bill to Legco means that the talks have broken down and that the basis for Sino-British cooperation has been disrupted by the British side. The British side should clearly understand the Chinese side's stand, that only by withdrawing the partial constitutional reform bill submitted to Legco can the British side prove its sincerity. If the British side is really sincere about the talks, they are clear about what to do. Zheng said: The Sino-British talks have broken down because the British side unilaterally announced the suspension of negotiations at the 17th round of the talks and later submitted the partial constitutional reform bill to Legco. Given that the British side has gone farther on the road of noncooperation and has seriously affected the stable transition of Hong Kong, the Chinese side must speed up the work of the Preliminary Work Committee and rely on Hong Kong residents in making good preparations in all fields in line with the provisions of the Basic Law in order to achieve a stable transition. Zheng also pointed out: Given that no agreement is reached between China and Britain, the three-tier councils of the British Hong Kong Government will only serve until 30 June 1997. The future special administration region government will reorganize Hong Kong's three-tier councils according to the Basic Law. A reporter asked: "Recently the Hong Kong Government again applied to Legco for an appropriation of 4.6 billion Hong Kong dollars for the airport project. What is your view on this?" Zheng said: "The British move is out of keeping with the memorandum of understanding [MOU]. In fact, no sooner had the memorandum been signed than the British side put forward a financial arrangement in violation of the memorandum. It was stipulated in the MOU that debts should not exceed HK$5 billion, but the British side put forward a financial arrangement that incurred well over HK$5 billion in debt. This means that the future special administrative region government should assume a heavy debt. As this will directly affect the interests and life quality of the vast numbers of Hong Kong residents, it is naturally unacceptable to us. Recently the Chinese side put forward some proposals, but the British side has made no response. The British side is now adopting an attitude of ignoring the Chinese side's view and is submitting the airport project to Legco piecemeal. This is also unacceptable to us for it is not conducive to the solution of the issue on airport financial arrangements. The key to solving the airport issue lies in the British Hong Kong authorities truly acting according to the MOU on the airport project. This is not something difficult to solve."
