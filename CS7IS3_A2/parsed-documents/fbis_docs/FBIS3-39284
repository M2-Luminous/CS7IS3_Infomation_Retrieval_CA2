Western leaders are all making statements about the situation and are saying that the NATO ultimatum will be carried through if the artillery weapons surrounding Sarajevo are not surrendered. One of the latest statements on the matter came from the U.S. defense secretary. William Perry stated that at the moment the military options are evident. But despite the strong stand, the international community continues divided. Russia has called for a UN Security Council meeting, which is due to take place within a few hours. The Russian diplomats say that air strikes should only go ahead if Sarajevo is shelled again. The Russian deputy minister for foreign affairs is in Lisbon and spoke about the situation. He was evasive. More details from Pedro Leal: [Begin recording] [Leal] Good morning Deputy Minister Sergey Krylov. What will be the stand defended by Russia at this afternoon's Security Council meeting? [Krilov, in Portuguese] We will be defending our stand, which is that to start any sort of action it is necessary to continue carrying out all resolutions approved previously. [Leal] Does that mean that Russia is against NATO's ultimatum? [Krilov] It means that only the Security Council can issue a mandate. [Leal] Do you mean that Russia will submit NATO's ultimatum to the Security Council's vote? [Krilov] I would not say that. [Leal] And what is Russia's intention in relation to the Bosnian issue? [Krilov] Our intention is that it is necessary to continue this political line of promoting peace among the conflicting sides. [Leal] Does that mean that you are against air strikes on artillery positions in Bosnia? [Krilov] You must be well aware of the fact that the ultimatum itself has already produced results. [Leal] Does that mean -- I will ask again -- that you are against strikes? [Krilov] I believe that military force is the last resort. When we all give up, then it can be used. We still have [word indistinct] we still have the possibility of continuing with the negotiations. This is a better option. [Leal] What will be Russia's diplomatic approach if NATO carries out its ultimatum on Bosnia? [Krilov] We still have a few days left before that can happen, and it is necessary to use other possibilities. [Leal] One last question -- what will you be discussing this afternoon at your meeting with Portuguese Minister for Foreign Affairs Durao Barroso? [Krilov] I will only be able to tell you that after the meeting. [end recording] That was Pedro Leal talking to the Russian deputy minister for foreign affairs, who is visiting Portugal [end recording].
