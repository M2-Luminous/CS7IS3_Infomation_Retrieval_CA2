Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, PFCRN candidate to the Mexican presidency, announced that its "vote-sponsoring brigades" will mobilize this week wearing a "uniform" -- a ski cap and sweatshirt -- like members of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) who rebelled on 1 January. Fernando Pineda, national propaganda secretary, today explained to EFE that the ski cap will be "a symbol of peace, not of war." He added that it will be worn as a symbol of the Zapatist struggle for democracy and to demand a "no to weapons, yes to the ballot box." The ski cap is the main garment worn by Zapatist leaders. Rebel leader "Subcommander Marcos" says he wears it to honor the Mexican culture of "keeping things under wraps" in which the name of the ruling party's presidential candidate is withheld. "The PFCRN fully agrees with the Zapatists' demands. We have adopted their ten points for democracy and offered ourselves as the Zapatists' peaceful branch because we believe their demands are just," Pineda said. The opposition party spokesman said its members hope violence will stop and that just solutions will be given to the people of Chiapas and Mexico, where, according to him, there are more than 40 million poor people, meaning half the country's population. The way to prevent permanent instability in the country is to promote new, in-depth economic policies and to help the poorest people overcome their backwardness. "We are going to emphasize this platform unity with the EZLN in our political campaign and guarantee that a political rather than military solution prevails on 21 August (presidential election day)". Aguilar Talamantes was applauded by dozens of supporters wearing black and white ski caps on 6 February when he began his campaign in the capital. During his electoral campaign, which began in January, Aguilar Talamantes harshly criticized another opposition presidential candidate, Cuahtemoc Cardenas of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), whom he describes as "lacking seriousness and ideological commitment." Aguilar Talamantes has also criticized Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the conservative National Action Party (PAN) for his "elitist" character because he wants politics for "groups of decent people without taking the poor into consideration." The PFCRN, known as the Worker's Socialist party until 1986, proposes to end agricultural backwardness; to sponsor progress, democracy, and development; and to promote an in-depth reconstruction of the country's political and social life as guidelines for winning the presidency. Nine parties will participate in the 21 August general elections, but only the ruling PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party), PAN, and PRD are considered strong.
