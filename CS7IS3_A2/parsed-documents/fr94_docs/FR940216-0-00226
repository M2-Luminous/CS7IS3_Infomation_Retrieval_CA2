FR940216-0-00226 FR940216-0-00010 (B) The annual average of the toxics emissions reduction percentages for all samples from a survey series shall be calculated according to the following formula: E:GRAPHICSER16FE94.011 where AATER = the annual average toxics emissions reduction TER 1,i = the toxics emissions reduction for sample i of gasoline collected during the high ozone season TER 2,i = the toxics emissions reduction for sample i of gasoline collected outside the high ozone season n 1 = the number of samples collected during the high ozone season n 2 = the number of samples collected outside the high ozone season 0 (C) The covered area shall have failed the simple model toxics survey series if the annual average toxics emissions reduction is less than the simple model per-gallon standard for toxics emissions reduction. (ii) The results of each complex model toxics emissions reduction survey series conducted in any covered area shall be determined as follows: (A) For each complex model sample from the survey series, the toxics emissions reduction percentage shall be determined based upon the tested parameter values for that sample and the appropriate methodology for calculating toxics emissions reduction at §80.47; (B) The annual average of the toxics emissions reduction percentages for all samples from a survey series shall be calculated according to the formula specified in paragraph (c)(8)(i)(B) of this section; and (C) The covered area shall have failed the complex model toxics survey series if the annual average toxics emissions reduction is less than the applicable per-gallon complex model standard for toxics emissions reduction. (10) The results of each NO X emissions reduction survey and survey series shall be determined as follows: (i) For each sample from the survey and survey series, the NO X emissions reduction percentage shall be determined based upon the tested parameter values for that sample and the appropriate methodology for calculating NO X emissions reduction at §80.47; and (ii) The covered area shall have failed the NO X survey or survey series if the NO X emissions reduction percentage average for all survey samples is less than the applicable Phase I or Phase II complex model per-gallon standard for NO X emissions reduction. (11) For any benzene content survey series conducted in any covered area the average benzene content for all samples from the survey series shall be calculated. If this annual average is greater than 1.000 percent by volume, the covered area shall have failed a benzene survey series. (12) For any oxygen content survey series conducted in any covered area the average oxygen content for all samples from the survey series shall be calculated. If this annual average is less than 2.00 percent by weight, the covered area shall have failed an oxygen survey series. Each survey program shall: (i) Be planned and conducted by a person who is independent of the refiner or importer (the surveyor). In order to be considered independent: (A) The surveyor shall not be an employee of any refiner or importer; (B) The surveyor shall be free from any obligation to or interest in any refiner or importer; and (C) The refiner or importer shall be free from any obligation to or interest in the surveyor; and (ii) Include procedures for selecting sample collection locations, numbers of samples, and gasoline compositions which will result in: (A) Simple model surveys representing all gasoline certified using the simple model being dispensed at retail outlets within the covered area during the period of the survey; and (B) Complex model surveys representing all gasoline certified using the complex model being dispensed at retail outlets within the covered area during the period of the survey; and (iii) Include procedures such that the number of samples included in each survey assures that: (A) In the case of simple model surveys, the average levels of oxygen, benzene, RVP, and aromatic hydrocarbons are determined with a 95% confidence level, with error of less than 0.1 psi for RVP, 0.05% for benzene (by volume), and 0.1% for oxygen (by weight); and (B) In the case of complex model surveys, the average levels of oxygen, benzene, RVP, aromatic hydrocarbons, olefins, T&hyph;50, T&hyph;90, and sulfur are determined with a 95% confidence level, with error of less than 0.1 psi for RVP, 0.05% for benzene (by volume), 0.1% for oxygen (by weight), 0.5% for aromatic hydrocarbons (by volume), 0.5% for olefins (by volume), 5 ○F. for T&hyph;50 and T&hyph;90, and 10 ppm for sulfur; and (iv) Require that the surveyor shall: (A) Not inform anyone, in advance, of the date or location for the conduct of any survey; (B) Upon request by EPA made within thirty days following the submission of the report of a survey, provide a duplicate of any gasoline sample taken during that survey to EPA at a location to be specified by EPA each sample to be identified by the name and address of the facility where collected, the date of collection, and the classification of the sample as simple model or complex model; and (C) At any time permit any representative of EPA to monitor the conduct of the survey, including sample collection, transportation, storage, and analysis; and (v) Require the surveyor to submit to EPA a report of each survey, within thirty days following completion of the survey, such report to include the following information: (A) The identification of the person who conducted the survey; (B) An attestation by an officer of the surveyor company that the survey was conducted in accordance with the survey plan and that the survey results are accurate; (C) If the survey was conducted for one refiner or importer, the identification of that party; (D) The identification of the covered area surveyed; (E) The dates on which the survey was conducted; (F) The address of each facility at which a gasoline sample was collected, the date of collection, and the classification of the sample as simple model or complex model; (G) The results of the analyses of simple model samples for oxygenate type and oxygen weight percent, benzene content, aromatic hydrocarbon content, and RVP, and the calculated toxics emission reduction percentage;
