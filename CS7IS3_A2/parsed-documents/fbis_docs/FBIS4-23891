RPF Political Bureau Member Dr. Jacques Bihozagara, whom we questioned, repeated that to us bluntly: [Bihozagara] The answer is no! France is not qualified to carry out this kind of operation for several reasons. First, because we think that France was aware of, if not an accomplice of, the plans for genocide: The training of the commandos was carried out by the French, it is they who supplied them with weapons; 80 percent of the weapons we have seized from the government forces have been supplied by the French. The Interhamwe [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic Militia] were divided into three categories: Demobilized members of the Presidential Guard, who had kept their weapons, commandos, trained by French soldiers, and ordinary peasants who had been given weapons. Today the genocide plan has been carried out: Two thirds of Rwanda's Tutsis have been exterminated as well as 90 percent of the Hutu intellectual and political elite. We also think that France is not qualified because we have information that it participated in the attack on the president's plane. From the start, we said that the plane's black box was in Paris and nobody has denied this. But the information from the black box has never been analyzed or released. [Braeckman] Are there still civilians to be saved? [Bihozagara] Yes, and the RPF is capable of doing it. We also note a change in the Rwandan Army's attitude to the militias: When the latter burst into the Hotel des Milles Collines, it was the government army which intervened against them. In addition, we have noted conciliatory remarks about the RPF from the chief of staff and we know that the government troops are demoralized. We have the feeling that the Rwandan Army is not ready to do what is necessary to release the hostages and it is at this precise moment, when things could be resolved, that France wants to make a gesture. [Braeckman] How can this attitude be explained? [Bihozagara] There are several reasons: The first is that France feels a moral debt toward Rwanda, and that the government feels urged to do something, including to launch into the adventure. But we also think that among the scattered troops there are embarrassing witnesses who could call France into question and who ought to be eliminated. I would also like to tell you that the UN special representative who is in Rwanda might, during his investigations on the ground, be forced to implicate members of the Akazu (the president's entourage -- LE SOIR editor's note) who are currently in France. [Braeckman] Do you have information that French soldiers are in Rwanda and are trapped alongside the government forces? [Bihozagara] Yes, we also have reports that some French soldiers have been discovered in military camps in Kigali and we think that the current operation also has the aim of bringing them out. We even think that this is the decisive reason for the operation planned, and this is why it is necessary to move so quickly. France wants to cover its tracks and we oppose that. We have asked all Rwandans in Europe to return to the country to oppose this action. [Braeckman] Bernard Kouchner [French state secretary for humanitarian affairs] is currently in Rwanda, and has passed through RPF lines. In what capacity? [Bihozagara] When I saw him in Geneva and he told me he wanted to make another visit, I suggested that he went to the government side to plead with the militias to release their hostages. He had tried previously but the militias had refused and he returned empty-handed. He has now returned to Rwanda, passing through the North, but he was there on a private basis and was accompanied by Mr. Larome, who is in charge of humanitarian operations. If we refuse France's intervention it is also in memory of our country's countless victims. We also refuse the intervention of former French colonies with excessively close ties with Paris, like Togo for instance. As for Senegal, we agreed to its participation in a UN intervention, which we still accept, but if the Senegalese return alongside the French, as [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe is asking them to do, that is a different matter.
