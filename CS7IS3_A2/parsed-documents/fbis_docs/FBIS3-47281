FBIS3-47281 "dreas007_c_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-007 Document Type:Daily Report 11 Jan 1994 North Korea Daily: Japan Must Admit War `Crime' Responsibility SK0801110394 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1055 GMT 8 Jan 94 SK0801110394 Pyongyang KCNA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Government must, though belatedly, admit to Japan's responsibility for the crime in drafting "comfort women for the Army" in view of the international law, enact a domestic law of its own accord and hold trials to bring criminal charges against those responsible for the criminal case and manifest its intention to restore the damaged honour of the victims and international justice, says NODONG SINMUN today in a by-lined article. The Japanese Government authorities' act of avoiding full investigation into the crime in drafting "comfort women for the Army" and publication of its results is to duck their responsibility for the anti-human arch crime under the international law, the article says, and goes on: The crime in drafting "comfort women for the Army" committed by the Japanese imperialists is the most despicable and diabolic, inhumane criminal act ever known in human history. It is typical of the "crime against humanity" under the international law. Because it is, above all, a grave human rights abuse, in the form of enslavement of women. It falls under the "crime against humanity" according to Subparagraph C of Paragraph 6 of the regulations of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal and Article 5 of the Regulations of the Tokyo International Far Eastern Military Tribunal. The crime in drafting "comfort women for the Army" committed by the Japanese Government and military was a forcible sexual enslavement of women. They deprived the "comfort women" of all their freedom and rights, treated and murdered them like slaves. This criminal case comes under the "crime against humanity" also because it was committed as part of their scheme to obliterate another nation. The "imperial Army's" brutal cruelties against the "comfort women for the Army" were praised as "qualities" of the "imperial Army" because they were based on Japan's policy aimed at obliterating the Korean nation itself. This notwithstanding, the Japanese authorities are trying by hook or by crook to avoid their responsibility for the criminal case under the international law. They describe the publication of "Results of Two Rounds of Investigation" as a fulfilment of their duty and are intending to evade compensation with an offer of something like "fund". If the Japanese Government continually refuse to admit their responsibility for the criminal case under the international law, to probe the truth and make compensations, it will bump into stronger condemnations from the international community.
