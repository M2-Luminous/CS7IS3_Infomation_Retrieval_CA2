FR940926-2-00061 FR940926-2-00054 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Docket No. AB-290 (Sub-No. 146X)] Norfolk and Western Railway Company_Abandonment Exemption_In Raleigh County, WV Norfolk and Western Railway Company (NW) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR Part 1152 Subpart F_ Exempt Abandonments to abandon its 4.3-mile line of railroad extending between milepost WG-29.3, at Whitby, and milepost WG-33.6, at Willabet, in Raleigh County, WV. NW has certified that: (1) No local or overhead traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a state or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (3) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental reports), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met. 1 1 Under 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(2), the railroad must file a verified notice with the Commission at least 50 days before the abandonment or discontinuance is to be consummated. The applicant, in its verified notice, indicated a proposed consummation date of October 24, 1994. Because the verified notice was not filed until September 6, 1994, consummation should not have been proposed to take place prior to October 26, 1994. Applicant's representative has confirmed that the correct consummation date is on or after October 26, 1994. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on October 26, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues, 2 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), 3 and trail use/rail banking requests under 49 CFR 1152.29 4 must be filed by October 6, 1994. Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be filed by October 17, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 2 A stay will be issued routinely by the Commission in those proceedings where an informed decision on environmental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis in its independent investigation) cannot be made prior to the effective date of the notice of exemption. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines, 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay on environmental concerns is encouraged to file its request as soon as possible in order to permit the Commission to review and act on the request before the effective date of this exemption. 3 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist., 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). 4 The Commission will accept a late-filed trail use request as long as it retains jurisdiction to do so. A copy of any pleading filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: James R. Paschall, Norfolk Southern Corporation, Three Commercial Place, Norfolk, VA 23510&hyph;2191. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. NW has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environment and historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by September 30, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA, at (202) 927&hyph;6248. Comments on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public. Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where appropriate, in a subsequent decision. Decided: September 13, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23759 Filed 9&hyph;23&hyph;04; 8:45am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
