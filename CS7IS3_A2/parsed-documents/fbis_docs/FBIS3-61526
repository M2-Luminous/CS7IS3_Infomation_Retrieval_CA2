To this end, staff of the Fresh Water and Experimental Hydrobiology Laboratory of the Zoology Institute at Russia's Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg carried out hydrobiological research aimed at clarifying the bay ecosystem functioning. In so doing, the phytoplankton and chlorophyll concentrations are studied on the basis of the 1984-1989 and 1992 data; the phytoplankton sedimentation samples are processed using conventional hydrobiological procedures, and the chlorophyll concentration is measured in acetone extracts with the help of a spectrophotometer. The sampling procedure is outlined. The findings reveal that the Neva river estuary is characterized by a twin-peak seasonal phytoplankton dynamics curve with the aquatic plant biomass maximum of up to 15 mg/l in the spring. The blue-green, green, and diatom algae are dominant during the summer and fall period. The average zooplankton population and biomass in the Neva river bay in June of 1984 and 1991, Shannon's diversity index in the oligochete colonies in various sections of the Neva bay, and the oligochete biomass in the Neva bay are summarized. The study of the hydrobiont colony structure and functioning reveals that the significant changes which occurred during the 1984-1991 period reflect the continuing water contamination and changes in the hydrological conditions which are attributed to seawall construction. The need for further long-term systematic observations and a special estuary ecosystem monitoring program is stressed. A negative trend whereby research budgets are being cut is noted. The prerequisites for stabilizing the environmental conditions in the Ladoga, Neva, Neva bay, and Gulf of Finland system are formulated. Figures 5; tables 3; references 17.
