Now, as Minister of Housing, he's moving on to grander schemes as he aims to oversee the construction of several million houses. Asked why he got the job, he's embarrassed, but jokes: "Maybe because I've got a pretty face." Drawing on a short, slim cigar, his tone turns serious: "I took what I was asked to do. I feel honoured that I've been chosen for this. Housing is the most important element in the socio-economic development of a country." He explains that for every 1 million rand invested in housing, 120 jobs are created -- five times better than the employment benefit of investing in, for example, textiles. Housing creates a consumer market for electrical goods and there is accompanying development of roads and water systems. "It has a multiplier effect, in a way no other sector has," say Mr Slovo. He spend his first weeks as minister talking to the country's captains of industry, the Council for Construction in South Africa and all the bankers and mortgage lenders. He told them new housing must form viable communities in places where there is easy access to jobs, health care, education and social ammenities. He says each householder needs a permanent residential structure, secure tenure, privacy protection against the elements, potable water, adequate sanitary facilities and waste disposal and electricity. His priority is affordable housing for the very poor, with the government's subsidy scheme aimed at people who earn R2,500 a month or less. Provision will also be made for the homeless and jobless by the creation of rental housing stock. Unemployed people's ability to pay rent depends on a still-to-be designed system of social welfare that will provide the basic minimums of life. Mr Slovo says: "The whole reconstruction and development programme will have to be co-ordinated with housing as a key element." Big ideas are difficult to carry out without skilled people and Mr Slovo is angry about the current level of builder training. He says: "The Building Industries Federation of South Africa is only producing about 500 people a year." He will immediately raise the R20-million annual training budget, which comes from a levy on employers, to R200-million. Mr Slovo says 10,000 men and women must be trained in building skills in the next two to three years. To do this, the R1.6-billion housing budget must be increased, and probably the employers' levy too. In the past five years, the annual average was 23,991 new houses built. Mr Slovo is looking at 370,000 houses a year. He estimates that at the end of the first year of the new government, there will be 100,000 new houses; the next year double that, and in three years, up to the 370,000 average. Included in housing strategies is a plan to increase the population density in some areas. While tower blocks are unlikely, new dwellings will include three to five-storey blocks of flats. In the coming months, the housing ministry will put together financial and other infrastructures needed to start building. The mortgage indemnity scheme is expected to end business' reluctance to invest in housing, and banks are collaborating to form the National Housing Bank. The minister predicts training will start to produce enough labour for a visible thrust to the housing programme in about six months. Mr Slovo is hugely proud of his portfolio and the new government. He says: "For 50 years I've been involved in the struggle for political and economic liberation. Now the challenge is to deliver up that liberation."
