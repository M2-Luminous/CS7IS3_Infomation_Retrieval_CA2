FR940513-1-00033 FR940513-1-00009 DOE is proposing an administrative remedy for those aggrieved by the initial decision of the DOE Deciding Official who will be the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. In order to exhaust administrative remedies, it will be necessary to appeal to DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals. This procedure has two virtues. It would be less expensive than pursuing a judicial remedy immediately. It would also ensure that DOE has made a record which is appropriate for judicial review in the event a petition for review is filed in a federal court. III. Regulatory Review DOE has concluded that this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria which define such actions under Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735, and is therefore exempt from regulatory review. Accordingly, no clearance of this proposed rule by the Office of Management and Budget is required. IV. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any regulation that will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities; i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions. DOE has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant impact on small entities because the rule directly affects only qualified renewable energy facilities owned by state or local governments or non-profit electrical cooperatives, and such facilities are not deemed small entities. V. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act New information collection requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq., and recordkeeping requirements are proposed by this rulemaking. Accordingly, this notice has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval of paperwork requirements. Earlier in this notice, DOE described the application content proposed for use under the rule. The information DOE proposes to collect on the applications for incentive payments is necessary to determine whether the applicant is qualified for payment. The frequency of the information collection is monthly for those entities eligible to apply for incentive payments. It is estimated that less than 40 entities will apply for incentive payments in the first year, growing to less than 200 over a ten year period. The public reporting burden is estimated to average 25 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and retrieving the collection of information. The collection of information contained in this proposed rule is considered the least burdensome for the Department of Energy's functions to comply with the legal requirements and achieve program objectives. However, comments are requested concerning the accuracy of the estimated paperwork reporting burden, in addition to the proposed record retention requirement discussed above. VI. Review Under Executive Order 12612 Executive Order 12612, 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), requires that regulations, rules, legislation, and any other policy actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the National Government and the States, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of Government. If there are sufficient substantial effects, then the Executive Order requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementing policy action. This proposed rule establishes an incentive program under which state owned renewable energy facilities may qualify for incentive payments based on the amount of electric energy the facility generates using specified renewable sources for sale in, or affecting interstate commerce. The Department has determined that since the generation of electricity is not a primary function of a State, the proposed rule will not have a substantial direct effect on the institutional interests or traditional functions of States.
