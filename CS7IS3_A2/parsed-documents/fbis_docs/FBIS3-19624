In a statement to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation, Kasoulidhis said: We should not consider Yeoryiadhis' murder to have anything in particular to do with Cyprus. Such murders, Kasoulidhis added, have been taking place lately in various European countries and elsewhere. But, he said, if the aim was to affect the talks on the Cyprus issue, [Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf] Denktas will not avoid assuming his responsibilities on the talks on the confidence-building measures. EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] Chairman Vasos Lissaridhis said the murder was political, a challenge to everyone. He said this is the Turkish answer we get: the murder of a genuine man of the people in our country. Lissaridhis added that Yeoryiadhis was a man with ideals and principles and his actions were always within political boundaries. DISI [Democratic Rally] General Secretary Dhimitrios Sillouris said Turks perpetrated Yeoryiadhis' murder. He said he is certain this is not the last such act we will see, adding that it must be organized, something directly connected with the advance of the confidence-building measures. Sillouris said Turkish agents circulate unhampered in the free areas of the Republic of Cyprus and added that we should all assume our responsibilities and protect ourselves through the state structure and through cooperation between people and the responsible authorities. Yeoryiadhis' murder was also condemned by AKEL's [Restorative Party of the Working People] press spokesman Nikolaos Katsouridhis and DIKO [Democratic Party] Deputy Nikolaos Mousiouttas. The National Liberation Front of Kurdistan has strongly condemned Yeoryiadhis' murder, which, it says in a statement, was planned by the Turkish National Security Council and executed by the Turkish Secret Service. The statement also notes that the National Liberation Front of Kurdistan will reply accordingly to the Attila state, which destroys the people of Kurdistan with Ottoman and Mongolian methods.
