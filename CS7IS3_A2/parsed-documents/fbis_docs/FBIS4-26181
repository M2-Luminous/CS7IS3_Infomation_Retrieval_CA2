The conference is another milestone in the development of the education of the Chinese nation. At the first national education conference in 1985, Deng Xiaoping delivered an important speech which established a strategic position for China's educational work. A great historic leap was made from 1985 to 1994. "The hope of revitalizing the nation lies in education, and the hope of revitalizing education depends on teachers." After hearing General Secretary Jiang Zemin's important speech and Premier Li Peng's keynote report, the delegates have been greatly inspired. The main topic for discussion during the conference is how to face the development opportunity and challenge in the 21st century, to deepen further the educational reform, to accelerate the development of education, to improve the overall quality of the Chinese nation, and to train qualified personnel who span this century and the next. A salient feature of the conference is that the principal responsible comrades of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions are present discussing education and pledging to take the initiative in improving educational work. It Is Necessary To Attach Strategic Importance to Education The delegates hold that the party Central Committee, the State Council, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping have always attached importance to education in the overall development strategy of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Jiang Zemin has pointed out in his speech to the conference the need to always treat education as a fundamental issue linked with the socialist modernization drive and with the historic fate of socialism. We should treat education as something of strategic importance and pay attention to the development of education. Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju linked education with the strategic task of concentrating on the development and opening of the Pudong area and making Shanghai an international economic, financial, and trade center as soon as possible. He pointed out: "Marching toward the 21st century, Shanghai should have first-rate education commensurate with its status as a first-rate city." In education, Shanghai should play the role of a training base and train a large number of qualified personnel for the whole country. At the same time, it should open up more channels of international cooperation and turn itself into one of the bridges spanning China and other parts of the world in education. Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan said: In the Beijing region, there are 67 universities and colleges, of which 24 are national key institutes of higher learning. We can and should develop education in the capital and make it the best education of the highest standard in China. The conference is a mobilization meeting for the implementation of the "outline." The delegates say that the speeches of General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng have inspired them, while also giving them a sense of urgency and pressure. Yan Haiwang, secretary of the Gansu provincial party committee, said: In order to attain the objectives set out in the "outline," it is crucial to have a strategic vision and to put the development of education above everything else. From now on, all provinces should make efforts to truly enhance understanding and step up publicity so that the whole party, all of society, and particularly the number one party and government leaders will firmly establish the notion of giving the highest priority to the development of education and perform actual deeds, and the leaders at all levels will fulfill their duties. It Is Necessary To Deepen Reform and Promote the Development of Education The delegates consider the keynote report made by Premier Li Peng on behalf of the party Central Committee and the State Council to be in conformity with reality and to be practical and feasible, because it contains both the general concept and specific measures for implementing the "outline." It is necessary to seize the opportunity, deepen reform in an all-around way, and promote the development of education in our country. In China, the degree of economic and social development varies from place to place, and the educational development situation similarly varies. In the light of their region's educational priorities and problems, leaders from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions made efforts to explore new ways to expedite educational development. Hebei Governor Ye Liansong said in his speech that, to accelerate reform and development of vocational education in rural areas, the construction of county-level vocational education centers must be intensified. Zhao Fulin, secretary of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region CPC Committee, stressed that the most important way to help impoverished areas was to help them develop their education. Yunnan Provincial Party Committee Secretary Pu Chaozhu pointed out that, to popularize nine-year compulsory education as the "outline" required, the need to expedite educational reform and development must be fully understood, and there should be effective leadership, financial investment, support from the media, and the involvement of various social sectors. More Essential Work Must Be Done for Education and Teachers The representatives maintained that, to firmly expedite educational reform and development, efforts must be made to provide education and teachers with essential support. Representatives from Guangdong proposed that increasing educational investment was the fundamental measure for reaffirming education's strategic role and achieving educational development. They said: As the economy develops, we should, while increasing educational investment, appropriate and use educational budgets according to the principle of "underscoring the need for priority and urgent projects, taking into account the need for routine and less urgent projects, and devising a consolidated plan to be carried out step by step." Jiangxi Governor Wu Guanzheng indicated that educational work must have adequate logistic support and more essential support must be available for education and teachers. Those in charge in Shaanxi's maintained that increasing teachers' pay and solving their housing problems were essential to stabilize the ranks of teachers and for educational development generally. They said Shaanxi had come up with many ways to solve teachers' housing problems and the province had achieved remarkable success in this area. In recent years, Shandong has given priority to popularizing nine-year compulsory education and eliminating illiteracy among adults. Shandong Governor Zhao Zhihao said that, to succeed in these two areas, stronger contingents of teachers must be built. He added that improving teachers' overall quality was essential to revitalize educational development. Achieving the objectives stated in the "Outline of the Reform and Development of China's Education" is a formidable but glorious historical task. Revitalizing education and rejuvenating the Chinese nation are jobs that must be done as we approach the 21st century.
