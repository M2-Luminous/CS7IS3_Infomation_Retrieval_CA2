Bosnian Serb "parliament speaker" Momcilo Krajisnik and civil affairs chief of the UN forces in Bosnia Victor Andreev [names as received] signed a memorandum to the effect late today, which provides for a cease-fire around Gorazde and the deployment of some 100 UN Protection troops there. Under the memorandum, "the Serb side agrees, as long as it is not being attacked, to cease fire immediately" within an area three kilometers away from downtown Gorazde on the left bank of the Drina river. The UN protection forces will deploy in the truce area some 100 soldiers, 41 medical personnel, 20 armored cars and 29 non-military vehicles. The UN forces and staff of other international groups will be able to carry out normal humanitarian aid in the area but any activities to be conducted out of the area must obtain advance Serb permission. The temporary accord will remain effective until a permanent one is reached. Earlier today, Russian President Boris Yeltsin urged the Serbs to put down their weapons while UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus- Ghali asked for the expansion of NATO air strikes on Serbs and the U.S. threatened to bomb Serb territory. The U.S., reportedly ready to issue another ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs, warned that it would launch a preemptive and extensive air strike on Serb territory if Serbs continue their attacks or threaten the safety of any UN peace-keeping soldier. U.S. President Bill Clinton said in Washington tonight that he would soon announce further pressure and operation plans against the Serbs. NATO launched two air strikes on Serb positions around Gorazde last week to press for cease-fire, but the Serbs, undeterred by the bombings, retaliated furiously and entered the besieged town over the weekend.
