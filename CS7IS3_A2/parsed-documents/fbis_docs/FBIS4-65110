Admiral Jean-Charles Lefebvre was appointed to the post of Navy chief of staff effective as of 1 July, at which time he will also receive his fifth star. He replaces Admiral Alain Coatanea, who reached the age limit for his rank at the end of March. Born on 1 May 1938, Jean-Charles Lefebvre has commanded the Naval Action Force (FAN) since June 1992. A former student of the Naval Academy and nuclear engineer, he commanded an escort ship, the frigate Georges-Laygues and, from 1985 to 1987, the aircraft carrier Clemenceau. At the Navy staff, he was the head of the planning and finance division from 1990 to 1992. He has a reputation for great intellectual rigor. He becomes head of the Navy at a time when it has been rocked by the accident of the nuclear attack submarine Emeraude, when the Armed Forces are being increasing organized on an interforce basis, and when the way is opening up toward a European defense policy. At the Rue Royale, where the "Optimar" plan was launched, he is the one who will have to implement and lead the military programming law (with the priority of maintaining the credibility of the strategic ocean force and the preparation of the project for a second nuclear aircraft carrier by 1997). He will also ensure that the Navy indeed remains, as Admiral Coatanea would like, "above a critical size." General Jean-Philippe Douin has been promoted to general of the Air Force and he succeeds General Vincent Lanata as chief of staff for the Air Force. . Changes To Be Implemented Born on 8 April 1940, Gen. Douin is a fighter pilot. Since October 1992, he has been the deputy chief of staff of the Armed Forces, the deputy to Admiral Lanxade, after serving as the second in command for operations at EMA [Military Air Force College] and earlier in the Air Force. The Air Force, of which he will take command on 1 July, has experienced profound changes in the past two and a half years since the Gulf War, under the authority of Gen. Lanata. There has been a series of administrative and operational reorganizations, as well as a major rejuvenation of its combat aircraft fleet. Going beyond the minimum of 460 combat aircraft on line, it has opted for fewer aircraft (390), but more modern ones. By summer, it will be possible to refuel all of its combat aircraft in flight. This reorganization, which will give the Air Force "more muscle," will be offset by a considerable -- some say excessive -- downscaling of its size. The programming law calls for some 5,000 jobs to be cut, including 1,600 officer positions, and therefore the closing of several bases. Gen. Douin will have to implement these changes. He will have to pursue the Rafale (to be operational by 2002) and Mirage 2000-5 (to be operational in 1998) programs; launch the major future transport aircraft program; decide on the withdrawal in 1996-97 of the Mirage-IV's from the strategic Air Force; prepare the eventual launch of a second component of nuclear deterrence, the one favored by Gen. Lanata, i.e., the duo comprising the Rafale and a long-range surface-to-air missile. He will also have to ensure that the modernization of the combat fleet is maintained through a steady series of new orders and deliveries. This is an ambitious objective since, if the current pace is maintained, three-fourths of this fleet will be more than 10 years old in the year 2000, whereas today, half of it is less than 10 years old. To succeed Gen. Douin as deputy chief of staff at the Armed Forces staff, the cabinet appointed another aviator, Lieutenant General Jean Rannou. For three years, Gen. Rannou was head of the military staff of the defense minister (under Pierre Joxe and then Francois Leotard), where he proved to be an efficient organizer and a loyal adviser. A master at speaking frankly, which is actually a rather rare (and sometimes burdensome) quality, he knows how to speak in confidence, which is even rarer in the military world.
