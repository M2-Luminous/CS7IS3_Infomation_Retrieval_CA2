The Oslo agreement formulators never even dared put the possibility of foreign observers in the territories in writing. It was taboo as far as Israel was concerned. And yet now Israel has consented, for the first time, to the deployment of an international force in the territories, and it does not matter that it is called "temporary international presence." Since 1967, Israel has refused, in one way or another, all Palestinian demands raised through UN-endorsed resolutions to hand the territories over to international custody. Now the demand has been accepted as the interim stage en route to the territories transfer to the Palestinians. The gain, therefore, is now all 'Arafat's. As for the opponents to the agreement with the PLO, they can, if they like, direct their complaints to Dr. Barukh Goldstein. This was his present to them. The Hebron massacre accelerated proceedings designed to sever and separate Israelis from Palestinians. 'Arafat conceded nothing in the negotiations conducted after the Hebron massacre: Contrary to reports about the Palestinians' waiving the deployment of Palestinian policemen in Hebron, they did not give in even on this issue. 'Arafat had no use for a Palestinian police that was subordinate to Israeli command. He was afraid -- with reason, from his viewpoint -- that the Palestinian public would perceive such policemen as collaborators with the occupation regime. Thus the force of several dozens Norwegians, to which Israel had agreed, became a 160-member observer force with a freedom of action in Hebron. The second Cairo agreement, which was signed yesterday by Amnon Shahaq and Nabil Sha'th, concurs with what any reader of the Oslo agreement has always known -- that Israel is going to surrender the territories it took in 1967. The Oslo agreement has been described as vague and ambiguous in many spheres; the second Cairo agreement elucidates the issues for those who are still in the dark as to Israel's destination. This agreement will also have a political ramification: Please note that within a year, Israel will have gained many enemies in Norway, Denmark, and Italy, three currently friendly countries. The dispatch of observers from these countries to Hebron is the surest way to turn the amicable relations with people from these countries into hostility and resentment.
