To approve the Russian Federation Government's list of causative agents of disease (pathogens) affecting human beings, fauna, and flora, their genetic mutations, and fragments of genetic material and equipment which can be used in the creation [sozdaniye] of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons whose export is controlled and carried out under license (see appendix). 2. The Russian Federation Government shall ratify the statute on the procedure for the control of the export from the Russian Federation of causative agents of disease (pathogens) affecting human beings, fauna, and flora, their genetic mutations, and fragments of genetic material and equipment which can be used in the creation of bacteriological (biological) and toxic weapons. 3. It is prescribed that the foreign economic activity commodity schedule codes indicated in the list appended to this directive may, if necessary, be clarified by the Russian State Customs Committee in conjunction with the Russian Eksportkontrol [Export Control Committee]. 4. The Russian Federation president's directive No. 711-RP, dated 17 November 1992, is deemed to have lapsed. 5. This directive comes into force from the moment of its signing. [signed] B. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation [dated] 14 June 1994 Note. The list is not published. "We Are Conducting an Open Dialogue" Pavel Syutkin, deputy chairman of the Russian President's Chemical and Biological Weapons Convention Problems Committee, now comments on this document. [Syutkin] The Russian President's directive is a kind of stage in the development of our country because this is surely the first time that we have stated clearly and accurately that Russia shares the principles and approaches to the problem of bacteriological and toxin weapons adopted in the civilized world. We have embarked on the path of cooperation and have tacitly begun to cast off the rigid straitjacket which held us tight for many years. [Lyashenko] The international convention "On the Prohibition of the Development, Production, and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction" was signed back in 1972. Is Russia today honoring the commitments made by the USSR when it signed this document? [Syutkin] The president has signed an edict confirming the Russian Federation's succession in law with regard to the Convention's obligations. This means that the development and implementation of biological programs in breach of the convention are prohibited on Russian territory. Control is entrusted to our committee. However, whereas this convention contains detailed measures on the banning and control of chemical weapons, the same cannot be said about bacteriological weapons. There are certain complications here. For example, the basic "raw material" -- the human and fauna pathogens, fragments of genetic material, and various types of equipment and apparatus -- are dual-purpose. The pathogens are essential for research purposes and apparatus is needed for vaccines, but those same instruments can be used to produce bacteriological weapons. Precise criteria are needed governing prohibition and control. Work to elaborate such an approach is under way but that will take many months, if not years. There have been many international conferences since the convention was signed. There was a conference of countries parties to the convention in Geneva in September (?1991) [final digit indistinct], where Russia openly stated its position for the first time. [Lyashenko] The list of pathogens and equipment whose export is controlled and carried out under license contains more than 100 named items. However, many of them are not typical of Russia and are hardly ever encountered here, for example, "Rift Valley fever pathogens" and "banana top bushiness pathogens" [vozbuditel kustistosti verkhushki bananov]. Why have they been included in the list? [Syutkin] This list was drawn up in accordance with the recommendations of the so-called "Australian group." It was created in 1985 and included the 25 most advanced countries. These countries guarantee the implementation of a unified control of the export of materials and equipment which can be used to create bacteriological weapons. Furthermore, all 25 countries are interlinked by a kind of reciprocal pledge: If one of them refuses the export of any materials or equipment to anyone, the others are obliged to follow that example. This reciprocal provision of information, support, understanding, and openness help prevent the proliferation of bacteriological weapons. In June 1993, in accordance with the requirements of the international regime controlling the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the "Australian group" extended and clarified the list of materials and equipment whose export is controlled and carried out under license.
