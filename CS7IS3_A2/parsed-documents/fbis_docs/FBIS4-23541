The council was reacting to amnesty legislation announced by Justice Minister Dullah Omar on Tuesday. It said in a statement the AWB had extended a hand in a "reasonable attempt to bring about peace in our beloved country". "We offered to call a halt to our struggle pending negotiations on a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] if they showed good faith by granting unilateral amnesty for all rightists, those sentenced and awaiting trial. This is, however, clearly excluded in Mr Omar's statement. It is now apparent to us they are not interested in the hand extended to them. They have treated our offer with contempt and have rejected it out of hand," the statement said. It added: "The rejection of our reasonable offer means that our struggle must continue and even intensify."
