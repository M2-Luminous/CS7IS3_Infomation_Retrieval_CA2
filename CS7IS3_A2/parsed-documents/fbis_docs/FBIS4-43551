The Federal Government must explain to the public and to the Bundestag why it does that, he said in Bonn's SPD Press Service on Friday [17 June]. After all, the tax concept was announced in January in the government's annual economic report, which is an official document. Scharping sees primarily one reason for the renunciation: "Chancellor Kohl does not have the courage to tell the people that the government coalition is planning considerable tax increases." It has obviously already been decided that the tax lie of the previous Bundestag election will be repeated, Scharping asserted. Even after the debacle at the European elections, SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping does not want to change anything about the program and the basic line of the election campaign. A few days before the election party congress in Halle (22 June) he announced that the SPD will "increase mobilization, make the will for a change clearer, and improve its reform profile." The election of the candidate for the chancellor's office is to be a secret ballot. "I do not want an acclamation." Even though he pointed out that he is not responsible for every poster, Scharping admitted that he shares responsibility for mistakes. Thus, the western German way of thinking was transferred to the east, where it was not understood. He himself "has done clearly too much during the past half year; concentration is slipping." Scharping still sees a chance to win the Bundestag elections. Yesterday Sharping did "not" want to "discuss publicly" personnel reshuffles in the election campaign team and in the party apparatus. He did not confirm Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen's announcement that the shadow cabinet will be presented at the end of July. Instead, he gave the second half of August as the date. The focal issue of the congress in Halle, which was deliberately scheduled immediately before the Landtag elections in Saxony-Anhalt, is the election program with 230 motions for amendments. Guest speakers are new DGB [German Trade Union Federation] Chairman Dieter Schulte as well as the prime ministers of Spain and Norway, Gonzalez and Brundtland.
