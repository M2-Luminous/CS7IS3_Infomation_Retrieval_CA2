Today, thanks to the ups and downs of Russian-Latvian negotiations, its renown is all but scandalous. But it has already been decided that the radar station will operate for another 4 years, and 18 months will be devoted to disassembly of the equipment. But behind the "technical aspect of the question," the high contracting sides have somehow entirely forgotten about the Skrunda garrison, the service members who to this day regularly go to work at the radar. The unit commander, Lt-Col Aleksandr Nikitin, met us at the staff building. He looked exhausted. They night before a piece of equipment had gone down, and he had to rush all over the place so that everything would be normal by morning. You see, despite the political situation, the radar "garrison" continues to perform its assigned mission. Alert duty is pulled daily by 4 crews on 12-hour shifts. Before, serving at Skrunda was considered a privilege, mainly because of the comfortable geographic location of the garrison, the availability of housing, and convenient transportation to major cities. And topflight specialists served here. Even today practically 90 percent of personnel have an academic education. Meanwhile, once at inter-government negotiations, seeking to "demilitarize" the facility, Latvia asked Russia to replace the military specialists who maintained the radar with civilian ones. But later Latvia was to learn that this proposal was unrealistic. Specialists of this type are trained only in military VUZ [military institutes of higher learning], but even after graduation it takes at least two years before a young officer is allowed on alert duty. Even then, as the unit commander explained, at first he has the skills only for a few operations. But specialists such as Lt-Cols Viktor Mikhaylov, Leonid Zhukov, Valentin Churkin, Pyotr Samorodov, and Majors Pyotr Palamarchuk and Viktor Dedoriv can tell even from the behavior of the apparatus where they should look for or even where they should expect a defect. They're the ones who keep it all going. Incidentally, in the period of breakup of the Union, many specialists from the station went into the armies of the newly formed sovereign states, mainly Ukraine. Thus it turned out that the unit was manned by about 60-70 percent with men from that republic. This is explained quite easily by the fact that radar specialists were trained at Kharkov and Zhitomir. "Some of them didn't care for the Ukrainian Army, and tried to return," Lt-Col Aleksandr Nikitin recalled, "but the command figures that for these people there is no turning back." Now only the most reliable remain to work at the facility. And besides alert duty, they still have to protect the military camp, an territory of 42 hectares. Even the wives and children of the officers have joined the ranks, so to speak. This was forced largely by the absence of replacements of compulsory service troops for two years. We spoke with two nice women in military uniform, the Ryzhikovs, mother and daughter. The officer's wife, Larisa Sergeyevna, is a PFC, and works as an expediter at the communications center, while her daughter Larisa is a private and radio telegraph operator. They like the service. "We feel a real army kinship!" In addition, the unit command has tried not only to resolve problems involving the training of female specialists, but also to maximally settle day-to-day problems. We were told by the unit psychologist, Lt-Col Sergey Pakhomov, "There is a kindergarten, grade school, club, music school, and the children's Russian folk ensemble "Kuderyshki" operating in the garrison." In each of the 10 residential buildings for officers, small, cozy food stores have opened their doors. A joint Russian-Latvian enterprise created on the basis of the military store provides the wares. But then, the freshest dairy products can also be purchased at the garrison KPP [traffic regulating point] from residents of local villages. It is too bad that we did not manage to see our interlocutors at their combat posts. On orders from Moscow, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA journalists were not allowed near the operating radar "Dnestr-M." But we did visit the new one, the "Daryal." It is a sad sight, an abandoned, first-class military facility. It is hard to realize that life will not pulse after all in the heart of this mighty, nearly hundred-meter high building. And how much manpower and resources are still needed to disassemble it all! "We missed our chance to come to an agreement on the fate of the radar" the officers escorting us said with one voice. "The decision about mothballing and disassembly should have been made in 1991-1992, when there were contract organizations and builders here." Well, that's life. It remains only to repeat that the outmoded station "Dnestr-M" in Skrunda will keep working for another 4 years, and then the entire Commonwealth of Independent States, Russia included, will be without the means of detecting attacking missiles on this flank. It is possible to restore the former degree of protection only by spending new, enormous sums. But you know, it all might have been different if we had shown political far-sightedness back then.
