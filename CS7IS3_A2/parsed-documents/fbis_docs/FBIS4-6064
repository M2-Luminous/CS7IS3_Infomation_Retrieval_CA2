Previously the government, while working on non-NPT member nations such as India, Pakistan, and Israel to join the NPT, said that it would not allow them to possess military-use nuclear materials. However, the government has concluded that the cut-off pact will serve as "supplement" to the NPT (according to a Foreign Ministry source) and that in order to strengthen the international system to check nuclear proliferation, it is better to conclude the cut-off pact with non-NPT member nations than asking those nations to abandon nuclear materials which they currently possess. This cut-off pact was proposed by President Clinton in his speech to the United Nations last September. Outline of the proposal is: 1) a multilateral pact should be concluded to ban the production of such military-use nuclear materials as highly enriched uranium and plutonium; 2) the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] should inspect member nations to check whether nuclear materials are used for military purposes; and 3) military-use nuclear materials which the member nations already possess are exempted from the IAEA inspections. The possible conclusion of the cut-off pact will lead to the creation of the third nuclear control system composed of countries which possesses nuclear materials but not armed with nuclear weapons, in addition to the NPT, in which nuclear control group is divided into two: one composed of nations which possess nuclear weapons; the other composed of non-nuclear nations. Nuclear inspections will also be carried out of the third group. The major controversial point of the proposal is that there is the possibility that nations which are suspected of storing military-purpose nuclear materials will be allowed to keep those nuclear materials. However, India recently indicated an interest in the proposal, and among the non-NPT member nations, there is a positive move toward concluding the cut-off pact. Therefore, it is likely that debates on merits and demerits of the proposal will be brisk on a world-wide scale.
