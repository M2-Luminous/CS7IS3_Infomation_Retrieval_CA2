Colleague Bechir Hedebil has prepared the following report on the visit and its results. [Hedebil] The Greek foreign minister stressed that the troika delegation came to Algeria with a message of support from the European Union [EU] for the Algerian economic plan and national dialogue. George Papandreou described the talks between the European delegation and Algerian officials, led by [President] Liamine Zeroual as serious and frank. In the economic sphere, the European delegation expressed its deep satisfaction at the economic plan and the government's concern about economic reforms. The Algerian Government delegation, led by [Prime Minister] Mokdad Sifi, was reassured about the EU's support for Algeria in its negotiations with international financial institutions. Papandreou said: [Papandreou, in English with superimposed Arabic translation] In the discussions we also talked about the recent signing of the agreement with the IMF and we expressed our support for Algeria because that agreement is regarded as a solid basis which demonstrates and proves the Algerian Government's determination to continue the economic reforms. We have expressed our support for these serious efforts. We also discussed constructive proposals for cooperation between Algeria and the EU. We made proposals on support and help for these efforts to achieve the government's plan. [Hedebil] Regarding assistance or financial support, Papandreou said: [Papandreou] We have announced to the Algerian Government that 150 million ECU's, which is the second installment of a loan, will be paid to Algeria soon. Regarding the proposal and request for a new loan of 200 million ECU's, we have replied affirmatively to the Algerian request in order to consolidate the economic stabilization plan. The request will be submitted officially to the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers in forthcoming sessions. A delegation of European experts will visit Algeria to hold in-depth talks with Algerian counterparts to discuss joint action to consolidate and implement the economic plan. [Hedebil] Papandreou concluded by saying that Algeria possessed enormous resources and had a very important future, and that the EU supported its plan and would make every effort to achieve the reforms by developing a partnership. In the political sphere, the Greek minister stressed the need to support the democratic process: [Papandreou] Again let me stress as we have during our discussions that the European Union favors, supports and backs democratic governments, wherever they may be, which respect human rights, aspire to economic stability and the realization of reforms, including social reforms, and strongly condemns the use of violence and terrorism. The Algerian minister of foreign affairs, Mohamed Salah Dembri, focussed on the European delegation's understanding of the difficult situation in Algeria and the pressing need for supporting it financially in order to achieve economic and political stability in the country. [Hedebil] He said that Algeria was determined to achieve market economy, had a deep desire to have economic dealings with the EU and that it had put an end to the old economic obstacles.
