Box 3027, Gillette, Wyoming 82717&hyph;3027 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 77.1607(u) (loading and haulage equipment; operation) to its Buckskin Mine (I.D. No. 48&hyph;01200) located in Campbell County, Wyoming. The petitioner requests a variance from the mandatory standard for towing of haul trucks and other large off highway surface mine equipment. The petitioner proposes to use a portable hydraulic unit to supply power to the necessary functions of disabled equipment in order to move it safely. The petitioner states that proper training would be provided to every miner responsible for using this equipment. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 2.

The petitioner requests a modification of the mandatory standard to permit the use of temporary ventilation controls in the room necking procedure for rooms developed less than 600 feet. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 3. Ram Head Coal Company [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;138&hyph;C] Ram Head Coal Company, 277 Main Street, Joliet, Pennsylvania 17981 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1400 (hoisting equipment; general) to its Primrose Slope (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08454) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Because of steep, frequently changing pitch and numerous curves and knuckles in the main haulage slope, the petitioner proposes to use the gunboat without safety catches in transporting persons. As an alternate, when using the gunboat to transport persons, the petitioner proposes to use an increased rope strength safety factor and secondary safety connections which are securely fastened around the gunboat and to the hoisting rope above the main connecting device. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 4.

The petitioner requests a modification of the mandatory standard to permit the drill to continue drilling the shot pattern while loading is in progress.

The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.
