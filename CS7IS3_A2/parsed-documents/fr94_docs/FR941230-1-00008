FR941230-1-00008 FR941230-1-00003 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;24&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Beech Aircraft Corporation Model F90, and 99, 100, and 200 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to certain Beech Aircraft Corporation (Beech) Model F90, and 99, 100, and 200 series airplanes. The proposed action would require installing a circuit breaker on the landing gear motor control panel assembly. A report where excessive current flow caused the electrical landing gear motor and wiring to catch fire on a Beech Model 200 airplane prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent excessive current flow through the electrical landing gear motor, which, if not corrected, could cause an airplane fire. DATES: Comments must be received on or before February 27, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket 94&hyph;CE&hyph;24&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.
