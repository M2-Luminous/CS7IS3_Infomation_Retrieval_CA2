This may lower the reliability of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, which prevents diversion of nuclear materials to military use, and the image of Japan, which takes pride in being "IAEA's model student," is greatly damaged. It is whispered that the incident may stimulate world opinion, including the United States, which is critical of Japan's use of plutonium. Enough Plutonium To Make More Than Eight Atomic Bombs The news came to light after Paul Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, a U.S. organization critical of Japan's nuclear power policy, obtained information that a huge amount of plutonium was stuck to the equipment of the fuel plant, and asked the U.S. State Department to seek the facility's shutdown. At the end of April, immediately before the incident was brought to light, the IAEA had directed Japan to reduce the amount of plutonium adhering to the equipment during an annual meeting with the Japanese Government. Using a neutron measuring instrument called "Holdup Measuring Equipment" at the plant, the IAEA had checked whether the amount of plutonium sticking to the equipment agrees with the amount reported by the PNC, which runs the facility. However, since the measuring equipment has a margin of error of 10-15 percent, 8 kilograms -- which is a "significant quantity" for the production of a nuclear bomb -- falls within the range of error when the amount of holdup is 70 kg. This means that 8 kg of plutonium could escape detection even when the amount is cooked up with evil intentions, and the PNC had already been working on full- scale measures to improve the situation when the news was brought to light. "Aim at Reducing Plutonium by Half for the Moment" Since the beginning of the factory's operation, approximately 3 tons of plutonium have been brought in the production lines, and about 2.3 percent of the amount has been left inside the equipment. It is difficult to judge whether this percentage of holdup is large or small because there are only a small number of plutonium fuel production facilities in the world. The process of making plutonium fuel is similar to that of medicine, in which tablets are made by compressing powder. "In the process of manufacturing tablets, about 2 percent of the powder material is lost," according to Sankyo Co., Ltd., a drug manufacturer. The fuel factory produces cylindrical fuel pellets (diameter 5 mm, height 8 mm) for the fast breeder reactor "Monju." The mixture of plutonium and uranium powder is processed in the following way: granulation, casting, sintering, grinding, and inspection. To avoid exposure to radioactivity, the production lines are sealed in containers called glove boxes, and operators work behind safety glass with gloves. Of the 30 glove boxes in total, plutonium holdup was confirmed in 17. In particular, a large amount of plutonium sludge was found in the casting lines (two), where the powder is shaped into pellets, and the grinding line, where the surface of a sintered pellet is smoothed. The combined total holdup in those three lines was 40 kg. In the casting process, the powder scatters when the source material in a mold is pressed vertically from both directions. In the grinding process, shaved powder was not collected completely. The powder that accumulated where the workers could not reach, such as the back of the equipment, had to be left as it was. To collect the plutonium residue completely, the production lines have to be stopped. But, especially for the last one or two years, priority was reportedly given to the production of fuel to meet the critical state of "Monju," and there was no time for cleaning. For the moment, the PNC has to reduce the amount of plutonium holdup so that the amount that falls within the range of measurement error becomes much lower than the significant quantity of 8 kg. "To reduce 70 kg by half is our goal for the time being," according to the PNC Nuclear Fuel Facility Planning Department. Casting and grinding equipment, where plutonium was stuck intensely, have already been replaced with the new ones, which are designed to allow less scattering of plutonium powder. "Increase in the amount of residue must be smaller than before," the PNC said. The old equipment will be dismantled and cleaned, and the plutonium will be collected. The United States Attempts To Undermine Japan? Overseas reaction to the news, such as that of the U.S. Government which is sensitive to Japan's use of plutonium, weighs on our minds. The Japan-U.S. Nuclear Agreement stipulates that the United States, which supplies enriched uranium, a source for plutonium, can seek a facility's shutdown, if Japan commits a serious violation of safeguards. Leventhal's advice to the State Department had this in mind. However, Japan's Science and Technology Agency does not seem to worry about this point: "It is certainly a problem that the amount of plutonium adhering to the equipment was large, but it is not a serious violation because the plutonium is not missing" (Atomic Energy Bureau). Rather, the agency's Atomic Energy Bureau is interested in "why a private U.S. organization got the information at this time." Regarding plutonium, Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary has recently complained, which is unusual, about the content of the PNC's video for public relations. That the United States is irritated by the fact that Japan has begun to use plutonium seriously is well known. About how the information of plutonium holdup came to light this time, not a few people concerned think of it as "a U.S. attempt to undermine Japan in an indirect way."
