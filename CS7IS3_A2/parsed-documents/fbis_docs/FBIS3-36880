The Tiraspol leaders consider this has become necessary due "to increasing attacks of Chisinau on the Dniester administration". Thus the parliament fired back the Wednesday statement of Moldovan President Mircea Snegur, who accused Tiraspol of attempts to aggravate the socio-political situation and block the implementation of the Moscow agreement on the peaceful settlement of the conflict, signed in August 1992. "The presence of international observers may prevent economic siege and a new military conflict in the region", the parliament statement said. The document reiterated that the Dniester province will not take part in Moldova's parliamentary elections scheduled for February 27. The situation is apparently hotting up in the Dniester province. "A single provocation will be enough to have a military conflict unleashed", Valeriy Prudnikov, chief of police in the Dniester town of Bendery told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. Prudnikov complained that the Dniester leaders "stur up local population against the police", which is subordinate to Chisinau Interior Ministry. Dniester is not the only pain in the back for Chisinau. Leaders of the self-proclaimed Gagauz Republic in the southern part of Moldova insist that the 14th Russian Army deployed in the former Soviet republic must be granted the status of peace-keeping forces. This will prevent Chisinau's possible attempts to solve by force the problem of Moldova's two provinces -- Dniester and Gagauzia, said a statement signed by Gagauz leaders. The Army itself warned all sides against "the illusions to solve the conflict by force". The statement of the command of the 14th Army circulated on Wednesday stressed that "organizers of armed provocations from both banks (of the Dniester River) will get severe punishment for any attempt to unleash a new conflict". The military appealed to politicians to seek for a political settlement of "all difficult but still solvable problems" basing on the Moscow accords.
