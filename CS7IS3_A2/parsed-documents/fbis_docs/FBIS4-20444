The recombinant plasmids pSAG1-19, pSAG2A-19 were identified by restriction digestion, Southern blot hybridization and detection of antigenicity and immunogenicity of the fusion protein from transformed E. coli. The inserted BamHI-7 fragment, approximately 6.9 kb, of the recombinant plasmids contained the glycoprotein gp50 gene.
