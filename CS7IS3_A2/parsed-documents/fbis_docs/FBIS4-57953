Today, the Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat [Secofi] invited businessmen and individuals involved in the production or marketing of those articles to express their opinions "for or against" speeding up the opening. Secofi has reported that, to determine whether or not this expeditiousness is appropriate, the secretariat has consulted with the involved producers, chambers, and agricultural, livestock, and industrial associations through the Coordinating Board for Entrepreneurial Foreign Trade Organizations [COECE]. The list was composed based on this consultation. The list includes glass, wine, vegetables, dairy products, grain, fruit, chemicals, vitamins, film, paper, fiber, textiles, fabric, footwear, silverware, screws, refrigerators, freezers, dryers, dishwashers, washers, machinery and equipment, ovens, stoves, bicycle spare parts, and tools, in general, among others. We are dealing with the elimination of tariffs for a large number of articles. Some of the lines include bilateral export products whose quantities and values are considerable. The invitation, published today in DIARIO OFICIAL DE LA FEDERACION, says: "Public consultation on the expeditious lifting of tariffs for products of North American origin, as stipulated by NAFTA, is hereby requested." The consultation will last one month. Negotiations will start later. The negotiations will be virtually bilateral because Canada's demands to expedite the commercial opening are relatively few in relation to those presented by the United States and Mexico. Canada's requests represent only 8 percent of the total to be discussed. According to NAFTA's paragraph 3 of article 302, NAFTA member countries can speed up the opening. "On request of any one of the members, the interested parties will carry out consultations to consider the possibility of expediting the elimination of tariffs provided for in the tariff elimination lists." The inclusion of these products does not represents a priori commitment for the opening, but only the intention to sit down and negotiate. Nevertheless, "generally speaking, the three countries will consider lifting the tariffs on the products included on the list." The 157 products appear on the list at the request of three countries' production sectors. In Mexico, all modifications will involve consultations with the involved sectors and will be negotiated between the governments later, Secofi said. For this reason and to incorporate into the consultation process the opinions and proposals "of all interested parties," Secofi has invited all persons and enterprises who so desire to express their views on this subject through their chambers or associations represented at COECE. Views for or against speeding up the opening for the products included on the list should be addressed to the entrepreneurial representatives prior to 23 June 1994. The remarks should include the name of the tariff group involved, the signatory's economic activities and the reasons for his interest, and specific arguments supporting his case, such as the effect on jobs, production, and exports. The negotiations, "scheduled to be held in a few weeks," will discuss only the products included in the groups listed. In addition, the Mexican Government will agree to modify the speed of tariff elimination on goods from the United States and Canada and determine whether the consultation shows absolute consensus for speeding up the process among the national production sectors involved. According to the list, which will also be released in the United States, the two governments will negotiate the expeditious lifting of tariffs on products such as wine (including sparkling wine, grape must, brandy, and wine coolers); various types of glass; textiles, such as flat cotton fabrics; polyester fibers; metalized thread, velvet, and plush; garments, such as suits, trousers, and silk ties; cotton towels; curtains; and various types of footwear. The list also includes vegetables, such as potatoes, asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, and dried beans, and fruits, such as mangoes, lemons, and grapefruit. Also, corn flour, preserves, prepared or preserved tomatoes, and grapefruit juice and other citrus products. [sentence fragment as published] Also included on the list are photographic films, herbicides, lumber, blinds, chemical paper, silverware, screws, untreated zinc, stove spare parts, scissors, refrigerators, freezers, driers, dishwashers, washers, electric ovens, stoves, and ranges. The list also includes chemicals such as sodium cyanide, monochlorodifluorethane, ethyl hexanol, tributylamine, ethylenediamine, diethylentriamine, triethylentetramine, lovastatine, e-nalapril malleate, hexamethylen, and sulfamerazine, among others. In the invitation, Secofi points out that a country can refrain from participating in the negotiations on a given tariff group for two basic reasons: either the importing of that product to the country is already free of tariffs or the country has no interest in eliminating the tariff.
