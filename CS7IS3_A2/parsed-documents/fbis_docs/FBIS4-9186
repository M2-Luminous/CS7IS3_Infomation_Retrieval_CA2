Three Serb soldiers were wounded in the shelling, which has set fire to a large tract of forest, two kilometres south of gorazde, the local command of the Bosnian Serb Army has said. The Moslems were again using schools, hospitals and residential buildings for their operations against the Serbs, the Serb Army command said. The Moslem media have alleged that the Serbs are attacking these locations, and the falsehood has been picked up by many world media. Bosnian Serbs on Wednesday unilaterally declared a ceasefire and agreed to the deployment of two platoons of U.N. peacekeepers in the area, in line with an agreement struck with U.N. officials on Tuesday. The Moslems have once again spurned the peace offering and are continuing to attack. Moslems are continuing to attack Bosnian Serb positions on other fronts in Bosnia as well, and are bring in reinforcements to Brcko in the north, which they are keeping under constant artillery fire. In the Doboj area, also in the north, the worst Moslem attacks have been from small arms, hand grenades and mortars at Teslic. Bosnian Serb positions at Teslic, south of Doboj, have come under a steady stream of mortar fire, eliciting a response in kind, which has effectively put an end to the Moslem operations. Moslems were also opening small-arms and sniper fire at the Serbs on the Trebava front, east of Doboj, Bosnian Serb sources reported.
