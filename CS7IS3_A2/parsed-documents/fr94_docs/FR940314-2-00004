FR940314-2-00004 FR940314-2-00003 Food and Nutrition Service RIN 0584&hyph;AB61 Food Stamp Program: Maximum Allotments for Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands AGENCY: Food and Nutrition Service, USDA. ACTION: General Notice SUMMARY: By this notice, the Department of Agriculture is updating the maximum food stamp allotments for participating households in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. These annual adjustments, required by law, take into account changes in the cost of food and statutory adjustments. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 1, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Judith M. Seymour, Supervisor, Eligibility and Certification Regulations Section, Certification Policy Branch, Program Development Division, Food Stamp Program, Food and Nutrition Service, USDA, Alexandria, Virginia 22302, (703) 305&hyph;2496. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Publication As required by law, State agencies implemented this action on October 1, 1993 based on advance notice of the new amounts. Based on regulations published at 47 FR 46485 (October 19, 1982) annual statutory adjustments to the maximum allotment levels, income eligibility standards, and deductions are issued by General Notices published in the Federal Register and not through rulemaking proceedings. Classification Executive Order 12866 The Food and Nutrition Service is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and has determined that it is not a ``significant regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department, it has been determined that this action: (1) Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; (2) would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; (3) would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (4) would not materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and (5) would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. Executive Order 12372 The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For the reasons set forth in the Final rule and related Notice to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V (48 FR 29116, June 24, 1983), this program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order No. 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. Regulatory Flexibility Act William E. Ludwig, the Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service, has certified that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The action will increase the amount of money spent on food through increases in food stamp benefits issued to participating households. However, this money will be distributed among the nation's food vendors as the food stamps are used by households, so the effect on any one vendor will not be significant.
