The report, to be presented in a mainland affairs meeting to be held early next month, says competition between Taiwan and the mainland will become increasingly fierce, with Mainland China likely to take over U.S.$17 billion worth of Taiwan's export markets, or 20.56 percent of Taiwan's total export value registered in 1993. Competition in wooden, bamboo, nonmetal furniture and miscellaneous industries will be strongest, the report says, adding that as high as 70.1 percent of Taiwan's markets in these fields may be lost to the mainland. Mainland China may also snatch 40 percent of Taiwan's garment and costume accessories markets in the next few years, the report warns. It points out that because Mainland China has cheap labor and rich natural resources, its export competitiveness has grown rapidly in recent years, particularly in some labor-intensive industries. The mainland will become even more competitive in some technology-intensive industries after 1997 when Hong Kong will revert to its rule, the report says. Taiwan's electronics, machinery, automobile and motorcycle makers will face ever stronger competition in the years ahead, the report adds.
