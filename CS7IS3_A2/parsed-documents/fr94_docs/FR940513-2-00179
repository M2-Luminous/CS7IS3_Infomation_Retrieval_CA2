FR940513-2-00179 FR940513-2-00086 In addition, or as an alternative to a letter of credit, GSU may: (1) Provide an insurance policy for one or more series of Tax-Exempt Bonds, and/or (2) obtain authentication of and pledge one or more new series of its First Mortgage Bonds (``Collateral Bonds'') to be issued under GSU's mortgage and delivered to the trustee or the bank to evidence and secure GSU's obligations under the Equipment Lease or the Reimbursement Agreement. Such Collateral Bonds could be issued: (1) In a principal amount equal to the principal amount of Tax-Exempt Bonds and bearing interest at a rate equal to the rate of interest on such Tax-Exempt Bonds; (2) in a principal amount equivalent to the principal amount of Tax-Exempt Bonds plus an amount equal to interest on those Tax-Exempt Bonds for a specified period and bearing no interest; (3) in a principal amount equivalent to the principal amount of Tax-Exempt Bonds or in such amount plus an amount equal to interest on those Tax-Exempt Bonds for a specified period, but carrying a fixed interest rate that would be lower than the fixed interest rate of the Tax-Exempt Bonds; or (4) in a principal amount of Tax-Exempt Bonds at an adjustable rate of interest, varying with such Tax-Exempt Bonds but having a ceiling rate of 13%. Each series of the Collateral Bonds that would bear interest would do so at a fixed interest rate or initial adjustable interest rate not to exceed 13%. The terms of the Collateral Bonds will correspond to the terms of the related Tax-Exempt Bonds. The maximum amount of the Collateral Bonds would be $300 million, and the Collateral Bonds would be in addition to the aggregate limitation on the Bonds specified above. In connection with the proposed Tax-Exempt Bonds financing, GSU requests a finding of the Commission that competitive bidding of Collateral Bonds pursuant to Rule 50 is inappropriate since the Collateral Bonds would be issued and pledged solely to secure GSU's obligations and no public offering of the Collateral Bonds would be made. GSU also proposes to use, in addition to or as an alternative for the proceeds from the sale of the Bonds, MTNs, Preferred and/or Tax-Exempt Bonds, other available funds to acquire, through tender offers, open market or negotiated purchases, in whole or in part, prior to their respective maturities, not more than $600 million aggregate principal amount and par value and/or stated value of: (1) One or more series of GSU's outstanding first mortgage bonds or sub-series of MTNs, (2) one or more series of GSU's outstanding preferred stock, (3) one or more series of outstanding tax-exempt bonds heretofore issued for the benefit of GSU, (4) GSU's outstanding series of debentures, and/or (5) GSU's outstanding series of preference stock. GSU states that it will not use the proceeds from the sale of the Bonds, MTNs, Preferred and/or Tax-Exempt Bonds to enter into refinancing transactions unless: (1) the estimated present value savings derived from the net difference between interest or dividend payments on a new issue of comparable securities and those securities refunded is, on an after-tax basis, greater than the present value of all repurchasing, redemption, tendering and issuing costs, assuming an appropriate discount rate, determined on the basis of the then estimated after-tax cost of capital of Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries, consolidated; or (2) GSU shall have notified the Commission of the proposed refinancing transaction (including the terms thereof) and obtained appropriate authorization to consummate the transaction. Louisiana Power & Light Co. (70&hyph;8391) Louisiana Power & Light Company (``LP&L''), 639 Loyola Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana 70113, an electric utility subsidiary company of Entergy Corporation (``Entergy''), a registered holding company, has filed an declaration, pursuant to Sections 6(a) and 7 of the Act and Rule 50(a)(5). LP&L proposes to issue and sell up to $326 million in secured lease obligation bonds (``Refunding Bonds''), in one or more series through December 31, 1995, in order to redeem approximately $310 million in previously issued and sold secured lease obligation bonds (``Original Bonds''). By orders dated September 26, 1989 (HCAR No. 24956) and September 27, 1989 (HCAR No. 24958) (``Orders''), LP&L sold to and leased back from three separate trusts ``(Lessors''), on a long-term net lease basis pursuant to three separate facility leases (``Leases''), an approximate 9.3% aggregate ownership interest (``Undivided Interests'') in Unit No. 3 of the Waterford nuclear power plant (``Waterford 3'') in three almost identical but separate transactions. The First National Bank of Commerce (``Owner-Trustee'') is the trustee for these trusts. LP&L now has an approximate 9.3% leasehold interest in Waterford 3. The purchase price of the Undivided Interests was $353.6 million. About $43,603,000 was provided through equity contributions of the owner-participant in each of the three Lessor trusts. About $309,997,000 was provided through issuance of the Original Bonds by the Owner-Trustee in an underwritten public offering. The Original Bonds consist of three separate series of secured lease obligation bonds, with an annual interest rate of 10.30%, to mature on January 2, 2005, issued in an aggregate principal amount of $140,452,000 (``2005 Bonds''), and three separate series of secured lease obligation bonds, with an annual interest rate of 10.67%, to mature on January 2, 2017, issued in an aggregate principal amount of $169,545,000 (``2017 Bonds'').
