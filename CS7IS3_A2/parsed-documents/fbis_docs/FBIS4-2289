Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing, told deputies attending the second session of the 8th Municipal Political Consultative Conference here that the municipal government has begun to sell grain and cooking oil reserves to its citizens as a way to lower prices. The cost of daily necessities has been growing rapidly in recent months in the Chinese capital. Last year's retail prices rose by 16.9 percent in the city and many members at the conference have shown concern whether the city can achieve the target to keep the price rise under 10 percent this year. This target was announced by China's Premier Li Peng in his government work report to the recent National People's Congress session. Zhang Liyuan, a professor at Beijing University, proposed at the city's on-going session that Beijing should supervise the prices of daily necessities item by item. Prices should be checked daily, individually, on such daily necessities as grain, cooking oil, meat, vegetables, eggs and milk. Citizens should be given price check results regularly, according to the professor. The mayor said that Beijing is to increase its investment in vegetable farms and adopt a series of other measures to ensure a booming market supply and to slow down price growth.
