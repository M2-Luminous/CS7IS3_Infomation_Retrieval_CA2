According to the party's declaration issued yesterday, its objectives are to support the unification of China, promote sincere interaction between the mainland and Taiwan as well as uphold the prosperity of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. At the party's inaugural ceremony yesterday, chairman Lawrence Yum Sinling said people could not label the party as pro-Taiwan. "We have just started up. I think people should see what we are doing before labelling us," he said. Although about 10 of the party's members were graduates from universities in Taiwan, it did not mean the party was pro-Taiwan, he said. The members were Chinese and had lived and grown up in Hong Kong. The party's vice-chairman, Willy Ng Wai-cho, said the party had 82 members. Nine of them were municipal council and district board members, including Chiang Sai-cheong, Shung King-fai and Christopher Chu Cho-yan. Mr Yum said the party would communicate with other liberal camps because it demanded that councillors of all levels be elected by universal suffrage as soon as possible to ensure a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong. Mr Ng said that, like the democratic flagship the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK), the party wanted to have 30 directly elected seats in the Legislative Council returned in the 1995 election. He said about 10 members of the new party were also members of the UDHK and a few were members of Meeting Point or the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood. The party would accept members who belonged to other parties. Mr Ng, who is also a member of the UDHK, said he had decided to run in the district board elections in September as a candidate of the new party. He said he had informed the UDHK of his decision. He did not want to withdraw from the UDHK but he would respect its decision if the party would not allow a candidate running for elections to belong to more than one party. Mr Ng said 13 other members of the new alliance had informed the party that they would be interested in running in the district board elections. The party would need further discussion to decide how many candidates to field in the election, he said. Mr Yum said the party had raised about $100,000 mainly from friends. When asked whether the party would accept financial support from pro-Taiwan organisations, Mr Yum said it would accept anybody's contributions as long as they were unconditional.
