The issue will be put to international agenda next month when the IAEA holds board of governors meeting, she said. The IAEA wants to conduct specific tests to verify that North Korea did not divert any nuclear material since the last inspection and to allow future verification while ensuring continuity in safeguards, Shelly told a noon briefing. "North Korea, while agreeing with a number of the planned measures, indicated that a significant number of other required measures, ones that were outlined by the IAEA, would not be allowed," she explained. "The IAEA will not send an inspection team to North Korea unless there is full agreement on the safeguard measures which have been specified and have been judged necessary for a meaningful inspection," said Shelly. While predicting a "formal review on this" at the February board meeting, the spokeswoman emphasized the complexity of the situation. The United States or the security council will call a halt when "they feel that there is nothing meaningful" in ongoing talks. "This is not a simple issue," she said. But Washington is hopeful still of a settlement, according to Shelly, "I think the fact that North Korea is in Vienna and is trying to work out the details with the IAEA is an indication that they are committed to finding a resolution to the problem." There was no planned contact with North Korea in New York, she added.
