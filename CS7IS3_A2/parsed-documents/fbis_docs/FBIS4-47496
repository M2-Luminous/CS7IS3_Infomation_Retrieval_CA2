Tolkova, Nizhegorod University, Nizhniy Novgorod; UDC 535.317.1] [Abstract] Reconstructing the image of an astronomical and thus remote object seen through a distorting medium such as the atmosphere is considered, specifically reconstructing the phases of its spatial spectrum from closure phases obtained in one exposure. A spectrum phase can be completely determined from two interference patterns simultaneously recorded by two interferometers with angular shifts _a_ and 2_a_ respectively. These data are sufficient for determining the closure phases on three basises forming an isosceles triangle whose base is longer than its arms, each closure phase then representing a recurrence relation. One known reconstruction algorithm (F. Roddier, C. Roddier; OPTICAL COMMUNICATION, Vol. 60 No. 6, 1986) yields an exact solution to recurrence equations in the form of an infinite series on basis triangles shrinking toward the center of the aperture with coefficients forming a geometric progression, but gives no evidence about the convergence of this solution and about its immunity to noise in the input data. Another algorithm is therefore proposed which includes determination of the permissible noise level in the input data. First the plane of closure phases is constructed from the light intensity distributions on two interference patterns with �/2 and � angular shifts respectively. Next is formed the combination k(u,v)= _b_(u,v) + _b_(v,-u) + _b_(u+v,v-u) of bispetrum phases for reconstruction of the spectrum phases. The problem of reconstructing the image from noisy input data is solved by avoiding the inherent ill-conditioning of this problem, namely by reconstructing not the absolutely exact image of an object but the image most closely approximating it and, therefore, by using the optimally long k-series which will minimize the error at the given noise level. Both correctness and effectiveness of this algorithm are confirmed by a numerical experiment involving the image of letter T and the image of letter C with superscript ++ (C[.sup]++[/]).
