FBIS4-6166 "dreas075__a94023" FBIS-EAS-94-075-A Daily Report 19 April 1994 ANNEX Japan NEC To Expand Purchases of Foreign Parts NEC To Expand Purchases of Foreign Parts OW1504132194 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 13 Apr Evening Edition p 1 OW1504132194 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] NEC Corporation has started the work of choosing foreign parts manufacturers from which it will import after concluding that the purchase of parts from abroad is a centerpiece of its measures to cut production costs. The major Japanese commercial electronics maker intends to import a variety of parts used in manufacturing personal computers, printers, and POS (point of sale system). The Japanese firm, which aims to reduce production costs by half by the end of 1995, has concluded that with the appreciated yen, the purchase of parts from abroad is the most effective way to cut production costs rather than innovation in production lines and design changes which take a long time. The Japanese firm plans to develop NEC Technology Hong Kong, its subsidiary in Hong Kong, into an overseas supplier of parts for it. One staff person from the Japanese firm is presently stationed in NEC Technology Hong Kong, but the Japanese firm plans to increase greatly the number of staff and its subsidiary's technological capability in a bid to secure the quality of parts that it imports. NEC's subsidiary in Hong Kong manufactures personal computers, printers, and hard disk drives (HDD). A NEC Corporation factory in Japan has already decided to import substrate for use in manufacturing personal computers from the subsidiary in Hong Kong beginning this autumn, and the factory is expected to diversify the kind of parts to import both in 1994 and 1995. NEC Corporation has yet to decide how high it should raise the ratio of overseas purchase of parts to the domestic purchase of parts, but each division of the company will map out a set of measures to expand the overseas purchase of parts that are expected to reduce the production costs. The personal computer division has begun to purchase substrate from Taiwanese makers. NEC Corporation is thinking of widely purchasing parts from foreign makers, including NEC-affiliated foreign makers.
