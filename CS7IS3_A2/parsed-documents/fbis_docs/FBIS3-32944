FBIS3-32944 "drlat032_o_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-032 Document Type:Daily Report 16 Feb 1994 Colombia * Sintura Aide Allegedly Accepted Bribes * Private Secretary Arrested 94SM0215A Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 13 Jan 94 pp 1, 8A 94SM0215A Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO Language: Spanish Article Type:CSO [Text] Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Jose Sintura was forced to remove his private secretary from office after an elite investigative team working directly under the authority of Prosecutor General Gustavo De Greff found evidence justifying an investigation of the official for alleged "bribes." As Sintura's private secretary, Orlando Caceres Henao had succeeded in making himself indispensable in the office. Taking advantage of that position, he apparently hinted that he wielded some influence in the processing of documents and demanded sums of money in return for his "services." Complaints from several citizens--said to be contractors and suppliers for the Prosecutor General's Office--led the prosecutor general's elite investigative team to begin its respective inquiries. Only hours ago, a prosecutor made the decision to take Caceres Henao into custody. Once the investigators had informed Sintura of the result of their preliminary investigations and of the decision made by the prosecutor handling the case, the deputy prosecutor general removed the official from his post. Reliable sources told EL TIEMPO that "Caceres was demanding commissions allegedly ranging from 300,000 to 700,000 pesos, assuring the potential blackmail victims that he could speed up the obtention of signatures needed on contracts. The source stressed that "what was most unusual about this case is that Caceres was not in a position to influence any decision because his responsibility amounted to no more than verifying whether documents required by the Prosecutor General's Office were complete and in order." Nor did the official have access to confidential reports that form part of the records in cases involving drug trafficking or plea bargaining. Even as EL TIEMPO continued its efforts to get in touch with Sintura yesterday, no more than a brief bulletin was released by the Press Office. In it, the deputy prosecutor general deplored the events and noted that routine internal inspections had led to the "discovery of conduct that might constitute a violation of criminal law." Sources consulted by EL TIEMPO indicated that the alleged crime of extortion was based on the original report said to have been given to the elite team. Impeccable sources report that Caceres, who is to be questioned in the hours ahead, once worked for the Office of International Affairs, another department under the Office of the Deputy Prosecutor General. However, those same sources refrained from giving out any details about the period under investigation or other rumored irregularities that the Prosecutor General's Office may have discovered. The bulletin from the Press Office reads as follows: "The deputy prosecutor general regrets to inform the public that routine internal inspection procedures established by the institution some time ago have led to the discovery of conduct that might constitute a violation of criminal law. Because of the investigation being conducted by the Office of Prosecutor General, Orlando Caceres Henao was taken into custody following his removal from the post he held as private secretary to the deputy prosecutor general."
