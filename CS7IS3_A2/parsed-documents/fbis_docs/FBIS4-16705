Station commentator (Aleksey Kontrachev) indicates that the DPRK president once more made clear the DPRK's position regarding the inspection of the radiochemical laboratory and another nuclear site in Yongbyon. According to the IAEA's opinion, the two sites are producing plutonium needed for nuclear weapons. Other countries, as well, have the same suspicion. Neighboring countries, in particular, harbor such suspicion. However, President Kim Il-song said: Pyongyang has nothing to hide from the world. It is natural that the DPRK has its own military secrets as other countries do, he added. However, can the DPRK president's remarks alleviate the international community's concerns? The IAEA holds that all nuclear sites should accept the IAEA's inspection without exception. Pyongyang's refusal to accept the IAEA's inspection has further aggravated tension on the peninsula, let alone creating suspicion of the nuclear facilities. It has been reported that the UN Security Council will actively discuss the issue of imposing international economic sanctions on the DPRK in early May. Now, how can the present stalemate be settled? Pyongyang believes that this stalemate can be settled through direct dialogue between the DPRK and the United States. (?The international community) is seeking other ways. Washington has set some preconditions for its direct dialogue with the DPRK. Pyongyang is refuting some of these preconditions. It seems that Moscow's proposal will be able to settle the stalemate. Moscow proposes that an international conference be held to discuss the issue on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Seoul and some other countries support Moscow's proposal.
