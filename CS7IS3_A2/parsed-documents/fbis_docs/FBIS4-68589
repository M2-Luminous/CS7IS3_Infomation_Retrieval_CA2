As Oleg Soskovets declared at the congress of the Association of Russian Banks yesterday, changes in the tax system will be promulgated as early as June. For now government plans have the stamp of secrecy. However, there is information that fundamental reform of the existing tax system, which pursues primarily the aim of budget replenishment, can take place during the forthcoming summer. The possibility of such a development of events is confirmed by statements by several high-ranking government representatives. Thus, at a government meeting yesterday Yevgeniy Yasin, director of the administration's analytical center, announced the need to increase taxation on citizens' "superincome," as well as to shift the center of gravity to taxation on the property of natural persons. For example, it was proposed that one-half of all citizens' income over 300 million rubles be withdrawn into the state treasury (the maximum income tax rate now makes up 30 percent of the amount of more than 30 million rubles). At present virtually any tax changes are made only in the interests of the budget. The most important figures in tax policy also admit this. Thus, according to Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko, "any taxes pursue fiscal aims exclusively and all the rest is based on unnecessary complications." The reason for such an approach by the authorities is quite understandable: This is the only acceptable way out under present political conditions. The parliament and the government work out the principles of tax policy. However, their realization is placed on the shoulders of the State Tax Service. The anger of taxpayers, who have lost any hope of understanding anything in the tax policy of the state, spills over at its representatives. The course of their thoughts is quite understandable. It is more difficult to understand the logic of representatives of the highest echelon of Russian leadership, among whom the negative evaluation of the work of the State Tax Service has become almost a ritual. Boris Yeltsin's message to the Federal Assembly, more accurately, the phrase that under the existing tax regime "it is impossible to live; it is only possible to die," gave the reason for the especially sharp criticism of the State Tax Service. Since that day almost every high-ranking government representative has managed to express dissatisfaction with the work of the tax service. It is most interesting that parliament members, who thus far have not examined a single matter concerning the making of changes in the existing tax system at their meetings, also express dissatisfaction. Nevertheless, there is also a more valid accusation--of unjustified rigidity--brought against the tax service by representatives of entrepreneurial circles, in particular, in connection with the excessively rigid interpretation of some legislative acts; for example, of the law on the use of the word Russia and of word combinations formed on their basis in names of enterprises. Although the decision on the introduction of this tax was adopted by the parliament, it was the State Tax Service that gave a broad interpretation of this law, in accordance with which this tax is imposed on all joint ventures. In the opinion of KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts, there are two most probable reasons for such behavior by tax service workers. First of all, the Ministry of Finance, of course, prompts the State Tax Service to more rigidly interpret tax legislation. At the same time, it would be strange to accuse the ministry of a desire to increase the revenue part of the budget. In any country throughout the world the Ministry of Finance primarily guards the interests of the state treasury. The fear of accusations on the part of structures checking the activity of tax service workers, the most known of which is the procuracy, is also reflected in the fact that these workers make rigid decisions. For now it does not express dissatisfaction with the work of the State Tax Service, which was stated by the procuracy representative at the hearings of the State Duma last Tuesday. Nevertheless, law enforcement bodies usually interpret any granting of tax privileges to taxpayers as the manifestation of corruption. Probably, the most rigid interpretation of legislative norms by the State Tax Service is due to fears to be subjected to such accusations. The adoption of a political decision on serious amendments to the existing tax system by the parliament and the government in the very near future can be the most acceptable way out of the existing situation. However, in the opinion of KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts, this should not fundamentally change the existing tax system, because any global reforms will now lead to a legal chaos. At the same time, it is necessary to simplify tax legislation, to eliminate most (and perhaps even all) existing privileges, and to unify the periods of tax payment, while toughening control over the payment itself. Aleksandr Ivaneyev, director of the Department of Tax Reforms, also agrees with such an approach. In brief, it should be simple and joyful, as far as possible, to pay taxes.
