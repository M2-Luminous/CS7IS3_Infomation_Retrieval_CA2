FR940812-2-00204 FR940812-2-00073 The trading of options on the Mexico Index, including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS, however, raises several concerns, namely issues related to index design, customer protection, surveillance, and market impact. The Commission believes, for the reasons discussed below, that the Amex adequately has addressed these concerns. A. Index Design and Structure The Commission finds that the Mexico Index is a narrow-based index. The Mexico Index is composed of only ten securities, all of which represent Mexico companies. 20 Accordingly, in light of the limited number of components in the Index, the Commission believes it is proper to classify the Mexico Index as narrow-based and apply Amex's rules governing narrow-based index options to trading in the Index options. 20 The reduced-value Mexico Index, which is composed of the same component securities as the Index and calculated by dividing the Index value by ten, is identical to the Mexico Index. The Commission also finds that the large capitalizations, Liquid markets, and relative weightings of the Index's component securities significantly minimize the potential for manipulation of the Index. First, the overwhelming majority of the components that comprise the Index are actively traded, with an average daily trading volume for the period from November, 1993 through May, 1994, ranging from a high of 430,000 shares per day to a low of 106,000 shares per day. Second, the market capitalizations of the securities in the Index are very large, ranging, during the same period, from a high of $31 billion to a low of $156.92 billion, with the mean and median being $6.77 billion and $1.94 billion, respectively. Third, although the Index is only comprised of ten component securities, no one particular security or group of securities dominates the Index. Specifically, no one stock or ADR comprises more than 24 percent of the Index's total value and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index account for 60 percent of the Index's value. Fourth, at least 90 percent of the securities in the Index, by weight, and at least 80 percent of the number of components of the Index, must be eligible for standardized options trading. This proposed maintenance requirement will ensure that the Index is substantially comprised of options-eligible securities. Fifth, if the Amex increases the number of component securities to more than thirteen or decreases that number to less than nine, the Amex will be required to seek Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act before listing new strike price or expiration month series of Mexico Index options and Index LEAPS. This will help protect against material changes in the composition and design of the Index that might adversely affect the Amex's obligations to protect investors and to maintain fair and orderly markets in Mexico Index options and Index LEAPS. Sixth, the Amex will be required to ensure that each component of the Index is subject to last sale reporting pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 of the Act. 21 This will further reduce the potential for manipulation of the value of the Index. Finally, the Commission believes that the expense of attempting to manipulate the value of the Mexico Index in any significant way through trading in component stocks, ADRs, or securities underlying ADRs (or options on those securities) coupled with, as discussed below, existing mechanisms to monitor trading activity in those securities, will help deter such illegal activity. 21‚ê£ See Amendment No. 3. Furthermore, the Commission notes that the Amex has agreed to apply the initial listing and maintenance standards set forth in the Generic Narrow Based Index Approval Order to the Index and Index options. These standards are reasonably designed to ensure the protection of investors and the public interest. Specifically, the Commission finds that the generic standards covering minimum capitalization, monthly trading volume, and relative weightings of component stocks are designed to ensure that the trading markets for component stocks are adequately capitalized and sufficiently liquid, and that no one stock or stock group dominates an Index. Thus, the Commission believes that the satisfaction of these requirements significantly minimizes the potential for manipulation of the Index.
