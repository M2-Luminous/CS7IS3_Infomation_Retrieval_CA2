The emperor and empress are the first state guests of the administration of President Bill Clinton since he took office in January 1993. In Atlanta, the emperor and empress will meet former President Jimmy Carter and Coretta Scott King, widow of assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King, government officials said. They will be in Washington for four days from Saturday, and will meet President Bill Clinton, lay a wreath at Arlington Cemetery and visit an elementary school. Clinton will hold a welcoming ceremony for the imperial couple Monday at the White House. The couple will also travel to New York, St. Louis, Longmont and Denver in Colorado, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Honolulu. In New York, they will meet UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus- Ghali, and in Los Angeles, former U.S. President Ronald Reagan. In Honolulu, they will lay a wreath at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific but will not visit Pearl Harbor, on which Japan launched a devastating attack on Dec. 7, 1941. The government dropped plans for the emperor to visit the USS Arizona National Memorial at Pearl Harbor under pressure from conservative Japanese circles, who fear the emperor would be expected to make an apology for the attack that pulled the U.S. into World War II. It is the second visit by a Japanese emperor to the U.S. Emperor Hirohito, posthumously known as Emperor Showa, made the first such visit in 1975. It is also the imperial couple's first U.S. tour since the emperor succeeded his deceased father in January 1989, and their third official visit to the U.S., which they visited twice as crown prince and princess. The couple will return to Tokyo on June 26.
