FR941122-2-00012 FR941122-2-00009 Department of the Navy Record of Decision for Realignment of Carswell Air Force Base to Naval Air Station Fort Worth, Fort Worth, TX Pursuant to section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 and the Council on Environmental Quality regulations for implementing NEPA procedures (40 CFR 1500&hyph;1508), the Department of the Navy announces its decision to implement realignment of Carswell Air Force Base (AFB) to Naval Air Station (NAS) Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base (JRB), Fort Worth, Texas. In accordance with the legislative requirements of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 [Public Law (P.L.) 101&hyph;510), the 1993 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC&hyph;93) recommended the closure of NAS Dallas, Texas, NAS Memphis, Tennessee, and NAS Glenview, Illinois. Assets and operations from each of these bases were directed to be relocated to the former Carswell AFB, which closed September 30, 1993 pursuant to a BRAC&hyph;91 decision. The former Carswell AFB is to be realigned to become the Naval Air Station Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base (JRB). In compliance with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations, the Department of the Navy acted as a Cooperating Agency with the Department of the Air Force and had substantial involvement in drafting and reviewing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the disposal and reuse of Carswell AFB. The EIS presented a full description of the projects and environmental impacts associated with the Navy realignment actions. In addition, the Navy planned actions were presented at the Draft EIS Public Hearing hosted by the Department of the Air Force. The Department of the Navy has conducted an independent review of the EIS and adopts the EIS for purposes of its proposed actions. This Record of Decision announces Navy's decision to implement actions described in the FEIS for the realignment and operation of NAS Fort Worth JRB, Fort Worth, Texas. A Draft EIS was prepared for the proposed reuse and disposal actions and distributed to federal, state, and local agencies and to interested individuals and groups in February 1993. The DEIS was revised to include the Navy as a cooperating agency when the BRAC&hyph;93 decision to realign Carswell AFB was made. The revised DEIS was published and distributed in March 1994. A public hearing was held on April 4, 1994 in the City of Fort Worth, Texas. Responses to all public comments received were incorporated in an FEIS that was distributed in July 1994. The proposed Navy realignment action would incorporate approximately 1,869 acres from the former Carswell AFB for reuse as NAS Fort Worth JRB. The realignment of the base would consist of renovation of approximately 120 buildings and new construction of an additional 25 facilities, in addition to the demolition of some facilities that are not cost effective to reuse or renovate. The realignment also includes upgrades of base utilities to accommodate JRB requirements. Upgrades to the airfield stormwater drainage will also be incorporated into the realignment plans. An estimated total of 24 acres of land will need to be distributed for new construction activities. The proposed operations of the NAS Fort Worth JRB will be primarily air operations by reserve forces. Some smaller non-air units will also be attached to the base. Reserve units from the Navy, Marine corps, Air Force, Texas Air National Guard, and Army National Guard will be operating at the base. The various types of aircraft that will be normally at the base will include F&hyph;14s, F/A&hyph;18s, F&hyph;16s, KC&hyph;130s, C&hyph;130s, C&hyph;9s, C&hyph;12s, U&hyph;21s, CH&hyph;47s, UH&hyph;60s and a UH&hyph;1. An estimated 95,000 annual air operations are associated with the various proposed military aircraft, including transient military aircraft. All of the existing airspace and air traffic control services associated with previous Air Force operations will be retained for use by the JRB. The combination of closure and realignment will reduce military air traffic in the area and significantly reduce potential civilian-military aircraft conflicts. Approximately 2,100 active duty military personnel are expected to be attached to the JRB. An additional 1,400 civilian personnel will be employed at the base. Approximately 8,500 reservists or guardsmen will drill at the JRB on schedules that will attempt to spread the numbers equally over three weekends each month. The realignment and establishment of NAS Fort Worth JRB will occur, as mandated by P.L. 101&hyph;510, regardless of the disposal and reuse of the remaining portions of Carswell AFB. Therefore, these military land areas and reuse activities were incorporated as part of the No-Action alternative and all reuse alternatives for analysis in the EIS. Maximum consideration was given to the use of existing structures to minimize environmental impacts and construction costs for realignment. Sites considered at NAS Fort Worth JRB for the proposed new facilities avoided environmentally sensitive areas and were selected based on functional considerations, adequacy of existing structures for the proposed uses, availability of utilities, proximity to existing facilities, and observing all airfield safety and noise criteria. The proposed action will cause no significant impact to ambient air quality levels. Localized, temporary impacts would occur during construction and demolition activities. Compliance with state and federal regulations, including National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS), will be achieved during any removal of asbestos-containing materials.
