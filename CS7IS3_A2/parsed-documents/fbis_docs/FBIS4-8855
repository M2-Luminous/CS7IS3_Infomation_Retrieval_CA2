The West is afraid of Russia." Silajdzic said the problem lies in the fear of the West of Russia which wants a "greater fascist Serbia." He said NATO can do whatever the United Nations wants, but the United Nations is not doing anything. "It is a vicious circle," Silajdzic said. "A scenario to kill Gorazde and give it to the Serbs." Silajdzic said Bosnia is alone against the world, but expressed belief Turkey is doing its best, adding he is constantly in contact with President Suleyman Demirel and Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. On the latest developments in Gorazde, he said he contacted the town half an hour ago and that the West has shown the green light to kill the city and its inhabitants. "It is proof that the West will not do anything to help and will not lift the arms embargo," he said. He said according to latest information from Gorazde, Serbs are burning everything in the town and there is a massacre going on. Silajdzic also said that the Serbs want to take the defenseless city after forcing UN observers and any other UN officials out of Gorazde.
