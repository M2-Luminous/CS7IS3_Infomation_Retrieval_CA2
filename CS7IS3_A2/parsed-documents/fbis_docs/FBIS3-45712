Before "1" was announced in the countdown, a Benz car slammed into an obstacle with a loud "bang" and, meanwhile, a safety air cushion was instantly ejected out of the steering wheel inside the car while the "driver" remained safe and sound [variant version reads: ...in the countdown, a safety air cushion was instantly ejected out of the steering wheel, sending up a light smoke. This was a scene simulating a car collision in the Benz auto company....]. The Chinese subtitles reading "Welcome Your Visit to the Benz Company Safety Research Division" were shown on the wall in the hall for the collision simulation test. The visit by Qiao Shi, chairman of the PRC National People's Congress Standing Committee, and his entourage to the Benz auto company, one of Germany's most famous enterprises, reached a climax here [variant version reads: ...National People's Congress, to the Benz auto company reached a climax here... deleting "and his entourage" and "one of Germany's most famous enterprises"]. Safety in driving a car has become the crucial point of auto research and development [variant version reads: ...research and development now... adding "now"]. It is learned that the Benz auto company is one of the earliest auto manufacturers to use safety air bags in their products. Qiao Shi and his party arrived at Sindelfingen city near Stuttgart for a visit to the Benz headquarters at 1630 today. Accompanied by President (Lloyd) of the Benz group, Qiao Shi visited the Benz company's new car exhibition hall first. Various new Benz cars were on display in this round hall which occupies several hundred square meters. Qiao Shi listened with keen interest to a company briefing on various new models of Benz cars, and raised questions from time to time. "Does this car have automatic gear shifting? Is it electronically controlled?" "Yes." "How many cylinders does it have?" "There are four, six, and eight cylinders." "What kind of gas does it use?" "Super unleaded." "How much gas does it consume per 100 km?" "Ten to 20 liters per 100 km, depending on the number of cylinders and capacity." Pointing at the star-shaped emblem in the front of a car, (Lloyd) said: "This is an article most liable to theft. We must produce a large number of emblems as spares every year." Qiao Shi and other visitors burst out laughing. Standing in front of a beautiful convertible, Qiao Shi said humorously: "This is very suitable for youngsters. They like to go for a drive." When Qiao Shi and his party came to the place where a heavy truck was on display, their host said that the Benz company had signed an agreement with China to produce this kind of truck in China. Qiao Shi enquired with concern: "What is its loading capacity?" Their host replied: "Eighteen tonnes. Plus the weight of the truck itself, it has a total capacity of 40 tonnes. However, the weight of the truck China is to produce is altered to 36 tonnes." At this point, (Lloyd) pointed at a colleague standing beside him and said jokingly: "He drives this kind of truck like a racing car, speeding at 280 km per hour on the freeway." Another burst of laughter. Then, Qiao Shi visited an assembling shop. At last, he came to the safety research division hall for car collision simulation tests. On display in the hall were cars damaged by collisions at different angles. The responsible person for the safety research division demonstrated a simulated car collision controlled by computer. Qiao Shi was very interested. More than once, he walked close to a damaged part to take a careful look while he was listening to a briefing. The responsible person of the safety research division said: "Indeed, Benz auto technology and safety are the best, but their prices are a little too high." Chairman Qiao Shi said: "So long as you pay further attention to technology, you can gain an upper hand in the competition all the same."
