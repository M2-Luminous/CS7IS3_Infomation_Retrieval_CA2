ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: The Secretary amends the regulations governing grants for long-term training to implement the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 and the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals With Disabilities Act Amendments of 1994. The Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program is authorized by section 302 of Title III of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (the Act). The purpose of this discretionary grant program is to fund projects to provide academic training in areas of personnel shortages identified by the Secretary. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations take effect either 45 days after publication in the Federal Register or later if the Congress takes certain adjournments. If you want to know the effective date of these regulations, call or write the Department of Education contact person. A document announcing the effective date will be published in the Federal Register . FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard Melia, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., Room 3324 Switzer Building, Washington, DC 20202&hyph;2649. Telephone (202) 205&hyph;9400. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: These final regulations implement changes made by the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;569) and the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals With Disabilities Act Amendments of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;218). These amendments direct the Secretary to issue regulations, as appropriate, to carry out the provisions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. This program supports the National Education Goal that, by the year 2000, every adult American be literate and possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. The Department supports a variety of training activities for vocational rehabilitation personnel so that they may assist individuals with disabilities in gaining the knowledge and skills to obtain employment and compete in a global economy. On October 8, 1993, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program in the Federal Register (58 FR 52606). The major issues related to this program are discussed in the preamble to the NPRM. Significant changes resulting from public comment since publication of the NPRM include_(1) A waiver provision for part of the non-Federal share of the cost of a project if an applicant demonstrates that it does not have sufficient resources for the entire match; (2) An exemption for existing projects from the requirement to direct 75 percent of the total award to scholarships; and (3) A broadening of the term ``deaf'' to include individuals who are ``hard of hearing'' and of the term ``blind'' to include individuals who have ``vision impairment.'' In addition, after the NPRM was published, the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals With Disabilities Act Amendments of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;218) was enacted. Those amendments included a technical change to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, in the area of rehabilitation training. That statutory change has been incorporated into these regulations by adding the use, applications, and benefits of assistive technology devices and assistive technology services to the list of areas of personnel shortages identified in §386.1. Analysis of Comments and Changes In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 386 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations. An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows. Major issues are grouped according to subject, with appropriate sections of the regulations referenced in parentheses. Other substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and other minor changes are not addressed.
