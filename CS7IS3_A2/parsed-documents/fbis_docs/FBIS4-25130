The result of this "difficult but correct decision," they said, is a New China policy, which "will better serve both American interests and those of peace and stability in Asia." The two former secretaries of state made the comments in an article entitled "The Right decision", published in the WASHINGTON POST Monday [6 June]. They pointed out that America's broader interests in Asia "require a reasonable relationship" with China, and that peace and economic progress in Asia are in America's interest and require Chinese-American cooperation. Stability in Asia is in America's interest but is only possible if both America and China are engaged in its pursuit. "Withholding MFN would have ruptured one of the world's most important bilateral and potentially productive relationships," they noted. They went on to say that the United States and China share many other interests in the region, which "can best be advanced through a regular, comprehensive and frank dialogue at the highest levels." they described the meeting in Seattle last November between President Clinton and his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin as "a useful first step," and expressed the hope that "with the MFN decision behind us the two leaders will establish a strategic dialogue between our two countries." Praising the administration's New China policy for opening the door to broadening and strengthening U.S.-China relations, they reminded that pursuing better relations with Beijing is not a favor which America bestows on China. "It is in America's interests. America and China need each other in our mutual search for regional stability." Referring to the importance of China's cooperation to the United States on a number of major issues, Kissinger and Vance warned that China's cooperation on these matters cannot be taken for granted. "China will base its decisions on a hard-headed assessment of its own national interests, as will we. Settling the MFN-human rights issue, vital as it is, does not guarantee smooth sailing on other issues." But they stressed in the article that cooperation is more likely to be forthcoming "if Washington and Beijing both work to strengthen the central strategic relationship between our two countries."
