Papers here today say this act of the Kim Yong-sam group has proved that political surveillance over politicians is as vicious and persistent as under the military "regimes", though it claims a "civilian government" has been established in South Korea. An analyst of NODONG SINMUN notes: It is a serious matter that the traitor Kim Yong-sam continues vicious political surveillance over civilians, though he committed himself to build "a society where human rights are respected" and "stop intelligence surveillance" when taking the "presidential" seat. With the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique and such notorious intelligence tools as the "Security Planning Board" and the "secret affairs command" left alone, the South Korean people cannot evade being targets of intelligence surveillance. A MINJU CHOSON commentary stresses that if human rights and democracy are to be guaranteed and the people are to live in peace in South Korea, all the political charlatans like the traitor Kim Yong-sam who stirs up horror and uneasiness and resorts to terrorism and plots must be removed.
