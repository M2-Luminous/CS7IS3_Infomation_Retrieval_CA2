The priests were accused of having "conducted religious rites in several villages in the municipality of Kumanovo without the permission of the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian Ministry of Internal Affairs, and thus instigated national hatred and intolerance." Recalling that this is not the first occasion on which the authorities of the former Yugoslav republic have shown intolerance toward the clergy of the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs stresses that by such behavior Skopje is depriving the Serbian people living in Macedonia of their religious rights. This is in contravention of international norms and documents that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has accepted, the statement, which was forwarded to TANJUG today, goes on to say. "This incites an atmosphere of insecurity and fear among the Serbs in Macedonia, whose status, despite the promises and alleged readiness of the relevant authorities, has not as yet been defined in the Constitution. In addition to the existing discrimination regarding the use of their mother tongue, employment, education, and information, this behaviour by the Macedonian authorities makes Serbs feel like second rate citizens," the statement says. The Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs expects the Macedonian side to take all necessary measures so that there should be no recurrence of such incidents. The ministry expects the Macedonian side to start resolving the issue of the constitutional status of the Serbian people living in Macedonia in the near future, in accordance with highest CSCE and UN standards.
