The province of Bie is under fire, and UNITA admitted moments ago that Bie is already under the control of government troops. There are reports that as many as 30-50 people have been killed in today's clashes. More details from Paulo Juliao: [Juliao] The city of Cuito, capital of Bie Province, has been again under intense shelling since 0745 hours. At the moment, the clashes between the government and UNITA forces are spreading all over Cuito. More than 30 civilians have been killed, and another 49 have been injured. The Luanda forces reported they have taken over most of the positions previously held by UNITA troops and have captured four UNITA soldiers, including an officer. The two armies have been using long-range artillery in the battle over control of Cuito, including 106 mm and 130 mm mortars and P-12 cannons. In the meantime, the two armies continue to exchange accusations about who has violated the cease-fire, which was broken this morning in Cuito. Reports from that city tell us that the government forces had sworn to expel Savimbi's men from the city, thus paying homage to their deceased commander Kosuma. [passage omitted]
