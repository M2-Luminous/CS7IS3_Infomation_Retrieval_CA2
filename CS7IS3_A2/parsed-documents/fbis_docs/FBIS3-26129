A survey shows that sales of such ornaments in the city last year were 20 tons, an increase of five tons over the previous year and double the 1991 figure. Shanghai people's average possession of gold ornaments rose from 0.77 grams per capita in 1991 to 1.54 grams last year. Trading in gold ornaments resumed in China in 1982. The newspaper attributed the fast growth to the rise of Shanghai residents' income, the custom of purchasing gold ornaments, and the change of habits from keeping gold for its value to acquiring it both for its value and its decoration. With approval of the People's Bank, Shanghai set up 300 gold retail shops toward the end of last year and some 150 shops are waiting for official approval. There were only 40 such shops in the city a decade ago.
