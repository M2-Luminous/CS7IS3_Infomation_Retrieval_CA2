The article says: The work is a classic one that scientifically analyzed the historical lesson in building socialism and fully proved the validity and invincible vitality of our party's general line of socialist and communist construction. It is also a highly important work that makes it possible to restart the socialist movement and further strengthen and develop it as demanded by the era of independence. In the work the dear leader exposed the essence of the reactionary sophism of the imperialists and the renagades of socialism describing the frustration of socialism in some countries as a change in the historical trend. He, on the basis of a scientific analysis of the reasons for the collapse of socialism in some countries, gave a comprehensive exposition of the questions arising in steadfastly defending and accomplishing the cause of socialism. It reflects the unshakable stand and will of our party and people to firmly defend the cause of socialism under any circumstances. The significance and vitality of the work find expression, first of all, in that it made clear in a scientific way the reasons for the frustration of socialism in some countries, so as to reconstruct the socialist movement on a new basis and advance it more vigorously. The work profoundly indicated the basic reasons for the frustration of socialism in some countries: One of them is that they did not put the main emphasis on strengthening the motive force for building socialism and on enhancing its role because they failed to understand the essence of socialism centering on the popular masses, the makers of history. Another reason is that they failed to recognize the qualitative differences between socialism and capitalism and did not adhere consistently to the fundamental principles of socialism. And it is also the reason that they had not strengthened international solidarity based on independence in relations between parties of socialist countries. With those reasons clarified in the work, a precious guideline for reconstructing the socialist movement on a new basis and invigorating it has been provided. And it has been possible for the world revolutionary parties and peoples struggling for socialism to fight more vigorously for the victory of the socialist cause with renewed confidence and optimism, well aware of the lesson of the history. The significance and vitality of the work is also manifested in that it fully proved the validity and invincible vitality of our party's general line of socialist and communist construction, thus encouraging our party and people to further promote the cause of Korean-style socialism under the banner of the chuche idea. In our country the cause of socialism is now being steadfastly defended and advanced ever victoriously in spite of all the forms of challenge and maneuvers by the imperialists and reactionaries. This is attributable to the fact that the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il put forward the most correct line of socialist and communist construction and have wisely guided its thorough implementation. The great leader was the first in history to put forward the general line of building socialism and communism by carrying out the three revolutions, ideological, technical and cultural, while strengthening the people's power and enhancing its function and role. In the work the dear leader scientifically and theoretically vindicated our party's general line of socialist and communist construction and comprehensively reviewed the great victories and achievements won by our party and people in socialist construction by constantly tackling and successfully implementing it. Our people have the unswerving faith through their life that our party's line of socialist and communist construction is most just and they can accomplish the cause of socialism only in accordance with it. Indeed, the publication of this immortal work which is of weighty theoretical and practical significance in the completion of the socialist cause in the era of independence is another great exploit of the dear leader in the accomplishment of the human cause of independence, the cause of socialism.
