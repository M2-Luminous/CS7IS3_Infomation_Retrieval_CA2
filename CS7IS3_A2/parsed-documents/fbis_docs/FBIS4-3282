Zou made the call at a luncheon given jointly by Canadian Asia-Pacific Foundation and Canada-China Business Council here in his honor. The vice premier, who arrived here on Monday for a 10-day official visit, said Sino-Canadian economic and technological cooperation is presented with a new opportunity. He said the two countries should open new areas for cooperation apart from the traditional ones. Canada is strong in transportation, telecommunications, energy, electricity, mining, agriculture and forestry, and these are exactly the priority areas for development in China, he told about 250 Canadian businessmen and government officials. Zou said the Chinese government always attaches great importance to its relations with Canada and believes that stronger Sino-Canadian ties will work in the fundamental interests of both peoples and contribute to peace, stability and economic prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large. He said China's door is sure to open even wider and an all-directional pattern of openness linking the coast with the hinterland across China is taking shape. The Western countries have advanced technologies and management know-how, abundant capital and experienced managers, Zou said, adding that China on the other hand has rich natural resources, a labor force of low cost, a considerable economic foundation thanks to several decades of reconstruction and above all, a huge market. He said that more economic and technological interflows aimed at a long-term cooperation, therefore, could contribute to mutual complementarity of comparative advantage of the two sides for common prosperity. On the form of cooperation, Zou said, it can take many forms. "trade with us is certainly welcome. But we also hope to see more business people with acumen come to China to invest and set up their own factories, to enter into partnership with Chinese enterprises, or to transfer technology, and explore China's market," he added. The vice premier pledged that China's investment environment will keep improving and the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors will be better protected under Chinese law. Zou said in 1993 alone, foreign investment actually used in China reached 36.77 billion U.S. dollars, up by 91.5 percent over the previous year, in which direct foreign investment reached 25.76 billion U.S. dollars, up by 130 percent. The investment environment in China, Zou said, is improving. There is more order in the financial and circulation fields and signs of an economic overheating have been brought under control after the government introduced last June a series of measures aimed at tightening and improving macro-economic regulation. "This year, in face of greater inflation pressure and the quick rise of the aggregate price level, we are stepping up measures to control the excessive increase in investment in fixed assets and consumption funds and to reinforce supervision and examination of prices," the Chinese vice premier said.
