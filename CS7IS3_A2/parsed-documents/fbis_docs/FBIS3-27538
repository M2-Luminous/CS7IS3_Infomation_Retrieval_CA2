In a 110-page address delivered to the parliament, Yeltsin said the struggle revolves around how to further social and economic reforms. He complained that although the country had abandoned the Soviet-era command style of management it has not learned to abide by the law. "It has to be admitted bluntly that the democratic principles of the power structure are being discredited more and more," Yeltsin stated. He urged the legislature to adopt laws enforcing "strict rules" on powerful state bodies, on the government itself, on federal state services, on the basic organization of regional bodies and on the status of lawmakers. Meanwhile, he stressed the need to carry out a legal reform in Russia, pinpointing the need to introduce efficient justice based on strict legal and democratic principles. Yeltsin also called on the people and various political forces to cooperate with the new Russian Constitution. "It is the duty of all those who are linked with the fate of Russia to use this chance for renewal and stability offered by the new Constitution," he added.
