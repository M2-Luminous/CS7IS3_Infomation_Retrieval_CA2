The agreement eased international tensions which had been tightened another notch a day earlier by the most unequivocal in a series of claims that Pyongyang has an active nuclear weapons programme. But the accord makes no provision for inspection of the two Yongbyon sites where the suspected nuclear arms facility is based. IAEA spokesman David Kyd said the two sides had reached an accord on inspecting seven identified sites and that a six- or seven-strong IAEA mission of two to three weeks' duration would enter North Korea as soon as visa formalities had been dealt with. Welcoming the accord, Kyd said that, if all went well, the mission could get under way in the next few days, adding that Pyongyang had accepted all IAEA demands concerning the nature of the inspections. He stressed the agreement did not cover the two undeclared sites at Yongbyon, where the IAEA suspected that Pyongyang was illegally stockpiling liquid and solid nuclear waste. He said those sites would be the subject of future negotiations. The accord comes six days before a meeting of IAEA governors at which future relations with North Korea are due to be discussed. Kyd added that the aim of the inspections at the seven declared sites was to "verify that nuclear material in these facilities has not been diverted since earlier inspections." "In addition, inspectors will take certain measures, such as reloading of cameras and changing of seals, to facilitate future verifications." [passage omitted] Earlier Tuesday in Tokyo, Japan's JIJI Press quoted official South Korean sources as saying Pyongyang's absolute leader Kim Il-Sung had proposed a meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton over the nuclear issue. Kim made the proposal through U.S. Southern Baptist evangelist Billy Graham, who met the North Korean president and party chief when he visited Pyongyang in late January, the sources said. Russian researchers told JIJI Monday that the former Soviet Union had been engaged in a joint plan with North Korea to build a nuclear bomb until 1985, and that Russian scientists continued to provide clandestine assistance to Pyongyang.
