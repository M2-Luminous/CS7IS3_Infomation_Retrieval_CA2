The three Americans and two Indonesians had "conducted illegal religious activities," in violation of new regulations governing religion which took effect January 31 and restrict the religious activities of foreigners in China, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said. Wu did not specify the nature of the activities, nor did he refer to two Hong Kong Chinese who were also detained February 11 in central Henan province after attending an outdoor Christian prayer meeting. All seven missionaries -- led by Reverend Dennis Balcombe, a Mandarin-speaking evangelist and pastor of the Revival Christian Church in Hong Kong -- returned to the colony on Tuesday. The fate of three local Chinese detained at the same time remains unknown. Wu said the local security officials had carried out "investigation, interrogation and detention" of the foreign missionaries in accordance with Chinese law, and had issued stern warnings. Balcombe, a frequent traveller to China, also had his visa revoked, Wu added. In a statement Wednesday, Balcombe said cash and property worth thousands of dollars had been taken by police from the group during their ordeal, during which the Hong Kong Chinese were also beaten and pulled by their hair. "These people have acknowledged that they had violated Chinese laws and made guarantees that they would not conduct such activities anymore," Wu said. They were believed to be the first Christians detained under the new regulations which prohibit foreigners from cultivating religious disciples in China and setting up religious offices or schools. While foreigners may bring in religious material for their own use, any materials which have contents harmful to China's social public interest are banned. The regulations "embody the principle that China's religious bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign domination," Wu said, adding that foreigners would not be allowed to "harm the social public interest or interfere in China's religious affairs." Although freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Chinese constitution, the communist government has waged a constant campaign to prevent the spread of all faiths and limit contact between domestic and foreign religious organisations. "As long as foreigners abide by the Chinese laws, they will have no trouble at all," Wu said. Well aware of the important role played by the church in the downfall of eastern European communism, religious repression -- including torture and detention of believers -- has intensified since early 1992, international human rights organisations say.
