This will be achieved through Sweden and Norway gradually decreasing their UN forces in Macedonia. To compensate Finland is prepared to contribute more personnel to Macedonia. Denmark is represented in Bosnia relatively "heavily" with the majority of its UN force in the Tuzla region and is not likely to redeploy its men to any great extent. This in broad outline was the outcome of the Nordic defense ministers' coordination meeting in Oslo on Sunday [17 April]. "We are agreed that it is important that we are flexible in the way in which we make UN forces available. The most effective help is achieved when we can deploy forces where they are most needed," Norwegian Defense Minister Jorgen Kosmo said after the meeting. Finland is prepared to take the Nordic responsibility for UN personnel in Macedonia, Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn confirmed. "But the Finnish Government has not as yet discussed the size of the force with which we will increased our UN personnel in Macedonia," Rehn said. The Americans have said that they are willing to increase their presence in Macedonia as the Nordic UN force's operations are shifted more and more to Bosnia. Finland has a force of 230 men in Macedonia. It also has a force of observers in Bosnia and a unit in Croatia. The Norwegian Government intends to propose to the Storting that the country should put a new 370-man force at the UN's disposal in Bosnia, Defense Minister Kosmo said. If the Storting approves the proposal, the new force will be ready to leave for Bosnia in about three months' time. Once Norway has reduced its operations in Macedonia the Norwegians will have a UN force of around 850 men in the former Yugoslavia, a little more than today. Both Denmark and Sweden each have around 1,300 men in the former Yugoslavia. The Danes are heavily represented in Bosnia with almost 1,000 men. Neither Denmark nor Sweden has plans to increase its efforts in the former Yugoslavia. Swedish Defense Minister Anders Bjorck said that his country currently has 140 UN soldiers in Macedonia. A little over 100 of them have said that they are willing to move to Bosnia. They will travel home to Sweden next week for training. Thereafter it is planned that they will be on the ground in Tuzla in mid-May. The Nordic defense ministers also took the opportunity to discuss the general situation in Bosnia after the events of recent days.
