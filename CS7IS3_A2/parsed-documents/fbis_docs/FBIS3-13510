Perhaps the Tall al-Za'tar massacre was, but what happened was a combination of all these massacres at once. It was the bloody Friday massacre that extended from Hebron to Gaza, Nabulus to Ramallah, and from the ocean to the gulf, enveloping the entire Arab homeland; a massacre that was the natural twin -- since it came from the same womb -- of the Hamah massacre in Syria in 1982 and the al-'Amiriyah shelter massacre in Baghdad in 1991. It was the massacre that drowned the faces, souls, bodies, policies, and the persons of the gathering of servility, humiliation, abandonment, concession, and normalization with the Zionist Jews -- the Hafr al-Batin gathering. The Palestinian blood that filled the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron was a bath from which none of those Zionist Arabs who shook hands with Zionist Jews will emerge. It was a bloody massacre, drowning in eternal shame Hafiz al-Asad, Husni Mubaak, Fahd, Jabir, and all the others. They are responsible for the death of Iraqi children in their sickbeds in hospitals due to shortages of medicine and food. This is thanks to the blockade imposed by the savage civilization that has allowed the death of Muslims in Sarajevo and danced to the tune of Arab deaths from Somalia to Baghdad, via the West Bank and Gaza, to the remotest areas of the Earth, wherever people speak Arabic or recite the holy book in Arabic, because the Koran is Arab and Prophet Muhammad, may the peace and blessings of God be upon him, was an Arab. This Palestinian blood is the curse of the righteous martyrs who fell in defense of the Allahu Akbar flag [Iraqi flag] and for the sake of justice, freedom, and human dignity. It is the curse of the martyrs on everyone who has betrayed their blood and generous sacrifices and disavowed the sacred slogans for which they died peacefully, knowing their blood will not be wasted. This Palestinian blood is the responsibility of those who rushed to Madrid. It is the responsiblity of those for whom Washington has become Mecca. It is the responsibility of those who sold Arab national honor in the slave market between the walls of the Security Council and the Knesset. Tell me, O nation of Muhammad; tell me, O free Arabs, what would have happened if Palestinians had attacked a Jewish synagogue and slain seventy and wounded 500 others in cold blood? Nay, what would have happened had a faithful Arab government slain 10 debased traitors in broad daylight? Would it not have aroused the [Security] Council, human rights, and the new world order? In fact, armies would have moved, missiles would have been launched, and aircraft would have taken off to burn and destroy! What peace, what normalization, and what agreements can there be with criminal racist murderers? Let God be our witness, whoever calls for or strives toward that will be directly responsible for every drop of Palestinian blood that has been, or is being, shed on the soil of the entire Arab homeland from the ocean to the gulf. O pure blood, you are boiling in the veins. You are the moment of truth that burns the spiders web. O Palestinian blood, can we forget you? If we did, we would not be Arabs. Woe to us from our grandsons and conscience. Woe to us from our Arab blood which is calling us day and night: Revenge, revenge. Where is the Arab who forgets blood revenge?
