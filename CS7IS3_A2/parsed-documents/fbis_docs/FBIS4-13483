Writer Urges Scholars To Unite To Face Islam's Enemies MUFTI CALLS ON RICH MUSLIMS TO INVEST IN THEIR COUNTRIES A 140-word report on page 1 of 'AQIDATI carries an exclusive statement from the mufti of Egypt, Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, calling on rich Muslims to invest their funds in their homelands and not abroad. He says that investing money abroad is a sign of weak belief and that the faithful should invest their funds in their own countries and thus help reduce unemployment and increase production. The mufti's comments are in response to reports that the investments of Arabs and Muslims abroad total $670 billion, of which Egyptians invested $60 billion. STATEMENT DEFENDS AL-AZHAR IMAM AS AUTHORITY ON RELIGION On page 1, 'AQIDATI carries a 70-word report on a statement issued by the Islamic Research Council replying to the criticisms leveled against al-Azhar and stressing that the al-Azhar imam is the grand imam and ultimate authority on religious affairs. On page 2, the newspaper carries the 1,400 words text of the statement. SENTENCES PASSED FOR CRITICISM OF MUFTI An 80-word report on page 2 says that the Cairo Criminal Court has sentenced in absentia Dr. Sha'ban Isma'il, head of the Shari'ah Department at the Islamic Studies College of al-Azhar University; Dr. 'Ali al-Salus, a teacher at Qatar University; and AL-NUR editor 'Ali Faruq, for criticizing the mufti's edicts on bank transactions and the importing of alcoholic drinks. They were each given six-month suspended jail sentences and fined 200 pounds. SEMINAR ON ISLAM'S VIEW OF WORK AND PRODUCTIVITY A 2,000-word report on page 4 details the proceedings of a seminar held at al-Kharijah town in al-Wadid al-Jadid as part of the 'AQIDATI religious convoys that tour the country to explain the true tenets of Islam. Most of the seminar dealt with Islam's view of work and productivity, and ample Koranic quotes are given indicating that Islam advocates work. Saying that the issue of work and productivity is topical, Dr. Sabri 'Abd-al-Ra'uf, dean of the Shari'ah Department at the al-Azhar Medical College, says that "Islam does not rely on slogans or prayers but on useful work to achieve the fruit of production." He then notes that "work and productivity should be based on studies, awareness, and full expertise. This is why it is our duty to refer to those who possess the message. God Almighty says "If ye realize this not, ask of those who possess the message." Islam rejects pursuing our lives without plan or purpose. We see ideas that are alien to our youths tending to turn them into idle hands and tempt some of them to devote themselves to prayers alone and to abandon work and productivity. Every youngster then turns into a mufti and speaks in the name of religion, but religion is not responsible for these youths, who do not understand the meaning of religion, the cause of religion. Religion does not accept these ideas." Questions on proper ways to pray, care for orphans, a wife's duty to a drunken husband, and the way of dealing with people in workplaces are then answered by the experts panel. WRITER RAPS WEST FOR HONORING RUSHDIE A 400-word comment by Basyuni al-Halawani in the "With All Frankness" column on page 6 comments on the Austrian Government's decision to honor Salman Rushdie, British author of "The Satanic Verses." After saying that Europe continues its blatant hostility to Islam and recalling how Rushdie was received by President Clinton in the White House, the writer adds that "The U.S. President would have had a different stand had Rushdie criticized Christianity or Judaism." He then says that the issue now is not Rushdie but the thousands of charlatans and mercenaries who regard this renegade as their ideal and are daily attacking Islam. Predicting that attacks on Islam and its sources, the Koran and the prophet's sayings, will increase following the honoring of this renegade, he asks whether "the Islamic countries will be content with merely reiterating the expressions of condemnation and denunciation? Or will they take more positive steps to protect their religious sanctities and its shari'ah from these mercenaries?" AL-AZHAR SHAYKH EXPLAINS RIGHTS AND DUTIES A 900-word article by Grand Imam of al-Azhar Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq on 'AQIDATI's page 7 deals with the interpretation of man's rights and duties under secular and religious laws. He starts by viewing the secular laws' interpretation of human rights and public freedoms, arguing that this interpretation means that human rights are more or less personal rights that are designed to protect the human being. He then presents Islam's view which indicates that man has both rights and duties. He adds that religion "indicates that the relationship between the ruler and the ruled makes it the duty of the ruler to be fair and to manage the affairs of the ruled in a legitimate way. It also makes it the duty of the ruled to obey the ruler as long as he obeys God and his prophet. The congregation has the right to have its interests cared for. The principle that religion is not compulsory gives every individual the right to his own creed. It is the duty of the state and society not to interfere with this freedom unless it is abused or threatens the Islamic society's safety, security, and strong structure." WRITER ON SUPPORT FOR DETAINEES' FAMILIES A 400-word comment by Majdi Salim on page 10 comments on the testimony of repentant terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi that he saw a lawyer handing a 250,000-pound check to a terrorist leader to spend on the families of terrorist detainees and prisoners. He argues that this should not be criticized, as the families have to be taken care of, otherwise the new generation will be angry with society. After citing a similar example from the 1960's, he concludes that "the state has rejected the notion of collective punishment. We should adhere to this, so that we can encircle terrorism and eliminate this phenomenon, which is alien to our society." HEAD OF KOSOVO'S ISLAMIC SHAYKHDOM INTERVIEWED A 1,200-word report on an interview with Rajab Boya, head of the Islamic shaykhdom of Kosovo, appears on 'AQIDATI's page 20. After reviewing the number of Muslims and the areas they live in, he details the Serbs' persecution of Kosovo's Muslims and the measures taken against them. He then gives his view that the turn of Kosovo's Muslims will come once the Serbs have finished with Bosnia and that he expects this massacre to be worse than the Bosnian one. WRITER URGES SCHOLARS TO UNITE TO FACE ISLAM'S ENEMIES A 500-word column by Al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf on page 24 comments on the sentence passed by a Cairo court on two university teachers and AL-NUR's editor. The writer says he feels regret and sorrow at this ruling, which is not the first nor will it be the last as long as there are societies, media, different views, and even mistakes. He adds that his sorrow does not stem from the ruling itself but from the fact that differences between scholars have reached the courts. He says that scholars' differences should be confined to their circles and within objective limits, otherwise they would threaten educational and propagation work. Another point he notes that is that differences between scholars and labelling them either "the regime's scholars" or "scholars outside authority" have somewhat blocked these scholars from the arena and left it vacant for those who advocate extremist ideas. He then adds that letting "the scholars' differences reach the level of conflict and quarrels have opened the door wide for the enemies of Islam to promote polarization and attempt to sow sedition and deepen the dispute between these scholars." He calls on the scholars to put aside their differences and face the dangers posed to Islam from outside the land of Islam, as well as from inside.
