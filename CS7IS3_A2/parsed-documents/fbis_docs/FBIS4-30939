Kresimir Zubak, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, and Mile Akmadzic, foreign minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, arrived in Geneva a few minutes ago. They were invited by Yasushi Akashi. There is no indication whether Federation Vice President Ejup Ganic, who represents the Bosnian Muslims at the cease-fire negotiations, will come. Bearing in mind that all three sides have been invited to Geneva, it is not likely that Kresimir Zubak will be negotiating on behalf of the Federation, that is, of the two sides. Let us note that these talks today are not the negotiations on a general political solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina that are expected to resume in Geneva this coming weekend. This is the United Nation's attempt to mediate in a cease-fire between the Serbs and the Muslims, to make Mladic and Delic sign an agreement to disengage their forces. [passage omitted]
