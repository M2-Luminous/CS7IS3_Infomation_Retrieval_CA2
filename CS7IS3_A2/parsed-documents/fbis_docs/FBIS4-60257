The Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Mr. Nateq-Nuri, and the deputies from the cities of Tehran, Torbat-e Jam, Shahr-e Kord, and Damavand and Firuzkuh gave speeches. Then the Majles took up its agenda, and we direct the attention of our esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings. 'Abbas'ali 'Amid-Zanjani, Deputy From Tehran Eighty percent of the nation's problems have to do with the weak and naive performance of duties. The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was 'Amid-Zanjani, deputy from Tehran. During his speech he discussed the martyrdom anniversary of Master Motahari, and he discussed a statement from His Holiness the Imam (peace be upon him) concerning the mission of making the universities Islamic. He said: We hope that in this opportunity for the nation's higher education, all those working in science, research, and education will seek to achieve this sacred goal more quickly. He then said: Those who are desperately working behind the scenes of these activities to create fear and ultimately to revive harshness in the country must realize that harshness in this Islamic nation, in these circumstances with the establishment of the government and the deepening of the revolution, benefits no one, and the ones most subject to it will be those who have started it. The deputy from Tehran discussed the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran Supervision Council. He said: The Majles selected deputies for membership in this council, and Mr. Hoseyni and I were appointed to serve in this capacity. We know that the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran Supervision Council replaced the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran Supervisory Council in the revision of the Constitution, and that this council's responsibilities have been precisely specified in the law approved by the Interests Discernment Council. After a short delay, the Constitutional Revision Council was formed for various reasons, and has so far taken great strides to organize itself to perform the council's lawful duties. He added: These include compiling the relevant guidelines and creating appropriate organizations for carrying out the responsibilities of constitutional revision and supervising the Voice and Vision Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran. In this regard, programs have been selected as models and have been evaluated by expert and experienced people. These programs include programs for the New Year's celebration and for children. In this regard I must say that the previous management took steps to achieve the goals set by the organization. There were malfunctions, and the new management appointed by order of the exalted leader took very great and constructive steps. Continuing his remarks, 'Amid-Zanjani discussed the arrival of the time for the Mecca pilgrimage rites. He said: We hope this year the obligations and rites of the pilgrimage will be performed to achieve the goals of Abraham's pilgrimage, that the Government of Saudi Arabia, which claims to be guarding the shrines and to be serving the pilgrims, will act on this claim sincerely, that it will not obstruct the performance of rites, which are a part of the essence of Abraham's pilgrimage (purging polytheists), and that this year's pilgrims, like those in previous years, will be able to perform their pilgrimage obligations as commanded by Koran and Islamic law. He discussed the issue of the work ethic. He said: The revival of this great Islamic tradition, the call for which we are hearing from society's leader, is really a call that was issued with deep forcefulness in the first days by the Prophet of Islam. In any case, this is a cultural slogan which, if implemented, can solve many of our problems, even the economic and social ones. Perhaps 80 percent of the nation's problems have to do with this very problem of weak and naive performance of duties. The speaker then addressed the deputies. He said: In Article 72 of the Constitution we see that the Majles and the deputies are prohibited from enacting bills and motions that are in conflict with the criteria of the pure religious laws of Islam. The meaning of the above article is that the Majles cannot enact anything it sees as being in conflict with religious law. Some people think this is the duty of the Guardian Council and that it is only the Guardian Council that must concern itself with whether something is contrary to religious law or not. This is a great mistake. The Constitution has prohibited the Majles and the deputies from approving any laws or bills that are in any way in conflict with the criteria of Islam. Therefore, each deputy must take the steps necessary to determine which motion or bill is in violation of Islamic criteria and which is not. It is no excuse for any deputy not to know what is in violation of the criteria of Islam. Mohammad Hoseyni, Deputy From Torbat-e Jam Through obedience to the commands from the exalted leader concerning the work ethic and social order, a civilization worthy of the Islamic Republic of Iran must be established. The next speaker was Mohammad Hoseyni, deputy from Torbat-e Jam. During his speech he said: One of the problems and afflictions besetting many developing nations is the lack of suitable and enduring economic policies to put economic issues in order. These nations use short-term and unstable policies to deal with their economic problems. In the same regard he said: Improved economic polices could increase the average return on economic projects by 50 to 100 percent. Therefore, putting the economic issues in order needs stabilization of government policies, and it is hoped that this will be achieved in the Second Five-Year Plan. The speaker then discussed the fact that exports are one of the most vital economic sectors in any nation. He said: To stabilize their economies, governments try to increase their national exports and to free themselves from having a single product. It is clear that the respected government is trying to liberate the economy from single-product exports. He added: It is hoped that the government will give special attention to this important sector, that it will create industrial planning centers for exports, activate the export guarantee fund, activate the Nonoil Export Development Committee, create an exports information bank, create a permanent exhibition of export goods, establish regulations and criteria for the marketing of goods at export exhibitions, establish an export development institute, strengthen private export companies, establish a market development fund, and finally that it will revise the export organizations, in order to be able to achieve greater growth in the Second Five-Year Plan, meaning more than $23 billion. Continuing, he said: The Third World nations, especially the Islamic nations and the Islamic Republic of Iran, must give special attention to the production, conversion, preservation, and sound distribution of foodstuffs. In this regard, in studying the Second Five-Year Plan the Majles must give the necessary attention to the production of food and to the related food industries. The deputy from Torbat-e Jam discussed the efforts of the enemies of Islam to exaggerate problems and weakness by depicting public lack of confidence in the government. He said: This matter magnifies the duty of the officials and especially the deputies to explain the issues to the people. He noted: Although failed efforts in the last few months by those who have submitted to imperialism, such as the dastardly attacks against the president of the republic and the temporary Friday imam of Mashhad, are proof that the enemy has been unsuccessful in this effort and has turned again to physical assassination. It is necessary, however, by explaining the government's luminous achievements in the First Five-Year Plan, to disappoint the enemy more than ever. Hoseyni then discussed World Worker Day and offered congratulations to workers on this day. He expressed the hope that through obedience to the commands of the exalted leader, who has emphasized the two basic elements of the work ethic and social order, it will be possible to establish a civilization worthy of Islam and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the current century. Continuing, the speaker said: Information from the Iran Statistics Center shows that the national literacy rate in the country for those six years of age and older in the year 1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987] was 61.8 percent, and in the year 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] this figure reached 74.1 percent. At the same time, the result of a research project shows that 95 percent of the population in the compulsory education ages between six and 10 years were studying in the schools in the year 1370. It is necessary to offer congratulations on Teacher Week and Teacher Day to all those working in education and training, especially the esteemed teachers, for the unstinting efforts of teachers, managers, the administrative-educational cadre and others, and foremost among them it is necessary to praise and thank the committed and learned minister, the resourceful manager of the nation's education and training. The deputy from Torbat-e Jam offered condolences on the martyrdom anniversary of Martyr Motahari and he issued memos to officials on the problems in his electoral district, as follows: to the minister of commerce on expediting the wheat storage and silo project, to the minister of roads and transportation to expedite widening the road from Fariman to Torbat-e Jam and Taybad, to the minister of the interior to expedite appointment of the governor of Taybad. At the end of his speech the speaker also praised and thanked the minister of culture and higher education for ordering the creation of the government university, the minister of petroleum for expediting the gas delivery project, and the Khorasan general manager of industry and agriculture for giving special attention to Torbat-e Jam. 'Ali Mobini Dehkerdi, Deputy From Shahr-e Kord The Islamic government has presented a new way to manage a society and it has rejected and rejects imperialism and domination. The next speaker was Mobini Dehkadeh'i [as published], deputy from Shahr-e Kord. During his speech he offered congratulations on Labor and Worker Week and Teacher Week. He added: In these sensitive times we commemorate the greatness of the position, rank and status of the martyr of the pen and Islamic thought, the great thinker and trainer of youth in the seminary and the university, Martyr Motahari, because this theologian and Islamic philosopher is the best model for officials, teachers, educators, ministry of education employees and professors. He asked insiders to encourage society to study the works of Martyr Motahari. He said: The generosity of a human being and his wisdom, greatness and pride is found in the light of the life-giving orthodoxy of Islam. The Islamic government has presented a new road and path for the management of society and it rejects any kind of imperialism, exploitation, expansionism, domination or acceptance of domination. The martyr-nurturing, loyal, and sacrificing nation of Iran is proud to be the leading government of the world's oppressed, believers, pious, free, free-thinking and God-seeking people. The speaker also said: Iran has begun an extensive and aware effort to cut its economic, cultural, social, and scientific dependence on oppressive nations, and to teach the world's thinkers and intellectuals that it is effective to live independently with self-reliance, belief in self and rejecting the selling of self through careful implementation of the commands of the Koran and the traditions of the esteemed Prophet of Islam. He then added: The world devourers, with the support of world imperialism, have trampled the primary human rights of societies and nations. With arrogance, vanity, hate, genocide, shamelessness, and heedlessness in the heart of Europe, they are secretly and openly trying to deprive the rich civilization of Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina of the support of Islamic government. The Serbian genocide against Muslims, burning, and the aggression in Gorazde must be analyzed in this same connection. The speaker discussed the defeat of imperialist policymakers in their efforts to resist and control Islam. He discussed the enactment of the Second Five-Year Plan in the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] and then evaluated the First Five-Year Plan. He said: One of the important ways to anchor inflation and high prices and to support the oppressed classes in society is serious struggle against economic, government, and private monopolies, preventing collusion in the marketing of the goods needed by society, supervising the domestic market and setting prices justly. It is clear that the people must not pay the price of the inability of managers and their waste and extravagance in the form of existing monopolies. He also added: The importance of transferring economic and executive activities to loans and privatization is possible through the creation of an organization independent of government organizations under the supervision of the Policy Council with representatives from the nation's three government powers, the judicial, the executive and the legislative. [sentence as published] Preventing social polarization, providing for public participation in production matters, aligning economic adjustment with the banking facilities given, transferring government resources and equipment to the people, and increasing the utilization coefficient requires more activity than has so far been carried out, so that the government can carry out its basic responsibilities with more peace of mind. Continuing, the speaker said: Having administration that is strong and not subject to doubt in the reform of the nation's administrative and executive structure is one of the country's clear requirements today. Serious struggle against giant government, meeting the minimum needs of government employees, reducing the volume of the government and organizing the nation's revenues and expenditures are possible through serious and sincere cooperation between the government and the Majles. The deputy from Shahr-e Kord then discussed the important role of the Voice and Vision organization and the media in promoting the culture of working, trying, and economizing. He said: A great religious and national duty is to establish Islamic values in society and to eliminate Western values expressed through the use of clothing, garments, industrial products and consumer goods. Mobini Dehkerdi then cited strengthening and promoting the spirit of lawfulness among the nation's officials and the people and focusing on the Five-Year Plan instead of individual, organizational, and sector concerns in society as areas worthy of consideration in the nation's situation today. He said: An undeniable principle for achieving a nonoil economy is the adoption of clear and firm polices to reduce dependence in the government's annual budget on oil revenues during the Second Five-Year Plan, in such a way that it will be achieved by the end of the plan, with the development of nonoil exports and improved tax revenues based on the criterion of the incomes of society's classes. Seyyed Ahmad Rasuli-Nezhad, Deputy From Damavand and Firuzkuh The Ministry of Roads and Transportation has raised the rates for train, aircraft, minibus and urban bus fares on its own initiative. The final preagenda speaker was Rasuli-Nezhad, deputy from Firuzkuh. In his speech he severely condemned the killing and slaughter of the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He said: The Security Council's lackeys react to everything that is against the interest of its permanent members. How do you justify the way it has dealt with the killing of Muslims at al-Khalil by the Zionists and the slaughter in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the hands of the bloodthirsty Serbs? He said: It seems that this council issues a resolution every time the interests and security of the bullies, superpowers, world imperialists and their agents are threatened, and issues an order to put down the threat. What answer is the unworthy UN secretary-general giving to nations for all these crimes and and oppression? He then discussed the problems in his electoral district. He said: Since the time the current minister took over, not only has the Ministry of Roads and Transportation failed to act on the decisions that have been made and to remove the burden from the shoulders of the people, it has created many problems and severe dissatisfaction for the people. This includes raising the tolls on freeways and highways without providing additional services and acceptable quality. Heavy vehicles, which cause much loss of life and property, are allowed to use the freeways solely to obtain more revenue. He added: Other examples are the heavy and sudden price increases for tickets for passenger trains, aircraft, and recently for minibuses and urban buses. In the last example, how is it that the respected minister of roads and transportation and its general managers throughout the country undertook on their own initiative to increase fares, without the slightest consultation with province executive officials, especially the governors-general, the governors, and the district governors? This was done on the pretext that the gentlemen doing the driving wanted this fare increase for the New Year's holidays so they could provide appropriate and worthy service to the respected travelers. To prevent protests from officials and the people, they announced a specific date for implementing this program in a set of guidelines, so that this aspect of the situation might be tolerable. It was completely surprising and regrettable, however, that after the end of the announced period they issued another guidelines statement saying that the rates announced in the previous guidelines will remain in force, setting off a wave of public unhappiness. They themselves are sitting in warm and comfortable seats, coming and going in the latest fancy vehicles, their women and children at ease. It appears that they have not thought for an instant about the women and children of the people, the passengers and these toiling, low-income, oppressed people. Mr. Torkan, we in the Damavand and Firuzkuh area did not have any problem transporting passengers during the New Year's holidays for you to come and raise prices. Is it fair for travelers from Damavand taking this short trip to Tehran and back to pay such a fare? Is it fair for an oppressed person from Firuzkuh, a city in the province of Tehran, to pay the heavy 1,600-rial official fare you announced just to take the short trip to Tehran and back? Perhaps it is not your concern whether the people have the money or not, people who must stand for hours lined up without shelter in the burning summer sun and in the unbearable winter cold to obtain transportation at this heavy fare. In this same regard the speaker added: Mr. minister, do you feel the pain of these people? I sharply protest this willful initiative by the Ministry of Roads and Transportation, which has severely disturbed the people in my electoral district. I ask that the previous rates be announced and implemented. If this is not done, in accordance with my lawful duty, I will present a question to the minister in charge at an open Majles session, or I will take any other legal step within the realm of my responsibilities in order to pursue the matter to its conclusion. Continuing, Rasuli-Nezhad said: It is surprising, in view of the fact that we are in the planting season and in the second month of the current year, that it is still not known on what date the budget for the current year will be sent to the offices of the governors-general and the executive organizations. This is especially surprising in my electoral district, where the planting season is limited and the cold season is long. The deputy from Damavand and Firuzkuh added: The sudden increase in the rate for consumer electrical power has made the people anxious and unhappy and has caused a substantial shutdown at workshops and small factories. He discussed manpower adjustment. He said: We must first think about creating employment and work, and then think about adjustment. The speaker then discussed the numerous and repeated press conferences by the members of the Council of Ministers and he asked the president of the republic to remind them that not only do these appearances not solve any problems, they create problems and headaches for the nation and the government. At the end of his speech Rasuli-Nezhad said: In view of the fact that a number of people live on the poverty line and are in need of their evening bread, the preparation of an album on the first round of women's games in the Islamic nations at 25 tumans was a completely improper thing to do, and should be pursued and dealt with. Legislation Amendment to the Airline Organization Law The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was continued consideration of the report from the second consultation of the Roads and Transportation Commission concerning the Motion To Amend Articles From the Law Establishing the Airline Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which was approved by the deputies. Article 1: Article 5, Note 2 of the law is amended as follows: Article 5: The National Aircraft Organization is the only authority authorized to sign agreements and authorizations between the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and other nations. The right to make flights to transport persons and things to make use of the rights given in contracts, agreements and authorizations for the operation of air services between the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and other nations is assigned to the Aircraft Company of the Islamic Republic of Iran. If the Aircraft Company of the Islamic Republic of Iran fails to announce that is ready to provide airline services within a maximum of six months, the National Aircraft Organization is authorized to give authorization to operate the flights to other government airline companies. Note 2: Iranian airline institutions, with the exception of the National Airline Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which operate under the relevant regulations and conduct flight operations, as well as other Iranian airline institutions, which may be established in the future adhering to the Flight Law with the necessary letter of authorization, may engage in passenger and freight transportation or any other type of commercial flight without weight restrictions with passenger or freight aircraft (as determined by the Supreme National Airline Council). The executive director of the Airline Company of the Islamic Republic of Iran will be appointed as a voting member of the Supreme National Airline Council mentioned in Article 6 of the Amendment to the National Airline Law. Article 2: Note 2, Article 11 is amended as follows: Note 2: The National Airline Organization and the government airline companies are included in all the activities given in Article 11 of the aforementioned law. Article 3: Article 7 is amended as follows: Article 7: As of the date of this law's enactment, the general representative (agence general) for the foreign airline institutions in Iran and likewise for aircraft technical services (repairs) will be the National Aircraft Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Passenger land support services, the deplaning of passengers, and the unloading and loading of aircraft at the nation's airports for domestic flights, with the exception of the aforementioned company and the companies affiliated with the National Aircraft Organization, are assigned to the National Aircraft Organization, and the Airline Company of the Islamic Republic of Iran will perform these tasks in the case of foreign aircraft. If shortcomings and malfunctions are felt in the performance of these duties, the National Aircraft Organization can assign the tasks by prior announcement to real and legal persons and entities, whether government or nongovernment. With the approval of this law, all other conflicting laws are null and void. Amendment to the International Railway Transportation and Shipping Convention Another item on the agenda was the report from the Housing and Urban Construction Commission concerning the Bill Amending Articles From the International Railway Transportation and Shipping Convention, of which Article 1 was approved by the deputies. Article 1: The amended protocol dated 30 December 1990 (29 Azar 1369) to the International Railway Transportation and Shipping Convention dated 9 May 1980 (19 Ordibehesht 1359) enacted by the Second General Assembly of the United Nations for international rail transportation and shipping, is approved. Amendment to the Iran Communications Company Law The next item on the agenda was the report from the Administrative and Employment Affairs Commission concerning the Bill Amending Article 7 of the Law Establishing the Iran Communications Company (returned from the Guardian Council), for which the amendment to Article 7 was deleted in order to secure the approval of the Guardian Council. It is worth mentioning that this amendment states that the Iran Communications Company may issue agreements in principle for the creations of specialist communications companies. Rashidi, expert for the Administrative and Employment Affairs Commission, said concerning this: The Guardian Council issued the opinion that the creation of such organizations in the Communications Company entails a financial burden and that this violates the Constitution. After receiving this opinion, the commission invited the minister of post and telegraph, and he dispensed in some way with this proposal from the Communications Company. Therefore the commission voted for the deletion of this amendment. Bill Giving Minister of Roads and Transportation Membership on the Iran Supreme Architecture Council The fifth item on the agenda was the report from the Administrative Affairs Commission concerning the Bill Giving the Minister of Roads and Transportation Membership on the Iran Supreme Urban Construction and Architecture Council (returned from the Guardian Council), and the aforementioned minister's membership was deleted and rejected in order to secure the approval of the Guardian Council. Bill Forming Rural Development Homes The next item on the agenda was the Bill Forming Rural Development Homes. Mr. Rashidi, expert for the Administrative and Employment Affairs Commission, said concerning this: This bill, intended to improve the economic, social, and development situation in rural areas, seeks to maintain, preserve, and develop investment, which is made for rural people. After speeches by two people opposing and supporting the bill, continued consideration was postponed to the next session. Selection of Majles Deputies To Supervise Implementation of the 1373 Budget Notes Another item on the agenda was the selection of Majles deputies to supervise implementation of the notes of the 1373 National Budget Law, as follows: 1 - Mr. Jalali, with 149 votes, and Mobini Dehkerdi, with 148 votes, will supervise distribution of credits and the procedure for implementing Paragraph B, Note 2 of the 1373 budget.

The selection of the rest of the deputies to supervise implementation of the 1373 notes was postponed to the next session. Condemnation of the Attempted Assassination of the Mashhad Temporary Friday Imam by 167 Deputies In a a letter read at yesterday's open Majles session, 167 deputies condemned the attempted assassination of the Mashhad Temporary Friday Imam. The text of the letter is as follows: To His Holiness Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mr. 'Aba'i, Mashhad temporary Friday Imam The report of the attempted assassination of that great man severly affected all the forces of the Islamic revolution. You are one of the true children of the Islam of Mohammad (peace be upon him), one of the students from the school of Imam Sadeq (peace be upon him), a prominent figure at the seminary, and one of the true and long-time companions of His Holiness the Imam (peace be upon him) and the exalted leader. We thank God that through the grace of His Holiness Baqiyatollah al-A'zam (may God hasten his joyful advent) and special grace from His Holiness 'Ali ibn Musa al-Reza (peace be upon him), you were spared this danger to continue service to Islam and the Muslims.
