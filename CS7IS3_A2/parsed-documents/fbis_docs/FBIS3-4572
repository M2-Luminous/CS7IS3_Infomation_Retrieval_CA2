Kubo, appearing on a Fuji Television program, reiterated his opposition to a cabinet reshuffle designed to remove specific ministers, alluding to a reported move by Hosokawa and Shinseito co- leader Ichiro Ozawa to dump Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. Hosokawa and his supporters in the seven-party coalition have differences with Takemura over Hosokawa's plan to introduce a so- called "national welfare tax" to replace the consumption tax, the future of Japanese politics and other key issues, political sources say. Kubo said the SDP, the largest force in the seven-party coalition, is against a cabinet reshuffle before the start of deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget program but that it will not part with the coalition government in protest against a cabinet shake-up.
