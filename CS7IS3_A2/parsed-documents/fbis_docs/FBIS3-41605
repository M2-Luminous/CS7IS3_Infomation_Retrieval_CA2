I. Danilov-Danilyan, Russian Federation minister of environmental protection and natural resources: ``One-Third of Russia's Territory Is the Most Valuable of What Remains on Earth as the Basis for Its Ecological Revival''] [Text] In this article, at the request of ZELENYY MIR's editors, Professor V. I. Danilov-Danilyan, Russian Federation minister of environmental protection and natural resources, analyzes the problems of Russia's international cooperation in the field of protection of the environment, the disastrous state of which--typical for all Russia's industrial regions--is arousing profound concern throughout the world, especially in the developed countries. Russia's present environmental condition stems from the deformed structure of the economy, the obsolescence and physical deterioration of most enterprises' fixed assets, and the lag in development of the infrastructure. A fundamental improvement is inconceivable without huge investments--in the amount of at least $1 trillion in order to attain the most modest normative indices of environmental impact. Without precedent? Absolutely not! Thirty years ago a similar situation was observed in almost all the industrial states. But three decades of the development and consistent implementation of purposeful environmental policies have resulted in a fundamental improvement of the condition of the environment in the postindustrial countries--something, however, which cannot be said about the global environment situation. In practically all the developing states, it is steadily deteriorating, partly because the change for the better in the developed countries has been brought about by their export of polluting production facilities to the developing countries. What is unprecedented, however, is the socioeconomic and political situation in Russia: in the past 30 or even 40 years not a single country with a developed market economy has experienced such an investment crisis. The traditional means of actualizing Russia's economic potential--by expanding the volume of resources drawn into production--is, nonetheless, unacceptable from both global and national viewpoints and is fundamentally contrary not only to environmental interests and restrictions, but also to economically sound principles of development under present conditions. At the same time, more than one-third of Russia's vast territory is practically untouched by economic activity, and those lands represent the most valuable of what remains on the planet as the basis for its ecological revival. It can be considered to have been firmly established that in order to prevent the irreversible degradation of the biosphere we must not only preserve but increase the territories left without economic utilization. The problems of the environment are confidently moving to occupy the highest place in international relations. The UN Conference on the Environment and Development that was held in Brazil last year was devoted to them; it defined the basic principles of economic development that does not destroy its own natural foundation (``Agenda for the 21st Century'') and founded a new UN agency--the Commission on Sustainable Development, which held its first session in June 1993. At the conference in Rio, the special status of countries with a transitional economy was established for the first time in official UN documents. For the standpoint of the Rio documents, one must note that the necessary foundations for implementing an environmental-protection policy have been laid in Russia: There is a network for monitoring the condition of the environment, a system of agencies for environmental protection and regulation of the use of natural resources has been developed (both vertically and horizontally), an environmental expert review board is in operation, a legislative basis for environmental-protection activities is being created, environmental programs are being drawn up, a system of specially protected territories is being developed (nature preserves, national parks, nature reserves, etc.), reports are regularly published on the state of the environment, a ``red book'' is maintained, and so forth. The existence of such a foundation, in the first place, and the specific features of the structure of Russia's economy, in the second place, account for an extremely important circumstance: in terms of environmental impact, investments in the reconstruction of Russia's economy (and that of certain other countries with a transitional economy) surpass any other areas of capital investments. Along with recognition of the environmental danger that our economy represents, this circumstance determines the interest of the developed countries, especially the Group of Seven, in the question of environmentally oriented investments in Russia, and in credits and technical assistance for the purposes of developing the environmental-protection system and implementing environmental programs and measures to enhance ecological security. At present this interest has been manifested (on the level of preliminary negotiations, or of agreements that are being drafted or have been signed, or of projects that have begun to be carried out) with respect to five chiefly concrete forms of cooperation. 1. The writing off of part of Russia's foreign debts in the event of our implementation of environmental-protection measures that are of general interest (the construction of an enterprise to process radioactive waste--especially in the Far East, is in Japan's interests, for example, while the development of a system for monitoring environmentally hazardous facilities based on satellite communications with access for other countries' environmental-protection services, and other such projects are in the interests of the entire world community). 2. Credits and technical assistance for the development and implementation of such projects (this pertains especially to nuclear power engineering--the early shutdown of first-generation reactors and the bringing of newer ones up to standards, the implementation of energy-conservation measures that will provide for corresponding transformations in nuclear power engineering). 3. The development of a project for a World Bank ``ecological loan,'' which is a top priority for Russia--a project which is being completed this September through the efforts of a special mission of the World Bank and the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources. 4. Numerous questions of multilateral and bilateral cooperation--Russia participates in 16 multilateral and 27 bilateral environmental agreements. 5. The stepping up of cooperation with the European Community to address the most acute environmental problems in Europe and the according of the highest priority to those problems. It is in Russia's interests at the present time to strive for the conclusion of agreements on repaying part of its foreign debt by carrying out environmental measures for their full value and, in the case of investments in projects partially aimed at environmental goals (the shift to technologies reducing the discharge of greenhouse gases, etc.)--for a corresponding part of their value. Russia should try to obtain both credits on favorable terms and technical assistance for carrying out projects related to the reconstruction of environmentally hazardous production facilities, the reduction of resource consumption, and removal of the barriers to the penetration of environmentally friendly products of Russian enterprises into the world market (space probing and mapping, environmental monitoring devices, etc.). The announcement that an ``ecological loan'' in the World Bank was of high priority for the Russian Federation would strengthen Russia's position on all other issues and demonstrate our responsible attitude toward Russia's environmental problems that are of concern to the whole world. In the course of various talks, we should push the idea of the need to develop, in conjunction with the Commission of the European Communities, a special environmentally oriented program of technical assistance to Russia, and should explain that the decisions of the UN Conference on the Environment and Development (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), the Environment for Europe Conference (Lucerne, 1993), and the first session of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (New York, 1993) are being consistently implemented in Russia, and that the necessary foundation has been created in Russia for the consistent pursuit of policy in the area of environmental protection and resource conservation. And that not only reducing the negative impact of Russia's economy on the environment and reconstructing (eliminating) environmentally hazardous production facilities, but keeping vast territories of the country untouched by economic activity are essential to averting planetary environmental disaster.
