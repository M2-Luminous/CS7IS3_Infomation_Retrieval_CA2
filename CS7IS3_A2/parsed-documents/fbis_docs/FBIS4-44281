It is expected to be attended by a majority of the representatives of the 157 states which have signed the Convention on Chemical Weapons. The session will be chaired by Ambassador Grigoriy Berdenikov of the Russian Federation. The Convention on Chemical Weapons, opened to signature on 13 January 1993 and signed by 157 states, will enter into force 180 days after the date of deposit of the 65th instrument of ratification, but in no case earlier than two years after its opening for signature. Eight countries have ratified the convention so far. As soon as it enters into force, the convention will be applied by the OPCW. All major decisions are taken in its plenary sessions, and work is prepared in the Preparatory Commission or working groups and expert groups. On 27 June, Mr Ian Kenyon, Executive Secretary of the Preparatory Commission, will present a report reviewing developments and issues since the sixth plenary session in mid-April. Questions to be examined include the organisations' budget and programme, training of inspectors, confidentiality policy, inspection procedures for chemical weapons facilities including equipment and sampling and so on. The new president for the period August 1994 to February 1995 will be elected from one of the Latin American signatory states. The Convention on Chemical Weapons prohibits all development, production, acquisition, retention, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons. Signatory states are obliged to destroy their chemical weapons and chemical weapons production facilities as well as any chemical weapons they may have abandoned on another state's territory. Implementation of the convention will be verified through reporting requirements, on-site inspections and short-notice challenge inspections. The civilian chemical industry will also have to comply with obligations regarding the production, processing or consumption of chemicals that are considered relevant to the objectives of the convention.
