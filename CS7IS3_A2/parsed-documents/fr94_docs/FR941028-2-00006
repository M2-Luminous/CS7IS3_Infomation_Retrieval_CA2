FR941028-2-00006 FR941028-2-00003 The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be developed by a third party contractor who has been approved by the BLM and USFS. The contractor will use an interdisciplinary team to develop the document. The BLM and USFS will have the joint responsibility for the content of the EIS. The comment period for the draft EIS is anticipated to be in the summer of 1995. The comment period for the final EIS is anticipated to be the winter of 1995. At this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft EIS must structure their participation in their review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDS , 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft EIS stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final EIS may be waived or dismissed by the courts. City of Angoon v. Hodel , 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris , 490 F. Supp. 1334 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the agencies at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the EIS. To assist the USFS and BLM in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments on the proposed project should be as specific as possible. Comments may address issues and concerns or the potential alternatives to be considered in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points. Complete records of all phases of the environmental documentation process will be available for public review at the BLM, Phoenix District Office, and at the Tonto National Forest Supervisor's Office (same as addresses noted above). Dated: October 24, 1994. Paul J. Buff, Acting District Manager. Dated: October 24, 1994. Gordon L. Cates, Acting Forest Supervisor.
