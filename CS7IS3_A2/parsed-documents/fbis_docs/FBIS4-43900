According to the prereleased text of his speech held at the opening of the two-day conference of the bilateral economic commission in Berlin on Thursday [23 June], Rexrodt told Saudi Economics and Finance Minister Shaykh Muhammad al-'Ali Aba-al-Khayl that he hopes to get some information on future cooperation opportunities. The commission, which was established in 1975, held its last meeting in Riyadh in late February 1992. The conference will end in Potsdam on Friday with the signing of a final protocol. Rexrodt said he regrets that German investment in Saudi Arabia is still very modest in volume and that it has not gone up over the past few years. The reasons for this are not only to be sought in Germany. Creating favorable conditions for investment is also important for Saudi Arabia, Rexrodt said. Rexrodt went on to express concern over the fact that German exports to Saudi Arabia dropped by almost 15 percent in 1993, while German imports only went down 1.1 percent. German exports were at a high of 8.5 billion German marks [DM] in 1982. In 1993, the figure was DM3.6 billion. Imports from Saudi Arabia amounted to some DM2 billion in 1993. The main products imported were petroleum, fuels, and lubricating oil. According to the Saudi Industrial Ministry, there are some 70 German-Saudi joint ventures. The German Society for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) has arranged for over 100 experts to provide training and consultation for Saudi institutions. Cooperation in science and technology concentrates on the use of solar energy for hydrogen production.
