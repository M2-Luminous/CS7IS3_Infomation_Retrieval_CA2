You are not ready for foreign markets." Contrary to expectations, that warning from Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, the Russian president's personal representative at the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, did not give rise to any objections from the leaders of manufacturing enterprises or Russian weapons designers who are striving for the right to independent foreign economic activity. The conference on the problems of further cooperation between "Rosvooruzheniye" and military-industrial complex enterprises was prompted by the dual position which the Russian arms trade has been in for a month now. On the one hand, the president's edict of 18 November last year brought in a state monopoly whose implementation prescribed the formation of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company. On the other hand, the government decree of 6 May this year to all intents and purposes abolished the state monopoly. The right to trade on foreign markets will once again be granted to enterprises -- provided, admittedly, they are successfully certified for the purpose. Russia's military-industrial complex, Shaposhnikov stated, is rapidly collapsing. The programs to convert production and to recycle accumulated weapons are not being implemented, state orders continue to fall, skilled cadres are leaving the sector, and production of a whole host of components -- specifically, certain types of munitions -- is being stopped. Some 400 military-industrial complex enterprises have been shut down. In the first five months of 1994 the Defense Ministry owed the defense sector over 4 trillion rubles [R] -- not counting the R700 billion that was not paid last year. One way to avert collapse is to try to win a slice of Russia's exports pie, which has shrunk from $22.6 billion in 1987 to just $2 billion in weapons sold in 1993. Government Decree No. 479, which created another moot case in Russian legislation, was also a reflection of these interests. The top state authorities seem not to have noticed the contradictions between the two acts. A Security Council session was scheduled for 8 June at which it had been proposed to set up a certification commission to study applications from people claiming the right to establish direct ties with foreign partners. The session was postponed to July -- only because the same day sees the signing of contracts on the basis of plans for the delivery of MiG-29's to Malaysia, to which many of the people invited to the council session will have traveled. Optimists at the session gave assurances that we are no strangers to differing interpretations and contradictions and that the system of Russian military-technical cooperation will be improved. Aleksey Shulunov, president of the League to Assist Defense Enterprises, believes that the end product will be to combine a state monopoly with broader involvement of manufacturers and developers in military-technical cooperation. And the conference participants could not conceive of the arms trade without "Rosvooruzheniye," which has warned that it will not service firms that "strike out" on their own. But pessimists recalled the recent period when there was a liberal attitude toward arms exports. Nobody has calculated how much Russia lost through the free-for-all that prevailed then. When Malaysia expressed interest in buying a major batch of MiG-29's, around 50 firms, state institutions, and ordinary Russian citizens vied with each other to offer it their services. Not a single military-industrial complex enterprise has yet applied for a license. Stanislav Filin, deputy general director of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, believes that there will be few applicants, and that even fewer licenses will be issued. Nonetheless, powerful science-and-production associations are pressuring small firms in an attempt to win their consent to have them represent their interests in foreign markets. It cannot be ruled out that these giants will once again start stealing clients from each other. After all, apart from the contradictory presidential edict and government decree, there are no other acts of legislation in Russia regulating the arms trade. Under these circumstances Russia will hardly be able to count on increasing its share of the world arms trade.
