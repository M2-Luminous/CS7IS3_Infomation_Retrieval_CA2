"Damming the Mekong River is like declaring a war with Vietnam," noted U.S. biologist Dr Tyson Roberts, who has observed the Mekong ecological system since the 1970s. If Roberts is correct, then the first battle has already begun. Recently completed is the l,500-megawatt Manwan Dam, the first of its kind on the mainstream Lanchang Giang (Mekong River) in China's southem province of Yunnan. The 4,200 kilometre Mekong River starts its journey from the Tibetan Himalayas passing through southwestern China, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and then to Vietnam, where silt carried down the river and deposited in the area for thousands of years has formed a large expanse of over four million hectares of land at the delta. River dwellers living in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia have noticed the unusually low water levels during the dry season since the dam was built. Vietnam, as the last country the Mekong passes before entering the sea, is no exception. "We don't have any concrete or clear scientific conclusions about the unnatural reduction of water in the Mekong. But farmers at the delta have already noticed that water levels in the river and connecting canals are lower than they were in former years," said Dr Le Quang Minh, dean of the Water Resource and Land Improvement Faculty, Cantho University. Cantho is the capital of Hau Giang Province, named after the largest "tail" of the "dragon". In Vietnam the Mekong River is known as the Nine-tailed Dragon, as the river formerly split into nine branches at the delta. Two of the major branches are the Tien Giang and Hau Giang where webs of thousands of canals have been dug for navigation and irrigation. Giang comes from a Chinese letter meaning river. Today the "dragon" has only seven tails as two of them, Ba Ly and Co Chien, have been filled up with silt deposits. Crop cultivation and sustainable ways of life in this part of the country are made possible by these tails. Over 50 per cent of rice harvested for local consumption and export are grown in the delta region. Shortly after economic liberalization in 1986, Vietnam became the world's third largest rice exporter after the United States and Thailand. "Engineers have quite a positive perspective about dams, but I do not. Even though people desire the proposed function of the dam, I wonder whether it will be operated as it was designed. The people who designed it are not the same ones as those who operate it," said Minh. There are fears that the dam will be operated solely for the purpose of supplying energy without thought given to the effect dam operations will have on the delta region. "If I were the director, and those dams were designed for generating electricity, I would keep this function as my priority when operating the dam. In the dry season, I would retain water to secure operation of the dam." "It's the same story with the flood," the water management specialist continued. "If there is a big flood, I don't believe dam operators would retain the water because it could be risky for the safety of the dam." Due to Vietnam's push for development and wealth, supported by multilateral business and financial agencies, the Vietnamese government strictly maintains its export-oriented policy. Agricultural products, especially rice, are produced for export. High-yield-varieties have been promoted in the delta area. Irrigation systems, as a result, need to be expanded and improved upon to catch up to the expansion of plantation areas. The An Giang and Kien Giang provinces, west of the delta, as well as Dong Thap province in the East, are in the target areas of such agricultural development. However, the soil in O.55 million hectares of the area is strongly acidic, 1.05 million hectares is medium and lightly acidic, 0.15 million hectares is permanently saline and 0.16 million has high salinity in the dry season. The relationship between the soil, water and farming systems in the Mekong delta is so complicated and fragile that any changes in the condition of one component needs to be repeatedly tried and tested before the actual results of the change can be determined. The Mekong Committee in 1992 hired the Netherlands Development Consultancy to plan irrigation improvement of the acidic areas in the Southwest of the delta. The consultant at that time planned to divert the water from the Hau Giang River to lower the acidity levels. But the plan has not been implemented as detailed studies are needed to find out how much water should be wed. Too much water for irrigation means not enuough water at the mouth of the Hua Giang to maintain the natural conditions of salinity from the South China Sea. While hydro engineers dream to tame the Mekong by controlling natural floods and drought, what never seems to be taken into account is the ecological implications when the natural flow is disrupted by huge concrete structures such as dams.
