The targeted growth rate, first set forth at a special cabinet meeting on February 10, is a rebound from the sluggish 0.2 percent growth envisaged for fiscal 1993 that ends March 31. The projection is based on gross domestic product (GDP), the total value of goods and services produced in a country. The cabinet also approved projections for key economic items, including for government spending and national income. Government spending is projected to rise 7.8 percent in nominal terms and 7.5 percent in real terms to 92.7 trillion yen for the coming fiscal year. National income is forecast to increase 3.5 percent to 372.8 trillion yen. Corporate earnings are projected to rise 5.4 percent to 60.2 trillion yen, the first increase in six years.
