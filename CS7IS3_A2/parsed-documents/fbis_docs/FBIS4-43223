"Two IAEA inspectors at the Yongbyon nuclear plant in North Korea were informed that North Korea was withdrawing from the Agency by their North Korean colleagues," the spokesman, Hans-Friedrich Meyer, said. "But the IAEA has not been informed of the North Korean withdrawal, either by that country or by the United States," he said. He said the two IAEA inspectors, trying to determine if Pyongyang has a secret nuclear weapons program, "have not yet been asked by North Korea to leave the country." China, a close North Korean ally, said Tuesday that it had also not been officially informed of North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA. According to IAEA rules, the North Korean government must officially inform the United States of its intention to quit the nuclear watchdog, a decision which would presumably mean expulsion of the inspectors. The United States, the trustee of the Agency's ratification treaty, must then immediately inform the IAEA board of governors and the member states, Meyer explained. North Korea's official KCNA news agency announced Monday that Pyongyang was withdrawing from the Vienna-based nuclear watchdog in retaliation for an Agency decision last Friday to enact mild sanctions against the communist government. The sanctions -- cutting off technical assistance to Pyongyang -- were taken as punishment for the government's refusal to permit outside access to nuclear facilities and fuel rods extracted from a nuclear reactor. Western intelligence agencies suspect that enough plutonium could be taken from the fuel rods to produce four or five nuclear weapons. The UN Security Council is due to discuss a phased series of more serious sanctions against North Korea later this week. Meyer said that North Korea's obligation to allow IAEA officials to inspect its nuclear facilities does not follow from its membership in the IAEA but from its signature of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) which North Korea has not yet withdrawn from. Japanese and Western diplomats earlier said the real fear now was whether North Korea would leave the NPT, which bans members from using nuclear energy for a military purpose. "The point of no-return has not been reached yet," a Western diplomat said. "The red line is whether they withdraw from NPT. Such decision will be much more serious because it would mean they are renouncing dialogue," he said. Russian President Boris Yeltsin said meanwhile that he and U.S. President Bill Clinton had agreed to link the holding of a conference on the Korean crisis with phased sanctions against North Korea, the Russian government's ITAR-TASS news agency said.
