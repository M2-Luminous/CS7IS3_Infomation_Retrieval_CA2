The answer could be positive, provided the Muslim side also guarantees that it will comply with the unconditional cease-fire and sit at the negotiating table. As we already know, this not only depends on them but also on those who have pushed them into a war against their neighbors in the first place. The Muslim leaders at Bascarsija [center of Sarajevo] could finally benefit from the wisdom of their religious brother in Cairo, President Sadat, who, after four wars with its neighbor Israel, signed a peace agreement at the end of the 1970's, thus refusing to fight any more for the Arab cause to the last Egyptian. It is well known that roads and interests of not only one foreign power are crossing themselves on the territory of the former Yugoslavia that was based on AVNOJ [Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia] as well as Bosnia-Herzegovina. The interests of Germany, Austria, the Vatican, and Turkey are mostly well known from history. It is less known why the United States is investing so much passion in accusing the Serbs wherever they may be and supporting the Bosnian Muslims whatever they may be doing. This may to some extent be learned by examining the new U.S. interests in these regions, which are stronger than the interests of a small ally in the two world wars. The U.S. strategic concept, whose implementation has been elaborated in detail by military experts, includes a general scale of U.S. national interests. They are officially established by the President and their implementation depends on public opinion, support by Congress, and priorities that are established by executive authorities. U.S. national interests are organized into four categories according to the degree of importance. Vital life interests come first, and they refer to achieving basic national security aims. In order to defend those, the United States is prepared to risk even waging a nuclear war. Second place is occupied by great interests that require from the state readiness to use armed forces for their protection, but under the condition that the conflict does not grow into a nuclear war. Ranked as third are important interests. They are a little less important than vital and great interests but are important enough for offering logistic assistance and limited support from the air and sea. Ground forces would be used only in an advisory role. It is not difficult to see that the U.S. engagement in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina is in accordance with these important aims. Occupying fourth place is a single word: interest. With a view to protecting that, the United States would take certain measures -- but for war -- including help to allied and other friendly countries, with a possibility of engaging armed forces as well, in case of need. It is interesting to note the further division of U.S. national interests into direct and indirect ones. Therefore, for instance, if West Europe is of vital interest for the United States, then the oil fields in the Persian Gulf and naval routes from them to Europe are indirectly of vital interest for the United States as well. Following the analogy, one can understand Washington's relationship toward the Bosnian Muslims, considering the U.S. interests to improve relations with oil-rich Islamic countries and to contract profitable businesses with them. When mentioning the United States, the question somehow spontaneously poses itself of where Russia is and what its interests are. It is difficult to answer that question now, but it is nevertheless known that it was in the Balkans that this country was always confirming itself as a great power. Time will show whether it is renouncing this status in exchange for the benefit of cooperativeness and partnership with the United States.
