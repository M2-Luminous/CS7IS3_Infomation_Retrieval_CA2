He said this yesterday upon his departure from the Bulgarian capital of Sofia. Foreign Minister Kooijmans, who accompanied Lubbers, noted that the chances for calling a halt to the war have dropped in the last two weeks. He also talked of a "common front," which must make it clear that the flagrant violations of the UN resolutions will no longer be tolerated. The Netherlands had raised some questions about the request to NATO made by the UN secretary general to carry out air strikes around the "safe areas" in Bosnia. In a letter to the Second Chamber, Kooijmans said that "there must be better coordination with other countries that are supplying troops. There must also be a sufficient number of troops present in the "safe areas."
