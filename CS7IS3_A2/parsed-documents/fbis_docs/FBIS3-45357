The Liberal Party's Standing Committee yesterday deferred until tomorrow the final decision which will determine the success of Patten's bill. The party is considering opting for a "free vote" which will clear it of adopting a firm stance on political reform and allow an individual vote. The fate of the constitutional package will be determined after more discussions within the conservative party. The government needs the vote of the Liberal Party's 15 legislators to ensure the bill passes the Legislative Council. But the party is deeply divided, with several legislators already indicating they may vote against their party to oppose the abolition of appointed seats for district boards. The party has completed an independent survey of its 1,400-strong membership and several functional constituency polls on the controversial proposals. Results were said to be mixed, delaying any clear policy on the subject for a few days. It was also revealed Liberal Party legislator Howard Young could join colleague James Tien in opposing the abolition of appointed seats. Young's surveys of his functional constituency show support for appointed seats. Young said he would "weigh up very carefully" the Liberal Party's final stance before a decision was made. But if the party applied a "free vote" it is likely he would oppose the abolition of appointed seats -- which is a key part of Patten's package. He said a lot of people have reservations about giving up appointed seats and he claimed there was "great" regret in bringing the bill forward without China's blessing. One survey indicated Young's constituency was also opposed to lowering the voting age to 18. Tien has indicated he would introduce an amendment opposing the abolition no matter what his party decided. Under the Liberal Party constitution appointed members are allowed to vote against the party and support constituents' views. Support for Patten's partial bill appears to be on the wane in the Legislative Council after the breakdown in Sino-British relations and future threats to the legislature after 1997. Legislators say privately there is only 50 percent support for the bill and success or failure hinges on the Liberal Party's vote. The Liberal Party said it would support the bill if introduced with China's blessing. But last month it reserved a decision until a membership opinion poll was carried out. Liberal legislator Henry Tang said the party had to come up with a more definitive answer to the problem. The United Democrats indicated they would back the bill but would amend it to include more democratic elections in 1995. Independent legislator Eric Li is also set to introduce an amendment opposing the abolition of appointed seats.
