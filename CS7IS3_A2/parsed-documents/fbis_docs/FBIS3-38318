Idiz] [Text] Ankara -- Serious doubts are being expressed about the true nature of the much publicized recent Azeri advances against positions occupied by Armenian forces within Azerbaijan. There are increasing suggestion [as published] that the latest Azeri onslaught was ill-timed and that it may be providing the opportunity for Armenian forces to get reinforcements from Armenia, to regroup and to prepare for a serious counteroffensive in the spring. The TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN] has been told that the Office of the Chief Staff in Ankara also has serious concerns and reservations about the current military operations in western and southwestern Azerbaijan. Reports reaching Ankara from Turkish officers training the Azeri army apparently indicated from the start that the current onslaught ordered by President Geydar Aliyev was not just ill-timed but also badly planned and executed. Azerbaijan's Ambassador to Ankara Mamed Aliyev Novruz Ogly, who was contacted on the subject by the TDN, strongly denied these reports and said that they were simply attempts at undermining President Aliyev in his moment of success. "Our troops are not the attacking side. They have not embarked on a new onslaught. They are merely trying to liberate their lands from invading Armenians who have mercilessly pounded our towns and cities with artillery shells," Novruz Ogly said. On the question of timing, he added that the Armenians were threatening their big cities which necessitated immediate operations by the Azeri army to protect these cities. The fact that the training of Azeri soldiers had not been fully completed before this latest onslaught, has led to excessive casualties in return for small gains on the battlefield, according to sources informing the TDN. These sources also referred to "clear indications" that the Russian military is playing a "double game" in the Armenian-Azeri dispute by training Azeri troops on the one hand and reinforcing Armenian troops in Azerbaijan on the other. Sources have said that not just Turkish advisers, but President Geydar Aliyev's own military advisor, Gen. Nureddin Sadykhov, also exhorted the Azeri president to postpone the military operation until better weather conditions prevailed and the training of Azeri soldiers was completed. Gen. Sadykhov, who is said to be in close contact with the Turkish chief of staff's office, reportedly even threatened to resign if his advice was not taken. But President Aliyev's political considerations are said to have outweighed military considerations, leading him to order the offensive in the middle of winter. "It is true that there have been advances by Azeri forces. But most of these have been on open terrain and low ground with scant resistance from the Armenians. The Armenians may have pulled back from the low ground but they still retain all the strategic points on the high ground in and around Nagorno-Karabakh," one source said. He confirmed that the town of Goradiz had been liberated from invading Armenians. But he said this was achieved at a cost of 2,000 casualties on the Azeri side, which was advancing on the low ground, while the casualties among the Armenians, holding the high ground before they retreated, were considerably less. As for the recently, much reported "imminent liberation" of the strategic Azeri towns of Agdere [Mardakert] and Kelbadzhar, this source claimed that "nothing was further from the truth. "Azeri forces have not managed to come closer than 30 kilometers of Agdere, the gateway to Kelbadzhar, and have only entered minor villages on its extreme outskirts" he said. Agdere is immediately east of the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh while Kelbadzhar is to its west, near the border with Armenia. Both towns fell to Armenian forces in their offensive against Azerbaijan last year. "Even if a serious advance is secured against Agdere, taking Kelbadzhar under present climatic conditions is almost impossible, as any military official who is familiar with the region and its terrain would confirm," this source said. Questioned on these claims as well, Ambassador Novruz Ogly characterized them as "lies." He said Azeri troops were within 300 meters of the town of Agdere and were forcing the outskirts of Kelbadzhar. "My concern -- and this concern is shared by Turkish advisers in the region -- is that the Armenians, who still retain the high ground, are allowing the Azeris to advance in the low ground. This way it will be easier to ensnare them in a major counter offensive, which would be launched under better climatic conditions" the source informing the TDN added. This source also said there was strong evidence to suggest the Armenians were being reinforced and were regrouping for a new offensive in the spring, just a few weeks ahead. He referred to 5,000 troops that had been moved in from Armenia through the Lachin corridor to the outskirts of Khankendi (Stepanakert), the administrative center of Nagorno-Karabakh, the predominantly Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan. The Lachin corridor, which connects Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia, was opened by the Armenians in 1992 and has been the main artery supplying the enclave from Armenia. This source also said that two regiments of Russia Cossacks from the 7th army, and two Armenian regiments had been moved in to reinforce the Fizulinskiy region of Azerbaijan which is adjacent to the Iranian border and which is still held by the Armenians. "This, among other things also indicates that the Russians are playing a double game here, because while they are helping the Armenians in this way, their military advisers are training Azeri troops in the Ganja region of Azerbaijan" he added. Other sources informing the TDN indicated that the optimal time for the Azeri onslaught for liberating its invaded lands would have been in March or April. They said the military operation would have stood a better overall chance of success then, not just due to better climatic conditions that would have better facilitated such an onslaught, but also because the training of the Azeri army -- still continuing under Turkish, U.S. and British as well as Russian advisers -- would have been closer to completion. "It is true that the minor advances achieved by Azeri troops has buoyed the public in Baku and led to a new sense of confidence. But these advances are also playing into Armenian hands because if they decided to use their important strategic advantages and regain the low ground, given Russian support and their better training, their apparent victory will seem twice as important as it really is," one such source argued.
