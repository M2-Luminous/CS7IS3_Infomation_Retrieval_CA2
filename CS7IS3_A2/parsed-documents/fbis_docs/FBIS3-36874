The prime minister acquinted the industrialists with the protocol of the expert commission for the merger of the monetary systems of Belarus and Russia. The prime minister said that the statements by opponents of this action, in which it is alleged that it runs counter to the republic's interests, are unfounded. When the appropriate agreements between the heads of the two governments are signed, Belarus will receive fuels at prices which are identical to those paid by Russian consumers. There will be no need for customs barriers and duties. In the course of the three months after signing the agreements, the changeover to payments of wages of those employed in the budget-funded sphere in accordance with a single wage network will be enacted in Belarus. It is intended to carry out settlements between the banks of Belarus and Russia via correspondent accounts, opened by commercial banks with one another, or via accounts of the National bank of Belarus and the Russian Central Bank. The protocol provides for a number of jointly elaborated mechanisms and procedures for their implementation during the difficult process of fully merging the two states' monetary systems.
