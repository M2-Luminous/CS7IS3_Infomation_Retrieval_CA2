Despite the fact that an investigation by the Venezuelan Congress shows the Colombian Banco Latino branch operating normally, most of its shareholders are the same people responsible for the bank's bankruptcy in Venezuela. [Begin Orlando Fernandez, president of the Venezuelan Congress Banco Latino investigating commission, recording] The Colombian Banco Latino branch shareholders are all practically the same people who robbed the bank here in Caracas, with the exception of certain shareholders who are front men for former president Carlos Andres Perez. [end recording] While the woman judge investigating the case in Venezuela is about to issue 50 new arrest warrants, some of the alleged culprits are in Colombian territory. [Begin Fernandez recording] Several are in Colombia. The wife and genius connected to all the legal machinations in obtaining unsecured loans, loans with false documents, all the operations carried out by front men, were made by a citizen called Lermi Mendoza, who is in Colombia. [end recording] On behalf of the Colombian colony of immigrants affected by the financial catastrophe, Venezuelan Deputy Walter Marquez pointed out the principles of reciprocity that Venezuela and Colombia uphold. [Begin Marquez recording] Many Colombians have been affected by this situation. We consider this serious.
