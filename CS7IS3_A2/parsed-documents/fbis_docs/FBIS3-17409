In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday, Shokhin said that on March 23 President Boris Yeltsin appointed him vice-prime minister. The appointment fills up the vacancy that existed in the government since January 10. There is one first vice-prime minister and four vice-prime ministers in the Russian Government now. Shokhin expressed the supposition that he may be put in charge of economy, finances and cooperation with CIS states and international organisations. He added, however, that the exact range of issues to be handled by him will be determined at a meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin within the next few days. Speaking about the draft budget for 1994, Shokhin said that the major problem is the "low collectibility of federal taxes." He said the government plans to carry out a programme of measures to rescind previously adopted laws. He did not specify. He stressed that "between the government and the parliament normal conditions have been created for a civilised discussion of the draft budget." The newly appointed vice-prime minister said that the recently imposed import tariffs is a "rather advanced variant which had been discussed in the government for six months." It is seeking to reconcile the positions of domestic producers and consumers. The inflow of goods from abroad has led to the drop in demand for domestic products and closure of enterprises. Shokhin did not rule out the possibility of establishing, in the future, certain privileges for potential western investors seeking to invest in the Russian economy, rather than sell finished products. Asked about the problem of non-payments between enterprises, Shokhin noted that he sees the solution in "tightening payment discipline between economic entities and introducing a simplified mechanism for solving disputes."
