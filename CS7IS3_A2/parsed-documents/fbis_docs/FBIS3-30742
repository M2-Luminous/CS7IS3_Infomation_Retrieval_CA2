On that occasion some UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] low-ranking officials and officers refused to allow Zdravko Sancevic, Croatian ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and several other Croats to enter Sarajevo, thus preventing Ambassador Sancevic from carrying out his duties. It is inconceivable that an ambassador should not be allowed to enter the capital of the country to which he is accredited, regardless of whether he is stopped by the government of the host country or officials representing an international organization such as the United Nations, Granic said. He also expressed understanding for the problems faced by UNPROFOR in the implementation of their task and the hope that incidents like the ones of 5 February would not happen again. In his letter to Akashi, Granic also expresses deep concern and personal regret over the tragedy at Sarajevo market, stressing that the Croatian Government sharply condemns such barbarian acts directed against innocent civilians. To prevent further escalation of chaos, violence, and suffering, the Croatian Government has called on all sides immediately to cease hostilities and return to the peace negotiations. The Croatian Government also calls on the international community to use all available means, including force, to stop tragic clashes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is said among other things in Granic's letter to Yasushi Akashi.
