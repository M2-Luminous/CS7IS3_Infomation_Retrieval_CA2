This came to light because of a public opinion poll, which was released today, and caused concern for the EU Commission. Correspondent Nikos Bellos has the following report from Brussels: [Begin Bellos recording] The stance maintained by some EU members on the issue of Skopje has cause great dissatisfaction in Greece. This dissatisfaction in practice translates into a significant decrease in the number of Greeks who believe that the EU operates democratically. The latest poll conducted in the 12 EU member countries last April for the EU Commission was made public today and caused concern and anxiety for EU officials in Brussels. The Greeks, who up until recently were the warmest supporters of the EU among European citizens, today appear to be particularly reserved and suspicious. Specifically, in a statement issued today the EU Commission admitted that the issue of Skopje and the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina have negatively influenced the Greek public's view toward the EU. According to the poll, 57 percent of Greeks believe that the EU does not operate in a democratic way. This represents an increase of 22 percent in relation with the last poll in October 1993. Despite their bitterness, the majority of Greeks still believe that the accession to the EU was particularly positive for our country. Specifically, 69 percent believe that Greece has benefited from its accession to the EU. Furthermore, 64 percent believe that Greece's participation in the EU is a good thing. In comparison with the poll taken last October, there is also a decrease in positive answers by 10 and 9 percent respectively. Regarding the 12 June elections for the European Parliament, the country's domestic political and economic situation will play a decisive role in the choice of parties by the voters. This was the answer of 85 percent of those asked, whereas only 11 percent will vote European, that is based on the EU's current picture. Finally, the majority of Greeks, 57 percent, are in favor of increasing the authority of the European Parliament. This is the largest percentage among EU members after Italy. [end recording]
