The incidents began when some 500 students -- who were demonstrating against the government's recent economic measures and against the constitutional reform in the area of the ministry buildings -- arrived at the Finance Ministry building. Instigated by leaders of the National Union of Students (UNE), a group of demonstrators attempted to invade the building of the ministry, which had promoted the economic measures lifting restrictions on the installments paid to private schools and universities. For approximately 30 minutes the demonstrators confronted 200 military policemen who were guarding the building. A number of windows were broken by the stones thrown by the students. Two policemen and 12 students suffered injuries of a minor nature, although 8 of the demonstrators did need to be seen at a Brasilia area hospital.
