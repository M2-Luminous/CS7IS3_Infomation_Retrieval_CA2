That is part of a package of plans announced by Lu Yucheng, vice- mayor of Beijing, in a recent meeting here. The plans are expected to help the capital reach the goal of a relatively-comfortable life three years earlier than the nation's schedule. So far, more than 60 well-known trans-national firms have come to Beijing to invest, according to the latest statistics. The investment fields that the municipal government tries to attract foreign investment in cover infrastructural construction, renovation of outdate houses, high-tech and new-tech sectors, economic and technological development zones, the service industry and modern commercial buildings. In addition, the government attempts to lure foreign investment into such fields as high-efficiency farming, tourism and financial sectors. Lu said Beijing also plans to expand its foreign trade by over two billion U.S. dollars this year through building more export- oriented firms and factories. Last year's total exports topped 1.68 billion U.S. dollars. The shareholding system will be promoted in more trade companies. Officials said they hope to set up a total of 4,000 foreign- funded enterprises involving 1.25 billion U.S. dollars by the end of this year, up 39 percent over last year. To achieve that goal, the vice-mayor said that more than 10,000 high-level specialized experts involving international finance, international trade and modern management will be trained.
