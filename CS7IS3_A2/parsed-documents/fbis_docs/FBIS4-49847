Last year, gross national product (GNP) in provinces and autonomous regions with a high density of ethnic groups -- Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Tibet, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou and Qinghai -- reached 293.8 billion yuan ($33.8 billion). And the annual per capita income of farmers and herdsmen in the eight areas exceeded 720 yuan ($83). China has 55 minority nationalities with a total population of 91 million. Most live in remote mountain areas where the economy has traditionally lagged behind other parts of the country. But since 1949, the government has worked out a series of preferential policies to promote economic growth in these areas. In 1984, a law governing the regional autonomy of minority nationalities laid the foundation for the development of relationships between all nationalities as well as economic, cultural, scientific and technological progress. There are five autonomous regions, 30 autonomous prefectures and 123 autonomous counties. To advance local industry, the government started 1,400 large and medium-sized enterprises in the eight autonomous regions and provinces. These enterprises have since become the pillars of the local economy. And industry is now complementary to the traditional agriculture and animal husbandry. Last year, the total output value of agriculture and industry in these areas hit 540 billion yuan ($62 billion). Industry accounted for 59.8 percent of the local economy, up from 14.8 percent in 1949. In recent years, township enterprises in ethnic areas have progressed steadily. Relying on local natural resources, labour and State loans, these enterprises are engaged in a diverse range of industries. From 1991 to 1995, the State will allocate 100 million yuan ($11.5 million) in low-interest loans to these enterprises. State subsidies have been promoting economic growth in minority nationality regions. In 1955 a special subsidy for minority nationality regions was set up. In 1964, two reserve funds were established for these regions. By the end of 1979, the State had allocated more than 3 billion yuan ($344 million) to minority regions through the three projects. From 1980 to 1987, grants increase by 10 percent under a new State subsidy system. By 1991, the grants totaled 80 billion yuan ($9.2 billion). In 1980, the government set up a development fund for economically backward regions. By 1991, half of the fund, 4 billion yuan ($459 million), went to minority nationality regions. Ethnic regions also topped the State agenda for poverty relief. The poverty line in these areas was set lower than other regions so that more counties would benefit from the State subsidies. Eleven years ago the government provided 200 million yuan ($23 million) in annual loans to the agricultural development fund in Hexi and Dingxi, of Gansu Province, and Xihaigu, of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The loans will continue until the end of the century. To create a favourable environment for economic development, the State spent 10 billion yuan ($1.15 billion) on materials for the regions to upgrade infrastructure. And in 1990 the State set up a special fund to provide minority people with sufficient, food and clothing; the fund covers 143 poverty stricken counties in ethnic areas. As a result of government efforts, minority living standards have greatly improved. In 1992, the per capita income of farmers and herdsmen in the autonomous areas hit 548 yuan ($63), six times that of 1978. Minority nationality regions, however, took longer to open up to the outside world compared to coastal areas. But since China has developed friendly relations with its neighboring countries, the government has encouraged minority regions to make the most of their geographical positions and boost their border trade. China has 22,000 kilometres of border land, of which 19,000 kilometres are in minority regions. Last year, trade in the eight autonomous regions and provinces reached $5.7 billion. And trade with Russia, Myanmar [Burma] and Vietnam is especially active. Due to diverse traditions and customs, minorities have different kinds of daily necessities. Before 1949, ethnic regions suffered a shortage of daily necessities. They had problems exporting the locally made products, and consequently, prices for these goods were very low. Over the past four decades, the government worked hard to rectify the existing price structure, subsidizing grocery stores. And companies producing goods for minority groups enjoy preferential loans, investment and taxation policies. Special low-interest loans have also been set up to help the technical innovation of these enterprises.
