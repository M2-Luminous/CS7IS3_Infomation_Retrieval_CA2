ACTION: Notice of Panel Decision, Revocation of Countervailing Duty Order and Termination of Suspension of Liquidation. SUMMARY: On February 23, 1994, the Binational Panel convened under the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement issued a decision affirming the Department of Commerce's (the Department) determination issued pursuant to remand that the Canadian provincial governments were not providing countervailable subsidies to producers or exporters of certain softwood lumber products. The United States requested that an Extraordinary Challenge Committee (ECC) be convened to review the Binational Panel's decision. On August 3, 1994, the ECC affirmed the Binational Panel's February 23, 1994, order affirming the Department's redetermination. Therefore, we are revoking the countervailing duty order on certain softwood lumber products from Canada and ordering the termination of suspension of liquidation. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 16, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kelly Parkhill or Norbert Gannon, Office of Countervailing Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephones: (202) 482&hyph;4126; (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On May 28, 1992, the Department determined that the Canadian provincial governments were providing countervailable subsidies to producers and exporters of certain softwood lumber products (57 FR 22570). On July 6, 1992, the International Trade Commission notified the Department of its determination that a U.S. industry was being materially injured by reason of imports of certain softwood lumber products from Canada. On July 13, 1992, the Department published in the Federal Register (57 FR 30955) the countervailing duty order on certain softwood lumber products from Canada. The Department's determination was reviewed by a Binational Panel under the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement. The Binational Panel remanded the determination to the Department and ordered it to find that no countervailable subsidies were being provided to softwood lumber producers or exporters by the Canadian provincial governments. The Department filed its amended redetermination, which the Binational Panel affirmed. The Binational Panel's decision became final on March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12584). The United States requested that an ECC be convened to review the Binational Panel's decision. On August 3, 1994, the ECC affirmed the Binational Panel's Order Affirming the Determination on Remand. Therefore, we are revoking the countervailing duty order on certain softwood lumber products from Canada, effective March 17, 1994, and ordering the U.S. Customs Service to terminate the suspension of liquidation on all entries made on or after that date. Cash deposits made prior to March 17, 1994 are not addressed in this notice. Termination of Suspension of Liquidation The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to terminate the suspension of liquidation of certain softwood lumber products from Canada, effective March 17, 1994, to cease collection of cash deposits on certain softwood lumber products from Canada, and to proceed with liquidation of the subject merchandise which entered the United States on or after March 17, 1994, without regard to countervailing duties. Dated: August 12, 1994. Paul L. Joffe, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20230 Filed 8&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;05&hyph;P
