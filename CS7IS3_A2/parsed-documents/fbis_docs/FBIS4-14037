FBIS4-14037 "drnes080_o_94007" FBIS-NES-94-080 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 SYRIA Cancellation of UAE Curricula on Israel Criticized Cancellation of UAE Curricula on Israel Criticized JN2304174694 Damascus TISHRIN in Arabic 11 Apr 94 pp 1, 11 JN2304174694 Damascus TISHRIN Arabic BFN [Unattributed "News and Analysis" feature: "Canceling Books in the United Arab Emirates Discussing Israeli Repression!"] [Text] In a report from the United Arab Emirates [UAE] yesterday morning, London radio said the French Government canceled educational books in the French school in the UAE because they point to both Israeli repression in the occupied Arab territories and the Palestinian people's resistance of occupation. The press report claimed this measure was taken in agreement with the UAE authorities as part of fighting anti-Semitism! The report, in itself, was brief. It, however, has serious implications. Everyone is aware of the French Government's current shift in favor of Israel, which reached the extent of concluding military and nuclear cooperation deals with it. This recalls the cooperation of the Guy Moliere [name as transliterated] government in the fifties before and after the futile Suez aggression. However, the French Government's cancellation, under the Zionist lobby's influence, of curricula in an Arab country on the pretext that it is anti-Semitic to discuss Israeli repression is regarded as extreme deception and collusion. It also reveals strong hostility to Arab hopes and aspirations as well as a readiness to cooperate with Israel as much as possible. The Western press in general, including the French press, constantly discusses both Israeli repression and the subjection of Palestinians to disgraceful ordeals. We, however, have heard no official in the French Government viewing the Western reporters' articles and reports as anti-Semitic. Are not Arabs, the victims of Israeli occupation, entitled to raise their voices in denunciation and to urge the international community to assume its responsibilities? Do not both the failure to brief students on facts and publicity for Israel constitute absolute hostility to Arabs and their cause? The French Government's conduct is amazing because it has apparently bargained the international community's principles and the values of justice for blind bias toward Israel, thus relinquishing the friendship of 200 million Arabs in favor of concealing Israeli crimes and implementing Israel's schemes. What draws our attention is the fact that this measure totally conflicts with the recent decisions by the UAE Government with regard to tightening the boycott of Israel. This measure also contradicts the UAE's official policy condemning Israeli occupation and urging Israeli withdrawal and recognition of the Palestinian people's legitimate rights. The brothers in the UAE are aware of Israel's intransigence and aggression, knowing that the blood shed in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has not yet dried! The French Government's submission to Zionist blackmail should not mean that Paris is in a position to determine the UAE's policy toward Israel, especially since the UAE is not in need of France as much as France is in need of Arab oil. After all, Arab dignity remains above all considerations.
