Apart from over 10,000 Somalis killed during the UN military operations, about 70 foreign peacekeepers have died. Amongst the UN peacekeepers' casualties, 30 are of soldiers from the United States. Technologically the strongest military machine in the world as represented by the 9000 servicemen on US ships off the Somalian coast, has been supporting some 30,000 UN soldiers drawn from 28 countries. This did not reassure most of the contributors to the UN expedition. The American public that has yet to recover from the Vietnam syndrome, could not stomach the sight of the dead bodies of US soldiers dragged about in Mogadishu's streets. Elected representatives of the American people rightly raised two basic questions. One, what the US servicemen were doing in Somalia in the first place. Two, which aspect of the US security was involved in Somalia to provide constitutional justification to President Clinton to deploy US troops in that remote African country. Faced with mounting domestic hostility to its military involvement in the African country, Washington had no option but to call it a day. Some of the Europeans were smart enough to jump ship well in time. Especially noteworthy were the Italians who amongst all westerners knew their Somalia because of their past colonial role in that country. Forced by its laws and an increasingly hostile public opinion at home, Washington has resorted to the familiar subterfuge of trying to achieve its objective through proxies. But the dimensions of the conceptual flaw in the Somalian misadventure is becoming glaring enough for the United States to wash its hands off and shift the entire blame to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. Left holding the baby, it is Ghali now who is designated as the conceiver of the Somalian operation. Transferring the blame elsewhere, the United States is doing the same to its Somalian military role and in this respect, Pakistan is willing to carry most of the burden. With 5,000 soldiers, Islamabad already has the largest representation in the UN Somalian contingent and this is increasing steadily. With 32 of its soldiers dead, Pakistan's loss is the largest amongst all contributors to the force. Although the life of a Pakistani is not considered as valuable as that of an American, Islamabad should ponder over some crucial aspects of its willingness to shoulder US burden. It is widely known that wherever Langley House finds its style cramped by domestic legislative restrictions, it inducts Saudi or any other intelligence agency which collaborates with the CIA. But by their very nature, the clandestine operations remain hidden and have vast room for wriggling out of a tight corner. But in any military involvement, it is not that easy to disclaim responsibility. The UN operations around the world by now are widely perceived as another means of furthering US objectives. Pakistan needs to guard against emerging eventually as what the Americans call the fall guy. If Pakistan believes that it is doing a service to brother Muslims in Somalia, the correct authority for the Pakistani contingent's operations in Somalia should be the Organisation of the Islamic Conference [OIC]. Irrespective of the OIC's credibility as a forum of all Muslim countries operating independent of any non- Muslim decisive influence, its nomenclature demands action on important issues that entail supreme sacrifice by a Muslim soldier.
