With regard to the creteria for regular monitoring of the openness of the market (objective criteria), it plans to propose using the share of foreign products in past government procurement as a quantitative criterion, and progress in the implementation of measures to improve procurement procedures announced last March as a qualitative criterion. However, the United States is expected to reiterate its desire to discuss procurement by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT). It may again demand that a certain measure of numerical targets be included in the objective criteria. Government procurement is one of the three priority sectors in the framework talks. The focal issue here is how to increase the ratio of foreign products in telecommunications and medical equipment purchased by Japanese Government agencies. With regard to the issue of objective criteria, the following points have been agreed upon during the recent discussions between Japan and the United States which led to the resumption of the framework talks: 1) these criteria will not be considered numerical targets; 2) both quantitative and qualitative criteria will be created; and 3) a comprehensive evaluation of the openness of the market should be conducted by using a number of criteria. In line with the above, the Japanese Government has finalized its concrete proposals on objective criteria in this sector. In government procurement, the ratio of foreign products in telecommunications equipment (in 1992) was around 6 percent (according to a Japanese Government survey). The government plans to monitor this ratio regularly to demonstrate its positive attitude toward expanding procurement of products made in the United States and other countries. Japan also plans to include the number of foreign companies participating in bids as one objective criterion. This data will be a measure of how actively U.S. companies sell their products. A regular check on this figure will contribute to encourage U.S. efforts to participate in the market. The measures to reform bidding procedures announced in March consist mainly of steps to better reflect the foreign companies' opinions. By looking at how faithfully such measures have been implemented, Japan hopes to eliminate "suspicions about the existence of dango [bid rigging]" among some U.S. companies. With regard to NTT, Japan argues that "This company has been privatized. It is not logical to discuss NTT procurement at the framework talks." In relation to objective criteria, the United States will probably ask for mid- and long-term commitments to sustain the current trend of increasing foreign share in government procurement, claiming this does not constitute a numerical target. Japan intends to reject this demand, in the belief that "any commitment for the future should be interpreted as a numerical target." Since government procurement is an area under direct government control, it has been considered a sector where it would be easier to reach an agreement. The Japanese Government has also been hoping to bring progress to the framework talks as a whole by achieving an agreement in procurement. However, if conflicts arise un the NTT issue, negotiations may not proceed smoothly along the line of this scenario.
