"Wolfgang, just become president, that will solve the whole problem." Wolfgang Schaeuble let a hasty reply escape his lips: "I cannot exactly review the troops from a wheelchair." What is true for the president is also true for the chancellor. Protocol-pro Helmut Kohl dismisses the occasional defeatism of his most important associate. Whether or not one can review troops from a wheelchair is irrelevant. The chancellor sent Schaeuble, the victim of an assassination attempt, a biography of the paralyzed U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Motto: If you believe in yourself you can do anything. Schaeuble did not read the huge volume and finds the comparison with the U.S. president inappropriate. "Roosevelt had polio. I had my legs shot out from under me in an instant. The two are completely different." But even without Roosevelt's formula, Schaeuble has succeeded in believing in himself once again. Today he is at the top--the one and only union colleague whom Kohl can tolerate having with him. And no election chances remain for the ailing chancellor. This tough individual, confined to a wheelchair, has with determination maneuvered himself to the top. Government administrator, parliamentary caucus leader, CDU strategist: a man for all seasons. Kohl's luck has run out and Schaeuble's desire for power is increasing. Hermann-Otto Solms, the FDP [Free Democratic Party] parliamentary caucus leader, has a realistic opinion of his partner in the coalition: "Chancellor? Yes, he will make it there." Schaeuble has this awkward parliamentary group under control for the most part. As one member of the executive committee recalls, Schaeuble's predecessor, Alfred Dregger, "was Kohl's vassal. Schaeuble is his opponent." The Man Makes Mistakes Once, during a momentary loss of reality, when Schaeuble voiced his desire to reduce the sessional expense allowance for his deputies, a furor ensued. Developmental politician Volkmar Koehler, an unflappable man who had never before lost his composure in the parliamentary caucus, was barely able to summon the right words: "Mr. Chairman, you have contributed to the disparagement of the members of parliament." But Schaeuble's mistakes do not cling to him. And no CDU member is able to explain this. They point to the obvious: "He is simply the only alternative to Kohl." The fact that his colleagues tend to overlook his mistakes also has something to do with the wheelchair. They do not want to assail anyone who is already so vulnerable. Parliamentary caucus meeting last Tuesday. The first following Christmas break. The 317 representatives are expecting encouragement for the big election year. How will we be able to pull it out again? Helmut Kohl is gone. And Schaeuble? He says that the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] now has the opportunity for the first time to come to power, and that the feeling of discontent with the coalition is great. Schaeuble believes that red-green no longer represents a nightmare to many voters. He presents his election campaign plan without emotion--not a trace of upheaval. The members of parliament had returned to Bonn from winter break in a bad humor, many slunk back into their offices as if they were boarding a sinking ship. Evenings, over wine, they philosophize on the virtues of the opposition. Herbert Werner expressed it in a nutshell: "For 22 years now I have sat here in the Bundestag. That was the gloomiest first meeting of the year I have ever sat through." The government, with Kohl at its pinnacle, is in the basement. And Schaeuble is not pulling it out. Coincidence? For a year now Schaeuble has again been able to drive a car. Only now are photographs of this appearing in the press. Confidants of the chancellor interpret the message: His handicap is no longer an obstacle--to anything. Coincidence? At the end of last week Schaeuble planned to announce to the public that in the union's view the economy is picking up. The CDU leadership discussed precisely this topic over the weekend. Schaeuble, the parliamentary caucus leader, wanted to be faster than the party headed by Kohl. His hard luck: His delegates remained at variance and the paper was not completed. The demonstration of leadership was dropped. Schaeuble speaks loyally of Kohl. Recently, as presidium members have noted with amusement, Schaeuble's loyalty has even been "a little maliciously euphoric." On Friday he disclosed to the SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG what the Germans have in Kohl: "a treasure." In December this read somewhat differently. At that time BILD asked him whether he thought the chancellor would give him his job in 1994. His answer: "Because I know Helmut Kohl very well, I know that he will put his great responsibility before his own opinions." No one has ever used nicer words to say that Kohl has become weary of his office. Schaeuble gave an ironic comment regarding newspaper reports of a putsch against Kohl: "I will be happy if I am not around for that." Michael Glos, CSU [Christian Social Union] land caucus leader and long-time colleague of Schaeuble, agrees with Kohl-Deputy Heinz Eggert: "He is too clever to overthrow the chancellor." And Solms knows what Schaeuble is also convinced of: "Only Kohl can decide when to leave office. No one can force it." This could change completely following the elections in Lower Saxony. If the CDU loses more than five percentage points in 10 weeks, as is feared by union strategists, the debate over the chancellor will be opened up. A whole group of parliamentarians are planning to call for Kohl's resignation. And they will be assisted by a tail wind from CDU land associations. Schaeuble has painted himself as an alternative. And then? Today his analysis of the situation remains cool: "The costs of a change would be too great." But no one is in a position to predict the dynamics of a debate over the chancellor following a clear defeat in a key election. If the representatives no longer see any chance of securing their own mandate with Kohl, and if they think Schaeuble would be their only salvation, then things would look bad for Kohl. Schaeuble has much to thank Kohl for. The chancellor was his sponsor, he gave him encouragement in the Reha Hospital in Langensteinbach. In terms of their human traits, the two are quite close. Already in 1989 Heiner Geissler was speaking with others about Kohl's demise. Schaeuble, on the contrary, is not Kohl's Brutus. He issues frontal attacks, when they are called for. If he thought the situation was serious enough that the CDU was on the verge of being swept down the river, he says, "I would discuss it with him." For Schaeuble it is a question of loyalty. "Otherwise I would feel like a blackguard." Schaeuble wants to nip in the bud speculation in the union that is a threat to him that he is purposefully seeking to overthrow Kohl in order to succeed him: "I do not want to become chancellor. I want to be spared this bitter cup." Once, in the fall of 1992, Kohl gave Schaeuble (and Volker Ruhe) a solemn warning. When the parliamentary caucus chairman, together with the east German CDU representatives, was moving for the investment loan, thus dragging Kohl into the scrape, many in the union considered it an indisputable fact that: "Schaeuble is pushing for a grand coalition." Kohl warned, hinting at the 1989 putsch: "Anyone who needs it may have a Bremen party congress." At that time the party penalized the putschists led by Lothar Spaeth. Schaeuble understood. Glos describes the consequences: "Schaeuble does not give Kohl an opportunity to suggest disloyalty." The shrewd analyst leaves nothing to chance. Certainly not his career. This fact is recalled even today by many colleagues. As parliamentary party secretary, Schaeuble exposed the weaknesses of Chancellery Minister Philipp Jenninger often enough. When Jenninger had to go, the succession went to Schaeuble as a matter of course. Then in the chancellery he diligently performed his apprentice work in a classic department under the watchful eyes of Kohl. In the Interior Ministry Schaeuble early on secured for himself the job of handling the number one issue: German unity. "How was it before with the Saarland? Who was in charge then?" he quizzed his officials. As was so often the case, Schaeuble already knew the answer: It was the minister of the interior who organized the reintegration of the Saarland. This made the whole thing clear: Chancellery Minister Rudolf Seiters, who was actually responsible for the operative Germany policy, remained outside. The subtitle of the Schaeuble book The Treaty then read "How I negotiated German unity." This irritated Kohl, the chancellor of unity, greatly. It is also notable that the representatives who initiated the demise of the then parliamentary caucus leader Alfred Dregger came from Schaeuble's Baden-Wuerttemberg land caucus. After the "accident" (Schaeuble seldom refers to it as an assassination attempt), Dregger was permitted to extend his stay in office for one year, after which he had to yield to Schaeuble. His positions have always been promotions for him--as if there were a cuckoo clock for careers. Today Schaeuble is slaving away. Decisions are no longer being made in the cabinet, but rather by the party and parliamentary caucus leaders in the coalition. Schaeuble is maneuvering and pushing. As Glos has noted, "He wants rapid results; Kohl is waiting for the wave to die down." Kohl is becoming a statesman, presiding more than governing. If things become too close then Schaeuble has to straighten them out. For some time now the parliamentary caucus leader has not restricted himself to governing. He is looking after the CDU image. Schaeuble knows that it is not enough on election day merely to present a list of accomplishments from the preceding four years. New issues must be addressed--and a clear definition of political course must be presented. At the Berlin party congress in September of 1992 Schaeuble announced his claim to political and spiritual leadership. He possessed key ideas for preventing a drift of disillusioned CDU voters toward the right: "national community," "patriotism," "fatherland," the state as a "protective community and community of destiny," German "normalcy," the family as the center of society, the well-armed state--Schaeuble intones Kohl's theme of a transition of power from 1982: the spiritual-moral transition. For some time now he has been preparing a strategy for making the two people's parties again distinguishable. Earlier, Schaeuble checked those who were backing conflict as a way to improve the CDU image: "If the government can no longer function, a clear outline of party policy will be of absolutely no use." Those days are gone. Today the parliamentary caucus leader quotes the successful election candidate Heiner Geissler: "We need to start a fight." If necessary, even in his own camp. That is why it no longer matters if Volker Ruehe criticizes Schaeuble's push for the domestic deployment of the Bundeswehr. It is more important to the party leader that SPD Party Chairman Rudolf Scharping falls into his trap, allowing himself to lose his head over a comparison with Spain's fascist dictator Franco. Schaeuble already has the next major issue of conflict up his sleeve: the privatization of responsibilities of the state. Very soon, financing of Germany's expressways will have to come from private sources. Citizens will then be required to pay for their use. This will provide relief for the budget and will help the environment. If the SPD rejects this, Schaeuble plans to hold them up as state-minded supporters of a planned economy. Schaeuble, the most effective speaker in parliament, long ago became the most threatening opponent of the SPD. He speaks more softly than he really needs to. He says things that cause the opposition to experience a moment of shock before it can catch its breath. Kohl for consensus, Schaeuble for upheaval. The parliamentary caucus leader has assumed Geissler's former role. He is closing the gap left by the Adenauer house. This is still true now. Sometimes it becomes a bit too much for him. Thus it is considered only logical that he would like to again put Geissler up against Scharping. His problem: The former general secretary is more devoted to the union than the SPD. The SPD continues to plot its course against Schaeuble. Parliamentary Secretary Peter Struck's attempt: "He has always been somewhere between conservative and reactionary." In addition: Schaeuble remained silent during the debate over the abortion paragraph 218, and maneuvered for a long time over the issue of right to asylum. A rightist? For the strategists, the results are generally more important than the means. "No good will result if in the end one has a clear conscience but has achieved nothing." So he allows the aspersions to bounce off of him: "Anyone who considers me a rightist must already be rather stupid." Scharping tried a different formula: "This man is driving the union into a nationalist-rightist corner with his callous nature." Callous? Nearly all members of the parliamentary caucus leadership have found Schaeuble to be more tolerant, composed, and sympathetic since the assassination attempt. The feeling is different, however, among those who are not so close to him. Schaeuble will never be a chummy type like Kohl. Beloved in public, respected in the parliamentary caucus. With Kohl the reverse is true. Schaeuble Defends Minorities. For example, Friedbert Pflueger. He finds "this new stereotype of callousness simply vicious." He says he feels "happy and motivated" under Schaeuble's leadership. Schaeuble explains relapses into arrogance with his "admittedly somewhat difficult to understand Baden humor." Nonetheless: Schaeuble has risen from superior to chairman. Now he may become chancellor. The parade can begin. [Box, p 20] Wolfgang Schaeuble on... Rudolf Scharping: A great deal of sympathy for the SPD party chairman He is a dangerous opponent, a very good party chairman for the SPD in its current condition. He has managed to give the SPD confidence. And he has succeeded in conveying to the people the idea of a transition in government as something undramatic. He does not have a great deal of depth. Hans-Ulrich Klose: Gets along well with the SPD parliamentary caucus leader I have a very high opinion of Hans-Ulrich Klose. He is one of the most intelligent individuals in the German Bundestag, while at the same time he is quite human. He worries: Will we be able to look ourselves in the eye later when we look back at what we have done? I think the same way. Helmut Kohl: Loyal to and friendly with the CDU chancellor He has what one needs to be chancellor: a thick skin. No other office is exposed to such attacks. And he has no tendency toward becoming a potentate, he has remained a relatively normal person. And he is a reliable friend--like few others. Wolfgang Schaeuble: Prefers to remain true to himself, the CDU parliamentary caucus leader I also hold him in high regard. I am not a split personality who is dissatisfied with himself. When one is in the political field one must also be a little overconfident, otherwise one will not be capable of making decisions. I lie seldom and poorly--and I do not like living with an unclean conscience. [Box, p 22] Desires and Fears--The Private Wolfgang Schaeuble --Epiphany is marked in red in Wolfgang Schaeuble's calendar. It was then that he lost a game of chess to his 19-year-old son Hans-Joerg for the first time. The perfectionist has a hard time dealing with losing. He said his wife is the same: "Ingeborg, she is a hopeless case." --Schaeuble has four children and two brothers. He is a family man. Even more so after the assassination attempt. "When you have had an experience like that, you know how important your family is." --There is a ramp in the new Bonn assembly hall. It is too steep for wheelchairs. If Schaeuble wants to go to the speaker's desk he must go down the ramp. A ride along a perilous precipice. If he brakes too sharply with his hands his vehicle will tip over. "I will carry this image with me for the rest of my days." --Wolfgang Schaeuble admires Vaclav Havel. Not least because of his power as a speaker. In September 1991 he visited the Czech president. In the Prague castle, however, there was no elevator. Only many stairs. And Havel lived upstairs. Upon arriving there the union member sighed: "Not my milieu." --From 20 centimeters below the chin upwards there is no trace of Schaeuble's disability. He keeps his balance with his arms. Two arms are need to play the violin. Schaeuble has taken it up. --Schaeuble is supposed to have grown embittered. Saxon Heinz Eggert, Helmut Kohl's deputy in the CDU party chairmanship, sees things differently: "I have seen disabled individuals who have comforted the high and mighty."
