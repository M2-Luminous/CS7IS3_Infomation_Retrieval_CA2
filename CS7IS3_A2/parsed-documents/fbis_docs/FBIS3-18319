According to government spokesman Dieter Vogel, the chancellor, with applause from the cabinet members, thanked Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and his staff for the great commitment they had displayed in the talks. According to Kohl, the entry into the European Union of the new countries will go down as a major event in European history. The Federal Government has a vital interest in the fact that the group of member countries is now increased by Austria and the Scandinavian countries.
