Although each ministry tries to build a new setup before the Diet session ends in late June, the arrangements may not be completed until July due to the confusion in politics. While many ministries are said to be concentrating on strengthening their organizations by seniority promotions this year amid the increasing criticism of bureaucrats, the personnel changes of some ministries are to be watched, such as the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], which was in an uproar over the issue of MITI's Industrial Policy Bureau Chief Masahisa Naito's resignation; the Ministry of Finance [MOF], which carries the major task of tax reform; and the Ministry of Construction [MOC], which is being criticized for general contractors scandals. This year's personnel appointments are likely to draw more attention than usual. MITI The dispute in which Naito was dismissed as Industrial Policy Bureau chief by MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai late last year for giving a preferential promotion to the son of Yuji Tanahashi, former MITI vice minister, still casts a blight over the ministry, and its personnel appointments for June is quite uncertain. At this point, the chances are that Administrative Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano (entered the ministry in 1960; hereafter, the numbers in parenthesis indicates the year the person became a bureaucrat) will remain in office and work to settle the confusion. In this case, Kumano's contemporary, Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice minister; Tomio Tsutsumi (1962), who succeeded Naito as Industrial Policy Bureau chief; and Yoshihiro Sakamoto (1962), chief of the International Trade Policy Bureau, are all expected to stay in their posts. On the other hand, in and outside the ministry, there is a view that Kumano will resign to take responsibility for the situation. In this case, the personnel changes will be fluid, but, a plan to shift Okamatsu to the vice minister's post is most likely. Nevertheless, there is another view that Tsutsumi, who heads the Industrial Policy Bureau, will be promoted to administrative vice minister, a normal practice since a deputy vice minister becoming an administrative vice minister has no precedent. In either scenario, Hideki Osada (1963), director general of the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency, and Wataru Aso (1963), director general of the Patent Office, who are in MITI's extra-ministerial bureaus, are likely to retire voluntarily. There is a possibility that Tetsuo Nakata (1964), chief of the Defense Agency's Equipment Bureau, will be appointed director general of the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency; and Hisashi Hosokawa (1964), chief of MITI's Basic Industries Bureau, will be appointed director general of the Patent Office. In this case, Tadashi Ezaki (1965), director general for MITI Minister's Policy Coordination Secretariat is the candidate to succeed Hosokawa as Basic Industries Bureau chief. The post of Akira Takashima (1963), chief of the Industrial Location and Environmental Protection Bureau, is also expected to be replaced. Tsutomu Makino (1963), director of the MITI Secretariat, is likely to stay in his post, but in case of his replacement, the promotion of Osamu Watanabe (1964), chief of the Machinery and Information Industries Bureau, to Makino's post is most likely. Then, Watanabe will be succeeded by Katsuhiro Nakagawa (1965), chief of the International Trade Administration Bureau, and Nakagawa's post will be taken over by Hisamitsu Arai (1966), deputy chief of the Machinery and Information Industries Bureau. MOC To continue to reorganize the construction administration, which has been criticized even more due to the recent bribery scandals involving general contractors, Shigeo Mochizuki (1959), administrative vice minister of construction, is very likely to remain in office. The [MOC] has a custom of appointing officials specializing in technology and those in administration to the post of administrative vice minister by turns. So if Mochizuki, who is an administrative specialist, does not retire, the next vice minister candidate, Haruho Fujii (1962), vice minister of engineering affairs, who is technological specialist; and the next candidate but one, MOC Secretariat Director Noboru Ban (1963), who is from the administrative side, will stay in their posts. In that case, the personnel changes will mainly concern bureau chief level officials, and be relatively minor. However, a possibility still exists for a major personnel change if voices to hold MOC executives responsible for the scandals increase. National Land Agency Ichiro Ichikawa (1961), administrative vice minister of national land, will retire voluntarily after the current Diet session ends, and Secretariat Director Kazuhito Fujiwara (1962) will be promoted to the vice minister's position. In principle, the vice minister's post is held by officials from the MOC and the MOF alternately. MOC Housing Bureau chief Yasuhisa Mitsui (1963) will succeed Fujiwara, who was from the MOF, as director of the Secretariat, and prepare for next year's appointment to the vice minister's seat. Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Administrative Vice Minister Futoshi Shirai (1959) is going to retire voluntarily. Telecommunications Bureau Chief Haruki Matsuno (1960), who has been taking the lead in creating an environment for the multimedia age, is certain to become Shirai's successor. Communications Policy Bureau chief Mitsuo Igarashi (1963) will probably be appointed Telecommunications Bureau chief, which is the position for a vice-minister-to-be official. Postal Savings Bureau chief Akemi Yamaguchi (1963) and General Councilor Masahito Tani (1964), who was responsible for the talks over cellular phones (automobile and hand-held phones) between Japan and the United States, are among the list for the post of Communication Policy Bureau chief. International Affairs Department chief Yoshio Utsumi (1966) will be the next general councilor. Postal Bureau chief Tadaaki Arai (1965) and Secretariat Director Tsuyoshi Kimura (1966) are likely to stay in their posts. Ministry of Foreign Affairs Kunihiko Saito (1958), who took the office of administrative vice minister last August, is likely to remain in his post. While there are voices hoping for Treaties Bureau chief Minoru Tanba (1962) to remain in his post because of the DPRK's nuclear development issue, he will be transferred overseas as ambassador around summer because his service at home has been long. Masaki Orita (1965), consul general to Hong Kong, is likely to succeed Tanba. Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Upon completion of the Uruguay Round, executives, such as the administrative vice minister and Food Agency director general, were already replaced. Although the retirement of Deputy Vice Minister Jiro Shiwaku (1959), who was responsible for the [Uruguay Round] negotiations, is postponed to the end of May, Economic Affairs Bureau chief Takeki Manabe (1963) has been informally appointed to Shiwaku's post. Livestock Industry Bureau chief Hisao Azuma (1964) is expected to be the next Economic Affairs Bureau chief. Science and Technology Agency Administrative Vice Minister Takuya Hirano (1959), who has been in office for two years this June, will retire voluntarily, and he will be succeeded by Kenichi Murakami (1960), deputy vice minister of scientific councilors, who will be the third administrative vice minister in a row from within the Science and Technology Agency. Katsuhisa Ida (1962), director of the Secretariat, and Fujio Sakauchi (1962), director of the National Institute of Science and Technology Policy, are candidates for deputy vice minister of scientific councilors.
