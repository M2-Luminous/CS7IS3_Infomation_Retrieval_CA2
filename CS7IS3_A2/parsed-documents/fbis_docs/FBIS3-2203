The billion-dollar AIG (American International Group) Asian Infrastructure Fund, originally promoted and invested by AIG, is to provide equity financing for major Chinese infrastructure projects in the transport, telecommunications, and power sectors, said Qureshi, a former World Bank and IMF executive. Half the fund will be invested in China, while the other half will be concentrated on Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, he added. As well as AIG, the main investor in the 10-year fund is the Singapore government which has injected 250 million dollars through various subsidiaries. The first closing of the Bermuda-based fund has just been completed in Singapore to the tune of 760 million dollars, Qureshi said, adding that the second closing in a few months time would bring the fund's resources to at least one billion dollars. China's international investment arm, the China International Trust and Investment Corp. (CITIC) -- another major investor in the fund, will act as a local adviser together with the Bank of China. The participation of U.S. pension funds, endowment plans, and insurance companies in the scheme signals a changing trend in capital flow with long-term investors beginning to target developing countries, Qureshi said. "This represents a sea change in the willingness of long-term investors to venture out into developing countries," he said, adding that China's rapid economic growth coupled with the problem of transport bottlenecks provided "important opportunities" for infrastructure investment here. Following talks with Chinese officials, Qureshi said the fund was looking to invest in certain railway links and pilot projects aimed at opening up China's telecommunications sector. "We have also been specifically asked to consider the expressway that links Beijing with the capital of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang, and four or five power projects." Some 80 percent of the funds resources will be invested in the telecommunications, power and transport sectors alone, he added.
