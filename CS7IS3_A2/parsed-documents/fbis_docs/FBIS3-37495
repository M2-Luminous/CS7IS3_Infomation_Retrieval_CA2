Referring to the opinion of experts from the Russian Economics Ministry, the newspaper writes: "The government now collects only 60-65 per cent of all taxes due for payment, which is clearly below the average of other countries. We have to achieve the receipt of up to 80 per cent of taxes to the state budget". In the opinion of specialists from the American Heritage fund, income taxes from working people should be cut. Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin believes that "to introduce new taxes now means to aggravate conditions for economic activities and to increase mistrust of tax legislation". The TRUD newspaper writes that the recent visits by Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik and Public Education Minister Yevgeniy Tkachenko to the Kuznetsk coal basin in Siberia somewhat defused the explosive situation there. At the same time, the newspaper notes that the question on a strike by coal miners and other workers remains open in that area. For instance, 60 per cent of workers employed by light industry enterprises have nothing to do: warehouses are packed with ready-made goods, while trading firms prefer to buy imports. Every third builder went on a forced leave: customers have no money to pay for the work done. "Some 20,000 projects stand partially built," the newspaper notes. Appraising the work done by the cabinet of former Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar, prominent economist Nikolay Shmelev writes in the newspaper that "the reformers went too far". To change the situation in the country, it is necessary "to start, at long last, to conduct a stiff industrial policy", he claims. The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper writes on the same topic, noting that "the long-term programme for production of weaponry and the government financial support for the conversion of the munitions industry" remain a headache for the government. According to the newspaper, it is unprofitable up to this time to fill government military orders: they are paid at ridiculously low prices. The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper claims that the explosive social and economic situation in Russia can be explained, among other things, by the fact that the government has no action programme. The PRAVDA newspaper notes that the situation in the Russian economy is very difficult after two years of "shock therapy". "It would be an empty talk to speak about stabilisation in the country," the newspaper adds. According to PRAVDA, the course of Russian reforms "needs immediate adjustments". The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper features an exclusive interview with Bundeswehr General Inspector Klaus Naumann who claims that the armed forces of Russia and Germany can cooperate in future. In his opinion, the two countries "play an important, if not decisive, role" in creating a system of European security. The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes about a spectre of a new cold war in connection with NATO's decision to use force if Bosnian Serbs do not withdraw heavy weaponry from the Sarajevo area. "Russia, put before another difficult choice, tries to remain its own self," the newspaper writes. "The NATO ultimatum is declared 'illegitimate' and at variance with U.N. decisions. The newspaper notes that the recent illness "has not weakened the political will of the Russian President who warned that 'some people try to resolve the Bosnian question without Russia. We shall not permit this'". PRAVDA front-pages a report on fanning up anti-Russian sentiments in Estonia. It points to a recent "resolute protest" by the Estonian parliament against allegedly "rising imperialist trends in Russia's foreign policy".
