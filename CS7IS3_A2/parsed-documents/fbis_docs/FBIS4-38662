At a meeting with U.S. congressmen led by Senator Sam Nunn, he dwelt upon Russian arms exports to Iran which are causing western concern. "Let us work together over the rules of weapons exports (to third countries)", Kozyrev said. "Asking Russia to undertake commitment not to export weapons(to Iran) unilaterally as a condition for talks on the issue is not only out of line with the spirit of partnership with our western allies, but it also brings to mind the worst in our common history", he said. About Nagorno-Karabakh, the minister said that Russia was alone prepared to send peacekeepers to that area of conflict poisoning the situation on both sides of the Caucasus and posing threat to its southern fringes. "Meanwhile, we are being accused of neo-imperialism on the grounds that a political solution must be found to the conflict before sending peacekeepers to the region", he said. Kozyrev said that instead of the assistance Moscow would welcome, the West preferred to act as inspector driving in a wedge in efforts by Russia and the CSCE to try to settle the conflict. "This is not a partnership approach", he said. For details, refer to Diplomatic Panorama of May 31.
