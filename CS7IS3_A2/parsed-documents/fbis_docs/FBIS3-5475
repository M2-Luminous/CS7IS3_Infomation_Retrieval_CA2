The program calls for spending 430 trillion yen on public works projects from fiscal 1991 to 2000 to stimulate domestic demand. The Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), in a recommendation to the government, proposed income tax cuts for two consecutive years through a revision of the tax system. The federation also urged the government to set a target for reduction of Japan's huge current account surplus to a certain proportion of its gross domestic product. It stressed the need for Japan to promote the opening of its market and economic deregulation. The federation urged private corporations for their own efforts to expand imports. Masaru Hayami, head of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), called on Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Monday and submitted a list of proposals for restructuring Japan-U.S. relations, association officials said. They said the proposals included an increase in spending on public works projects by more than 100 trillion yen over the next 10 years and bringing down the level of Japan's current account surplus to about 2.0 percent of its gross domestic product.
