The reason for these statements is the establishment by the Sejm Foreign Affairs Committee of an extraordinary subcommittee, whose task is to evaluate the condition of the cadres in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MSZ]. The subcommittee was set up through the votes of the deputies of the governing coalition and the Union of Labor party. Deputies of Democratic Union refused to take part in the subcommittee's work; the establishment of the subcommittee was criticized by the Deputies' Club of the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms. According to Olechowski, the decision establishing the subcommittee infringes upon the powers of the minister of foreign affairs. Also at a meeting with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy the minister expressed his sorrow at the fact that it had been set up. There were rumors in the Sejm building that the entire subcommittee affair might lead to a conflict between the coalition and the Belweder. It was speculated that, if the coalition had received the post of a deputy minister in the MSZ, which it demanded, the subcommittee would probably not have been established. Tadeusz Iwinski, deputy of the Democratic Left Alliance, denied this information. He believes that the committee will help select the right people for the MSZ posts, such as the posts of ambassadors. He also said that, in recent years, many candidates without the right qualifications have been appointed to these posts.
