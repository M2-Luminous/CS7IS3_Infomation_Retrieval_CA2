These accidents differ substantially from the circumstances that caused the catastrophe in the completely different type of reactor in Chernobyl, according to the reply to a written question from the group "Alliance 90/The Greens." The tests were preceded by lengthy and thorough preparations and had been approved by the authorities. The experimental core meltdown was taking place in a test capsule which is placed in the core of the research reactor and screened from the effects of heat and pressure. According to the federal government, the reactor supplied only the neutron radiation of the test capsule required for the experiment. The radioactive substances produced in this capsule would be discharged from the reactor in pipelines. Their behavior would then be examined in pipelines and containers representing on a smaller scale the primary circuit and the safety vessels of light water reactor nuclear power stations. The experiment was being carried out to identify all the chemical and physical processes that are important for fission product behavior. The data will be used to test and if necessary, improve computer programs with which extremely unlikely accident courses with core meltdowns can be described. The purpose of these programs was to analyze the cause of accidents in nuclear power plants and to assess the efficiency of countermeasures. Control over the test procedure would be guaranteed by temperature measuring points which do not heat up outside the screened test facility. The project is being funded by institutions from France (55 percent), Japan, South Korea, and the USA (together 15 percent) and the Commission of the European Community (30 percent).
