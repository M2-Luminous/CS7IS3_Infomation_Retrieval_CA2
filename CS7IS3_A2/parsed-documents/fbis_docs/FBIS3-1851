Tourism is now one of Anhui's major industries. Most tourist attractions are located in the southern part of the province, where Huangshan and Jiuhuashan Mountains and Taiping Lake are located. In recent years Anhui's tourism has been developing at a high speed, with more tourist spots such as crocodile ponds, and monkey and deer islands opened, hotels built and cableways put into operation. In 1993 Anhui successfully held several tourism festivals, which were also designed for business promotion and to attract investment. Foreign diplomats were also invited to visit the tourism sites.
