First disclosed in AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, Blaauw's evidence was the the subject of a MAIL & GUARDIAN front page story last week, which called into question De Klerk's assertion last year that South Africa had not acquired nuclear weapons technology or material from another country, or provided another country with nuclear materials. Reacting to the expose, De Klerk insisted that South Africa's procurement of 30g of tritium from Israel, and its provision of yellow cake uranium to Israel, were not part of collaboration between the countries on nuclear and conventional weapons. His statement was endorsed by Atomic Energy Corporation chief Waldo Stumpf. Cape Supreme Court documents make it clear that Blaauw was the government's key intermediary in sensitive military deals with Israel, including those involving tritium and yellow cake. It was General Hendrik van den Bergh, head of the Bureau for State Security (Boss) who personally asked Blaauw to get tritium, according to the documents. They note that the 30g Blaauw ultimately secured "was sufficient for the manufacture of 12 atomic bombs". The tritium shipments were so sensitive that ranking South African and Israeli officials accompanied the 12 air shipments of the gaseous substance, and the heads of both governments were notified each time a shipment was successfully completed, according to the newly published book CRITICAL MASS by U.S. journalists William Burrows and Robert Windrem. Much of what South African officials withheld from the public was told to the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is charged with verifying the government's compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. According to a confidential IAEA document -- it bears the identifying numbers GOV/2684 and 93-03174 -- South Africa's Atomic Energy Corporation "received some tritium in 1977, but after the withdrawal of a small sample for the verification of its quality, the material remained in store until 1987". During that time, according to the IAEA document, South Africa was engaged in "theoretical and practical" research on "lithium-6 separation for the production of tritium for possible future use in boosted devices". The government also did the preliminary engineering work on a reactor -- "to be built at a site at Gouriqua, near Mossel Bay" -- to produce and recover plutonium and tritium, says the IAEA, repeating information provided by the De Klerk administration. It adds: "In September 1985 the South African government decided to...stop all work related to possible plutonium devices and to limit the production of lithium-6, but to allow further development work on implosion technology and theoretical work on more advanced devices." The 1985 date seems compellingly to coincide with the refusal of international financial organisations to roll over their loans to South Africa. It is reasonable to infer that if sanctions had not started to bite, the South African Government would have built an advanced nuclear device whose only purpose could be to attack--or threaten--nations within range of its surface-to-surface ballistic missiles. Even after putting its advanced weapons programme on ice, South Africa kept the tritium for another two years. With extensive Israeli help, it worked on developing its own versions of Israel's Jericho missiles. After the two countries jointly tested a South African Jericho clone from the Overberg test range in July 1989, U.S. officials told reporters that one of the several missiles Israel was helping South Africa develop was intended for delivering nuclear warheads. Last year De Klerk asserted that South Africa only planned to make seven crude nuclear weapons and only intended the six which were actually made as a "deterrent". This purportedly meant testing a bomb in order to blackmail Washington to save the established order from "total onslaught". At an international conference last weekend to discuss future nuclear policy for South Africa, the head of the ANC's [African National Congress] science and technology department, Roger Jardine, slammed De Klerk's "list of lies" about South Africa's nuclear weapons programme. He called for the nuclear industry to be opened to full public scrutiny.
