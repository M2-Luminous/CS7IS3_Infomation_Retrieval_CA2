Juan Jose Gutierrez, Guatemalan Chamber of Industry president and Fecaica Guatemalan representative, said: "Aside from the treaty signed between Mexico and Costa Rica, we believe that as the Central American countries negotiate bilateral treaties with Mexico, they are jeopardizing the integration process, which is still fragile." Carlos Enrique Rivera, Fecaica executive director; Luis Mejia, Salvadoran Industrialists Association president; and Gutierrez himself reported that one of the most important resolutions of the bimonthly Fecaica meeting was the need to negotiate any commercial treaty as a bloc. We believe the efforts and work of so many years would be lost, and Central America would not be able to subsist without integration," added Gutierrez, also president of the Pollo Campero restaurant chain. Fecaica representatives urged their Nicaraguan counterparts to "accompany Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador in negotiating with Mexico, which, in their opinion, will benefit Nicaragua. In addition, they said Nicaragua can negotiate preferential aspects that Mexico has offered . Fecampco Agrees Rivera added that the Federation of Central American Chambers of Commerce (Fecampo) and the Federation of Export Chambers (Fecaexca) agreed to support Fecaica's joint declaration in the sense that negotiations with third countries will be carried out jointly, not on a bilateral basis. Fecaica representatives met on 20 May with Salvadoran Economy Minister Enrique Cordova, who informed the Central American industrialists of the progress made in negotiations with Mexico. Another Fecaica resolution deals with the deadline the governments have established for signing the treaty, which is supposedly set for December of this year. In that sense, Leonel Mejia, president of ASI [Salvadoran Industrialists Association], said "signing a treaty quickly does not make it good." Upon returning from a meeting with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Salvadoran President-elect Armando Calderon Sol recently announced his intention to sign a treaty with Mexico before the end of this year, if possible.
