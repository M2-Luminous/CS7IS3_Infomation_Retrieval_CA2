FR940826-2-00056 FR940826-2-00046 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Secretary [Docket No. D&hyph;94-1069; FR&hyph;3748] Delegation and Redelegation of Authority; Offices of the Assistant Secretaries for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity and Public and Indian Housing AGENCY: Office of the Secretary; Offices of the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) and the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing (PIH), HUD. ACTION: Notice of delegation and redelegation of authority. SUMMARY: This notice delegates and redelegates authority from the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to certain HUD officials to grant time extensions to Public Housing Agencies and Indian Housing Authorities (HAs) to complete structural changes to dwelling units, in compliance with the regulation at 24 CFR 8.25(c). This regulation implements Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794 et seq. ), with regard to program accessibility for individuals with disabilities. The Act prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. The authority to grant a time extension is jointly delegated to both the Assistant Secretary for FHEO and the Assistant Secretary for PIH. This authority is then retained and jointly redelegated to both the Director, Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Division, and to either the Director, Public Housing Division (in the case of a Public Housing Agency) or the Administrator, Office of Native American Programs (in the case of an Indian Housing Authority), in the pertinent field offices. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 15, 1994: FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William C. Thorson, Director, Maintenance and Supply Division, Office of Construction, Rehabilitation and Maintenance, Office of Public and Indian Housing, telephone (202) 708&hyph;4703, Deborah Lalancette, Director, Housing Management Division, Office of Native American Programs, Office of Public and Indian Housing, telephone (202) 708&hyph;2980, or Judith Keeler, Director, Office of Program Compliance and Disability Rights, Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, telephone (202) 708&hyph;2618 (voice/TDD) , Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 7th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. [These are not toll-free numbers.] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The regulation at 24 CFR 8.25(c) requires each Public Housing Agency (PHA) and Indian Housing Authority (IHA) (collectively referred to as HAs) to assess the need for dwelling units within its jurisdictional area which are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Where the assessment demonstrates a need for additional accessible units, the HA must develop a transition plan to achieve the necessary structural changes. In accordance with this regulation, each HA is to have already made such assessment, and developed a transition plan, if required. 24 CFR 8.25(c) provides that each HA must have completed the structural changes necessary to achieve accessibility as identified in the transition plan no later than July 11, 1992. However, the regulation also provides that an HA may obtain an extension of time in meeting this deadline under certain circumstances. Section 8.25(c) provides that the Assistant Secretary for FHEO and the Assistant Secretary for PIH may extend the deadline to as late a date as July 11, 1994 ``on a case-by-case determination that compliance within that period would impose undue financial and administrative burdens on the operation of the recipient's public housing and multi-family Indian housing program''. This regulation further provides that the Secretary or the Undersecretary may extend the time period for compliance from July 11, 1994, up until July 11, 1995, in ``extraordinary circumstances''. To facilitate the prompt review of each request, the Secretary is jointly delegating to the Assistant Secretaries for FHEO and PIH, and the Assistant Secretaries are jointly redelegating to certain officials in the field, the authority to grant an extension of time in ``extraordinary circumstances'' for an HA to complete these structural changes. Accordingly, the Secretary delegates, and the Assistant Secretaries for FHEO and PIH redelegate, authority as follows:
