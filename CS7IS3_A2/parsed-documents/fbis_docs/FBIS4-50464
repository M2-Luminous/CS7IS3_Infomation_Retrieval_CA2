The meeting reviewed and summed up Shanghai's economic development, reform, and opening in the first quarter and made plans for the work in the second quarter. Mayor Huang Ju made an important speech at the meeting. First of all, he affirmed various achievements accomplished by the city government during the first quarter. He said that Shanghai achieved marked results in seizing opportunities, deepening reform, opening up, promoting development, and maintaining a stable situation by carrying out the goals, principles, and tasks put forward by the second plenary session of the sixth municipal CPC committee and the second session of the tenth municipal people's congress. He said: Shanghai carried out various tasks this year under an unprecedented situation in which reform was extensively implemented, interests were widely readjusted, and new situations and problems continuously cropped up. Shanghai had a good start in carrying out this year's work because the city, under the leadership of the municipal CPC committee and government, wasted no time in unifying thinking, made good plans for the work of all fronts, and promoted a thorough work style. Shanghai continued to maintain a fairly rapid speed in developing the national economy. In the first quarter, it created 42.05 billion yuan of gross national product, an increase of 13.1 percent over the same period last year. Its total industrial output value reached 87.05 billion yuan, representing an increase of 13.9 percent over the same period last year. Its exports increased month by month, with an increase of 19.9 percent over the same period last year. Its economic efficiency increased simultaneously, with a fairly large increase in local revenues. Shanghai's economic structure improved. For the first time, the value added of its tertiary industry was higher than that of its secondary industry. Its new pillar industries enjoyed rapid growth. Its high-standard urban construction made good progress, with major projects including the inner traffic link, the overall renovation of People's Square, the First Line Subway, and the Tongfang Mingzhu Television Tower all proceeding smoothly. The 7-million-square meter housing project which is expected to be completed by the end of this year was in full swing. The work to remove houses from the area where the Chengdu Road Viaduct will be built was basically completed. In terms of utilizing foreign funds, Shanghai maintained fairly good momentum, with a marked increase in the use of foreign funds for industrial and new high technology projects. With the growth of Pudong district, the gross national product of this new district was 9 percent higher than that of the city itself. We achieved results in coordinating and promoting reform, development, and stability. A multilayer and multichannel poverty relief program was gradually institutionalized, thus laying a fine foundation for the stability of society. Huang Ju emphatically said: While fully affirming the results, we should clearly recognize some new and outstanding contradictions existing in the city's economic life. We should also attain a complete understanding of some temporary difficulties cropping up in the course of our reform and opening drive. Faced with these new challenges, we should have a scientific attitude and the courage to overcome them. We should be good at exploring new methods. We should be persistent and move ahead so as to promote to a new height the city's work in all aspects. While talking about the second quarter's work, Huang Ju said: The key to promoting the overall interests of reform, development, and stability as well as to carrying out the current work lies in two things: first, persisting in the promotion of reform, opening up, and economic development; and second, persisting in alleviating problems and enhancing social stability. He urged cadres at all levels to further emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, correctly deal with the relations between reform, development, and stability, and strive to maintain a good economic growth rate by producing quality commodities which can find ready markets and by enhancing economic efficiency. We should take the overall situation into account and strengthen comprehensive coordination so as to fulfill all quotas for national economic and social development set for the first half of 1994. We should strive to fulfill the second quarter's work ahead of schedule and lay a solid foundation for realizing this year's goal. Huang Ju put forward seven requirements for the second quarter's work as follows: First, it is necessary to treat marketing as a primary task in Shanghai's current economic work. We should seize the opportunities and actively expand the domestic market, in accordance with the requirement of promoting a socialist market economy and gearing our work toward the country as a whole. We should take active measures to readjust our marketing measures. Instead of waiting for customers to come to Shanghai, we should go out and set up shops across the country. Instead of doing business as a small merchant or peddler, we should engage in a large-scale goods trade. In this way, we can provide better service to the country as a whole, particularly to the hinterland and rural areas. Meanwhile, continued efforts should be made to expand foreign markets. We should spare no efforts in carrying out the "dragon head plan" for foreign trade. We should attach importance to foreign-funded enterprises and help them increase export earnings. We should tap and bring the role of village and town enterprises' potential into play. Second, regarding the utilization of foreign investment, we should tackle thorny problems. We should show enthusiasm and initiative, compete for projects, and strive to locate a new breakthrough point through which we can open wider to the outside world. Third, we should earnestly intensify work to raise and distribute funds, improve our efficiency in utilizing funds, and ensure that we reach our goals for economic growth, particularly concerning progress in key projects. Fourth, on the one hand, we should focus on these three key supplementary points: key products and backbone industries which show prospects for development, village and town industries in rural areas, and joint investments by big state-owned enterprises; on the other, we should focus on helping some state-owned enterprises surmount difficulties, and strive to maintain the favorable trend for industrial development. Fifth, we should unswervingly, and actively but steadily, push forward the deepening of reform and open up wider to the outside world. We should experiment with the modern enterprise system and with innovations in the enterprise organization system, accelerate the construction of a modern market system, and conduct relevant studies and concentrate our energies on developing central commercial districts, on promoting joint investments by state-owned large backbone enterprises, and on supporting policy measures which promote "Chinese-Chinese-foreign" investment in village and town enterprises. We should also continue to expand our experiments on the shareholding system and actively develop the shareholding cooperative system. Sixth, we should galvanize the whole municipality into action and whip up an upsurge in turning our municipality into a national hygienic municipality. Our general objective is to basically build a national hygienic municipality this year and fully complete the relevant efforts next year. To achieve this, governments at all levels must list this as an important item on their agenda, which is a great undertaking with an impact on the image of Shanghai in reform and opening up and on the construction of a modern international metropolis, and a practical task which will effectively improve people's lives and work environment. We should implement the leadership responsibility system; set our sights on accomplishing our work in time for "May 1st," "July 1st," and National Day; and launch comprehensive activities to make improvements in a well-planned, systematic way, focusing on one aspect at a time. We should extensively mobilize the entire society to participate in and support our "construction" work so that the concept of "making Shanghai cleaner and prettier" takes root in the heart of people and becomes known to all. Seventh, we should seize the initiative to do work, provide prompt instructions, resolve conflicts, and maintain social stability. Right now, cadres at all levels, particularly principal leading cadres, should regard the effort to preserve social stability and ensure safety in all quarters as a major task. We should be adept at discerning public sentiments and at resolving conflicts promptly, further deepen campaigns to "show care," and conduct relevant efforts on a regular basis and systematically. We should also combine our efforts with ideological and political work and actually carry out work to overcome difficulties at various levels. In summing up his speech, Huang Ju said emphatically: Cadres at all levels in the municipality must fulfill their duty and responsibility, judge the hour and size up the situation, work in full cooperation with unity of purpose, thoroughly plan their work, be single-minded, and ensure that the favorable trend in economic and social development is maintained in Shanghai. Attending the meeting were vice mayors, and responsible persons from various committees, general offices, bureaus, and district and county governments. Vice Mayor Xie Lijuan made arrangements for the construction of a national hygienic municipality. Also invited to the meeting were responsible persons of the municipal people's congress, the municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and relevant authorities.
