Our formidible party, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], which represents the oppressed masses, is celebrating the 28th anniversary of its creation. On this day we want to pay homage to all our heroes who have fallen along the way. On this day we would like to remember with special tenderness and profound grief the most illustrious figures in our struggle, notably former UNITA Vice President Jeremias Chitunda, UNITA Secretary General Mango Paulo Alicerces, and Engineer Elias Salupeto Pena. 2. We would like to thank all who have supported our party for helping resist the most brutal and irrational offensive by the enemy, together with its foreign allies, in 1992 and 1993. 3. We want to congratulate all renewed resistance forces that have kept our glorious flag of the Black Cockerel flying, fanned by the winds of hope of an Angola that will not surrender. 4. In the wake of intense consultations between the UNITA Party leadership and the Lusaka-based negotiating team that came to Huambo, UNITA President Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi is only expected to talk to the nation on 16 March. 5. After four hours of talks with Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola, in the city of Huambo on 12 March, UNITA President Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi told his colleagues in the UNITA Political Commission the following words with that particular conviction he is renowned for, quote, peace and national reconciliation will be achieved in Lusaka. UNITA has not fought for 28 years just for the sake of securing some ministries. Our UNITA Party will be defended against all moves aimed at its destruction.
