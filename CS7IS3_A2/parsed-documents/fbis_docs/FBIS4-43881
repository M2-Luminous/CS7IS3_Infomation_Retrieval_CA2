As Foreign Minister De Marco said in an interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, Malta can strengthen the European Union [EU]. De Marco is hoping that negotiations on his country's accession to the European Union will start at the end of this year or in early 1995. [passage omitted] After the conservatives took power from the Labor Party seven years ago (the electoral law had meanwhile been changed, so that the party that received the most votes also got a majority in parliament), they submitted a membership application in July 1990. In June 1993, Brussels noted that Malta fulfilled the conditions for EU membership, but posed certain conditions: The economy, which was oriented along socialist models under the preceding Labor rule, had to be modified through comprehensive reform. De Marco, who is also deputy government head, believes that important conditions have been fulfilled now and that the question is no longer whether Malta will join, but when it will do so. To prove this, the foreign minister refers to efforts for economic opening: Important business branches have been liberalized, manufacturing industries restructured, services promoted. According to official figures, 4.5 percent of the population who are fit to work are without jobs, and a considerable economic growth was achieved last year. At the beginning of next year, Malta will unilaterally lift duties toward the EU, compensating for the loss in revenues by a value-added tax, which has not existed on Malta so far. Under these conditions, negotiations should "not be very complicated," De Marco said. Even today, three-fourths of the country's foreign trade is with the EU. It is widely assumed that EU membership would seal Malta's departure from the officially nonaligned and neutral, yet in fact sometimes fickle and anti-Western, course that was pursued during the 16 years of Labor government. Under Prime Minister Dom Mintoff, Malta concluded cooperation agreements with Moscow, Beijing, and even Tripoli, with which it used to cooperate temporarily in the military arena. [passage omitted] Even though, according to government calculations, economic advantages will outweigh the disadvantages (fishery and some industrial branches are regarded as problem areas), Malta is trying to take this step mainly for political reasons. De Marco says the concept of nonalignment was "outdated" after the end of the East-West antagonism. [passage omitted] To be firmly anchored in the EU will offer Malta security, while neutrality without any affiliation can be dangerous. A few days ago, when he was the first representative of his country to have the honor to address the Western European Union in Brussels, the foreign minister said about the defense organization of the Europeans: "We accept this responsibility not only as another element of the common set of laws, to which all Europeans have to be committed, but also as part of the political finality that we share with our European partners." Even though a small country, Malta is of strategic importance, Marco said in the interview. Cooperation between the North and South, and thus the "question of the Mediterranean," are shifting into the center of international politics. Malta has been one of the first countries to point out that European security is inseparably linked with the Mediterranean. Malta is taking part in the dialogue between the countries on the southern and northern shores of the Mediterranean, it is pursuing the objective of a Conference for Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean (CSCM), to be modeled after the CSCE, as well as a Mediterranean Council, modeled after the Council of Europe. "The Mediterranean will determine Malta's future as it has determined its history." The foreign minister is convinced that Malta's voice will be heard in the EU. [passage omitted] De Marco said he understood that the EU must first "digest" Austria's accession and -- after positive referendums in those countries -- those of Finland, Sweden, and Norway before it will be Malta's turn. Finally, the minister emphasized that "positive signals" from Brussels could strengthen his government's dynamism aimed at EU accession. Contrary to the government party, the Labor Party is against Malta's EU membership and has called for close ties. In the view of the Labor Party, such ties should permit the country to benefit from cooperation with Europe while it would not have to fear the disadvantages of EU membership.
