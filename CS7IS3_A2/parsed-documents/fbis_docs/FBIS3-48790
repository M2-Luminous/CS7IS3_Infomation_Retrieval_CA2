Japan will maintain an outline of bilateral support, such as the $1.8 billion in aid that Japan promised to Russia in April. However, as for emergency and humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies, the Foreign Ministry will carefully select Russian Government agencies eligible for such aid and study whether aid is needed at all. This was disclosed by a senior Foreign Ministry official on the morning of 21 January. As for the plan to review economic aid to Russia, the same official pointed out that "we have no choice but to scale down the monetary and financial measures of the past" because of the resignation of Gaydar, first deputy prime minister and economic minister, who had been promoting the radical introduction of a market economy, and former Deputy Prime Minister Fedorov's refusal to become a cabinet member. He also explained that some people are concerned about the possibility that the escalating trend in Russia of seeking "major-power chauvinism" may create "antipathy against `handouts' termed humanitarian aid."
