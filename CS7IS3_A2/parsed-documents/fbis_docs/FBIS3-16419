The plan provides for 19 bills to be drafted and submitted for the consideration of the state duma, the parliament's lower house. The bills on the list include several draft laws worked out on the basis of provisions of the presidential message to the Federal Assembly. These are a draft law "On Russia's Free Economic Zones", "On Participation of Russian Military Contingents in Peacekeeping Missions, Including Within the CIS, CSCE and UN Framework", "On International Treaties of the Russian Federation", On the Status of Foreigners in Russia, and "On Higher and Post-Graduate Professional Education". The Federation Council also suggests drafting laws "on Federal Bodies of State Power", "On a Procedure for Implementation of the Federative Treaty and Delimitation of Powers", "Basic Principles of Legislation on Veterans", "On Federated Arrangement of the Russian Federation", and "On the Status of a Subject of the Russian Federation". Addressing the gathering with a report, the House's First Deputy Speaker Ramazan Abdulatipov proposed setting up a scientific coordinating body to coordinate legislative activities by both chambers of the Russian Parliament. The Federation Council passed a resolution saying it would resume discussing the plan of legislative initiatives after the state duma approved an analogous document.
