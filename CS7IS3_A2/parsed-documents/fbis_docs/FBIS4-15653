Press center workers and fleet staff officers said that armed sailor Dmitriy Pulkin, who is serving under contract in a counterintelligence sub-unit of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, killed four people and injured three sailors. At 0355 hours he switched off the signaling in the armory room and stole two submachineguns with six full drum magazines and five pistols. Then he went down into the quarters of the duty officer for a large unit of submarines and shot him with the submachinegun. Next, he entered the quarters where the submariners were resting and opened fire on them. One sailor was killed and two were wounded. Seizing the unit commander's driver, the criminal forced him to take the wheel. The latter managed to get away for a few minutes into the barracks where he reported the emergency to the duty officer of the naval headquarters. Realizing his mistake, the criminal himself took the wheel and set off for the military town. However, by that time, the road was blocked by two fire engines, and Captain Dudakov of the counterintelligence services drove towards him. He tried to detain the criminal who opened fire with a submachine gun and killed both the officer and his driver. Breaking away from his pursuers, Pulkin reached a torpedo retriever boat on which a seaman from his own district of Pereslavl-Zalesskiy was serving. The criminal shot him dead and took the other four members of the crew hostage. All Pulkin is demanding from the representatives of the naval command and the counterintelligence services, who are talking to him about his surrender, is vodka and cigarettes.
