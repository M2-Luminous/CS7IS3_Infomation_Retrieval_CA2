The agreement, as signed by the two parties in Brussels in March, has been held over pending ratification by the Ukrainian Parliament of the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty]. At a meeting of EU foreign ministers, the Belgian foreign minister recommended that the EU should adopt an uncompromising position, believing that this would help strengthen Mr. Kravchuk's authority. But most of his colleagues favored an immediate signing, thereby forcing Ukraine to sign the NPT before ratification of the partnership agreement by the European Parliament and the national assemblies of the Twelve. The ministers also confirmed their commitment to EU financial aid for Ukraine, notably by funding the purchase by the Kiev authorities of seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides in order to relaunch a farming sector which has fallen into decay due to lack of funds. The ministers also discussed at length the question of civil nuclear power. They were unanimous in calling for the shutdown of reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, seriously damaged following an accident in April 1986. (On Monday afternoon, the Kiev authorities requested financial aid in order to allow them to permanently shut down Chernobyl and ensure energy supplies for Ukraine.) In return, the Twelve expressed a willingness to contribute to financial aid granted in the framework of the G7 (a grouping of the world's seven most industrialized nations) in order to complete the construction of two new nuclear power stations. Mr. Claes stated that these new reactors are already between 90 and 70 percent finished. The Belgian minister did, however, express some reservations regarding the future of the civil nuclear program in Ukraine. "I do not believe it is wise to envisage the continued production of nuclear energy in Ukraine. There are other alternative solutions, such as the sale of electricity at very low prices while waiting for traditional power stations to be built," he told the assembled press.
