FR940526-1-00018 FR940526-1-00010 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AC22 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Reopening of Comment Period and Notice of Public Hearing on Proposed Endangered Status for the Barton Springs Salamander AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule; notice of public hearing and reopening of comment period. SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) provides notice that a public hearing will be held on the proposed determination of endangered status for the Barton Springs salamander ( Eurycea sosorum ) and that the comment period on the proposal is reopened. This salamander is found only in Barton Springs, Travis County, Texas. All interested parties are invited to submit comments on this proposal. DATES: the public hearing will be held in two sessions, from 1 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., and from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., on June 16, 1994, in Austin, Texas. The comment period, which originally closed on April 18, 1994, has been reopened and now closes on July 1, 1994. The Service will accept comments received between April 18, 1994 and July 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Both sessions of the public hearing will be held at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Auditorium, Lyndon Baines Johnson Library Complex, 2315 Red River Street, University of Texas campus, Austin, Texas. Written comments and materials should be sent to the Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, 611 East 6th Street, room 407, Austin, Texas 78701. Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lisa O'Donnell, Biologist, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Austin Ecological Services Field Office, at the above address (telephone 512/482&hyph;5436). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Baron Springs salamander is completely aquatic and currently known only from Barton Springs in Travis County, Texas. The salamander is threatened by contamination of the waters that feed Barton Springs, reduced groundwater supplies, and disturbances to its surface habitat in the pools where it is found (such as use of chemicals and high pressure hoses for pool cleaning). On February 17, 1994, the Service published a proposed rule in the Federal Register (59 FR 7968) to list the Barton Springs salamander as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq .). Section 4(b)(5)(E) of the Act requires that a public hearing be held if requested within 45 days of the proposal's publication in the Federal Register . The first public hearing request received within the allotted time period came from Mr. Jon Beall, President of the Save Barton Creek Association, Austin, Texas. Several other hearing requests were subsequently received. The Service has scheduled the requested hearing in two sessions, from 1 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., and from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., on June 16, 1994, at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Auditorium, Lyndon Baines Johnson Library Complex, 2315 Red River Street, University of Texas campus, Austin, Texas. Anyone wishing to make an oral statement for the record is encouraged to provide a written copy of their statement at the start of the hearing. So that everyone has the opportunity to make an oral statement, each person who wishes to do so should make their statement at only one of the sessions. In the event there is a large attendance, the time allotted for oral statements may have to be limited. Oral and written statements receive equal consideration. There are no limits to the length of written comments presented at this hearing or mailed to the Service. The comment period on the proposed rule originally closed on April 18, 1994. The Service finds that good cause exists to reopen the comment period to accommodate the hearing. Written comments may now be submitted until July 1, 1994, to the Service office in the ADDRESS section. The Service will also accept comments received between April 18, 1994, and the publication date of this notice. Author The primary author of this notice is Lisa O'Donnell (see ADDRESSES ). Authority: The authority for this action is the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C.1531 et seq .). Dated: May 20, 1994. John Cross, Acting Regional Director, Region 2, Fish and Wildlife Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;12846 Filed 5&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;55&hyph;M
