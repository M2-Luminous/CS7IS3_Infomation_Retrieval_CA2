Upon their return from the Christmas truce, the National Liberation Party (PLN) and Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC) are in the home stretch, aware of the close [poll] results and difficult battle they face. Their propaganda strategies to achieve this differ and in the case of the Social Democrats, perhaps, is more reactive. The Social Christians, who announced a strong campaign against PLN candidate Jose Maria Figueres since late 1993, have fulfilled their pledge. They renewed reports about the opposition leader's alleged involvement in certain irregularities and, in certain cases, they revealed some new ones. The PLN launched a campaign under the slogan "The Safe Way," based on promises of social welfare and the party's principles. However, the ruling party's harassment reportedly provoked a drastic change in the PLN's preliminary strategy. This is gleaned from a propaganda analysis prepared for this newspaper by specialists Victor Flury, Victor Ramirez, and Jose Alberto Ramirez. The analysis covered the period 2-10 January and studied 23 different ads in newspapers and 35 television spots. This is the sixth report on political propaganda, and the experts have added their reviews of other issues, including public speeches, debates, and polls. Referring to the last three weeks, the analysts predict the PUSC will continue to attack Figueres; it will strengthen some campaign promises; and it will give a triumphant-reflexive feeling to its messages. PLN members, they predict, will continue to proclaim the party's victory, extol the polls which give them the advantage, and exert themselves to deal a psychological-political blow: Former President Oscar Arias' eventual participation in proselytization activities. Flury, Ramirez, and Rodriguez believe the resumption of the electoral battle in January provoked a national debate on whether the parties were carrying out a dirty campaign (mutual accusations) or a confrontation of ideas. According to predictions included in the previous report, which was published on 29 December, the PUSC attacked Figueres with strong moral and business charges. Moral issues involving the candidate's actions prevailed. Hence the slogan "Careful with Figueres Olsen, there are problems wherever he goes." This was followed by messages on Figueres' recent involvement, according to the Attorney General's Office, in a possible embezzlement with bonds and mines, as well as the removal of seven Telenews journalists from Channel 7, reportedly a result of pressure exerted by PLN leaders. According to the three professionals' analysis, PLN reportedly reviewed two scenarios in December to counter the ruling party's attacks: A) Launch a January campaign reviewing ideas and programs, but -- given the PUSC's onslaught -- argue they had no other choice but to launch a counterattack. B) Opt for a positive campaign because party leaders figure the people are tired of attacks. Nevertheless, given the strength of the Social Christians' charges, a fierce internal discussion took place and the decision adopted was to change strategy lest the adversary's blows undermine its support. Nevertheless, two days after PUSC presidential candidate Miguel Angel Rodriguez' attacks, the PLN went on the offensive by reporting the manipulation of poor people and an apparent purchase of votes. Also, it terms as slander and dirty campaign what was reported by the PUSC. The PLN launched a series called "We cannot vote for Miguel Angel," recalling alleged irregularities in the distribution of taxi license plates, the sale of high school diplomas, and the use of construction material. Nevertheless, the analysts believe these actions have no influence on voters and they claim those were "isolated events" of no importance that "will not directly affect the party or the candidate." In fact, when comparing the type of charges made by the PUSC and the PLN, Flury, Ramirez, and Rodriguez say those of the latter will have a lesser impact. The two parties are criticized because they planned propaganda messages in a general way, without taking into consideration the characteristics of the press or television. The TSE [Supreme Electoral Tribunal] deserves a special mention in all this. Ramirez believes it played an exaggerated role that was totally uncalled for. One specific example: its fruitless efforts to stop the parties from attacking each other. Analysts believe the TSE's frequent prohibitions have limited the debate and confrontation of ideas. Generally speaking, the three specialists believe the PLN strategy mainly intends to depict Miguel Angel as a threat by stereotyping him as a neoliberal. They think the concept is not necessarily understood by most of the population. Social Democrats will reportedly offer the voters a party with experience, achievements, and a security tradition that, according to them, is guaranteed by every PLN government. Likewise, they predict that, in the end, undecided voters will give more importance to issues such as a government team and party tradition rather than honesty. It is believed the green-white party's strategy is guided by the incentive-reply concept given the Social Christians' actions. In addition, the analysts emphasize the fact that, even though Carlos Espinach is in charge of the PLN campaign, he is unknown by voters, reticent, and totally out of contact with the media. Referring to the PUSC's strategy, experts observe a tendency to present its candidate with more vehemence and firmness than in the recent past. Furthermore, they say Social Christians will try to send voters the message that Figueres is a person who cannot be trusted to rule a country, particularly due to the moral and business charges he has faced. The ruling party's strategists also believe undecided voters will eventually choose the most honest candidate rather than the one who offers more benefits to the people.
