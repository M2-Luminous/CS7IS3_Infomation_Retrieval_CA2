FR940721-1-00013 FR940721-1-00007 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Part 101 [Docket No. 94N&hyph;0155] RIN 0905&hyph;AB68 Food Labeling; Nutrition Labeling of Raw Fruit, Vegetables, and Fish; Guidelines for Voluntary Nutrition Labeling of Raw Fruit, Vegetables, and Fish; Identification of the 20 Most Frequently Consumed Raw Fruit, Vegetables, and Fish; Correction AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Proposed rule; correction. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is correcting a proposed rule that appeared in the Federal Register of July 18, 1994 (59 FR 36379). The document proposed to revise the guidelines for voluntary nutrition labeling of raw fruit, vegetables, and fish; revise the definition for compliance with respect to adherence by retailers to those guidelines; and revise the labeling values for the 20 most frequently consumed raw fruit, vegetables, and fish. Certain portions of section VII. C and section VIII. in the Supplementary Information section were inadvertently omitted from the document. This document corrects that error. DATES: Submit written comments by September 16, 1994. The agency is proposing that any final rule that may issue based on this proposal became effective 30 days after publication. ADDRESSES: Written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jean A. T. Pennington, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS&hyph;165), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202&hyph;205&hyph;5434. In FR Doc. 94&hyph;17287, appearing on page 36379, in the Federal Register of July 18, 1994, the following correction is made: 1. On page 36388, in the 1st column, in section VII.C., in line 16, the following text is added after the word ``existing'' and before the word ``with'' to read as follows: * * * signs normally would have been replaced during the compliance period. However, FDA does not believe that signs normally would have been redesigned during that period. Therefore, the costs of the proposed regulation are administrative and redesign costs. FDA estimates that the average cost of redesigning signs to label raw fruits, vegetables, and fish is $100 per store. There are 31,000 chain stores and 68,000 independent grocery stores that fall under the compliance guidelines. Therefore, if those stores currently complying with the guidelines continue to do so, costs of compliance would be approximately $7.5 million. VIII. Effective Date FDA is proposing that final regulations and voluntary guidelines based on this proposal become effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. Under the act, FDA is scheduled to do a compliance survey every 2 years. The first survey was conducted in November and December of 1992, and the second is scheduled for the fall of 1994. While FDA would like to have the new values in place by the fall, the agency recognizes that it is unlikely that it will be able to do so. Even if the agency were to complete this rulemaking by that time, FDA recognizes that it will be very difficult for firms to have signs in place that reflect the new values by the time of the survey. Therefore, FDA advises that regardless of whether it completes this rulemaking by the fall or not, it intends to find a store to be in compliance if it is providing nutrition information for raw fruits, vegetables, and fish in accordance *␣*␣*. Dated: July 19, 1994. Michael R. Taylor, Deputy Commissioner for Policy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;17845 Filed 7&hyph;19&hyph;94; 12:10 pm] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F
