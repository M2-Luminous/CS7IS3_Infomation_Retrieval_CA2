For example, this is the case with the Le Natal printing shop and Nicks Taxi. Others have decided to reduce the hours they work daily, such as the National Brewing Company and the Port-au-Prince Custom Service. The managers of other companies say they will be able to function until the end of January. The manager of the National Oil Works company asserts that the company is no longer able to plan for the future, as now we work on a day-to day basis. The same story applies to the Four C laboratory company. The manager did not want to make public the options that will be considered at the end of the month. The Adventist hospital in Diquini will no longer be able to function by the end of the week if the 1,500 gallons promised by the administrative committee handling the humanitarian fuel supply are not delivered. Even this fuel will not allow a normal functioning of the hospital. One of the hospital officials, contacted by Signal FM, asserts that a new schedule will have to be adopted which will have some consequences for the patients. Other companies such as Electricity of Haiti, CAMEP [drinking water company], and TELECO [telephone company] cannot function normally due to the extreme fuel scarcity.
