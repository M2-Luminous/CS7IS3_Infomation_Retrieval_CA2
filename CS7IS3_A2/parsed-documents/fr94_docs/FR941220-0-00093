FR941220-0-00093 FR941220-0-00014 Assuming the actual wage is higher than the prevailing wage and thus is the required wage rate, if an employer gives its employees a raise at year's end, or if the system provides for other adjustments in wages, H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants must also be given the raise (consistent with legitimate employer-established criteria such as level of performance, attendance, etc.). This is consistent with Congressional intent that H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants and similarly employed U.S. workers be provided the same wages. Where the employer's pay system or scale provides adjustments during the validity period of the labor condition application_ e.g., cost-of-living increase or other annual adjustment, increase in the entry-level rate for the occupation due to market forces, or the employee moves into a more advanced level in the same occupation_the employer shall retain documentation explaining the changes and clearly showing that, after such adjustments, the wages paid to the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant are at least the greater of the adjusted actual wage or the prevailing wage for the occupation in the area of intended employment. In the Final Rule, guidance for employers regarding the essential aspects of the foregoing discussion, along with several examples which are substantially the same as appeared in the preamble to the Interim Final Rule are being promulgated as Appendix A to Subpart H. f. Prevailing working condition standard (See § XXXX .732.) The Act requires employers to attest in their LCA's that the employment of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants will not adversely affect the working conditions of U.S. workers similarly employed. The regulation provides that ``working conditions'' include such matters as working hours, shifts, vacation periods, and fringe benefits. The employer's obligation in this regard extends for the longer of two periods: The validity period of the certified labor condition application or the period during which the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) is (are) employed by the employer. In previous stages of H&hyph;1B rulemaking, the Department stated its position that Congress intended prevailing working condition determinations to be made in the same manner as the current regulations for the permanent alien labor certification (immigrant worker) program. See, e.g. , 57 FR 1316 (January 13, 1992); 56 FR 54720 (October 22, 1991); 56 FR 37175 (August 5, 1991); and 56 FR 11705 (March 10, 1991); see also 20 CFR part 656. There has been some confusion expressed, however, regarding the Department's interpretation of this LCA element. While the regulation itself is clear and is not being amended, the Department is providing the following additional guidance. The H&hyph;1B regulation permits the employer to file an LCA without making any pre-filing determination or documentation of working conditions; the regulation requires that a prevailing working condition determination be made only in the event of an investigation. See § XXXX .732 of the final Rule; see also 20 CFR 656.24(b)(3). The public should be aware that the Department is carefully reviewing its program experience, as well as information received from members of the public and other sources, regarding the impact of the employment of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants on the working conditions of U.S. workers. g. Challenges of prevailing wage determinations only through employment service complaint system. Former § XXXX .730(e)(1)(ii)(C)(1), new § XXXX .731(a)(1)(iii)(A), lists the State Employment Security Agency (SESA) as one source for obtaining a prevailing wage determination. Although DOL regulations provide an avenue for an employer to challenge a SESA determination through the Employment Service (ES) complaint process (under 20 CFR part 658, subpart E), the Interim Final Rule did not make it sufficiently clear that challenges to prevailing wage determinations were to be made only through that process. In designing the program, the Department had envisioned that the ES complaint process would be used for all prevailing wage challenges. However, after substantial enforcement litigation experience, the Department has found that some employers are instead attempting to contest such determinations through the hearing provided under § XXXX .835. Such enforcement was not intended to handle such challenges.
