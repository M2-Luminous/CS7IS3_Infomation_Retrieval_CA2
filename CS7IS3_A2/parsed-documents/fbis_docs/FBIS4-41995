The speaker of parliament's lower house addressed on Wednesday a news conference, summing up results of the lawmakers' trip. When asked by TASS about the possibility of granting such a status, Rybkin said the Duma intended to back the region's legislative initiatives on the issue. "The defence of our eastern borders is to be reasonable and sufficient. Proceeding from this principle, we should help the Far East in every possible way with material and technical resources so that local residents could not feel deprived", the Duma chairman believes. Speaking of his visit to the South Kuril islands, Rybkin expressed support of their residents' aspiration to retain these economically beneficial territories.
