The decree specifies, in particular, that a list of commodities is approved, for which quota and license issuance regulations are nullified in 1994, as well as that license issuance procedures are no more applicable to commodities, not covered by the quota regulations. The decree specifies that exports of coal, ammonia, ethylene, benzene, methanol, mineral fertilizers and ferrous metals are effected following the established procedures without specifically authorized subjects of foreign economic activities. The Cabinet of Ministers is instructed to determine, on a quarterly basis, amounts of export quotas for the above listed commodities to be realized at auctions by the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations. The Cabinet is further instructed to draft, within a month's term, and submit to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine a law on necessary amendments to Cabinet decrees, which regulate exports of commodities and services, and to adjust, within a fortnight's term, its own resolutions to this decree. The institute of "special exporters" was set up by the Cabinet's resolution of 22 December 1993 allegedly with a view to make more orderly Ukraine's exports and pursue unified and CIS-co-ordinated pricing-export policies, as well as to ensure a more regular flow of hard currency to the state budget. The Cabinet resolution approved a list of organisations and agencies, which were thus authorized to act as Ukraine's exporters of certain commodities. On 5 March and 26 April 1994 the list was substantially complemented. According to Valentin Kulichenko, deputy minister for industry, these "special exporters" charged from 0.5 to 5 per cent of the contract-specified amounts of export proceeds. As Mr. Kulichenko maintains, all the "special exporters" transferred their currency accounts to the Ukrainian Export-Import Bank by the first quarter's close. Meanwhile, as observers believe, the Decree was issued under pressure brought to bear by certain commercial (that is, nongovernment-owned) structures, which used to deal in metals, other raw materials and products before the special exporter institute was introduced. So, formally from now on, any juridical person, who possesses enough means, may buy export quotas at auctions held by the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations. However, as experts maintain, quota acquisition is not at all tantamount to a quota's factual application, since certain structures are obviously in a very good position to block the quota application process. Besides, according to information furnished by the Industry Ministry, last year, none of Ukraine's exporter-manufacturers were able to fully realize their quotas. In particular, about 10 million tons of metals failed to be exported under the issued quotas. Thus, as analysts insist, Ukraine's export quota market is doomed to remain shared among the very same old and long-established influential groups. [passage omitted]
