[Dzhemilov] The Crimea is our homeland. We are trying to reestablish Tartar autonomy within the confines of Ukraine. The young Ukrainian state is not responsible for the crimes against our people. [DIE WOCHE] Most of the population of the Crimea are Russians. Do they have no right of self-determination? [Dzhemilov] Russian claims to the Crimea stem from their conquest thereof in 1783. The Tartars are indigenous to the Crimea. We are not going to accept annexation to Russia passively. [DIE WOCHE] Have you not backed the wrong horse? [Dzhemilov] During the 211 years of Russian colonization, we have not experienced anything good about Russia. The Tartars were drive out of their homes, and Russians were settled in their place. In 1944, Stalin had the Tartar population deported. [DIE WOCHE] Might not your warm feelings toward Kiev drive the Russians and Tartars further apart? [Dzhemilov] We are already being discriminated against everywhere. There is no work for the 250,000 Tartars in the Crimea. Unemployment has reached 40 percent. Our health situation is catastrophic. We constitute 10 percent of the population, but 30 percent of its patients. [DIE WOCHE] What would the Tartars do in the event of an armed conflict between Ukraine and the Crimea? [Dzhemilov] Should fighting break out, we will know how to defend ourselves. We are well organized, and can deploy defense troops in the shortest time.
