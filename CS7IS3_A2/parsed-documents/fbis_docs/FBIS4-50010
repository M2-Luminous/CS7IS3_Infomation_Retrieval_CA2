Jiang made the remark in meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed Mahathir here this afternoon. Jiang, quoting Mahathir's remarks made during a visit to China last year, said political stability is an important factor for economic development. "This makes a lot of sense and we have good knowledge of that," he said. "China needs stability, and so do Asia and the world in general. This is a crucially important issue," he added. Referring to the political disturbance in June 1989, Jiang said that without the resolute measures taken then, China would not have enjoyed today's stability. "A bad thing has been turned into a good thing, and as a result, our reform and opening program has forged ahead with steadier, better and even quicker steps, and our advantages have been brought into fuller play," he said. "History shows that anything conducive to our national stability is good," Jiang said. "In the past five years, China has enjoyed economic development, social stability and improved livelihood of the people, thanks to our consistent efforts to take stability as an overriding priority. Facts prove this is absolutely correct." Stability forms a prerequisite and reform serves as a driving force, while development represents the goal, Jiang said, adding that the three factors interact to promote each other. The importance of ensuring lasting national stability has become a common understanding of all the Chinese people, Jiang said. "The stability of China is not only needed for China's own development, but will also benefit the stability and prosperity of Asia and the world in general." That is because the stability of China, which has a close-to-1.2-billion population, is of international significance, he said, noting that in the past decade and more, the stability and development of China have not only brought benefits to the Chinese people, but contributed to world peace and development as well. On the regional situation, Jiang noted that the situation in Asia is developing in a good direction in general, with sustained economic development and constantly improving regional security. Further efforts to safeguard regional peace and development reflect an issue that has won attention from leaders of Asian nations, he noted. "We are ready to work with Malaysia and other Asian countries towards peace and development in Asia." In the meeting, Jiang noted that Mahathir's visit coincides with the 20th anniversary of Sino-Malaysian diplomatic relations, saying such ties have gained overall expansion in the past two decades, with fruitful cooperation in the political, economic, cultural, scientific and technological fields. The traditional friendship between the Chinese and Malaysian peoples continues to expand, while vast potential exists for bilateral cooperation, Jiang said. Continuous expansion of such relations will not only promote common prosperity of the two countries, but also will serve to enhance regional economic cooperation, he added. Mahathir said that since last year, he has been encouraging Malaysian businessmen to invest in and expand trade with China. Malaysia is satisfied with the steady growth of economic and trade ties with China, he said. Referring to his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton shortly before he came to China, Mahathir said he had stressed his opposition to imposing one's own views upon others and to using the MFN [most-favored nation] issue to exert pressure on China, according to a Chinese official. After the meeting, Jiang hosted a banquet in honor of Mahathir and his party.
