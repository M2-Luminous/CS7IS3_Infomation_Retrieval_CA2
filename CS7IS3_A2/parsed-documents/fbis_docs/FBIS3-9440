[Bazlikova] The first point on the agenda was the proposal of the former government, the government of Vladimir Meciar, on 8 March to recall Marian Tkac from his post of vice governor of the National Bank of Slovakia. One of the reasons stated was the fact that Tkac had been positively vetted--that is, that he was accused of having cooperated with the StB [the former secret police]. The noteworthy fact about this proposal to recall the vice governor is that the former opposition had presented similar, or maybe the same, reasons approximately a year ago, when the government proposed that parliament elect Tkac to the post of vice governor. According to some deputies from the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the Slovak National Party, some facts that prevent Tkac from staying on in this post have only gradually become known. [passage omitted] [Tosecka] [passage omitted] The results of the public vote were as follows: 119 deputies voted in favor of Tkac's recall, one deputy was against it, and six abstained from voting. The final decision on recalling will be made by the president of the Slovak Republic. For the time being, this is all from the parliament, where there is a lunch break now.
