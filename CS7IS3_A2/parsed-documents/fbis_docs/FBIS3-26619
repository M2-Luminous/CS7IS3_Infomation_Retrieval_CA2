In terms of the rural areas, an important issue is how to continuously increase peasants' income through reform and development. Comrade Xiaoping says the criterion for evaluating our work is mainly to see whether it helps develop the socialist productive forces; whether it helps strengthen the comprehensive national power of the socialist state; and whether it helps raise people's living standards. If we use this criterion to measure our rural economic work, then I believe that while the rural economy has achieved substantial development in recent years, peasants' income has, however, not been raised correspondingly, and their incomes are not in keeping with economic development. Seen from the last five years of 1989 to 1993, the net annual income of peasants, allowing for price rises, only increased by an average of 2.2 percent yearly. This is far less than the 5.5 percent speed required by the target of becoming well-off. Without peasants' income increasing, people's living standards cannot rise, and they will not have the enthusiasm necessary for building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Thus we cannot even begin to talk about the development of productive forces and the strengthening of comprehensive national power. Man is the decisive factor in our great socialist cause. As far as the rural areas are concerned, the decisive factor is the enthusiasm of the 800 million peasants. If we have this enthusiasm, then there is hope for our rural economic development and modernization of agriculture. However, if peasants' income increases slowly and rural purchasing power remains low, then the market for industrial products will not be able to open up and expand in the countryside. The potential of the large Chinese market is in the countryside, among the 800 million peasants. Therefore, an increase in peasants' income and a rise in their purchasing power is an major issue determining the development of China's market for industrial goods and the entire national economic development. The party Central Committee and the State Council are very concerned about this and, at the central agricultural work meeting held not long ago, listed increasing peasants' income as one of the major goals of rural economic development. How to increase peasants' income? According to the experience of the last 15 years of reform and opening up, apart from increasing the party's and state's agricultural input and improving the policy environment so as to adapt better to the conditions of rural development, I believe three major changes are needed in terms of agriculture and rural economy itself in order to develop that economy and increase peasants' income. The first major change is to rely on science and technology to raise per-unit grain per mu output, constantly increase total output, boldly adjust the industrial structure, and vigorously increase the production of meat, eggs, milk, fruit, vegetables, and other cash crops on the premise of satisfying the needs of the country and the people. This is not only needed for increasing peasants' income, but also required by the Chinese people if their living standards are to be raised as they work toward a well-off life. This change has already obtained successful experience in many places. For instance, Jiangxi Province has stabilized its total grain output above 50 billion jin by raising per-unit yields, and thus freed up several million mu of fields for fruit, vegetables, meat, eggs, and milk, achieving great success and increasing peasants' income substantially. In other places it is the same. This is a successful experience for the Chinese rural areas overall. Compared with 1978, the per-mu grain yield for 1992 over the whole country rose 197 jin. Because of this, while 200 million mu was taken out of grain cultivation, total grain output rose by 275.8 billion jin, which created the possibility of increasing the cultivation of cash crops and restoring forests. In accordance with the feature of China's resources structure of having a large population with little land, while developing land-saving farming, one must utilize sideline products, such as the stalks of crops, to develop grain-saving animal husbandry. One must also guide farming itself to reform from a two-tiered structure to a three-tiered structure. In the past, farming meant grain crops; later we added cash crops; now we again add crops for animal feed. The growing of crops for animal feed will become independent of farming and will produce animal feed directly to develop animal husbandry. This will be much more efficient than what we do now, which is to wait for corn to ripen and then make it into animal feed. I recently visited Germany. The Germans mash up large quantities of corn in the field, while it is still green, to feed cattle and milch cows. Some places in China now are doing the same. We can give full play to our advantage of having rich farm labor resources and exploit and use our land comprehensively to develop many kinds of food and nutrition resources for people's consumption. That is to say, apart from farming the 1.5 billion mu of cultivated fields, we must also develop nonfarmland resources such as uncultivated land, unused water, barren hills, beaches, and courtyards to increase the effective supply of food. The second major change is to vigorously develop the processing industry, with agricultural products and by-products as raw material, and the transportation industry on the basis of discarding the traditional unitary farming and breeding industry, so as to develop a close linkage and mutual promotion of primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. Successful experience has already been gained in this in many parts of China. We should summarize, spread, persist in, and develop this experience. The agriculture of most of China basically remains at the level of producing raw materials. On this foundation, we should develop processing and circulation as two necessary links of agricultural production, then the economic efficiency of agriculture will be substantially raised, and a broad employment outlet for rural labor will be opened up. In terms of production management, we should organize industrial chains according to the sequence: Trade, industry, and agriculture. To put trade first means putting marketing first, that is, to put the market in first place. Processing should be conducted according to market needs, and raw material production conducted according to processing needs. With an increase of farm products and processed goods and the expansion of transactions, the old state and cooperative commerce can no longer meet the need. Thus we must actively cultivate new means of transportation and marketing and encourage large numbers of peasants to leave farming and breeding, get organized, and enter the fields of circulation and services, to develop tertiary industries in the countryside. The third major change is to guide the farm products processing industry and other nonfarming industries into a relatively concentrated and regional development, so that the development of township and town enterprises is linked with the construction of small rural towns. Based on the rational distribution of existing small towns, one should turn the large number of rural laborers into nonfarming industries, at the same time gradually concentrate them in small towns in a planned and organized fashion, and create possibilities for them to sever their ties with the farmland. This is not only the demand of industrial development itself, but is also needed for large-scale operation in agriculture. The relative concentration of industry will generate huge demand and drive the development of tertiary industry, and hence lead to the development of tertiary industry. The relative concentration of secondary industry and tertiary industry will result in the gradual development of rural small towns. Thus, nonfarming industry's development in the countryside will not only achieve economic results but yield social development at the same time. The new leap forward in China's agriculture depends on the development of nonfarming industry in rural areas and its combination with small towns. For agriculture to have high productivity and increase peasants' income substantially, one cannot rely only on raising prices. That is only one aspect. The main way out is to transfer rural labor away from the fields toward small towns and to operate agriculture on a large scale. This change is a long and gradual process. It cannot be done by rushing headlong into mass action, or by creating a "small town fever." The correct method is to actively guide the peasants to progress steadily. According to current practice, the first change has already obtained general success, and the experience should be summarized, persisted in, and further developed. The second change has obtained some effect in some areas and accumulated certain experience that needs to be disseminated. The third change has already appeared in the coastal regions and suburbs of large cities; it requires investigation and study and summing up of experience so that guiding principles and policies that have the nature of a law can be promoted to guide the realization of this change in places having the necessary conditions. I believe that the realization of these three major changes is the road one must take to develop rural economy and increase peasants' income.
