Dr. al-'Anani said that the decision to "cut short" bilateral talks in the U.S. capital in protest after the Feb. 25 massacre of Palestinian worshipers in Hebron by an extremist Jewish settler was taken within an Arab context and had to be similarly reversed. "We need an Arab decision," Dr. al-'Anani said. His comments came after a cabinet meeting Saturday during which details of a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the Hebron massacre were discussed. Dr. al-'Anani said the Kingdom welcomed the Security Council's resolution condemning the massacre but expressed reservations over Washington's decision to abstain from voting on the part of the resolution that described Arab East Jerusalem as Israeli-occupied territory. "We hope that the Israeli statements that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Israel have not received a boost by the American vote," said Dr. al-'Anani. He said that Jordan had been made to understand that the U.S. abstention "was in line with what they said was the terms of the Oslo agreement which relegates the negotiations over Jerusalem to final status talks." "But our position is that Jerusalem is an occupied territory regardless of when its final status is to be negotiated," Dr. al-'Anani added, The minister, however, described the resolution, passed late Friday after weeks of haggling, as a "good decision." He said that the resolution provided positive stipulations protecting the Palestinians in the occupied territories. Dr. al-'Anani added that Jordan "viewed positively" the resolution's call for accelerating the peace process and reiteration of the applicability of the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories occupied by Israel in June 1967 including Jerusalem. A source in Jordan's delegation to the peace talks said an announcement by U.S. Ambassador Madeline Albright that Jordan, Syria and Lebanon had agreed to resume negotiations with Israel in April "is inaccurate." The source, who asked for anonymity, said that Jordan's decision to consult with its Arab partners before resuming negotiations "does not mean that Jordan will not return" to the negotiating table in April as was announced by the U.S. envoy. [sentence as published] The Kingdom, along with Syria and Lebanon, "only took a decision to cut short a round of bilateral talks between the heads of the negotiating teams in Washington in February." The three teams left the U.S. capital three days before the scheduled end of that round. At the time, Jordanian sources said that the negotiators were not expected to return to Washington before April mostly to accommodate religious holidays of the Muslims and Christians in March and early April.
