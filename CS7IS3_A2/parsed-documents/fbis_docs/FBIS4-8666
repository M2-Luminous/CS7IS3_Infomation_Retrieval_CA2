Reporting on U.S.-spearheaded NATO raids on Bosnian Serb positions around the eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde on Sunday and Monday, Clinton said that the operation had been aimed at protecting international peacekeepers deployed in Bosnia's "safe areas". Gorazde, as a U.N.-designated "safe area," should have been demilitarized last spring, but has instead been used by the Moslems, who have concentrated 10,000 troops there, to launch a powerful offensive against the Serbs. When a Serb counter-offensive threatened to crush the Moslem onslaught, NATO fighter jets were called in to raid Bosnian Serb positions, openly taking the side of the Moslems. "It is not now possible to determine the duration of this operation," Clinton said, in what U.S. observers regard as being meant to prepare congress and the public for a wider U.S. action on the side of the Moslems in Bosnia. Meanwhile, Bosnian Moslem Vice-President Ejup Ganic has arrived on a three-day visit to Washington, to put renewed pressure on the U.S. Administration to supply military equipment and exempt the Moslems from an arms sales embargo which is in force against all of former Yugoslavia. Moslem ambassador to the United Nations Muhamed Sacirbej said on Wednesday that the Moslems would not agree to the ceasefire offered by the Serbs on the weekend unless the Serbs around Gorazde withdrew to the lines they held on March 30. Sacirbej refuted the statement by U.N. commander in Bosnia- Herzegovina General Sir Michael Rose that the Moslems on Tuesday attacked Bosnian Serb positions at Gorazde unprovoked, although the statement has been confirmed by ranking U.N. officials. In a plucky effort at deceit, Sacirbej said that under U.N. Security Council Resolution 836, Moslems have the right to defend the "safe areas" at arms. However, the Moslem action is hardly consistent with the claim of defence, since they have launched another infantry attack from Gorazde on Serb positions, supported by the artillery situated in Gorazde town proper.
