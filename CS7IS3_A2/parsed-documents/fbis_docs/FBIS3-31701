"However, the opening of Tuzla airport will be permitted under the conditions somewhat different from those proposed by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, for his scenario is unacceptable for the RS. The French foreign minister has clearly indicated the West would like to apply the Sarajevo recipe, in the form of a NATO ultimatum, in the case of Tuzla airport. Was the experience of the Sarajevo ultimatum not sufficient for Mr Juppe?", Buha said.
