Kozyrev, minister of foreign affairs of the Russian Federation, by ROSSIYA correspondent Andrey Sharyy, place and date not given, under the rubric "Throughout the Wide World": "The Country Tripped Itself Up: The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia on Domestic and Foreign Policy"] [Text] The outcome of the elections created an acute desire among politicians to speak up. Andrey Kozyrev, who by his own admission fully grasped the need for "contacts with the public" during the election campaign, did not stay on the sidelines either. Toward the end of last week the minister of foreign affairs invited to his suite representatives of the few Moscow newspapers--as a diplomat described it, "publications of a quiet democratic persuasion." Andrey Sharyy represented the weekly ROSSIYA at this session of contacts with the public. [Sharyy] Andrey Vladimirovich, will the results of the elections influence Russia's foreign policy? [Kozyrev] Russia's foreign policy is determined by the president. Fortunately, the president is not being replaced. This means that there are no grounds to speak about changes in the country's foreign policy course. The source and mandate of Russia's foreign policy remain unchanged. We should not forget that the adoption of the new Constitution is the main outcome of the elections. This document carries the imprint of the national leader, just as policy unavoidably bears the imprint of what is happening in society. Despite the elections introducing a certain element of destabilization into our society, I see nothing terrible about their result. Indisputably, foreign policy accents may be changed when the new parliament begins to work, when its nature and character are determined. We will need to take into account the position of the Duma, obviously, heed the criticism in some way, and adjust our course. However, few candidates took an interest in foreign policy issues during the election campaign, and this is why it was difficult to find out who is dissatisfied with what. Perhaps only Zhirinovskiy distinguished himself, but his criticism amounted to fascist-type demagoguery. It is hard to call what he proposed a foreign policy program. Besides, the positions of the LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] keep changing. In one of his presentations after the election, Zhirinovskiy retracted virtually all territorial claims against foreign countries. At the same time, note an altogether unprecedented case: The man is making territorial claims against his own country by demanding that Kaliningrad be converted into a Russian-German condominium. This is the extreme limit of irresponsibility, these are crazy pronouncements. I believe that we should not panic and exaggerate the danger to the process of democratic reforms. Of course, the results of the election are not too gratifying; nor can we ignore the circumstance that the threat of fascism coming to power has arisen in the country. However, I had, after all, been talking and warning about it for a long time. We should try to separate the buffoonish form of Zhirinovskiy's speeches from this real threat. The task of forming a broad antifascist front, including the participation of Communists, is becoming obvious. I am trying to evoke in the Communists the essence of communism; after all, during World War II the communist Soviet Union fought Nazi Germany together with the United States, which did not eliminate ideological differences. I hope that the Communists will not act together with fascists at present, either. Please do not try to find in these words some kind of a failure to dovetail with my previous positions. It is just not there. I remain anticommunist, and since the elections our differences with the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, say, on economic issues have not diminished. They say that they intend to build communism; let them intend--we do not intend; but as far as fascism is concerned.... Previously, we said that our opposition is of the "Red-Brownshirt" coloring. The time has come to separate the Red from the Brown. By no means should we allow the formation of a communist-fascist bloc. An antifascist bloc is needed. [Sharyy] To your mind, to what degree did the democratic image of the country at large and your ministry in particular become "tarnished" throughout the world after the results of the election were known? [Kozyrev] I believe that the initial headline shock of both our press and foreign newspapers has already worn off. The threat of the peril of democracy is real, but it should not be made larger than it actually is. First, for now we cannot say that Zhirinovskiy will control the parliament. His influence is prominent, but it does not mean a change in the overall course. Second, it is not yet known what kind of people these are. I for one do not know anyone in the LDPR, except for Zhirinovskiy himself. It is quite possible that some of the LDPR faction will not march to the drum of its leader. Besides, it is not known how Zhirinovskiy himself will behave. Excessive patriotic rhetoric merely hardens the adversaries of Russia abroad. We are tripping ourselves up in a way. The old Supreme Soviet regularly engaged in this, continuously provoking our partners to take a harder line. We should be aware of one more circumstance which is manifested in some circles speculating with pleasure on the results of the elections, beginning with the Ukrainian supporters of nuclear weapons and to those in Central Europe who, with maniacal stubbornness, wish to join NATO. Questions are already being heard: Are we not coming out against the admission of Poland and the Czech Republic to NATO because we are beginning to yield to our Red-Brownshirts? There are circles in the West, too, which are interested in maintaining at least a residual arms race for their corporate considerations because they make money from it. At present, they are prepared to latch on to any pretext in order to say: "You see, you cannot trust the Russians!" Meanwhile, our patriots take pleasure in giving them ammunition.... [Sharyy] What lessons have you personally learned from the outcome of the elections and the outcome of your election campaign in Murmansk? [Kozyrev] So far, I am not all that scared. The experience of my campaign indicates that if you talk normally to the people, answer questions, hear them out, and so on, they will vote for you and be receptive to your arguments. Moreover, they, these people, are very reasonable; on the other hand, I understand them. I understand their irritation over these endless scholastic TV debates. In essence, the people did not vote for Zhirinovskiy; they voted against those whose peacockery irritated them, against the complacency of the authorities. They were sick of seeing on screen the mugs of my colleagues and friends, including obviously my own, who know everything but cannot explain it articulately. The nighttime "Welcoming the New Political Year" on TV is precisely a case in point. They gathered in order to be seen on screen yet another time. I for one did not attend this welcoming, although I had been invited persistently. I was so tired that, to tell you the truth, I went to bed at 2200 on the night of the vote. During the night I was awakened by my wife, who was in tears when she saw what was happening there. Incidentally, the unprofessionalism of our politicians was a factor in the conduct of the election campaign. Where were professional politicians to come from? All of these American recipes for conducting advertising campaigns do not work out here. Against the background of how the people live in Murmansk, the dog from the advertising clip of Russia's Choice is terrifying. After all, society in the United States has a full stomach, whereas a different approach to our people is needed. Do you remember the proverb "Some complain of not enough cabbage in their soup, while others complain that their pearls are too small?" So, for now we have cabbage soup, and this is the reason American electoral logic does not apply to Russia. [Sharyy] However, you belonged to the leadership of the Russia's Choice bloc and obviously could influence the tactics of the election campaign.... [Kozyrev] In the executive committee we entrusted this to people who were professionally responsible for this--Bragin and Poltoranin. As one of the members of the Russia's Choice leadership, I do not disclaim responsibility, although, frankly, in the weeks right before the election I was too busy with my campaign in Murmansk and international affairs to follow the situation in Moscow. I did not even have an opportunity to watch TV. However, I was altogether terrified when I returned home. This should provide a great deal of food for a great deal of thought, for a major adjustment of policy. What was Zhirinovskiy's forte? He went to the elections with lies of cosmic proportions, whereas Russia's Choice went to the elections with something inarticulate. Zhirinovskiy bought several hours of TV time and sort of talked to people in a human way. He talked obvious nonsense. However, it turned out that this was nonsense, say, for me, but not for many people: They are no longer used to things being just explained to them and argued in regular spoken language, without showing off, without posturing, or to problems of interest to them being discussed with them....that they were not shrugged off. Here is the result. I did the same in Murmansk, that is, answered questions in a popular, human language, and looked at the audience. If I saw that my words were not getting through, it meant that I had to explain in more detail and argue. I understood that one should talk to the people and explain all the nuances to them, because hundreds of myths exist which have been quite skillfully created by SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA and PRAVDA. So, in addition to adjusting the course, we should think about ways to explain our policy to people. [Sharyy] What are the differences between parties with a democratic orientation on foreign policy issues? [Kozyrev] I do not have an answer to this question at the moment. The emergence of differences is not dictated by the policy course; the process originates in reverse--personal ambitions bring about political polarization. Many of my colleagues from the democratic camp were thinking about not only the elections to the Federal Assembly but also a presidential elections. Each candidate needs his own party for the presidential elections. When Russia's Choice was being formed I came out in favor of it emerging precisely as a bloc rather than a party. At that time, this point of view won out just because it was right and not because I advocated it. Having understood that no one will give up their ideas about filling the position of president--neither Serezha, nor Grigoriy--I proposed to not split the parliament and proceed toward the elections with a joint platform. Of course, some variants were possible; well, women could break off if they wanted to create something on their grounds. However, the democratic movement would have preserved its unity. However, a reverse process got underway--based on ambitions. It turned out that for some democratic leaders the main problem was that they did not end up as the first ones on the lists. The split for personal reasons prompted a search for political substantiation. Since there were not enough real differences, artificial ideological spectrums emerged: The programs of some parties shifted to the left or to the right, perhaps, considerably further than their leaders would have liked. They have now grasped for themselves that their genuine electorate is elsewhere. [Sharyy] The experience of the coexistence of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the old parliament turned out to be unsuccessful. Obviously, problems will arise for you in the Federal Assembly, too. Proceeding from your experience in interaction with the Supreme Soviet, what are you preparing for at present? [Kozyrev] I had a very constructive attitude toward that parliament. To my mind, my situation with regard to that parliament was quite normal. I must say that at the beginning cooperation was not being established all that badly. It is another matter that the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the condition in which it was a couple of years ago could do little. I hope that a constructive relationship will develop between the new parliament and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At any rate, we are doing everything possible and are preparing for this as much as possible. What do we need the parliament for? First, to have a legislative base. Second, for opposition. Why? Because the parliament should express the public sentiment. You might recall that I asked the Supreme Soviet time after time to give me an opportunity to speak from the rostrum. I continued to invite myself to events of this kind even when the Supreme Soviet became altogether frantic and they appeared to be unable to stand the sight of me, because there is no other way to communicate: Normally, a minister reports, and deputies ask questions. It was just impossible to work with a majority of the old deputies because they altogether failed to get to specific problems. I will tell you that a completely monstrous catastrophe will happen if the Duma is going to be like the Supreme Soviet.... On one occasion we held a quite businesslike closed-door meeting of the Supreme Soviet Committee for International Affairs. The newspapers wrote: How come--there is a confrontation between the ministry and the Supreme Soviet, but the conversation proceeded in a friendly tone? So, this was a very instructive meeting: At first, all the Isakovs and Baburins flocked there, but they sat in the hall only as long as the TV cameras were rolling. A few people came who were interested in something, who wanted to figure it out, and began to ask questions. Fifteen minutes later the entire irreconcilable bunch left. Why would they stay? They cannot carry on a conversation at this level. Control is the third point in relations between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Duma. Regular control of the parliament over the ministry is needed, just as there is control in any normal country over the operation of any normal department. [Sharyy] Apart from the need to explain the outcome of the elections to the entire world, what particularly concerns you in our foreign policy at present? [Kozyrev] I am concerned about a few substantive issues, for example, the issue of expanding NATO membership. We have ensured that for now no decision on quantitative expansion will follow. Some Central European figures cannot even explain what joining NATO would accomplish for their countries, and cannot actually imagine how this will end. Expanding NATO will, pardon me, amount to a revolution in the entire military organizational development and command. And nobody is ready for this at present. Some politicians are saying persistently that ultimately it is possible to admit new members to NATO. But we are saying this, too! However, this is "ultimately," that is, following a stage of cooperation! At issue is not the admission of some countries to NATO as the beginning of the path but rather an opportunity to join as the result of a path which is yet to be traveled. Meanwhile, there is a long path to be traveled. It is time to proceed from the discourse about who should be admitted and when on to more essential issues, and this is what gives me a headache. What will be the specific content of this stage of cooperation? The situation of the Russian-speaking populace in the nearby foreign countries is the second serious problem. This problem exists in various countries in different forms. For example, there is a tremendous difference between the Baltic states and Kazakhstan, but there are problems in both. Some of our foreign partners have opted for a clearly speculative approach instead of working along democratic lines. I would like to warn that, while our strategic foreign policy course remains unchanged, very firm things will occur on the part of Russia in this instance. Incidentally, we will have to seriously interact with the new parliament on these issues. Our relations with nearby foreign countries largely depend on how qualified the deputies of the Federal Assembly will be. Of course, we will not get anywhere if the Duma consists exclusively of people who are only capable of stating: "We do not have a policy in the nearby foreign countries, and that is that." [Sharyy] You have preferred to discuss domestic rather than foreign policy today. Are you preparing for a switch in your career? [Kozyrev] No. The whole point is that in our country domestic policy is too closely tied to foreign policy. This connection has become particularly obvious now. The time has come to draw conclusions. We should not yell at one another: "Hey, you are to blame for Zhirinovskiy's success!" Now is not the time for public acrimony. This severe blow may have been necessary for the democrats to come to their senses and to get bruised. The main point is not to smash all Russia in the process. The only fortunate thing is that the president was not up for election this time. We have at least two or three years in order to test once again what we are worth.
