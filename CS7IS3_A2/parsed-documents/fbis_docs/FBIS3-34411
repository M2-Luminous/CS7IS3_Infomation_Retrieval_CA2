You should wait for a while. You have done something great. Your revolution is great. It has had many difficulties. You should know that with all these high prices and all these problems... [pauses] You will forgive me for taking so long to speak, but I am constantly unhappy about this issue, these high prices and problems. I should even tell you this: in the meeting that members of the Assembly of Experts had with the leader, despite the fact that it was not the place for such discussions and the issue did not concern the experts, it was put to their excellencies, the leader and the president as follows: Sir, you who are the first person of the country, and Sir, you who are the second person of the country -- both of you are present -- and we, members of the Assembly of Experts have a different task. But, we put forward this issue: the nation is unhappy with high prices, inflation, and some other matters. Be kind enough to think more of the nation. This was discussed in that meeting and this is what the leader said in response: There has been no occasion in which I have gotten together with the president, two of us or more, and not discussed the issue of high prices, inflation, and people's problems. You people should not worry. It is natural for such problems to exist. The hope is that the country's infrastructure has been well built, the result of which we will soon see. Be patient and, God willing, you shall receive both the goodness of the world as well as the hereafter. [passage omitted]
