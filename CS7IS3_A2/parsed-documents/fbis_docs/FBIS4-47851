FBIS4-47851 "drafr087_c_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-087 Daily Report 4 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Problems Continue To Slow Vote Counting Process Problems Continue To Slow Vote Counting Process Kriegler on `Pollution' of Data MB0405163294 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1620 GMT 4 May 94 MB0405163294 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannebsurg May 4 SAPA -- The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] will resume issuing vote tallies within little more than an hour -- about 7 PM -- IEC Chairman Justice Johann Kriegler said on Wednesday [4 May] afternoon. He explained to the media that results had been stopped after "pollution" of the data was discovered shortly after 6 AM on Tuesday. The results would now be issued from a second, slower, manually-fed back-up system which he claimed was free of these errors. Mr Kriegler said a team of computer experts had been called in to investigate the problem and that it was not known who was responsible for the computer interference. Investigations were continuing. All vote counting, barring that in Empangeni, had been completed and the latter would be finished within hours. Judge Kriegler was supported by his deputy, Mr Dikgang Moseneke, and Commissioner Ben van der Ross. They said Natal results would reach the IEC headquarters in a "usable format" no later than 7 PM on Wednesday. "All disputes have been resolved at Durban Expo and we can now deal with the final tallies," Mr van der Ross said. When the result issue was resumed the manual tallies would take over from those issued from the computerised system. Judge Kriegler said the new totals would be "more or less slightly higher" than those already issued with a slight fluctuation in results for particular parties. In a lengthy explanation of the "pollution", Judge Kriegler avoided using the word mistake and became, as he put it, "disconcerted by the implication (of questioners) that I am not being truthful." On Tuesday the slow pace of results had prompted an attempt to change systems to issue totals rather than batches. When this proved very much slower, and after closing down the data receiving system, "the suspicion arose that some of the information may be polluted", he said. Investigations started immediately while the manually fed monitoring system became the main recording system. "None of the suspect material was loaded onto the monitoring system. It is not suspect, even now." The judge did not tell the media what the euphemism "suspect material" or "pollution" meant in real terms. The problem, he said, had been discovered due to trivial differences which continually occurred between two independent data control systems which had specifically been set up to provide independent verification of the results. "Extraordinary measures are being taken to ensure the integrity of results on the manual system is as trustworthy as human precautions can make them," he said. He could not give a definite time when the final results would be announced. "But we in the commission are acutely aware, as you are, of the inauguration and of the (preceeding) sessions of the provincial and national assemblies. "We will take as long as the law allows us to do the job as thoroughly as we can. We are doing everything in our power to ensure that there is no disruption and I am confident we will be able to do so," Judge Kriegler said.
