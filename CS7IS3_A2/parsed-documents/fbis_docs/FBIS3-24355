They reflect to a certain extent the plans and intentions of the ministry that I head. First and most important: The federalization of Russia does not mean a weakening of the state but the sole possible way of preserving its unity and integrity. But lest the objective processes of decentralization bring about the disintegration of the state, they must be cast in civilized forms of federalism. Federalism for Russia also means an opportunity to unite the rich potential of all Russia's regions and the sole possible form of the democratic organization of society. Underlying the most essential contradiction of the state arrangement of Russia is the approach whereby federalism was for more than 70 years seen solely as a method of solution of the nationality question. This was both the ideology and the practice of constitutional development. Of course, it was not realized in all things but it was this approach that guided our former constitutional developers, and it was to these criteria that the internal arrangement of the USSR and the RSFSR corresponded. Another form of state arrangement of the Russian Federation, in which the economic and territorial aspects have emerged in the "federalism" category, has arisen and has been developing in the past four years. Federalism has "suddenly" become the mode of distribution of economic and power authority within the Russian Federation and also a factor actively influencing the pace and forms of economic and political reform. Thus the national model of arrangement of the state and the territorial model of the arrangement of the state have found themselves in contradiction. There is just one way out of this contradiction: We are condemned to a long transitional period, in the course of which we will have to find the optimum forms of the interaction of national aspects of state arrangement and the purely economic and territorial forms. It is the ostensibly incomprehensible argument between the republics and oblasts about the equality of the components of the Russian Federation that is behind this contradiction of the two forms of state arrangement of Russia--national and territorial--which exist simultaneously. The need for recognition of a transitional period means that the republics, as national states, will be preserved within the Russian Federation. The krays and oblasts of the Russian Federation will enjoy development also (the constitution has equalized in a legal respect all components of the Russian Federation). We must pay particular attention, however, to the formulation and support of new fledgling forms of integration of the components within the Federation itself. The first experience in this respect is to hand--it is the activity of the interregional economic associations. There are eight of them today, and they encompass, as a whole, the entire territory of the Russian Federation. Within the framework of such associations different components of the Russian Federation interact with one another and tackle specific economic, transport, and other economic problems, regardless of their status. I proceed from the fact that equality does not mean identity, and no one, therefore, will succeed in "accommodating" the entire diversity of the components of the Russian Federation to some one format. If only because some regions are subsidized and exist thanks to subventions of the federal budget. And this is not their fault but a consequence of the location of the productive forces and the development of the economy throughout previous years. Other regions are profitable, and not only the federal budget but also the subsidized regions live thanks to them. This means that there may be and will be different approaches in economic strategy and tactics in respect to different components of the Russian Federation. The new Constitution of Russia has laid down important principles of the self-regulation and "self-adjustment" of the Federation. While having preserved and strengthened the constitutional nature of Russia, the constitution has at the same time recorded the possibility of the regulation of processes of the delineation of authority by the Federal and other treaties. Part 3 of Article 11 of the constitution, which is devoted to these matters, is enshrined in the chapter "Fundamentals of the Constitutional System" and thus takes precedence over other provisions of the constitution. Article 78 enshrines the possibility of the delegation of authority by the federal structures of power to the level of the components and vice versa. Articles 73 and 76 enshrine the fullness of power of components of the Federation in respect to all matters other than those pertaining to the competence of the Federation and also the right to independently regulate matters referred to the competence of the components. In aggregate, the said provisions represent a basis for use of the mechanisms of "self-adjustment" within the Russian Federation. It is on these articles that the treaty that has just been signed with Tatarstan is based. Debate of the status of the Republic of Tatarstan is not a subject of the treaty. This is simply not in the treaty. Article 1 of the treaty talks about the format of the delineation of terms of reference and authority, and then come articles on the authority of the organs of state power. The treaty is called "Delineation of the Terms of Reference and Mutual Delegation of Authority Between Organs of State Power of the Russian Federation and Organs of State Power of the Republic of Tatarstan." This treaty was born over the course of three years, and it contains certain conceptually new provisions which could and, in my view, should be the subject of scientific analysis. First, this treaty was born not of a political debate between the parties to the treaty but by way of the successive conclusion of specific agreements. Eleven such agreements were signed. They regulate individual economic matters, problems of the delineation of state property, budget and tax relations, and so forth. Thus the formulas of the main treaty were born of specific agreements. And following the signing of such a treaty, the Federation obtains a ready mechanism of its realization in the form of these agreements. This is undoubtedly a new approach, which could be applied in many other instances also. And the second, fundamentally important, fact. The Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, like the constitutions of many other republics also, is today in formal contradiction with the text of the Constitution of the Russian Federation. According to the Constitution of Russia, no federal body can abolish, fully or some part thereof, the constitution of any republic. It might be expected that the republic authorities would revise their constitution independently, but this could prove to be an interminable process. The treaty on the delineation of terms of reference and authority now represents the sole possibility, therefore, of the removal of the formal contradictions between the constitutions of the republics and the federal constitution. Inasmuch as a provision of the treaty in this case takes precedence over the rules of law, the format of the delineation of terms of reference and authority corresponding to the Constitution of the Russian Federation will take effect. I have dwelt on this in such detail for the added reason that this treaty has "closed" a long three-year period, when neither the federal constitution nor federal laws in fact operated on the territory of Tatarstan. None of the efforts of both the former parliament or the positive efforts of the Constitutional Court had any real effect in resolving these collisions. A few words about the political aspects of federalism. They lie in the plane of an improvement in state power in the Russian Federation on the basis of the principles of federalism. It is a question of realization of Article 77 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation and the draft federal law on the common principles of organization of representative and executive power in the components of the Russian Federation. Guarantees of the fundamentals of the constitutional system and the equality of the citizens and, primarily, guarantees of their suffrage, the model of delineation of powers between the executive and representative authorities, the principle of the electivity of the heads of administration and the local government authorities, and certain principles of the delineation of terms of reference and authority could and should be the subject of such a law. This would be a considerable step forward in the development of the political aspects of federalism in Russia. The economic aspects of federalism are the next important issue. We can talk for as long as you like about the fact that Russia must be a full-fledged federation, but as long as the tax and budget systems remain exclusively unitary, Russia will never be a federation. The main thing, therefore, is to bring the budget and tax systems into line with the federative nature of the state. Each component of the Federation must have its own sources of revenue in the form of tax receipts into its own coffers. In addition, the federal fund for support of the regions must finally begin to function. And the logic of tax collection must necessarily be revised. I do not believe that income tax should remain mainly in the hands of a component of the Russian Federation or a local government authority but should be a federal tax. Each citizen should personally and directly do his bit for the cause of the Federation. Taxes of the VAT type, profits tax, and others, on the other hand, should be a subject of distribution. A specific format is being worked up by our ministry. We calculate that it will be possible to switch to an essentially federal tax and budget format as of 1995. Unfortunately, a mass of violations is being perpetrated at this time on the part of the organs of state power of the components of the Federation in the economic sphere: nonpayment of federal taxes, the imposition of internal customs, restrictions on the free movement of goods and services, and other obstacles. This is prohibited by the constitution, and the federal authorities should not only respond appropriately to such violations but also formulate a new format ensuring the unity of the economic space of Russia, the unrestricted movement of goods, services, and people, and the equal legal protection of citizens of the Russian Federation, wherever they may be on the territory of Russia. The basis for the economic unity of the Russian Federation should be such elements of a common infrastructure as power engineering, transport, communications, and information science. For the equalization of the regions, which differ considerably in terms of level of economic development, it will evidently be necessary to introduce territorial rent also. There are no other effective sources of the redistribution of budget and financial resources. And, finally, national aspects of federalism in Russia. Two circumstances are distinguished here. Our paramount task is the prevention of conflicts in the Russian Federation, which are national in form, and a settlement of those that already exist. Without attempting a more detailed analysis here, I shall cite the three main causes of such conflicts: a recarving of power (the competition or struggle of old and new political elites in the regions), a recarving of ownership, and the activity of organized crime. The national form of a conflict is chosen by their organizers as the most "suitable," the one that most disguises the true aims of the political forces behind these conflicts. Unfortunately, a new aspect of national conflicts could soon appear. Conflicts could develop on not just a bilateral basis (Ossetian-Ingush, Ossetian-Georgian, Georgian-Abkhaz, and so forth). The Russian population could be involved in them, with weapon in hand, what is more. This circumstance would switch the conflicts to an entirely different phase. In interaction with the authorities of the regions in the Russian Federation the federal authorities must avert this danger, therefore. Further, on the right of nations to self-determination. The right to self-determination can and should be guaranteed in the Russian Federation, except merely for one form of such self-determination, namely, detachment from the Russian Federation. Formulation of the question of the rights of nations to self-determination, up to and including the formation of an independent state and its separation from Russia, would under the conditions of the Russian state necessarily raise the question of the form in which the Russian nation might constitute itself. If we take the path of a "Russian republic" (and there are forces interested in this), it needs to be borne in mind that whereas for Zhirinovskiy a Russian republic means the USSR in its former dimensions, for other leaders a Russian republic means the sum total of krays and oblasts of the Russian Federation less the other autonomous formations. An attempt to draw the borders of a new Russian republic would end in these borders running not only across regions but also across human souls, across our families. This would be an absolutely hopeless and bloody path. It needs to be recognized officially that the Russian Federation is the common form of state self-determination of all peoples and national groups of the country. In addition, the Russian Federation is the form of the self-determination of all its citizens, regardless of the nationality to which they belong. It is the common home within which there is sufficient room for all forms of self-organization. Fundamental importance in the national aspects of federalism is attached to a revival of the concept of national-cultural autonomy. And not only and not so much even in the forms in which they were developed by Bauer and other ideologists. In my view, there is a possibility of the harmonious unification of the concept of national-cultural autonomy and a well-developed concept of local government. This would make it possible to devise specific organizational forms and realize at local government level the majority of the current national, economic, and political rights of all peoples and nationalities of the Russian Federation. Concerning Chechnya. A situation where for a very long period of time 1.2 million Russian citizens have lived outside of the protection of the Russian Constitution and legality and where crime rages and thousands of families have been forced to leave their homes cannot be tolerated. The federal authorities must regard a settlement of relations with Chechnya as a priority problem for preservation of the federative principles of the Russian state and the development of the Russian Federation itself. The position should be, in my view, as follows. The federal authorities can and should agree to a treaty delineating terms of reference and authority with the organs of state power of the Chechen Republic. It is necessary to proceed here from the fact that the free, voluntary delegation and distribution of authority is essentially the highest form of manifestation of sovereignty and independence. But the condition of the signing of such a treaty must be free elections to the organs of power of Chechnya with the participation of the opposition and the participation of the inhabitants of this republic in elections to the federal parliament. There is one further dimension to the problem of federalism--"federalism and the multiparty system." I am profoundly convinced that Russia can endure and strengthen as a free state only if two or three major and truly nationwide political parties, which would be the political pivot of the federal state, arise in it. It will be very difficult to create and retain a federative state in Russia by legal and economic mechanisms alone. "Federalism and the multiparty system"--this proposition echoes the proposition that the Federation is for Russia the territorial form of democracy. In conclusion I would like to emphasize once more that the rescuing strategy for Russia should be one based on three propositions--federalism, a socially oriented market economy, and local government.
