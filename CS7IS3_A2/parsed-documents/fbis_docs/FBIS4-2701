Director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce Mr Liu Minxue said in a news briefing today that the punishment for breaches of trademark and false registration of trademarks was harsh. He said he was convinced that with the growing development of the commodity economy and international trade, infringements of trademarks and counterfeit registration of trademarks had tended to increase, becoming a public hazard in the international community. Light punishment according to law against such crimes was to blame for rampancy of the offence. Following the learning of experience acquired by foreign countries in this sector, Mr Liu said that the Chinese authorities had revised the trademark law in accordance with its own situation while at the same time the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress had approved supplementary regulations on the punishment for counterfeit registration of trademarks and the State Council had endorsed the revision of the detailed regulations on the implementation of the trademark law. Legislation meanwhile had strengthened protection for the exclusive use of trademarks and the revised law had boosted the administrative enforcement of the law to deal with trademark infringement. The law stated that the industrial and commercial administration could increase administrative punishment for violation of trademark to a fine of not more than 50 percent of the turnover or not more than five times the profits obtained from the illegal practice of committing breach of trademark, an increase from the original imposition of a fine equivalent to not more than 20 percent of the illegal turnover or to a sum not more than twice the illegal profit. Persons found guilty of committing false registration of trademarks would receive the maximum jail term from the original three years to seven years.
