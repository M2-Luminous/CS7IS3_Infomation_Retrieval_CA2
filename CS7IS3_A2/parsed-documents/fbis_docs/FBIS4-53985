We Vietnamese often liken our country to a balcony that faces the Pacific Ocean and enjoys the fresh air and also bears the brunt of all the storms from the sea. Therefore, we attach great importance to all developments in the Pacific Basin. Speaking of the Pacific Basin, especially the eastern rim, people think not only of devastating earthquakes and storms but also of protracted and fierce wars that lead to consequences that were far more serious than natural disasters and that set up barriers among regional countries. Over the past centuries, many nations in the eastern rim of the Pacific Basin were colonial or semicolonial countries and served as suppliers of raw materials and labor to metropolitan countries. Meanwhile, except for Japan, the economies of the aforementioned nations were seriously affected by slow development and backwardness. The situation has basically changed now. All of those nations have regained independence, and wars have ended. Confrontation has been eliminated, and the trend for peace and cooperation has been established and developed with each passing day. People are surprised at and admire the marvelous economic achievements of many countries in this region where repeated waves of development have given birth to many rising dragons that are making their presence felt strongly in the world market, thus heralding the start of the Pacific era. The role of the Pacific region in the world economy has been consolidated with each passsing day, and as His Excellency Prime Minister Mahathir predicted at last year's conference in Seoul, by the year 2020, the Pacific economies will be 2.5 times greater than that of Western Europe, provided that the Pacific Basin countries do not shoot themselves in the foot. The dynamic development of the Pacific economies has not only brought about well-being for the regional people but also created favorable opportunities for the business circle all over the world. With a population of billions, East Asia and Southeast Asia form a large market and a big source of labor. Especially, the people in the region have a tradition of diligence, education, and skill. Many regional countries have a substantial need for capital, technology, and management experiences and as such, create a booming market for investment and trade. Located at the intersection of the world's busiest sea and air transportation networks and due to their development needs, regional countries give top priority to infrastructure development. This move creates no insignificant investment and business opportunities. Furthermore, the abundance of rich natural resources in the region is also an important factor for development and business attractiveness. The social and political stability in each country and the trend for peace and cooperation in the region created a reliable environment for business. The trend for regionalization in combination with that for globalization is developing, including Malaysia's initiative on the East Asia Economic Cooperation Forum. This has further strengthened the business opportunities in the Pacific. It is our hope and belief that this trend would not lead to confrontation between the economic blocs and closed trade, but step up the broadening of regionalization through efforts to further explore the agenda of discussions of the previous conference, thus contributing to increasing business opportunities to a significant degree. The vitality of the Pacific region, therefore, is creating important opportunities that should not be missed. The Pacific Basin, however, is very large and not a homogeneous entity. The countries in the region are at different economic development levels and sociopolitical structures. They experience different historical circumstances and cultural traditions. Besides, there are still latent sources of possible significant confrontation in the region. Though peace and cooperation for the sake of development is becoming the prevalent trend, the region has not been perfectly peaceful at all times and in all places. Moreover, while cooperation is often coupled with competition, the only way to suppress any possibility of confrontation is dialogue for the sake of enhancing mutual understanding and trust, thus further developing cooperation both inside and out of the region for peace, stability, and prosperity of the region and each of the countries. The undeniable conditions to ensure the basic interests are mutual respect, understanding of one's national self esteem and cultural traditions, avoidance of coercive imposition, and politicalization and ideologicalization of trade ties and cooperation. In other words, the principle of diversity in unity will help us reduce confrontation and increase opportunity. I strongly trust that dynamic development coupled with sincere cooperation among the countries, politicians, and businessmen will open promising potential for prosperity for us. Ladies and gentlemen, like other countries in the region, our country also has favorable geographic location, diversified natural resources, and especially the industrious, curious, and skillful people who can adjust quickly to the new environment. Recognizing the opportunity and challenge facing the developing countries including Vietnam, we have been persistent in the past several years in our renovation policy, in the development of the market-oriented economy, and the expansion of international cooperation. Achievements reached during the renovation process help us to gradually settle our economic development and to create new opportunity for domestic and foreign businessmen. The Vietnamese economy nowadays is developing, inflation has been repressed, export and foreign investment are on the rise at fast speed. The sociopolitical stability further improves the favorable environment for foreign and domestic investors. We are ushering our country into a new development stage in which we will gradually practice industrialization and modernization. We have great demand in industrial capital and business and management expertise. This is a new opportunity for foreign investors and businessmen. It is true that the infrastructure of Vietnam is still inadequate. It is quite understandable in the case of a backward agriculture country that had been seriously devastated by long wars. We are concentrating our energy to resolve the situation by reserving most of development aid for construction and upgrading public roads, ports, airports, and power and water supply networks. Many opportunities are widely open for businessmen to participate in the development process in such forms like bidding, joining investment capital, including the formula of construct-operate- transfer. It is also true that our legal system is imperfect. It still allows annoying procedures. We are well aware of this weakness and are trying to overcome it. We also trust that the international cooperation will help us with valuable experiences and opportunities to train our staff and improve our management style. One great favorable element for both us and foreign businessmen is that Vietnam's foreign relations are expanding quickly. Nowadays Vietnam has fine relations with all neighboring countries, is actively preparing to join ASEAN with full membership, and is participating in other institutions in the Asia Pacific region. Vietnam has established normal cooperative relationship with international organizations, improved its relations with most Asian, European, Middle East, African, and American countries. A vivid example of cooperation opportunity with Vietnam is the developing relations between Malaysia and Vietnam. The fine relations reflect not only the warm and trustful atmosphere between the leaders and peoples of the two countries, but also the ever-increasing cooperative relations on culture, economy, science, and technology. The Vietnamese-Malaysian cooperation is an indication of the South- South cooperation and the regional cooperation developing in Southeast Asia. Ladies and gentlemen, the new vitality of the Vietnam's economy is encouraged by the vitality of the Pacific region and by the open door policy of diversification and multidirection that Vietnam has been pursuing persistently. I am delighted at the knowledge of future visits to Vietnam of many distinguished guests who are present here today. The door to Vietnam is always open wide to welcome you. You will have a chance to know the traditional hospitability of Vietnamese people and witness potential of our country and business opportunities that will bring benefit for both sides. I thank you and wish you a successful conference.
