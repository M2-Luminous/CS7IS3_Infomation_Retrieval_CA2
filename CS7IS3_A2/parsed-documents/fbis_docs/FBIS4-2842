According to the plan, seven army brigadier command headquarters and 17 battalions will be dismantled within a year. In addition, the army's ordnance and transport schools will be merged into the logistics school. Troop strength will be reduced by more than 20,000 via the streamlining. Sun Chen said: If our internal and external environments continue to develop in the right direction, we may also consider accelerating the implementation of the plan or reducing our total manpower. He pointed: Internal environments refer to the improvement of our fighting capability following the replacement of our weapons with newer ones, which will reduce the requirements for manpower. Objective environments refer to relations across the strait and the international situation, both may affect the implementation of the manpower plan. In response to questions by legislators on the emphasis placed on strengthening the defense posture in the national defense white paper, Vice Minister Ku Cong-lien made a special point to explain that the change of the national defense strategy from offensive to defensive does not mean a change from active defense to passive; rather, it is an active strategy adopted to coordinate with the country's economic and foreign policies. He said that some people are worried about gaps in the national armed forces' fighting capability, but the Ministry of Defense actually has long had a plan to prevent the development of such a situation; there will never be the so-called "gaps" in defense preparations.
