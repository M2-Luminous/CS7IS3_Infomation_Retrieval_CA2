Landsbergis claimed in his statement that "during the recent days some governmental statements on Russian military transit via Lithuania have caused great concerns". Head of negotiation group Bulovas said that the agreement which had been proposed by Russia could be signed after two weeks when Lithuania established transit rules for dangerous and military cargoes. According to the statement, "President thinks that transits for all partners should be legalized as soon as possible. As I can see no logics in such statements, they possibly include something that should be known by Lithuanian people before our country finds itself entangled into the Russian military system". "Lithuanian labour democratic party has no mandate to condemn the whole nation", Landsbergis said.
