He said that during his talks with Environment Minister Maria Rauch-Kallat in Vienna last Thursday [20 January], Austria's stand was partially changed and Austria now respected the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of the Czech Republic, including decisions by the Czech Government. It is therefore possible to complete the construction of two blocks of the south Bohemian nuclear power plant at Temelin, some 100 kilometers from the Austrian border, Dlouhy said. The issue of the construction of a temporary storage facility for nuclear waste in Dukovany, south Moravia, was also negotiated. The Czech side feels that Austrian opinions should be presented only on the basis of international agreements while the Czech Republic proposes meetings to be held between experts from both countries, Dlouhy said.
