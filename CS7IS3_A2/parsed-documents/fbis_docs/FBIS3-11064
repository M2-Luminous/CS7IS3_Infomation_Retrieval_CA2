During a meeting with local businessmen and former ITESM [Monterrey Institute of Higher Technology] students, the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate promised to consolidate economic stabilization and modernization, as well as to promote capital investment as a core goal of his economic program. "The goal is to offer investors sufficient competitive conditions on an international level -- conditions that include favorable capital expenses, fiscal incentives, government regulations, infrastructure, and support in attracting human resources and technology." In an address lasting more than 35 minutes, which was interrupted on nine separate occasions, Colosio Murrieta asserted that to achieve growth it is first necessary to consolidate macroeconomic stability while encouraging competition and microeconomic efficiency. "I am deeply convinced we are at the dawn of a new phase of economic growth," Colosio Murrieta said. According to the PRI presidential candidate, his program is designed to steer the economy in a steady, clear, and planned manner to achieve the fundamental economic development the country expects. "I am determined to consolidate economic stabilization and modernization, and this will benefit every Mexican household, guarantee low inflation, preserve fiscal responsibility, and encourage structural changes." He said his social program will face some of the most significant hurdles, because he is seeking to create more health, education, housing, and nutritional programs for the people, especially for Mexico's children and younger generation. He called for sustained, shared, and balanced growth that will take into account environmental concerns before opening investment opportunities in Mexico. He also endorsed the promotion of domestic and foreign savings to spur investments. Colosio also said he believes it is important to confront inequalities: "I have witnessed financial irresponsibility while millions of Mexicans were searching for productive employment. Financial irresponsibility is gone forever, never to return." Participants in the event, which began at 1445, included Mr. Eugenio Garza Laguera, president of the ITESM Teaching and Higher Research Board of Directors, and his wife Eva Gonda de Garza Laguera. Also present were businessmen Alberto Santos de Hoyos, Eugenio Clariond Reyes, Javier Garza Sepulveda, Enrique Regules, and Alfonso Ramos, all of whom welcomed the PRI candidate. At the start of his address, Colosio Murrieta stated that during his arrival in Monterrey he was reminded of his university years, and he fondly recalled Mr. Eugenio Garza Sada. He noted it was in Monterrey that he first seriously reflected on the economy. Nearly three decades later, he said, he can honestly say it was a privilege to study at ITESM. Alfonso Ramos, one of the organizers of the event, said all of the participants pledged support for the PRI candidate. At the conclusion of the event, the PRI candidate received a small statue of a lamb -- the ITESM symbol.
