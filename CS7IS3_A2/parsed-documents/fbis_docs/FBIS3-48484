Since North Korea successfully conducted a test launching of its "Nodong-1" ballistic missile, which can directly hit Japan, the agency has been stressing the need for tools to keep track of North Korea's missile development. The agency is currently reviewing the "National Defense Program Outline" upon the request of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and is supposed to draft the revised outline by the end of this year. The new outline is expected to emphasize reinforcement of the nation's intelligence-gathering and analysis capability. Procurement of military satellites is difficult for Japan because a 1969 Diet resolution rules out the nation's development of space technology except for peaceful purposes. However, it appears that the agency thinks the prime minister may like the proposal for obtaining the satellites since he tends to attach importance to high-technology equipment. Full-fledged reconnaissance satellite systems are currently possessed by only three nations -- the United States, Russia, and China. If Japan decides to build its own military satellites, neighboring nations would certainly react strongly to the decision. Even within the country, the Social Democratic Party of Japan, a coalition member, would strongly oppose such an attempt. A reconnaissance satellite system should have ground facilities worth over 150 billion yen [Y], and three to four satellites, which would cost at least Y40-50 billion each. A senior Defense Agency official said: "Taking maintenance expenses into account, the satellite system would cost several hundred billion yen." Moreover, as the trail-blazing pioneer of space development, the United States may react negatively to Japan's attempts to develop its own space technology. Even in the Defense Agency, few people believe the plan can come to fruition easily. The Defense Agency has already begun studying the political, technical, and financial problems involved in obtaining satellites within the 1990's. A senior official said: "In the next five-year defense buildup plan, which will begin in fiscal 1996, we would like to advocate the need for Japan to obtain its own reconnaissance satellite, at the least." The introduction of reconnaissance satellites has been an earnest desire of the Defense Agency, which aims at establishing Japan's own system for gathering and analyzing strategic information. At present, Japan depends to a large extent on the United States for military data on its immediate strategic environment. In Diet interpellation in 1985, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone expressed a positive stance toward Japan's obtaining its own reconnaissance satellites. At that time, however, the government could not further discuss tangible measures for obtaining the satellites due to the 1969 Diet resolution saying "Japan's development and use of space technology should be limited to peaceful purposes." However, the Defense Agency is seeking a breakthrough for obtaining satellites on the pretext of the government's 1985 statement that "it is possible for the Self-Defense Forces to use information provided by general-purpose satellites, such as weather satellites."
