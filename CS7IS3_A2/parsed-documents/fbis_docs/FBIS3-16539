His rating was 7.1 on a ten-point scale (slightly down from 8.0 points last January), experts of the Russian Federation's Political Research Center announced. Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov ranks second -- 6.1 points compared to 5.7 points in January. Third comes Vladimir Isakov, leader of the Agrarian Party -- 5.8 points compared to 3.7 in January. Political scientists believe that the communists' and agrarians' strong position is due to the success of the political amnesty granted to the 1991 coup leaders and the organizers of the hardline revolt last October, initiated by them. Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party Vladimir Zhirinovskiy ranks fourth -- 5.5 points compared to 6.9 last January. Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar went down from second place in January (6.4 points) to fifth -- 4.9 points. Observers also point to a noticeable success of former minister of foreign economic relations Sergey Glazyev, who represents the Democratic Party of Russia. He ranked sixth in February, scoring 4.8 points (compared to 3.2 points in January). Experts explain his success by the fact that Glazyev had advanced his own economic program.
