S. Petrunya, docent, and A. M. Petrunya, physician, Department of Ophthalmology, Luganskoye Medical Institute; UDC 617.7-053.2-072/477.51] [Abstract] Between March 27 and 16 April 1991, in 10 rural population centers of Koryukovskiy Rayon, a total of 1,815 children 14 years of age or under were examined by a team of specialists from the Ministry of Health of Ukraine for various visual problems. Eye pathology was found in 371 children, or 20.4 percent, with the most common problem being refraction anomaly with lowered visual acuity. Congenital pathology was identified in 109 children. Inflammation was found in 70, and conjunctivitis in 54. In general, the incidence of eye pathology was a function of the overall gamma levels in the population centers. In the settlement of Kholmy, for example, where the gamma levels stood at 97 ï¿½R/hr, roughly 30 percent of the children examined presented with eye pathology. References 6 (Russian).
