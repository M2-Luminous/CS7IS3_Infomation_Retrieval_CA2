Representatives of the Belarusian National Bank, the Ministry of Finances, the High Economic Court, and the Cabinet of Ministers participated in its work. The experts emphasized that given the recent economic slump, the breakdown of monetary and credit policies, the process of trading in [products] and balancing mutual accounts between suppliers and consumers has considerably exacerbated. As a result of inadequate finances, working capital is slow to be replenished. Debts for gas, electricity, and thermal energy are growing. Though current legislation regulates mutual accounts between economic sectors rather efficiently, some legal acts, particularly Clause No. 16 of the Law on the National Bank of Belarus, must be supplemented. The commission adopted a decision to discuss this issue at the session of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the Supreme Soviet session; to repeal and declare a range of legislative acts -- formulating economic pressure on enterprises -- as no longer effective; to task the Belarusian National Bank with determining the amount and mechanism for applying economic sanctions when balancing the noncash accounts of those who violate the law.
