The National Guards Commander in Crimea Aleksandr Kostyukov explained the redeployment by the fact that an army compound has become vacant for the unit in the outskirts of Sevastopol. The armed guards have armored vehicles at their disposal. Their main task, in Kostyukov's words is to defend the Ukrainian constitutional system, its integrity and frontiers and to maintain public order. He stressed that there were no separate assignments for the battalion in Sevastopol. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Black Sea Naval Officers has sent to the Ukrainian president's ambassador in Sevastopol a letter, asking him on what legal grounds the battalion was brought into the city and for how long it would stay in the port. Kostyukov also reported that there currently is a regiment of over 1000 guards in Crimea's capital Simferopol.
