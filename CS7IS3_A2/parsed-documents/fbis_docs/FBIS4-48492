Despite this positive observation, however, Sergio Leite stressed the need to give priority to finer details of the implementation. [Begin Leite recording] I believe that if such economic measures are implemented correctly, there will be a considerable economic growth in Angola in the next few years. It is possible, and it will happen if you continue implementing coherent economic measures. [end recording] There is still room for doubt, however, since many steps need to be taken to ensure success. Leite noted, however, that Angola has considerable possibilities and resources for adjusting its economy. [Begin Leite recording] The armed conflict is obviously the major obstacle to the economic development, but even within these conditions, there is the need to oversee the adjustment. Although many people are afraid of the economic adjustment, this happened extensively in Angola in 1993 and was successful. [end recording] Severino de Morais, deputy planning and economic coordination minister, said the new economic government team intends to once again accomplish that goal and added that the preliminary draft resulting from the work of the two technical teams satisfies the intentions of both sides. Despite delays in implementing particularly the foreign exchange policy, the Angolan and international experts believe that it is still too early to evaluate the situation. At the end of the meeting the two teams bid farewell to each other. One is leaving for Washington to present its report to the director's fund committee, and the other remains here to fight for the development of the Angolan economy.
