The hardcopy version of this Foreign Media Note contains 4 cartoons with captions. Guards Authorized To Carry Weapons The Ministry of Interior has authorized uniformed security guards to carry weapons for self-protection when employed to guard company buildings or deliver money, precious metals, or chemical products. Security delivery vehicles will be equipped with radios and must carry certificates verifying the nature of the cargo being transported. The measure was reportedly introduced in December 1993 after a series of attacks against companies and public offices. (Algiers EL WATAN in French 2 May 94) Flow of Refugees to France Continuing According to a front-page article in the French-language daily EL WATAN, some 10,000 Algerians have fled to France, including doctors, journalists, and other professionals, despite a bleak outlook for employment in that country. Technical workers such as architects and electronics experts, for example, have found it necessary to work as industrial designers or to repair household appliances in dormitory towns largely inhabited by North Africans. The article quoted Algerian writer Rachid Mimouni, who criticized the fact that Algerian Islamist extremists "have been welcomed in European countries," while those whose lives have been threatened "f ind no assistance." (Algiers EL WATAN 18 May 94) GIA Publication Comments on Assassinations Algiers daily EL WATAN reported that the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) has claimed responsibility for the assassination of a French priest and nun in its weekly newsletter, AL ANSAR. The newsletter called the killings part of "the policy of liquidation of Jews, Christians, and infidels on Algeria's Muslim soil," describing the clerics as "crusaders who spent long years spreading evil." EL WATAN cited "informed observers" who attributed the double assassination to Mohamed Gousmi, who controls the GIA's "battalions of death" (kata'ib al-mawt) and his deputy, Djamel Zitouni. Gousmi is said to have personally sent news of the killings to Peshawar as a way of demonstrating his rejection of those FIS leaders who have condemned acts of terrorism. Another GIA head, Emir Dehilis, has condemned to death FIS representative Rabah Kebir; according to EL WATAN, documents proving the existence of this death threat were found in a GIA arms cache in Ain Ghrab. According to EL WATAN, information for the GIA bulletin is faxed from Algiers to the Peshawar, Pakistan home of "Abou Amine," who is said to be close to Afghan Prime Minister Golbodin Hekmatyar. (Abou Amine reportedly replaced "Abou Anas", or Bounoua, who was a representative for the Islamic Salvation Front (FTS) and the son-in- law of Shaykh Abdallah Azam.) Abou Amine compiles the newsletter, writes its editorials, and faxes it to Warsaw for onward transmission to Europe and Algeria. According to EL WATAN, this "fragile" relay system enables the Algerian "Afghans" to maintain their leadership over the GIA, whose "emirs" are increasingly "uncontrollable." (Algiers EL WATAN 15 May 94) GIA, FIS Relations Decline According to the Paris-based expatriate weekly AL-WATAN AL- 'ARABI, "informed sources" have reported that a conflict between the GIA and the FIS is anticipated following the assassination of a French priest and nun. According to AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI, the roots of the dispute between the two groups began when the GIA accused the FIS of colluding with the Algerian Government in an ambush that targeted a house in Algiers owned by a FIS member in which a large number of GIA leaders were killed. The operation reportedly took place with the collusion of the FIS as a sign of its "good faith" in executing the agreement between the two sides stipulating that the FIS would aid President Zeroual in eliminating the extremists within the scope of a political settlement. (Paris AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI 27 May 94) GIA-MIA-AIS Unification Denied The reported unification of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) and Armed Islamic Movement (MIA) under the umbrella of the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS)--announced earlier this year by Qamr Eddine Kherbane and Anouar Haddam, both members of the FIS executive council--has not materialized, according to Algiers daily LIBERTE. AL ANSAR, the GIA mouthpiece, has reportedly announced that all GIA "sections" and "companies" have rejoined the ranks of the GIA, with the exception of Said Mekhloufi's group. The LIBERTE article stated that an AIS communique reportedly signed by Abou Mohamed Abdelhadi subsequently alleged that the Al Ansar statement was "nothing but lies" since "the AIS invited and continues to invite GIA elements to rejoin in order to close ranks, but they refused." According to LIBERTE, the GIA-MIA merger originated in 1992 after several GIA leaders were killed or jailed, and MIA head Said Mekhloufi dissolved his group in the hope of forming a unified movement with the GIA.

Civilian Defense Force Shelved According to a "reliable source," Algerian officials have decided not to pursue the mobilization of civilians proposed by former Interior Minister Selim Saadi on 23 March. Saadi had raised the possibility of using civilian reservists as an anti-terrorist civil defense force during a visit to Blida. Officials have reportedly decided that Algerian security forces are "sufficiently capable" of continuing their anti-terrorist measures. (Algiers EL WATAN 12 May 94) Egyptian Anti-Terrorism Productions To Be Broadcast The 11 April edition of Algiers daily LIBERTE reported that Algiers ENTV television plans to broadcast two Egyptian productions, "al-'Ailah" ("The Family") and "al-Irhabi" ("The Terrorist"), both of which both dealt with religious extremism and violence. "Al- 'Ailah," an Egyptian television series, is scheduled to be broadcast first, followed by a showing of the film, "al-Irhabi." (Algiers LIBERTE 11 Apr 94; Algiers ALGERIE ACTUALITE 12-18 Apr 94) Television Documentary on Origins of Armed Islamist Groups The London-based expatriate magazine AL-MAJALLAH reported on an Algerian television program by journalist Lotfi Cheriet called "al- Kabus" ("The Nightmare"), a documentary about "terrorism and the roots of political and fundamentalist violence in Algeria." The 25- minute program described the origins of armed Islamist groups from the early 1980's. Various viewpoints were presented, including those of opponents of Islamist groups and "neutral" scholars. In addition, the documentary 4ncluded "provocative" statements by Abdelkader Chakendi, a "repentant" former Islamist leader. According to the article, Chakendi at one time worked with Said Makhlouf i, leader of the Algerian "Afghans" and with Abdelkader Chebouti, appointed by Ali Belhadj to be commander in chief of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA). The program also showed footage of training centers established by the Islamists in late 1990.
