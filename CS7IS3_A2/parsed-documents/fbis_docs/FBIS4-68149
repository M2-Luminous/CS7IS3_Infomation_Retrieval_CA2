The explosion destroyed 10 meters of track and left a hole 2 meters in diameter, interrupting railroad traffic. Soldiers and federal and state judicial police arrived on the scene and established area controls while National Railroad of Mexico personnel inspected the route for other bombs. The Army arrested a group of people from Central America who were near the site of the explosion -- four Salvadorans, seven Guatemalans, and one Honduran -- who remained under judicial police arrest. Nearby residents said that the bomb was homemade and that it was intended to destroy a nearby bridge, although authorities are still examining what was left of the device.
