They described Zaire's involvement as aggression. The accusation comes in the wake of warnings made by the UN Security Council to Angola's warring factions. The Angolan Government says Zaire has been violating the UN Security Council's sanctions on UNITA, particularly the supply of military equipment and fuel. The Zairian ambassador in Luanda says there (?is not) enough evidence to prove that Zaire is assisting UNITA. The Angolan Government has invited a UN commission of inquiry to visit northern Angola to draw its conclusions.
