FR940916-2-00087 FR940916-2-00076 [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;325 and 50&hyph;324] Carolina Power & Light Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;71 and DPR&hyph;62 issued to Carolina Power & Light Company (the licensee) for operation of the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Brunswick County, North Carolina. The proposed amendment would revise the frequency for verifying the position of the drywell-suppression chamber vacuum breakers when a valve position indictor is inoperable from at least once every 72 hours to at least once every 14 days. The proposed change is consistent with the testing frequency for this equipment that is stipulated in the Improved Boiling Water Reactor Standard Technical Specifications. By letter dated September 9, 1994, the licensee requested exigent handling of the proposed amendment request. The licensee stated that, on September 3, 1994, the closed position indication was found inoperable on one vacuum breaker, and they have been performing the required testing to verify that the vacuum breaker is closed. Since the plant is in operation and the primary containment suppression chamber is inerted with nitrogen, the suppression chamber is not accessible to repair the vacuum breaker position indication without an unscheduled plant shutdown. To conduct the vacuum breaker test, the nitrogen pressure is increased inside the drywell to establish the test pressure. This test reduces the operational margin between the actual drywell pressure and the high drywell pressure trip setpoint. If this setpoint is reached or exceeded, a reactor scram and Group 1 isolation will occur. Therefore, the changes to the test frequency will reduce the potential for incurring an unnecessary plant transient. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change revises the surveillance requirements associated with inoperable position indication for drywell-suppression chamber vacuum breakers. No safety-related equipment, safety function or plant operations will be altered as a result of the proposed change. The change does not affect the design, materials, or construction standards applicable to the vacuum breakers or their position indication instrumentation. Relaxation of the frequency for verifying the position of the drywell-suppression chamber vacuum breakers from at least once every 72 hours to at least once every 14 days, as stated in the existing Technical Specification 3.6.4.1, ACTION c, will not affect the ability of the drywell-suppression chamber vacuum breakers to perform their intended safety function. The extended frequency provides adequate assurance that the vacuum breakers will perform their intended safety function. Each drywell-suppression chamber vacuum breaker will continue to be demonstrated OPERABLE and closed at least once per 31 days and after any discharge of steam to the suppression chamber in accordance with Technical Specification 4.6.1.a. In addition, the new surveillance requirement provided in the proposed Technical Specification 4.6.4.1.a will require that each vacuum breaker be verified to be closed at least once every 14 days. The new surveillance provides further assurance that the vacuum breakers are capable of performing their design function under accident conditions of allowing the venting of non-condensible gases from the suppression chamber to the drywell while not allowing bypass flow from the drywell to the suppression chamber. Based on the above, the proposed change does not create a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed change would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. As stated above, no safety-related equipment, safety function or plant operations will be altered as a result of the proposed change. The change does not affect the design, materials, or construction standards applicable to the vacuum breakers or their position indication instrumentation. Relaxation of the frequency for verifying the position of the drywell-suppression chamber vacuum breakers of the existing Technical Specification 3.6.4.1, ACTION c from at least once every 72 hours to at least once every 14 days will not affect the ability of the drywell-suppression chamber vacuum breakers to perform their intended safety function. In addition, the new surveillance requirement provided in proposed Technical Specification 4.6.4.1.a will require that each vacuum breaker be verified to be closed at least once every 14 days. The new surveillance will provide further assurance that the vacuum breakers are capable of performing their design function under accident conditions without altering plant operations in a manner that would create a new or different kind of accident.
