Following the meeting, Brazauskas told journalists that he had received a response from Yeltsin to his letter of early April saying that some of the Lithuanian-Russian agreements signed by the two men in November 1993 had not been observed. Brazauskas said that Yeltsin's letter called for activating bilateral talks. He thought that both countries wanted that. He added that even before the letter was received the Lithuanian leaders had discussed steps to be taken in the near future. In particular, it was desirable that a Russian team come to Lithuania to discuss Russian transit across that country, visa matters and other urgent matters that had not been covered by agreements between the two governments. Brazauskas said that Virgilijus Bulovas, head of the Lithuanian working group handling talks with CIS member states, would complete shortly the study of a Russian draft agreement on transit. Dainius Trinkunas, Lithuanian president's foreign policy adviser, told Interfax that Yeltsin expressed his gratitude for an invitation to visit Lithuania. The date of his visit will be agreed on later.
