In 1993, the province's commercial enterprises alone attracted more than 200 million U.S. dollars in foreign funds, tripling the total of the past five years. The operation of commercial enterprises used to be confined strictly to domestic traders. Since 1988, Liaoning began to stress the development of the export-oriented economy among its commercial enterprises. At present, over one-fourth of the commercial enterprises in the province have foreign trade operations and have set up trade relations with more than 60 countries and regions in the world. By the end of last year, the province already had 106 foreign- funded commercial enterprises. Liaoning was one of the earliest provinces in China to open jointly-funded hotels. At present, jointly-run Star hotels in the province involve an investment of some 144 million U.S. dollars. In addition, the province sent 450 cooks and other technical personnel to work abroad last year. With China opening wider to the outside world, commercial enterprises in Liaoning are also broadening their scope of foreign trade. To promote the development of export-oriented enterprises, the provincial government has been strengthening foreign exchanges. In 1993, commercial enterprises in the province received more than 8,000 foreign businessmen and sent abroad 180 visitors.
