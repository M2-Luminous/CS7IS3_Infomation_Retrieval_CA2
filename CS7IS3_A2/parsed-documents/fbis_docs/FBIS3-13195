From time to time Mr. Galindo Pohl releases a report on the human rights records in Iran to conclude a phase of his mission. However, his mission is to keep alive the issue of human rights violations in Iran by resorting to every possible means. For this purpose he compiles the false and biased reports of the Western press, affiliated to international Zionism, and presents them to the HRC as a report. Throughout his life Galindo Pohl has witnessed blatant and gross violation of human rights by U.S. imperialism and its local agents in his country, Central America. Nevertheless, he refers to the fatwa of killing Salman Rushdie, the apostate author of the book The Satanic Verses as violation of human rights. He mistakes freedom of speech with freedom to offend and violate sanctities. Galindo Pohl is alway touring Europe. He should therefore know better: If anyone, in whatever status, were to attribute something to a Jewish personality or comment on a historical issue that does not please the Jews, they would raise their hue and cry. For instance, some time ago a member of France's National Front, who fought Hitler's occupation forces and lost an eye in a battle, said: The German gas chambers were only a minor part of the history of World War II. The Jews dragged him to a court on charges of undermining Jewish suffering, and obtained a verdict against him. Now Mr. Galindo Pohl ignores insults against the Prophet of a religion representing more than one fifth of the world population. In reality, if any organization or state were to be condemned for violating human rights, the United States and the Security Council should be condemned. Since Friday the sixth of Esfand [25 February], when dozens of worshipers were massacred in the holy shrine of Ibrahim in Hebron, the Security Council has not yet made any decision to issue a resolution condemning the Israeli regime. Even if such a resolution were to be passed, it would be a waste of ink and paper as it would fail to achieve anything. So far the HRC has only expressed regret on the matter, and the U.S. Government's only concern has been the peace talks. [passage omitted]
