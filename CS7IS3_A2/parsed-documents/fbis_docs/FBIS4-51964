Born in Chunchon, South Korean Kangwon Province, he finished primary and middle schools and graduated from a high school before serving in the puppet Army for three years. He worked at an aviation company and engaged in other jobs from 1981 and kept an aquatic products shop in his hometown before defecting to the North. Now his parents and brothers live in South Korea. Explaining the motive of his defection, Kim Chae-su said he learned through various channels that the people in the North were equally well off under a good policy centered on the masses. "Hearing this, I was disillusioned about the South Korean society where fraud, swindle and irregularities hold sway and I did not want to live there any longer." "Clearly learning that the anti-communist propaganda of the South Korean authorities was all a lie, I firmly resolved to come to the North where the people live a worthy life," he said, and added: "I came over here while I was on a foreign trip with my family under the disguise of tourism."
