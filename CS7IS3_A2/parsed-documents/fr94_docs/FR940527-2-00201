FR940527-2-00201 FR940527-2-00152 (2) Documentation and Public Access. The recipient unit of general local government must ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted to the recipient by a subrecipient applicant are adequate to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. The unit of general local government must make this material, including any letters of support, available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than 30 days after the award of the assistance. Unit of general local government recipients must also notify the public of the subrecipients of the assistance. Each recipient will develop documentation, public access, and notification procedures for its programs. (See 24 CFR 12.14(b) and 12.16(c), and the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942) for more information on these documentation and public access requirements.) (3) Disclosures. Units of general local government receiving assistance under this NOFA must make all applicant disclosure reports available to the public for five years. Required update reports must be made available along with the applicant disclosure reports, but in no case for a period less than three years. Each unit of general local government may use HUD Form 2880 to collect the disclosures, or may develop its own form. (See 24 CFR subpart C, and the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942) for further information on these disclosure requirements.) B. Allocation Amounts 1. Total Available Funding and Allocation The nonentitlement CDBG funds for New York State for FY 1994 total $50,616,000 and will be allocated as follows: a. Buffalo Office. $44,438,000 is allocated for distribution to eligible units of general local government within the jurisdiction of HUD's Buffalo Office. Maximum grant amounts for units of general local government under the jurisdiction of the Buffalo Office will be $400,000 for Single Purpose grant applications and $900,000 for Comprehensive grant applications, except that counties may apply for up to $600,000 in Single Purpose funds. The maximum amount for Single Purpose grant applications made jointly by units of general local government will be $600,000. b. New York Office. $6,178,000 is allocated for distribution to eligible units of general local government within the jurisdiction of HUD's New York Office. Maximum grant amounts for communities under the jurisdiction of the New York Office will be $400,000 for Single Purpose grants and $750,000 for Comprehensive grants, except that counties may apply for up to $600,000 in Single Purpose funds. The maximum amount for Single Purpose grant applications made jointly by units of general local government will be $600,000. 2. Distribution of Funds Between Single Purpose and Comprehensive Grants Generally, 85 percent of the funds allocated separately to the New York and Buffalo offices shall be for Single Purpose grants with the remaining 15 percent to be reserved for Comprehensive grants. However, in order to assure a competitive distribution of funds, each HUD office has the option to revise the division of funds between Single Purpose and Comprehensive grants to as low as 75 percent for Single Purpose and up to 25 percent for Comprehensive grants. Applicants requesting more that $600,000 in Comprehensive funding will be expected to provide clear and convincing evidence that the proposed activities will effectively address and correct conditions affecting large segments of the low- and moderate-income community, and that the grantee has the capability to expend the funds in a timely fashion. If this is not provided, the field office may reduce the grant amount. 3. Imminent Threats The criteria for grants to alleviate or remove imminent threats to health or safety that require an immediate solution are described at §570.432. All imminent threat projects must meet the national objective of benefitting low- and moderate-income persons. For FY 1994, $6,665,700 is being set aside in the Buffalo Office, and $926,700 is being set aside in the New York Office for imminent threat projects. These funds will be available in each office until the office completes the rating and ranking process for funds distributed under this NOFA. C. Eligibility 1. Eligible Applicants Eligible applicants are units of general local government in New York State, excluding: metropolitan cities, urban counties, units of government which are participating in urban counties or metropolitan cities even if only part of the participating unit of government is located in the urban county or metropolitan city, and Indian tribes eligible for assistance under section 106 of the HCD Act. Applications may be submitted individually or jointly. 2. Previous Grantees Eligible applicants, which previously have been awarded Small Cities Program CDBG grants, are also subject to an evaluation of capacity and performance. Numerical thresholds for drawdown of funds have been established to assist HUD in evaluating a grantee's progress in implementing its program activities. (These standards apply to all CDBG Program grants received by the community.) An additional threshold relates to the submission of annual Performance Assessment Reports (PARs) which are due annually for each grant which a local government has received. Failure to submit a PAR is not a curable technical deficiency. Applicants generally will be determined to have performed adequately in the area(s) where the thresholds are met. Where a threshold has not been met, HUD will evaluate the documentation of any mitigating factors, particularly with respect to actions taken by the applicant to accelerate the implementation of its program activities. 3. Eligible Activities and National Objectives Eligible activities under the Small Cities CDBG Program are those identified in subpart C of 24 CFR part 570. Each activity must meet one of the national objectives (i.e. benefit to low- and moderate-income persons, elimination of slums or blighting conditions, or meeting imminent threats to the health and safety of the community), and each grant must meet the requirements for compliance with the primary objective of principally benefitting low- and moderate-income persons, as required under the provisions of §570.200(a) (2) and (3) and §570.208, which supersede §570.420(h)(2). As described in Section I.A.3.a. of this NOFA, the principal benefit requirement was increased by NAHA from 60 to 70 percent. The method of calculating the use of these funds for compliance with the 70 percent overall benefit requirement is set forth in §570.200(a)(3) (i) through (v). 4. Environmental Review Requirement The HUD environmental review procedures contained in 24 CFR part 58 apply to this program. Under part 58, grantees assume all of the responsibilities for environmental review, decision-making and action pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the other provisions of law specified by the Secretary in 24 CFR part 58 that would apply to the Secretary were he to undertake such projects as Federal projects. D. Types of Grants 1. Comprehensive Grants a. General. Comprehensive grants are available to fund projects which meet the following criteria: (1) Address a substantial portion of the identified community development needs within a defined area or areas; (2) Involve two or more activities related to each other that will be carried out in a coordinated manner; (3) Have a beneficial impact within a reasonable period of time. HUD may make an exception to the requirement that all activities must be carried out in a defined area or areas if the applicant can demonstrate that the comprehensive strategy is a reasonable means of addressing identified needs. If an application for a Comprehensive grant does not meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Grant Program, HUD will rate the proposal as a Single Purpose grant.
