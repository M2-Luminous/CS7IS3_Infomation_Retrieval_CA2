"Inflation is not only their concern, it is also ours," said Finance Secretary Roberto F. De Ocampo. "But it is not the kind of concern that translates into panic." Last month's inflation rate hit 10.1 percent while the March and April levels were at 9.7 and 9.8 percent, respectively. A high inflation rate indicates rising cost of prices and a high level of liquidity in the system. The economic program drafted by the government for IMF approval sets an inflation target for the year of only 8.5 percent. A team from the IMF is currently in Manila to get an update on the economic performance of the Philippines during the first quarter of the year. "They are here to update their figures and make sure that it is in full consistency with what has been agreed upon," he said. The team began discussions with the technical committee of the Philippines, which drafted the three-year economic program submitted last month. "The review is in preparation for their orals when they defend the program in front of the (IMF) board," De Ocampo said. The IMF board is set to deliberate on the three-year economic program for the Philippines on 24 June. "The IMF board is in the process of reviewing our request for an extended fund facility amounting to $650 million," according to De Ocampo. "We are confident we will secure an IMF program, which will also enable us to proceed successfully with the much-awaited and long-delayed consultative group meeting for the Philippines on 21 to 22 July in Paris as well as the fifth Paris Club rescheduling," he said.
