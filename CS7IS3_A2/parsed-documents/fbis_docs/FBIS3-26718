During the second half of last year, monetary order was rectified, macroeconomic regulation and control was intensified, and the "Decisions on Several Issues Regarding the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" (the "50 Measures") were adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. These have exerted, and will continue to exert, a relatively positive impact on mainland China's economic development. In particular, the "50 Measures" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee can be called a programmatic document for mainland China to eventually realize the transition from a planned to a market economy. The outline of the basic ideas in this document was sketched out in 1988 when Zhao Ziyang was in power. Had it not been for the strong opposition from the conservative forces within and outside the party, and the backward forces in society at that time, against the mainland's economic structural reform, and the structural reform of prices in particular, these measures might have been introduced then and put into practice. It is a good thing that the work has begun after all, although it has been put off for four or five years. Moreover, judging from the systematic, comprehensive, and manipulative character of the document, the ideas in it are more mature than those in 1988; the fundamental tenets of the "market economy" have been more prominently stressed and defined. No doubt this marks a major historic advance in China. Deng Xiaoping Spoke Highly of the Creativity of the Decisions Adopted at the Plenary Session Deng Xiaoping himself was very pleased at this. At the time when Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping was published in the middle of November last year, just before the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee was held, Deng Xiaoping particularly pointed out: "The general guiding principle of this book lies in my speeches made during the south China tour at the beginning of last year (1992), in which I expressed some ideas on how to understand socialism and how to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. There was something new in them and some improvements had been made. The document adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee coincides with the meanings of my abovementioned speeches. It contains some new expressions that are not mine. This is very good, for this is creativity and development. If an idea or a concept can be proved in practice and further elaborated and developed, then it will have vitality and win support from the people. If we persistently follow this road and discover the law, the overall situation will not be hampered no matter whether someone is still alive or not and whether someone is in power or not. When this law works, the general direction will not be changed. I am most happy about this." Deng Xiaoping Places Hopes on Shanghai for Another Great Leap Forward Deng Xiaoping has been in high spirits recently. A short time ago, when accompanied by someone in his car driving along the Beijing Airport Expressway and the newly built Dongsanhuan Lu Bridge, he praised Beijing for "having a new atmosphere every year, which is very exciting." Recently, Deng went to Shanghai with his family for the Spring Festival there. Accompanied by his beloved daughter Mao Mao, he inspected the magnificent Yangpu Bridge on 13 December last year. Deng showed a special feeling for Shanghai when he said: "Shanghai is a place of blessing in China. People of our generation started a revolution in Shanghai at that time. Now, the development of China also needs another great leap forward that should start again from Shanghai. I have placed high hopes in Shanghai. Whether the work in Shanghai is well performed or not next year (1994) will have a bearing on the overall situation, so this step in the chess game must be made appropriately." Deng Xiaoping Once Again Stresses Faster Development Deng Xiaoping also stressed recently: "I think the last few years of the 20th century will be very advantageous to China. Many developing countries and regions all have a history of sustained economic growth for two or three decades. Will China be able to do the same? I think it is full of hope. Counting from 1980, we have only developed for a dozen years now. The comprehensive national strength has been augmented because we have chosen a correct path and the international climate is also favorable. These are basic conditions. Of course, we also have quite a few knotty problems. However, when we advance rapidly, we have more ways of solving these problems. That is why I feel that we must not slow down in the next few years. We must solve our problems in the course of development and spur development in the course of reform. We need not listen to some people's arguments abroad because they do not want to see a powerful China. They have failed to boost their economies, which has precisely offered us an opportunity. All countries are advancing and there is competition among them. Hence, we will suffer losses if the opportunity is seized by others. The problems with which China is now faced include a large population, the still unsteady position of agriculture as a foundation, and the still poor performance of most state-owned enterprises, which we must not treat lightly. We must take firm hold of these important matters which have a bearing on the overall situation and strive to make some new changes every year. In short, I am full of confidence." Is a Growth Rate of 9 Percent Appropriate? Will the mainland's economy continue to grow at the same high rate as last year? Will the economic structural reform which is being carried out on a large scale, go on smoothly? Everyone is following these two major issues with interest. In analyzing these issues, we may find the following phenomena worthy of further exploration. The problem of inflation. By October last year, the mainland's retail price index had risen by 14.5 percent, the index of residents' living expenses in 35 large and medium cities had risen by 20.1 percent, and the prices of daily necessities and labor services had increased by even larger margins. This year, as the prices of key industries and products such as petroleum oil, coal, communications, electricity, and so on will be raised successively, they will certainly bring about price rises in consumer goods and the agricultural means of production. As control on grain prices has been lifted and the price scissors of industrial and agricultural products has been gradually narrowed, the prices of essential consumer goods for daily life, such as grain, meat, poultry, eggs, vegetables, among other things will also rise substantially. Last September, the mainland's credit again showed an excessively rapid growth rate when the government injected credit funds into the economy to alleviate the problem of insolvency with which enterprises were universally confronted. The domestic credit, was increased on the mainland by a total of 199.5 billion yuan in the first nine months of last year. Of this, the September increase alone was 53.3 billion yuan with the growth rate reaching 26.7 percent. Among these increased credits, nearly three-quarters were used to meet enterprises' demands for circulating funds. In October, the government once again injected approximately 80 billion yuan as credit funds to satisfy the requirements for circulating funds. The credit growth contributed to the growth in money supply. As mainland economists pointed out, the experience of inflation in 1988 has proved that the growth in money supply has a notable impact on inflation and inflation comes after a growth in money supply. Therefore, the inflation triggered by the mainland money supply due to credit growth will be reflected on a large scale around March this year. By that time, the economic life on the mainland will very probably be in the situation where the economy will operate very rapidly as it did last June and, at the same time, inflation will pick up sharply. This will certainly bring about a rather unfavorable impact on the mainland's large-scale economic structural reform and its efforts to seek rapid economic development this year. When inflation reaches the limit of social and people's tolerance, it will inevitably give rise to social disturbances, about which the CPC hierarchy has been much worried. This is a matter to which people cannot help but pay special attention. It is said that there are different views in economic circles on the question of how rapidly the economy should grow this year. Even though the CPC hierarchy has recently determined that the economy should grow at 9 percent this year, some mainland economists still maintain that 7 to 8 percent will be more suitable because, if the monetary policy is relaxed too early, the positive results yielded by the measures taken since last July to rectify monetary order, intensify macroeconomic regulation and control, stabilize the economy, check inflation, and so on may be disrupted and high inflation may emerge again. This means that still more stringent measures must be adopted in the future to restore monetary order and stabilize the economy, so that the national economy will not once again fall into a vicious cycle of big ups and downs. Moreover, the rapid economic growth propped up by increased money supply will only retard the change from the old structure to the new and lead to a massive waste of natural resources and a confused condition in the economic sphere. However, there is very strong pressure from the governments of various localities on the mainland. They are calling for rapid growth and for the central authorities to ease credits and enlarge the scope of input and those advocating accelerating both reform and development simultaneously have got the upper hand. Under these circumstances, the CPC hierarchy has won the support and confidence of governments in various localities and is willing to adopt a compliant attitude in exchange for their recognition of the central authority. In addition, Deng Xiaoping's recently repeated emphasis on a faster growth is also a principle that the CPC hierarchy should follow in determining this year's growth rate. At present, as regards the policy of tightening currency, the CPC hierarchy has tried its best to avoid some expressions which have been used since last July. This signifies that it has put more stress on the policy idea of an "accelerated development." Perhaps after March or April this year, there will be some indications concerning the actual effect that this policy tendency will produce. The mainland's economic circles predict that if this year's credit and money placement are arranged in line with the growth rate of 9 percent, the "policy of tightening up money supply" may be abandoned and inflation will continue to pick up. The soaring prices of consumer goods in various large cities on the mainland a short time ago were a signal of that. Agriculture Faces Two Major Tough Problems The problems in agriculture. The problem of "issuing IOU notes" which emerged universally in rural areas in 1992, has hurt peasants and encroached on their interests. Last year, the CPC hierarchy adopted some measures and reaped certain positive results. However, the rapid industrial growth and the chaotic monetary order on the mainland last year caused a substantial amount of funds to transfer from agriculture to nonagriculture, so that "intensifying the position of agriculture as a foundation" became "empty talk" to a considerable extent. Last year, the output of several major agricultural products was lower than in 1992 and the condition that agricultural growth was not coordinated with industrial growth further deteriorated. Hence, insufficient supplies of agricultural products will be fully exposed this year. Today, there are two major problems which face agriculture. One is that peasants' income has been continuously declining over the past few years and the sustained growth of peasants' income of the early 1980's no longer exists. High inflation, high production costs, large amounts of fundraising, and large amounts of apportionment have become onerous burdens which the peasants are unable to bear and the reduction of agricultural income has dampened peasants' enthusiasm in farming, year after year. The mainland's economic reform started from the rural areas but the reform measures which have been introduced since the late 1980's have not brought many substantive benefits to the peasants or to the rural economy. While the market economy is eliminating backward rural production modes, peasants have not generally benefited from this and their participation in the large-scale socialized production system will inevitably cause a considerable number of them to pay the price of becoming relatively poor. As peasants on the mainland number 800 million, any proportion of them being reduced to poverty will bring a powerful onslaught on social, political, and economic lives throughout the country. Therefore, in the reform process to establish a market economy, how to diminish this degree of poverty in the best possible way and enable the vast numbers of peasants to gradually adapt themselves to the requirements of the economic transformation and universally benefit from the reform, is a very tough problem. Due to the constant decline in their income over the past few years, peasants have not been as "temperate, kind, courteous, and obedient" as they once were. Since last year, several dozen incidents of violent protest have occurred in various rural areas. In some areas, such as Renshou County in Sichuan Province, the peasants' protest was staged on a very large scale. These phenomena merit the CPC hierarchy's serious attention. Another major problem in agriculture is the outlet for a large number of surplus laborers. According to a survey, the surplus labor power in rural areas now numbers approximately 110 million, about 80 percent of whom have quit the rural areas and formed an enormous "floating population" moving here and there all over the country. As viewed from a positive angle, this huge "floating population" has provided the economic growth in the developed regions with affluent resources of labor power. Taken from a negative angle, however, the "floating population" has exerted great pressure on maintaining social order and stability. According to the economic development level on the mainland at present, only 30 to 40 percent of the rural surplus labor power can find jobs (including those absorbed by township and town enterprises). The rest of them mostly do not have a way out. Today, it is a general phenomenon in rural areas that only the old, underaged, weak, and female residents remain in the fields, while the able and strong laborers are unwilling to do farm work. How can this situation not cripple agriculture as a foundation? In this connection, many economists have reminded the CPC hierarchy of the necessity to seriously handle the agricultural problem and to introduce policies and measures like those in the 1980's to effect a major breakthrough in the 1990's so as to reverse the increasingly backward agricultural conditions in China. Reasons Why the Campaign Against Corruption Cannot Be Carried Out Thoroughly The corruption issue. In a bid to overcome the constantly spreading corrupt phenomena among government officials, the CPC hierarchy has made a series of arrangements and adopted a number of measures since last August; the understanding of the corruption problem has been deepened and considerably greater attention has been paid to it, in attitude at least, because the hierarchy does not feel as shy or that it is necessary to cover it up now as it did before. But, what are the actual results? More than six months have passed and it should be admitted that there is still a big gap between the achievements and the expectations of the people at the beginning of the campaign. Many "major and serious" cases of corruption, which have been exposed and brought to light, could not be handled smoothly and had to be laid aside, to say nothing of those that have been covered up, evaded, or ignored. There are two basic systems responsible for handling the corrupt cases--the public security organs, procuratorial organs, and people's courts outside the party; and the departments for discipline inspection within the party. The way of handling cases by both systems is of a closed nature, with different criteria and methods, but with identical practice--details may or may not be made public to the people in society. Both systems work "under the unified leadership of the party" and the views of party committees have the functions of "final adjudication." It is very difficult to guarantee the fair and legal handling of the corrupt problems in this way. In addition, the CPC's basic consideration for handling the corrupt problems is "stability." It will only act if things are beneficial to stability so it cannot really "act in accordance with the law." Moreover, the mainland's current economic structure is a "mixture" of power economy plus market economy. The rationality and irrationality of bartering money for power are mutually complementary and can be proved using two different rules, hence, it is not so easy to determine which is legal and which is illegal. It has been reported that there was also such a problem in handling the swindling case of the "Great Wall Machinery and Electrical Appliances," which was ferreted out last June. Some senior officials involved in the case were able to prove that their conduct was "legal" by invoking relevant legal provisions, while they were proved "guilty" according to relevant policies and stipulations promulgated within the party. The "two contradictory laws" have deferred the handling of the case even after stalling for a long time. That is why relevant personalities in legal circles, who were acquainted with the details of the case, pointed out that the conflict between "policy" and "law" is an inevitable product in countries ruled by a single party. Under the conditions that the party alone has been in power for a long time, the ruling party need not and cannot formulate laws which it has an obligation to abide by and comply with. Its basic point of departure in formulating laws is to safeguard the ruling position of the party. When the general applicability of the laws affects its ruling interests, the laws must make way for its policies. The existing Chinese Constitution makes definite stipulations on "upholding the four cardinal principles," the first principle of which is to "uphold the CPC's leadership." This stipulation is binding on various social strata but it is only a "safeguarding force" rather than a binding force on the CPC itself. In this regard, as viewed from the angle of "binding," the whole Constitution has no effect on the CPC--the only party in power and no political forces in the entire mainland society can supervise and standardize the CPC's political conduct with this Constitution. Perhaps this is a fundamental reason that the CPC is unable to depend on laws to overcome its own corrupt phenomena. This year, the CPC will carry out large-scale reform in the economic area. One of its main ideas is to change the "dual" structure of "power plus market." Originally, this can be regarded as a fundamental measure to stop officials from seeking economic interests by abuse of powers. However, people are in doubt--to what extent will government officials at various levels, who have gained enormous interests in the "dual" structure of "power plus market," support and welcome this kind of reform? In the change and transformation from a "double-track" structure to a "single-track" structure, how many illegal interests will be transformed into legal interests? These problems can constitute a major obstacle to the large-scale reform of the economic structure. A phenomenon which merits people's attention is thatthe ultra-leftist and conservative forces within the CPC are particularly active in the anticorruption campaign. However, it was precisely these people who reaped exorbitant profits in the "double-track system." This group of people could not accept the market economy but they would accept the economy of "power plus market." One of their principal objectives in performing actively in the anticorruption campaign was to safeguard the "power plus market" economic structure because, by so doing, they could have the grounds for maintaining their "planned control" over the economic life and, simultaneously, have the means for seeking personal benefits from the market. They took advantage of the anticorruption campaign to prove that the CPC was capable of exercising self-discipline to work honestly, so they must wield the power of direct intervention in the economic life. Such political intentions of the CPC's ultra-leftist and conservative forces should be detected and exposed to prevent them from turning the anticorruption campaign into an antireform political action. Stability Can Hardly Be Effected by Exercising Control The stability issue. To the CPC hierarchy, the maintenance of political stability is a matter of paramount importance. The CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee specially held an enlarged meeting at the end of last year to discuss this issue and make decisions. The meeting stressed that the first task of maintaining stability is to "resolutely suppress and crack down on various kinds of antirevolutionary activities conducted by the antagonistic forces at home and abroad and particular attention should be paid to cracking down on those organized political opposition activities." Another task is to effectively grasp and ontrol the press, cultural, and propaganda departments, to stress the "theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the party's basic line, and the themes of patriotism, collectivism, socialism, and traditional virtues of the Chinese nation," and to ban the words and deeds regarding bourgeois liberalization, extreme individualism, hedonism, and money worship from appearing in any form in news reporting and propaganda material. According to this strategy, relevant departments have adopted tight and stringent measures to control political, cultural, press, propaganda, and other areas. The censorship in films, press, and publication has been intensified, and almost every month the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department issues directives that articles concerning such and such films, performers, news themes, books, periodicals, and authors "must not be reported and propagated," or "must be criticized," or "must be ordered to suspend publication and make self examination." The Central Propaganda Department also stipulated that various major newspapers, broadcasting stations, and television stations at the central level "must submit their plans for news reporting and theme selection" and "must refrain from presumptuously publishing reports not included for selection" on a regular basis. Personalities from mainland press and cultural circles have a common feeling: "The control of press and culture at present is nearly the same as that during the decade of the `Cultural Revolution.'" Today, press and publications are flooded with illogical, undemonstrable, and unconvincing reports and articles which are simply dull preaching full of outmoded ideology. The people's voices, thoughts, and views are nowhere to be heard or seen and there are terribly few articles with insight and of good quality which can help people understand important international and domestic events. In short, there are no academic contentions, free discussions, criticism on work errors of government officials, or news reports which the masses wish to know in the press. However, such an inanimate and lifeless atmosphere of propaganda and public opinion is eulogized as the "press opinion exercising leadership over social opinion and being higher than social opinion." Relevant departments maintain that only by strictly controlling political, cultural, press, and other areas can political and social stability be guaranteed on the mainland. They do not understand that the multiple public interests, the diversified social life, and the wider openness brought by the mainland's economic structural reform can no longer be accepted and controlled by centralized politics and "unified opinion." A major contradiction, brought about by the authorities in pushing forward the economic structural reform through the traditional political structure and opinion control mode, has blocked and cut off the channels and bridges of exchange and linkage that promote the understanding between the officials and the ordinary people, so that the ability of the ruling party and government to respond to social changes and demands has become less flexible and they are unable to obtain understanding and support from the people when the economic reform meets with difficulties and obstacles. What is more, social contradictions will be sharpened and social unrest will be triggered off. The 4 June incident in 1989 did not occur because the political structural reform took the lead and the CPC's authority declined but because the reform lagged behind and even retrogressed. In summing up lessons after the 4 June incident, someone from the CPC hierarchy maintained that bourgeois liberalization had crippled the CPC's leadership. Hence, only by opposing "liberalization" can the CPC's ruling position be solidified. Since the coup d'etat in the Soviet Union on 19 August 1991, the CPC hierarchy, led by Deng Xiaoping, has acquired a new understanding of the above conclusion and believes that "China will come to a blind alley unless it persists in reform and opening up." Afterward, it came to realize the "necessity to maintain vigilance against the right tendencies but primarily guarding against the "left" tendencies because the latter is also a major cause of weakening the ruling position of the Communist Party. However, this understanding only remains in stressing the "need to further carry out economic structural reform" and the CPC, by and large, sticks to the previous traditional concept with regard to the political structural reform. This is shown in the wording about the political structural reform written in the "Decisions" adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Constructive Remarks of Mainland People of Insight Mainland people of insight point out: The general mood of the authorities has fallen into an erroneous sphere. On the mainland, the broad masses' support given to the CPC has, on the whole, not been changed (given the numerous complaints and dissatisfaction) because the people are clear that the CPC has performed meritorious deeds over the past few years, as they have benefited from reform and opening up. There are no other political forces in China that are able and qualified to replace the CPC. The CPC should have confidence in this. However, the CPC should also understand that it should not just rely on unflinchingly pushing forward the economic reform to enhance and consolidate its ruling position but should also rely on unflinchingly pushing forward the political reform, as this is a basic condition to ensure that the people will make concerted efforts with the ruling party to maintain basic social stability. To have a democratic political advantage is more conducive to maintaining the CPC's ruling position and the stability of the country than to have its "traditional political advantage." The establishment of a democratic political structure is also of great benefit to the ruling party in developing and fostering new political resources for use by itself. The people's expression of support for and participation in the political activities of the ruling party through various forms of democratic politics will have a greater political cohesiveness than the mere instillation of the "loyalty awareness" into the people. It is hoped that the CPC hierarchy will give careful consideration to these constructive remarks.
