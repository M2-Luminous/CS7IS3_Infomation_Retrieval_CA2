FR940505-1-00184 FR940505-1-00012 As part of the FIP, EPA is including a parking cash out regulation. Under this regulation, employers would offer employees the option of taking the cash value of employer paid parking as a financial incentive to reduce solo commuting. Where applicable, employers would be able to include a parking cash out incentive as part of their ECO program trip reduction plans. d. ECO rule development issues. Because the following components are common to other trip reduction regulations in California or are discussed extensively in EPA's ECO Guidance , EPA wishes to discuss these issues and the agency's rationale for not incorporating them into the proposed ECO regulation. First, this proposed ECO regulation does not allow for APO averaging, banking or trading. Including such a component within the ECO regulation would add an administrative and enforcement burden beyond EPA's present resources and is perhaps better administered at the local level. Should the state or local agencies develop an ECO regulation with APO averaging, banking, or trading consistent with EPA's ECO Guidance, EPA would accept such a regulation for review and possible approval and incorporation into the SIP as a replacement for the proposed federal ECO program. Related to the issue of APO averaging and trading is the issue of consolidated compliance plans. The proposed ECO regulation requires employers to achieve the APO target at each work location. Again, this is due to EPA's administrative and enforcement resource constraints. Therefore, to provide this type of individual employer accountability for achieving the APO target, the proposed ECO regulation does not allow consolidated compliance plans. A single employer with multiple work locations or a confederation of employers with geographically related work locations, such as a business park, are thus not allowed to average their APO survey results together to achieve the target APO. However, the proposed ECO regulation does not preclude employers from forming or participating in transportation management associations or using complementary ridesharing and commuter matching services to reduce trips to their respective work locations and promote ridesharing, so long as they demonstrate compliance at each individual worksite. Second, this ECO proposed regulation does not divide the Sacramento ECO program area into subregional AVO zones or target areas for the purpose of achieving the target APO. Subregional AVO zones or target areas would allow different geographic subregions to start from different existing AVO baselines for the purpose of calculating the APO target. Thus, different subregions could have different APO targets, but still meet the performance requirement of Section 182(d)(1)(B), a 25 percent increase in APO from the AVO baseline. AVO zones may be applicable within the Sacramento ECO program area if there are significant subregional differences in commute patterns, land use, transit availability, and baseline AVO. However, EPA has no information to suggest that these differences do exist. To conclusively assess whether or not these differences exist and develop subregional AVO zones would require detailed surveys of home to work commute patterns in the Sacramento ECO program area to supplement 1990 census data and the 1991 Caltrans State Travel Survey. Should California conduct such surveys and determine it appropriate, the State could include AVO zones in its ECO SIP. As a third and final issue, this regulation does not allow for APO crediting from the use of satellite work stations. Cold start emissions from motor vehicles are a significant proportion of motor vehicle emissions and will become an even larger proportion as future motor vehicles run cleaner. Consequently, EPA believes that satellite work stations are a relatively ineffective strategy for reducing vehicle emissions and vehicle trips unless they can reduce a significantly large vehicle miles traveled component of a work trip or allow an employee to substitute a commute mode of travel other than a motor vehicle. Based on its understanding of Sacramento commuting patterns, EPA concluded that this kind of vehicles miles traveled reduction through use of satellite work stations would not occur in Sacramento and has therefore not included credit for them in the FIP. However, this proposed ECO regulation does provide for telecommuting from home as an acceptable trip reduction strategy in employer compliance plans. EPA believes that telecommuting from home is a very effective trip reduction measure because an entire commute trip is eliminated when an employee works out of his or her home.
