It is a compensation for the nuclear warheads Ukraine has dismantled. This means that practical implementation has begun of the measures envisioned in the trilateral statement signed by the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the United States in Moscow in January. According to specialists, the fuel delivered to the Zaporizhzhe nuclear power station will suffice to keep one of five power-generating units operating for a year and give Ukraine 5.5 to six billion kilowatt hours of cheap electricity.
