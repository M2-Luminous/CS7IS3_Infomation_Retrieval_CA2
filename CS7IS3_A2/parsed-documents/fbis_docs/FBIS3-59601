The new CS6400 systems are available with four to 64 Sparc processors and have a United States list price beginning at under ECU350,000. In Europe, two sales have already been announced. In Europe, there are already two announced sales. The research division of Electricite de France (EDF), the world's largest electrical utility, based in Clamart, will be an early customer. A 16-processor system with two Gbytes of central memory will be shipped during November and the system will be upgraded to 32 processors and four Gbytes of memory in 1994. Terms were not disclosed. EDF, a long-time Cray Research customer, has plans to use the CS6400 for scientific, engineering and data management applications serving users of EDF's extensive computer network. "We will use the Cray Superserver 6400 system to provide enterprise level general computing services to various organisations within EDF," said Michel Pavard, head of EDF's data processing and applied mathematics unit. "We were looking for a high-performance Unix server to support a variety of applications and a large number of users, and the Cray Superserver 6400 system was our choice. With its data centre capabilities, scalability and excellent price/performance the system fits nicely into our existing network." The German electronics firm SICAN has also ordered a CS6400 system. The German electronics firm SICAN, based in Hannover, has also ordered, and is scheduled to receive, a CS6400 system in the first quarter of 1994. SICAN will initially receive a 20-processor system that will be upgraded later in 1994 to a 48-processor system. Again, terms were not disclosed. SICAN provides design services for German and United States based industries that use Applications Specific Integrate Circuits (ASICS) and full custom designs. The CS6400 system will be used for highly scalar Electronic Computer-Aided Design (ECAD) applications, as well as for data management. "We are targeting the CS6400 for a number of electronic design codes including commercially available programs and those we've developed in-house," said Hans Weinerth, chairman and CEO for SICAN. "The CS6400 is an outstanding option for us since most of our codes now run on our more than 50 Sun systems. We know that these same codes will run without recompilation on the CS6400, which will provide a central, powerful and cost-effective resource for our many desktop Sun users. In effect, the CS6400 allows us to upgrade each of our workstations with one single purchase."
