SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act Statement The information collection requirements contained in this NOFA have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. OMB has approved the section 8 information collection requirements under the assigned control number 2577&hyph;0169. (I) Purpose and Substantive Description (A) Background Section 6 of the HUD Demonstration Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;120, 107 Stat. 1144, approved October 27, 1993) directs the Secretary of HUD to carry out a demonstration program to attract pension fund investment in affordable housing through the use of project-based rental assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937. In carrying out this demonstration program the Secretary must ensure that not less than 50 percent of the funds appropriated for each year are used in conjunction with the disposition of either: (1) Multifamily properties owned by the Department; or (2) multifamily properties securing mortgages held by the Department. An appropriation of $100 million for fiscal year 1994 was authorized and has been provided to carry out this demonstration program. Project-based section 8 assistance under the program will be provided pursuant to a contract entered into by the Secretary and the owner of the eligible housing that: (1) Provides assistance for a term which, taking into account the financing and other factors relating to the specific project proposal, is not less than 60 and not greater than 180 months; and (2) provides for contract rents to be determined by the Secretary. The Fair Market Rent Schedule for this demonstration is 120 percent of the Existing Housing Fair Market Rent Schedule most recently published in the Federal Register . Initial gross rents (contract rents plus allowance for tenant paid utilities) for any new construction project, and any substantial rehabilitation project with per unit rehabilitation costs of $5000 or more, may not exceed the Fair Market Rents applicable to this demonstration. Initial gross rents for any substantial rehabilitation project with per unit rehabilitation costs of less than $5000 may not exceed 100 percent of the published Existing Housing Fair Market Rent Schedule. Contract rents must be reasonable on the basis of comparison with rents for unsubsidized units of similar age, design and location which include comparable amenities and services. HUD's multifamily mortgage insurance programs, the risk sharing programs under section 542 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, and Farmers Home Administration loan and loan guarantee programs are not available for housing developed or assisted under this demonstration program. A pension fund may not have an ownership interest in a project for which a project-specific proposal is submitted to HUD or for which assistance is provided under this demonstration. The Secretary may establish such other standards regarding financing and securitization of project mortgages as the Secretary deems appropriate. This NOFA announces the availability of $100 million in FY 1994 section 8 budget authority to carry out this demonstration program which will assist between approximately 900 and 2500 units. The number that can be assisted will vary depending on the level of gross rents (i.e., contract rents plus allowance for tenant paid utilities), contract administration fee and term of contract.
