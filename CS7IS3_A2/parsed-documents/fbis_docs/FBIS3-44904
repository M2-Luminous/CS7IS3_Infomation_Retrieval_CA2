Kinkel was speaking to reporters three days before the NATO summit meeting in Brussels, which is expected to offer all East European states and Russia closer military links through a so-called "partnership for peace" program. "What East European countries want now is something they cannot get, at least not in the initial phase," Kinkel said. NATO has decided to involve East European states in closer bilateral military relations but because of opposition from Russia has not agreed to offer them full membership at the present time. On Thursday [6 January], Russian President Boris Yeltsin's chief spokesman said that NATO's acceptance of East European states as full members could wreck reforms in Russia, boost extreme nationalism, infuriate the Russian Army and force Moscow to set up its own military-political bloc. Germany was one of the first NATO members to back bids for membership in NATO from a number of East European states, including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic and Slovak. Kinkel told the reporters that Germany has done "all it could" to bring East European states closer to NATO membership but that they were exerting "unrelenting pressure" on Germany to persuade NATO to offer them security guarantees.
