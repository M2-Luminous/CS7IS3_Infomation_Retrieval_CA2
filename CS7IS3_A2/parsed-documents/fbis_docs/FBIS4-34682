Indians from the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador [Conaie] appeared today before the Court of Constitutional Guarantees to pressure the court into handing down a decision that declares the Land Development Law unconstitutional. Conaie President Luis Macas denied having reached an agreement with the government regarding the formation of a joint commission to regulate the law's enforcement. [Begin Macas recording] The government is responsible for what has happened up to now. Obviously, the National Congress is equally responsible. We would also like to make one thing clear: We realize it is extremely difficult for the Ecuadoran people to understand us. We would like to say, however, that those who are spreading uncertainty and violence in the countryside are those who violated the Constitution at the National Congress, followed by the president's sanctioning of an unconstitutional law. [end recording] The Indians, who came down from several Ecuadoran mountain provinces, chanted slogans and said their protests will only end with the repeal of the law or with their deaths. Carlos Jaramillo, president of the Court of Constitutional Guarantees, promised to process the Indian request as quickly as possible. Luis Macas, on behalf of the Ecuadoran Indian communities, discarded the possibility of reaching any type of agreement with the government. He assured that the Indians would only end their protest when the land law is repealed. The Indian uprising, then, will continue to pressure the Court of Constitutional Guarantees to overturn the law. Chimborazo Province is completely paralyzed at this time by the Indian demonstrations. In our midday newscast, we reported on the situation there with statements by one of the strike coordinators. In the town of Guamote, Indians occupied the main administration building. This morning, they said they are ready to go as far as they have to. They are also demanding the government revoke the law. Deputy-elect (Cesar Vuelva) of Chimborazo Province said they will not return to their homes until the law is annulled. [Begin (Vuelva) recording] Three Indians have died -- one from Tungurahua and two from Canar province -- and we still have no specific answer to our request from the president. They may propose we reform the law's articles, or to draft the regulations to enforce the law. We cannot support this. The rank and file of the Indian organizations have ordered us to demand absolute repeal of the law. (Vuelva) maintains that the peasant-Indian coordinating board is more united now than ever before, and no one will be able to dissolve the peasants' organizations.
