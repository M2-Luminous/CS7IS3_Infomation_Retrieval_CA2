The accord of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks came last month under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. However, Eijiro Hata, agriculture, forestry and fisheries minister, said such measures will not be included in the primary budget for fiscal 1994 which starts April 1. The first meeting of the Agricultural Administration Council to discuss drawing up the farm measures will be held on Tuesday, Hata told reporters after a regular cabinet meeting. The steps will be compiled by the summer, Hata said.
