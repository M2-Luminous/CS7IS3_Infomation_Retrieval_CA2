In other words, the indoctrination in the chuche idea, including indoctrination in the principle of the chuche idea, indoctrination in class character, indoctrination in the revolutionary tradition, indoctrination in party policies, and indoctrination in socialist patriotism, is an ideological indoctrination to strengthen the main force of the revolution by firmly arming our party members and working people with a chuche-oriented revolutionary view of the world. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: The basic purpose of the indoctrination in the chuche idea is, in a nutshell, to guarantee unity of ideological will in the revolutionary ranks by arming the popular masses, who are the main force of the revolution, with a revolutionary independence ideology and to lead the popular masses to maintain the position as masters and to play the role as masters in the revolution and construction. Now, let us discuss why the indoctrination in the chuche idea is an indoctrination to strengthen the main force of the revolution. It is because the primary purpose of the indoctrination in the chuche idea is to guarantee unity of ideological will in the revolutionary ranks by arming the popular masses with a revolutionary independence ideology. The mission of the working class' party is to successfully push ahead with the revolution and construction and, thus, to completely realize independence of the working masses of people. In order to do this, it is imperative not only to achieve the cause of national liberation and class liberation, but also to consummate the cause of socialism and communism. For this end, it is necessary to have the inexhaustible strength capable of pushing ahead with and consummating these causes. The source of the inexhaustible strength lies in that all the people firmly unite around the party and the leader [suryong] with one ideological will. However, such unity does not come spontaneously. To achieve firm unity in the revolutionary ranks it is imperative to see to it that only one ideology prevails in the ranks. Only by doing so can unity of ideological will be achieved and great strength be displayed in the revolutionary ranks. However, even though one ideology prevails in the revolutionary ranks, firm unity is not achieved spontaneously. Only the revolutionary ideology of the working class' leader [suryong], that is, the revolutionary ideology which most thoroughly and correctly reflects the independent demands and interests of the working masses of people, should prevail in the revolutionary ranks. The chuche idea is a revolutionary independence ideology, which most correctly and thoroughly reflects and has codified the independent demands and interests of the working masses of people. Therefore, there is no mightier ideology than the chuche idea in realizing unity and cohesion of the revolutionary ranks. The popular masses can firmly unite around the party and the leader [suryong] and display mighty strength only when they arm themselves with the chuche idea. Accordingly, guaranteeing unity of ideological will of the revolutionary ranks by firmly arming the popular masses with the revolutionary independence ideology is the primary purpose of our party's indoctrination in the chuche idea. That the indoctrination in the chuche idea is an indoctrination to strengthen the main force of the revolution is also because the primary purpose of the indoctrination in the chuche idea leads the popular masses to maintain the position as masters of and to play the role as masters of the revolution and construction. The revolution is carried out by the working masses under the leadership of the party and the leader [suryong]. Therefore, to properly carry out the revolution and construction it is imperative for the popular masses to assume the attitude of being masters of the revolution and construction. The same may be said of the case of a household. Only when all members of the household, not only the housewife, manage household affairs with the position and attitude of being the housewife of the household can the household affairs be properly managed. Likewise, to successfully carry out the revolution and construction it is imperative for the popular masses, who are the people in charge of the revolution and construction, to thoroughly adhere to the position as masters and to smoothly play the role as masters. To see to it that the popular masses maintain the position as masters in the revolution and construction and play the role as masters, it is imperative to strengthen among them ideological indoctrination work to enhance the awareness of being masters. The chuche idea demands that the popular masses have the attitude of being masters in the revolution and construction. When people firmly arm themselves with the chuche idea they can not only adhere to their independent and creative position, but also maintain the position as masters and display the role as masters in the revolution and construction. In this way, leading the popular masses to have the attitude of being the master in the revolution and construction is not only the inherent demand of the revolutionary struggle itself, but also the inherent demand of the chuche idea. Herein lies the reason why the indoctrination in the chuche idea is an indoctrination to lead the popular masses to maintain their position as masters of and to play the role of masters of the revolution and construction. In this way, the indoctrination in the chuche idea, including indoctrination in the principles of the chuche idea, indoctrination in party policies, indoctrination in socialist patriotism, and indoctrination in class character, is the indoctrination to strengthen the main force of the revolution. As the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has systematized scientifically and theoretically that the indoctrination in the chuche idea is an indoctrination to strengthen the main force of the revolution and has clearly elucidated the overall task and direction of ideological indoctrination work a guiding principle which makes it possible to further strengthen and develop ideological indoctrination work among party members and the working people has been provided.
