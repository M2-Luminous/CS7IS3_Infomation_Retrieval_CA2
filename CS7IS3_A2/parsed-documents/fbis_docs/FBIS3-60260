In the morning, the National Assembly deputies discussed a draft law on environment protection. In the afternoon, they discussed a draft law on business bankruptcy." You, friends, are invited to listen to the following report on the National Assembly's group discussions on the draft law on environmental protection: "The National Assembly reserved the whole morning session for deputies to discuss the draft law on environmental protection. The general views expressed by almost all the deputies at their group discussions asserted the need to promptly promulgate an environment law. Many deputies agreed with the goals of the draft law, namely, to prevent and overcome bad consequences caused by human beings and nature; and to rationally regulate the exploitation and use of the environment in support of long-term national construction." Deputies contributed their views on every single chapter of the draft law. A Kien Giang Province deputy said the contents of the draft law were too general, especially with those measures to deal with environment violations. A Ho Chi Minh city deputy asked that the phrase "The Right to Live in a Healthy Environment Is a Human Right" be added to the preamble. "The feasibility of this law was fervently discussed by the deputies. Many of them maintained that to make it possible for the law on environmental protection to enter into life, we should delegate localities with more powers, set up a government agency to provide guidance for environmental protection activities, and draw up clear-cut measures to deal with environment law violations." Deputies from Minh Hai, Kien Giang, Hanoi, and Ho Chi Minh City said environmental pollution in urban areas is now relatively grave due to the presence of many heaps of garbage and the poor maintenance of public toilets. Agriculturally, deputies from Ha Tay, Hoa Binh, Vinh Phu, and An Giang Provinces also complained about the indiscrimate use of insecticide by peasants, and this, according to them, has adversely affected livestocks and food products. Some deputies said overuse of fertilizer and insecticide has resulted in the extinction of almost all of useful creatures in ricefields such as frogs, crabs, and mollusks. A deputy denounced a paint factory in Ha Tay for pouring its industrial waste into the Song Nghe River, polluting it and killing fish in its hatcheries. Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province Deputy Do Quoc Hung said: [begin recording] I think it is very necessary to promulgate this law, especially in the current circumstance. I agree with the proposal that we call this law the law on environmental protection [end recording]. Recommending measures to overcome the state of environmental pollution, Kien Giang Province Deputy Nguyen Duc Thang said: [begin recording] In the Mekong River Delta, we should do away with the presence of latrines built along irrigation canals and ditches if we want to keep our environment clean and beautiful [end recording]. Deputies from Ha Tay and Hoa Binh Provinces stated that while our country is stepping up the industrial process and broadening cooperation with foreign countries, the prompt promulgation of a law on environmental protection is very necessary. Ha Tay Province Deputy Nguyen Phuc Dinh said: [begin recording]It is very necessary for the fourth session of the Ninth National Assembly to pass the law on environmental protection. This is because in national industrialization, we must specify which chemicals are toxic and harmful to health and which are not [end recording].
