The leadership of the Inkatha Freedom Party, the Pan-Africanist Congress, the Democratic Party, as well as representatives of Bophuthatswana and Ciskei, were involved in the discussions, which took place at Midrand. A short while ago the parties said at a news conference that they consider the double ballot paper as a fundamental, nonnegotiable right. An action committee has been established to arrange a meeting with President F. W. de K lerk before Monday, at which the matter would be discussed further. According to the negotiators, other steps could be applied to ensure a double ballot paper, should the current efforts fail. Earlier today the discussions had to be interrupted when a bomb threat was received, but the police were unable to find a bomb.
