According to a recent statement by a majlis leader, the majlis has indisputable influence over an absolute majority of voters among the Crimean-Tatars. On the other hand, Vashtiy Abdurayimov, the leader of the National Movement of Crimean Tatars, who became head of the organization after the death of its founder and leader Yuriy Osmanov, stressed that the majlis was in fact betraying the national interests of the Crimean Tatars. In Abdurayimov's opinion, the Crimean Tatars must by all means vote in the Crimean presidential elections in order to elect a president who would more or less suit the Crimean-Tatar people. According to some sources, Abdurayimov is inclined to support the candidacy of Ivan Yermakov, Ukraine's presidential representative in Sevastopol, deputy chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council [as received]. Majlis leader Mustafa Dzhamilev is known to have recently met President Kravchuk. Although the results of the talks are not known, local observers believe they reached a certain, if not full understanding.
