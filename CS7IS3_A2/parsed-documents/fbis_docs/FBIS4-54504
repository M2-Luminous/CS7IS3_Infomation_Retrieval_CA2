FBIS4-54504 "dreeu084_c_94003" FBIS-EEU-94-084 Daily Report 22 Feb 1994 CZECH REPUBLIC Military Pay Changes Approved by Parliament Military Pay Changes Approved by Parliament 94CH0210E Prague A REPORT in Czech 22 Feb 94 p 1 94CH0210E Prague A REPORT Czech CSO [Article by sta: "Parliament Has Approved the Amendment to Law No. 143 on Pay and Emoluments"] [Text] On the first day of its 16th session, the Chamber of Deputies of parliament (15 February 1994) approved an amendment to change and augment Law No. 143/1992 Collection of Laws [Sb.] on pay and emoluments for readiness to work in budgetary and some additional organizations, as specified in subsequent regulations. This law becomes effective on 1 April 1994. The following provision is among the most important changes based on the language of the amendment: Paragraph 4 of Section 16 is eliminated. It said: "Pay is payable in the month in which the service relationship comes into being or continues." In practical terms, this meant that soldiers received their pay, for example, on 15 November for that entire month, their pay being thus "half ahead." The amendment changes this paragraph so that pay will be due in the future for the preceding month worked--that is to say, in practical terms, pay will be due in May for April. An additional substantial modification is the introduction of the institution of so-called additional pay. This is nothing other than a 13th payday, or possibly even an additional payday. Inserted after Section 15 of the amendment is a new section, Section 15a, that states the following: "Additional pay--In fulfilling conditions stipulated by government regulations, employees are eligible for additional pay in a calendar year." The specific nature of applying this provision currently depends on the government regulation that is under preparation and that should be adopted in March. As we found out in the lobbies of parliament, in the Army there is supposed to be a 13th payday for which the sponsor of the amendment has stipulated two variations of the due date. One of the variations speaks of the halfway point in this year; a second talks about the halfway point in 1995.
