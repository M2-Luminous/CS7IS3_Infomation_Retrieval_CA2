We have no doubt in our mind that the United States has abdicated that role -- the role of evenhanded broker and full partner. The United States cannot be unaware of the neutrality and evenhandedness that such a role presupposes if it is to lead to the establishment of a peace predicated on justice. Israel, however, does not want the United States to play such a role. Invariably, Israel is prepared to empty any international role of its content if it is based on the principles of international legitimacy and justice. No wonder top Israeli officials have advised against another tour of the Middle East by the U.S. secretary of state. Israel has no need for forward movement in the peace process; it wants Washington to stay as strongly biased to its wrongheadedness and aggression as it has been for the past half century and to continue as its protector in international forums. Israeli leaders are anxious for the United States to be little more than a false witness to separate deals that impose Israel's terms on the Arab states one by one, thereby enabling it not only to retain Arab territory but to ensure its edge over the combined Arabs. We do not think the U.S. administration, the one superpower on Earth, which has taken on the challenge of bringing peace to this region, will acquiesce in its role being so reduced. The United States is much too important a world power to bow to the will of a recalcitrant party flying in the face of international law and UN resolutions. It does not serve the interests of the United States to let Israel have its own way and dictate its own terms for a peace settlement in the region. U.S. interests are best served by an egalitarian and enduring peace. Warren Christopher, having come to the region many times, is now fully conversant with the respective positions of the Middle East players. He is all too aware which side wants peace and which side is placing obstacles in its path. For peace to come to the region, the UN resolutions -- the underpinnings of the Madrid conference and the peace process -- must be implemented. This is especially true, since, by the admission of their advocates, separate deals will not produce peace. Far from leading to peace, such an approach will only minimize its chances. If Mr. Christopher is coming to the region to propel the peace process on the Syrian track forward, he needs to come up with new ideas and clear answers to the core questions posed by Damascus when the U.S. secretary was last here. The future of the peace process largely depends on the kind of answers he brings. We do not think the U.S. administration will put its credibility and reputation on the line and renounce its pivotal role in the peace process. Nor do we think Washington will take the trouble of sending its chief diplomat to the region without giving him ideas that will make his trip worth the bother. Peace is a noble endeavor to which Syria is dedicated; President Clinton's administration and the whole world know this is the case. However, Damascus is pursuing an all-encompassing and fair peace -- the peace of the brave. This, too, is known to Washington and the whole world to be the case. If Israel wants this kind of peace, it knows the road leading there. If not, it will remain an unrealizable dream.
