He has decided to recommend to the UN Security Council that it approve Turkey's proposal to send troops to UNPROFOR, [UN Protection Forces] the peace force in former Yugoslavia. Naturally, this is a satisfactory development for us. We have always claimed the following: UN officials themselves have been stating that there is a shortage of troops in that region. We, in turn, have proposed sending a force with the aim of contributing to peace. Our proposal is now deemed appropriate. We believe that the UN Security Council endorsement of the UN secretary general's recommendation is a mere formality. We do not foresee any difficulties in this regard. This is not the first time Turkey has participated in UN peace forces. The Turkish Armed Forces have served with disciple, self-sacrifice, and honor in all previous UN operations. Those who doubt that the same sense of responsibility will prevail in former Yugoslavia as well are mistaken and prejudiced.
