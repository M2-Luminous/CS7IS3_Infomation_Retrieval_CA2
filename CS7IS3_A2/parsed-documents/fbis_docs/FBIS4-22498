Anatoliy Nikolayevich Grukalenko, a young entrepreneur, was their author. At that time (1987) the concept of "private initiative" was almost abusive. Grukalenko's frank account of some secrets of the Uyut Cooperative's commercial activity produced a shock in society. Fellow-citizens brought up in the spirit of their times saw in the activity of the beginner cooperative owner an encroachment on the economic and moral principles of socialism and an insult to public morality. Grukalenko, I want to remind readers of this, bought at the state price a large batch of sports shirts, which were lying on the counter, improved the unmarketable goods, putting a striking design on them, and very quickly, without any trouble, sold all the items on the kolkhoz market--at a price triple that of the state. Anatoliy Nikolayevich received a verdict from enraged readers: He is a speculator and a swindler. One high-ranking party official was outraged more than others. True, by the irony of fate this custodian of principles subsequently became an exchange dealer. After "Notes of a Businessman" A. Grukalenko appeared in the pages of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA more than once. I read his notes and involuntarily compare many of his plans, thoughts, and hopes of those days with today. How naive all of us were in the sacred belief in the force of private initiative during those first years of Gorbachev's perestroyka! And how many honest, noble impulses were buried during the subsequent era of cynical political mongering, money-grubbing, and large-scale shock therapy. Having made money on sports shirts, the cooperative owner gave the entire profit, down to the last kopeck, for charitable purposes. Grukalenko conducted the experiment with sports shirts by no means for the sake of personal gain, but only in order to force the local sewing factory, which, according to the plan, produced on a large-scale goods that no one needed, to operate differently. I confess that today "Notes of a Businessman" evoke in me sometimes nostalgic feelings about the lost illusions and sometimes also a smile. I recall the enthusiasm with which he dealt with the problem of the processing of dumped industrial waste. He established a semiprimitive enterprise and engaged in the manufacture of jewelry and all sorts of other trinkets. He promised readers of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA: "In a few years we will fill counters with goods that are not even available in the West." A very self-confident young man--you and I would say today. In fact, in 1987 the beginner entrepreneur boldly undertook many risky projects--he believed in his star. He did not want to know anything about Marxist initial capital accumulation. One day in the morning he came out to the street. He saw under his feet a kopeck dropped by someone. He picked it up and it dawned upon him: "Here is my capital. I will go to the bank, open my personal account, and this kopeck will be my first deposit. You are laughing? Never mind, in 2 or 3 years this kopeck will grow into millions. I will have my own business and will open my own factories and stores. I will become a rich man." I carefully followed our debutant entrepreneur. Yes, according to many external criteria, Anatoliy Nikolayevich turned out to be a successful businessman. He tested himself in many fields. He was one of the first to become a broker on the commodity-stock exchange. Then he was co-founder of almost the first provincial private bank in the country. Together with other enthusiasts he established the All-Russian Union of Cooperative Owners and then the Congress of Business Circles and the Union of Entrepreneurs. He founded a network of small enterprises. He participated in the establishment of the Niva-Kapital Check Investment Fund. The kopeck once found on the street grew into rubles and turned into quite a sizable initial capital. Then there was privatization--breath-taking opportunities for an enterprising person. Grukalenko decided not to miss his chance. Having overtaken his competitors, he leased a barbershop with the right of a subsequent buyout. He acquired rights to a bakery. He leased a store temporarily and opened his own office. Finally, he got the opportunity to become the owner of a large restaurant. But today, not without a sigh, Grukalenko says: "Then people not only listened to our opinion, but also took it into consideration." An entire era lies between "then" and "today." Russia got to know inflation and economic ruin. Millions of people were left out in the cold and lost their secure future, their savings, and sometimes even their homeland. It seems, however, that the universal impoverishment has not affected our hero. He looks at the future boldly and confidently and his accumulations, being constantly in motion according to the well-known formula "commodity-money-commodity," are not devalued in the abyss of inflation, but, conversely, increase. According to all criteria, Grukalenko is precisely the person on whom reformer Gaydar counted and whom he cherished in words. Yes, incidentally, Anatoliy Nikolayevich established the Foundation for Support for Reforms and the President in his native Bryansk approximately 1 year ago. We have not seen each other for a long time. Not only our paths, but also our views of many things in this life, have parted. Therefore, I was somewhat surprised when Grukalenko himself telephoned me a few days ago. "I would like to tell you a little about my life," he said straight to the point. We met. In my opinion, his story will be interesting to readers of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. I think that it will also be of interest to politicians who failed, but understood nothing. * * * In 1992, when privatization began, I decided to invest my savings in a barbershop and a bakery. Having paid a sizable sum, I acquired the right to lease these facilities. The starting price of the bakery was 23,000 rubles. However, it cost me 100-fold more, because there were many competitors at the auction. And so, I bought a scale, a counter, shelves, and a signboard for 2.2 million rubles. The store itself did not become my property, but the right to trade there was sold to me. Then an opportunity arose to acquire a restaurant not on a leasing basis, but for my ownership. This cost me more than 3 million rubles. A restaurant is a large enterprise. We service about 2,000 children with school lunches. There are also ordinary guests. However, in order that this public catering establishment may bring not only losses, but also income, I decided to open an evening coffee house there. It seemed to me that, having finally become a real estate owner, I would acquire complete independence and would have an interesting and profitable business. I recall that in 1987 Artem Tarasov hurled a popular phrase, which the entire country repeated after him: "Our Soviet system has come to the point where I, as a cooperative owner, cannot be dismissed from my job even by the country's president." I can confirm: According to the law, neither President Yeltsin nor the local governor can deprive me of the rights of an owner. Everything seems to be clear as far as the president is concerned. However, there are forces, which are not even under his control. Alas, I did not become an independent owner with full rights, as this was assumed at one time. As soon as a well-to-do person acquires an enterprise for ownership, he himself immediately becomes the object of solicitations and often of persecution on the part of a large, well-organized, greedy corporation of officials. At all times this mob of inspecting, controlling, and supervising officials lived rather well and fed on facilities under state ownership. It became so intertwined with these facilities and got so accustomed to considering them almost its own personal profitable property that even under privatization conditions it did not intend to part with the unwritten rights and privileges. Before me my restaurant functioned in very good order for more than 20 years, but only after it became private property, suddenly, it was discovered that as a facility it operated with gross deviations from existing rules. Almost on the first day I was told that, according to instructions of the sanitary-epidemiological inspectorate, fire safety, and tax and other services and according to decisions and instructions of municipal authorities, this public catering enterprise must be closed immediately. It turned out that partitions, windows, walls, and doors were not built properly. Electric wiring was not good enough and the roof was not made from the right material. I, the owner, was very quickly convinced that an official from any department (there are a dozen such departments) at any moment and for any reason could issue an order to close my enterprise and even to alienate it as an object of ownership. I, as an owner and employer, could not even appeal the decision of a certain official in court. And if I tried to seek the truth, next time even more devastating, new fines would be imposed on me. The sanitary epidemiologist's assistant makes a decision to close the restaurant. This lady acts according to the instruction. Previously, when the enterprise belonged to the state, for some reason she did not pay attention to this instruction. And it was of interest to no one that during the stoppage of the enterprise closed owing to an official's arbitrary rule the owner incurred huge financial losses on the maintenance of the building and on municipal and other services. Having no income, he paid wages and taxes. Following the first wave of inspectors the tax service pays a visit. It checks the activity of the enterprise during the previous year, when the restaurant was still municipal property. The previous director and accountant have long been dismissed and the new administration and owner are just beginning to get to the heart of the matter. However, no one is worried about this. In reports of more than 1 year's standing the official detects a mistake in the writing off of transport costs and immediately a fine of 600,000 rubles is imposed on me. I try to explain that I have nothing to do with the activity of the previous administration, because 1 year ago I was not the owner of this property. The inspector goes into indescribable raptures: "Ah, it turns out that you are a private enterprise. Then, in addition to the fine, you will have to pay another 200,000." After several days a new commission came and discovered that not long before privatization restaurant workers received a bonus of 3,000 rubles each, but deductions into the pension fund were not made from this sum. A fine of half a million rubles was imposed on me, the owner. After a few days I was invited to the rayon administrative commission. I went with the hope: They will understand and will revoke the unjust decision. However, they summoned me and the restaurant director for a totally different purpose. Both of us were handed fine notices on account of the same sanitary state. I and the director were fined the equivalent of 20 salaries, that is, 290,000 each. "But I have already been fined half a million," I tried to explain myself. In response I heard: "The oblast authority fined you, but the rayon budget must also be replenished." In the first 2 months alone the restaurant brought me fines amounting to 3 million. Not to mention the fact that I bought a hopelessly unprofitable facility and realized that at first I would have to invest a great deal of money in this production unit with the income obtained from other enterprises. I planned to make major repairs and to renovate equipment and the interior. But the excessive, at times openly fiscal, fines wrecked all plans. I realize that both the rayon and the city budget are supported by these very fines and without these proceeds there will be nothing with which to pay wages and bonuses to the officials themselves. In Russia their apparatus is growing to the size of a malignant tumor. Previously, deductions from the profit of plants and factories were the sources of replenishment of the budget. Today, however, state and privatized enterprises curtail production. Consequently, the private entrepreneur can be the source of replenishment of the budget. And so, they begin to rob our brother blind. Our ruin is of absolutely no interest to anyone. My accounts are in the records. For the second month I cannot pay wages to my workers. However, this, too, is of no interest to officials. In addition to the army of supervising bureaucrats, we are being overpowered by municipal service enterprises, as well as all kinds of firms and offices, without the knowledge of which the entrepreneur does not dare to take a step. These are monopolists setting enslaving prices of services, which at times the real estate owner, possibly, did not suspect before. For example, one enterprise for the entire city has the right to service cash registers and to issue a certificate concerning their installation. This sphere of activity is a gold mine. If a bakery does not have a cash register, the first tax inspector will impose a fine of 3 million on the owner. Taking advantage of the opportunity, monopolists inflate prices of cash registers to 600,000 rubles. Another several hundreds of thousands must be paid for a certificate for the installation of a register. They will not even come to make the installation for you, but you will have to pay in full for the certificate. Whereas previously my barbershop brought at least some income, now it must work for half a year for the cash register alone. Of course, monopolists live in grand style at our expense. Their workers receive bigger salaries than those of ministers and almost every month make "business trips" to foreign health resorts. But I, in order to make both ends meet, am beginning to reduce work places and to lower people's wages. In my restaurant people earn only from 16,000 to 37,000. Moreover, my personal income, despite the fact that I work 14 to 18 hours daily, have no days off, and have not had a leave since 1987, hardly totals 00,000 [as published] rubles. If we are to believe official statistics, this is much less than the average wages throughout Russia. At one time, having embarked on private entrepreneurship, I set for myself the goal of becoming a proprietor, an owner independent of the state and society. Was it realized? Formally, the goal, seemingly has been reached, but, in fact, I do not feel that I am an owner or a free person. Seemingly, privatization has been carried out in our country. Seemingly, private enterprise has finally appeared. In our country, however, the official bureaucratic state apparatus, not people from the "middle" class, who with their labor and enterprise have accumulated and saved up some capital, has become the true, real proprietor and owner of everything that is called real estate. As a rule, officials' actions are not subject to an appeal in court. Not only the state budget is being replenished at the expense of such business people like I. We might as well admit, everyone wants to live and officials go away from inspections by no means with empty bags. This is customary. From the experience of many entrepreneurs, my acquaintances, I know: There are many forms of hidden extortion. Everything seems like some ritual sanctified by the traditions of Russian hospitality. Victims do not protest requisitions. They are even grateful to those that take them. However, the takers themselves, in order that they may not be suspected of self-interest, having taken, drunk, eaten, and carried them away, are not ashamed to write a negative report and to exact a fine: The pike is in the sea in order to keep the crucian awake. The law reads that the entrepreneur himself is responsible for his activity and, consequently, has the right to independently establish the procedure and conditions of work at his enterprise. However, here, too, I, as the owner, am tied hand and foot by instructions, orders, and the official's personal benevolence and mood. In order to open an evening coffee house in my restaurant, I wasted a month on all kinds of formal agreements. As it turned out, officials have the right to impose their terms on me: How I should work, what staff I should have, and in what I can and cannot trade. All the rules of the game, including the recording and reporting procedure, change almost every week. Next, let us take the commitment to lessees, which guarantees the right to buy out an enterprise within 1 year. A year passed, but instructions about the buyout procedure did not arrive. In the meantime rents rose significantly. Entrepreneurs, not through their fault, cannot become owners of leased enterprises. It is advantageous for officials to maltreat us. We, nominal owners, are in permanent bondage to them. Nor did the party nomenklatura, which during these stormy years displayed a surprising capacity for mimicry, lose its positions. As soon as the party lost its power, they appeared at the exchange. When the exchange ceased to be a source of income, everyone moved to banks, to the tax police, to the pension fund, and to other soft jobs. I look back at past years. I did not take a single kopeck from the state, but conscientiously replenished the treasury, paying taxes. I have created about 50 work places and each of my workers supports a pensioner. Moreover, together we support more than one highly paid official, who pokes fun at us. However, I am tired of fighting a system, which has quickly established itself on the wreckage of the old society, has already managed to utterly ruin the people, and now is also getting to me. There is one prospect before me: I will reduce work places and am already beginning to curtail business. At any moment I can be declared bankrupt and everything that I have acquired can be taken away from me. Will other stronger and more prosperous people replace me? Yes, there are such people. I know that these people are not burdened by my concerns about how to make ends meet. Those that take away abroad tons and cubic meters of the riches of Russian land do not know my problems. Perhaps they are Russia's true masters?
