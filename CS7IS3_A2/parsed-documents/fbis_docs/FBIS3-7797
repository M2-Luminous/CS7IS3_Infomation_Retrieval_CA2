The other thing that people say about this almost mythical figure is that if Mitevic had not existed, neither Milosevic nor Milan Panic would have appeared in Serbian politics. Mitevic is a close associate of Milosevic, and it is no secret that he will become prime minister if the Serbian president manages to win a majority in parliament. Mitevic was a member of the Communist Party leadership in the former Yugoslavia as far back as in Tito's time and for many years, he was in charge of the state radio and television. "He had at least 5,000 people under him," people close to Mitevic claim. At the moment, Mitevic is one of the leading economic figures in Belgrade. He is in charge of MP Holdings, which is actually "Milan Panic Holdings" -- a company registered in Los Angeles and owned by the former Yugoslav prime minister. In his spare time, Mitevic is the shadow ruler of the FRY. Albena Shkodrova interviewed him specially for STANDART NEWS. [Shkodrova] Do you think NATO will fulfill its threat of launching air strikes against the Serbian positions in Bosnia? [Mitevic] I believe that reason will prevail at the last moment. However, it is clear that the threat is perfectly serious. I believe that all nations are good, but I do not believe in the abstract humanity of society. I am sure that the NATO countries are psychologically prepared to bomb us. Since they permitted bombardments in Somalia, Iraq, and other parts of the world, what will stop them allowing it here as well? When I said that reason will prevail, I had in mind only that in the final analysis someone will calculate what the world will gain and what it will lose by undertaking this drastic military and political action. Only this logic will save the Serbs from bombardment. In this connection, I think it is of absolutely no importance whether they position this here or remove that from there. Regarding the bombing issue, two big questions arise: If NATO bombs the Serbs, it will be clear that the United Nations is no longer what it was, that the organization no longer acts as a world parliament, given that a military alliance (which NATO is) can calmly reject the view of the United Nations and walk over them. In addition, it raises questions about international political order in general, about the laws governing the conduct of states and governments. I think that world public opinion should think carefully about what a precedent this creates for violating international order. [Shkodrova] What is Russia's role in this? [Mitevic] As a result of Gorbachev's policies, Russia is the United States' most important partner. If Washington disregards Russia, the forces in Russia that want it to conduct an independent policy will win the upper hand and put a question mark over the future of the Yeltsin administration. As partners of the Russians, the Americans should carefully consider what they will gain and what they will lose from this operation. I can swear to you that they will gain nothing except negative consequences. Bosnia is not Somalia. It is no desert. Here only the civilians will suffer, while nothing will happen to the military. The greatest danger is that in defending themselves, the Serbs may shoot down U.S. aircraft. Then no one will be able to stop the war -- the United States will have a reason to seek vengeance, and Russia will have to intervene as well. If world public opinion is really interested in ending this war, why does it not simply apply pressure to the Muslims to make them sign the treaty proposed by the peace mediators. Under this treaty, the Muslims will get much more territory than they are entitled to, based on the size of their population. [Shkodrova] What position do you expect Bulgaria to adopt in this situation? [Mitevic] The position of nonintervention by the Balkan countries in the conflict that President Zhelev has been defending for a long time is in my view a very good one. Everyone should refrain from using weapons, because when two people are fighting, one should see who they are and separate them instead of everyone joining in the fight so that it is not clear who is hitting whom. I hope the Bulgarians will realize this, because what is at issue is a historical conflict on a world scale. What is happening in Yugoslavia is merely a training exercise. It is part of the attempt to break up Russia. It is clear to the Western world that the Russian giant is dozing at the moment. Accordingly, they are trying to destroy him, to prevent him from ever rising to his feet again. [Shkodrova] Do you consider that some EU countries are more guilty than others? [Mitevic] Of course. In my opinion, everything that is happening in the former Yugoslavia is a result of Germany beginning to implement its policy in the Balkans. As far as they are concerned, the existence of our federation was always a barrier for them. The present war is really a religious one. According to the Germans' plans, then want to separate off the Catholics -- the Croats and Slovenes, while Bosnia is supposed to become Muslim. This is a war against the Orthodox Christians. [Shkodrova] When the war finally ends, do you think the Serbs will still face any charges of being the aggressor? [Mitevic] So far the Serbs have been continuously condemned, including being blamed for things that have not been proved. For example, regarding the latest incident in Sarajevo not only is there no proof against the Serbs, but also there are many more signs pointing to the Muslims. Despite this, the Serbs were accused. As far as guilt is concerned, the world is still arguing about who was responsible for World War I. Everyone has made mistakes in this war. This is also true of the Western democratic states, which recognized Slovenia and Croatia -- and Bosnia as well -- much too early. This is precisely what provoked the conflict. The West interceded on the side of the Muslims, with whose policies neither the Serbs nor the Croats could agree. The strategy followed by [former German Foreign Minister] Genscher caused the conflict. Long after the war has ended, the Serbs will have to prove what actually happened and it will take them many long years to remove the stain from their. Personally, I believe that in the end the truth will be understood. The question is how much it will cost. [Shkodrova] Do you think any change may be expected in Serbia's foreign policy? [Mitevic] No, the primary problem is to stop the war. After this, we will then think about paying more attention to our neighbors and to the security of the region. The Balkan nations will emerge from this war somewhat sobered up. The humanitarian aid that came to us through Bulgaria and Romania has drawn us closer to these countries. I think that our relations with them will become an important component of our foreign policy, because the events of last year have taught us something. If you recall, there was a play called "Australia Is Far Away"; our neighbors are most important for us. I think that after the end of the war, the [former] Yugoslav peoples will once again draw closer together, and later all the Balkan countries will do the same thing. If we are together, this provides us with a great deal of power -- access to three seas and -- why not? -- a unified system of telecommunications, transportation, and so on.... Geographically speaking, our countries are destined to live side by side. [Shkodrova] Do you think that Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] will no longer pose a problem in the Balkans? [Mitevic] It is difficult to say because I am unable to foresee how the dispute between Greece and Macedonia will end. However, Yugoslavia has an interest in this country [Macedonia] remaining as it is. What its name is does not bother us. In actual fact, the dispute between Macedonia and Greece boils down to a linguistic dispute, and the pride and obstinacy of the two peoples have added fuel to the flames. I consider that both Serbia and Bulgaria should help Macedonia to develop in peace. The Macedonians have nothing to be afraid of. It was to some extent a hysterical reaction on Skopje's part to bring U.S. troops to Macedonia. It seems to me that the problem of the Albanians is more important for the republic [of Macedonia], just as it is for us in Kosovo. [Shkodrova] How likely is it that you will become prime minister of the FRY? [Mitevic] To tell you honestly, I would not particularly want this to happen. I was a state servant for many years, but for the past two years, I have been in private business and have no desire at all to change my situation. A person who has had his tongue burned once always blows on his soup afterwards.
