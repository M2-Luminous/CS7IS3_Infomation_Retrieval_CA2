It has also been reported that the leadership has revised its directive, however, and that the range of accredited publications has been enlarged. Your ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA special correspondent asked Vladimir Kvasov, leader of the Russian Federation Government apparatus, for an explanation. [Ignatyev] Vladimir Petrovich, can we clarify matters here -- did the government make the decision to which the mass media are alluding and, if so, who signed it? [Kvasov] The government has not arrived at any decision or directive, even less a decree, which says that journalists are barred from attending presidium sessions. As a rule such questions are resolved in the course of work. There is no need for the corresponding documents on this score, and therefore there can be no signatures by members of the government. But statements of the type that the government has revised its decision are just insinuation. [Ignatyev] Nevertheless, as we have already reported, such an order has come from you personally. A representative of the government press service told an ITAR-TASS correspondent about this. You then confirmed this fact for us. Has anything changed since then? [Kvasov] No. I can repeat now that I gave only a verbal instruction that the system of journalists' accreditation should be regulated. The need for this arose when the government moved to its new address. The move caused a certain confusion for the work of a number of our services. As a result, people we did not know and complete outsiders began turning up to presidium sessions. The press published materials describing not the essentials of the presidium's work but mere intrigue. Furthermore, questions were assessed even though they were still at the discussion stage and decisions had not been made on them at the time. [Ignatyev] Did such materials harm the government's work? [Kvasov] These publications disinformed society, destabilized the situation in the country, and cast the government in an unfavorable light. A presidium session cannot be a public spectacle. And the presence of journalists, especially in large number, objectively introduces an element of theater to the proceedings. Normal and constructive work requires the appropriate conditions. Sometimes, however, a casual phrase uttered by someone at a presidium session is blown up into a real sensation in the press. This is why we want to instill proper order here. There is nothing scandalous about it. [Ignatyev] But why were Russian Television [RTV] reporters not allowed into Government House last Saturday? [Kvasov] I should think that, before guests come to visit you, they inform you first. That is the usual way of things everywhere. But to turn up without an invitation and then hammer on a locked door is stupid to say the least. Then to tell the whole country that journalists cannot get into the White House is tantamount to self-criticism and an admission of one's own helplessness. But to deal with specifics, the report on this subject in the Vesti newscast is typical first and foremost of the RTV leadership's work, namely, its inability to reach agreement with the relevant agencies on obtaining the necessary permission for filming. There is a definite procedure for this established in our country, just as there is in other civilized countries. It must be adhered to. For example, just you try to get into a British Government session without an invitation and see what happens. [Ignatyev] As far as is known, the government was at work on Saturday and discussed some serious issues.... [Kvasov] Yes, the government did work Saturday. However, no questions requiring urgent and broad coverage in the mass media were examined. Admittedly, that is my view. But if journalists consider it necessary to report on this or that problem they can get all the necessary materials and commentaries from our press service. [Ignatyev] Does your restriction on the presence of representatives of certain publications, news agencies, and television at government sessions not contravene the Law on the Mass Media? [Kvasov] I would remind you once again that there is no ban. In response to new applications from this or that publication, agency, or radio and television editorial office, lists will be compiled and journalists will be accredited accordingly. But it is not our intention to admit or bar particular correspondents. In other words, this is not a question of the right to obtain information but of the mechanism whereby that information is obtained. The Russian Federation Government's press service, headed by Valentin Mikhaylovich Sergeyev, deals with the work of that mechanism. How that service works is another question. Clearly we must investigate this properly. And is it not clear why the government press service did not grant the relevant materials to RTV when it came to Government House Saturday? Well, that question is probably one for us to deal with. I believe we will be able to answer it in the near future.
