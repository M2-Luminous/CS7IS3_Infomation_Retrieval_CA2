The spending, or eight million dollars a year, is part of the ASEAN-Australia Economic Cooperation Program and will be channelled through the Australia International Development Assistant Bureau (AIDAB). Australia has outlined six projects for development in ASEAN: -- Coastal Zone Development and Resource Management. -- Waste Water Treatment Technology Transfer and Cleaners Production Demonstration. -- Environmentally-sound Energy Production and Waste Disposal from Biomass/Waste Supplemented by Fossil Fuels. -- ASEAN-Australia Forum Telecommunication Cooperation in Training which may be implemented with Information and Communication Technology for Sustainable Development. -- Electricity and the Environment: A Framework for Decision Making in the ASEAN Region. -- Development of Food Safety and Quality Assurance Systems for Marketing and Distribution of Fresh and Processed Horticultural Products in ASEAN. AIDAB's Regional Programme Officer in Bangkok, Julie Angela Kaeowaen, said the projects are part of phase three of the cooperation program. Phase one was conducted during 1984-89 and phase two during 1989-94. In each project, four consultants from Australia and ASEAN will visit every ASEAN member to conduct a feasibility study and come up with an implementation plan that suits the development of that particular project. The feasibility study has been conducted already for the coastal zone environment and waste water projects, and the consultant team arrives in Bangkok today to do the environmentally-sound energy production project. The team to deal with the telecommunications project is expected to be here in late July. Eighteen participants from six ASEAN members will participate in each course under the project, which will include a training course in Australia that varies from ten days to ten weeks depending on the course. Miss Kaeowaen said 25 courses will be conducted under the telecommunication project, three courses will concentrate on policy and regulations, eight courses on economics and management and the rest on technology. The participants will include academics, company executives and government officials, who will be selected by the Thai Foreign Ministry. Australia also launched a project under the Linkages Stream for one year, granting A$25,000-250,000 to applicants who seek funds to support a technical and investment feasibility study aimed at encouraging investment exchanges between ASEAN and Australia, mutually beneficial trade, investment promotion and related projects. Thailand has had the most response to this project, with 260 applications for the funds.
