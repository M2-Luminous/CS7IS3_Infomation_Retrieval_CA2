Government sources claimed that Rabbani's arch rival Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, aided by powerful militia leader Gen Rashid Dostam, a close Rabbani ally until last Saturday, and the Wahdat militia had planned to move their joint forces into the city to capture the Presidential Palace. The government said opposition, who apparently gained an edge when Dostam switched loyalties and attacked government forces, had hoped to replace Rabbani with Sebghatollah Mojaddedi. The government alleged the plot called for elevating Dostam, a former communist general, to be defence minister while Hekmatyar would remain prime minister. Asked to comment on the government claim, the spokesman for Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], Haji Mangal Hussain, said: "We have been openly asking that Rabbani must step down. If he does so, Hekmatyar will also resign." Opposition and government sources said fighting, which showed Thursday night, resumed early Friday with both sides trading heavy artillery and rocket fire. However, heavy snow and fog prevented either side from using aircraft to stage attacks. Dostam, the only non-governmental commandar to have an air force, has been using his planes to bomb government positions in and around Kabul. He claimed on Thursday to have gained complete control of the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif. The continued fighting has prompted Pakistan, Iran and the UN Secretary General's representative in Afghanistan to call for a ceasefire and peace. Islamabad had called for a 24 hour ceasefire, to begin at 2300 PST [Pakistan Standard Time], to permit the wounded, diplomats and UN personnel to be evacuated form Kabul. "Pakistan is deeply concerned over the increase in serial bombardment posing a great danger to the civilians living in Kabul, and has urged all sides to hold political talks", the spokesman said. Opposition sources in Peshawar said Rabbani has sent his family to Pakistan.
