The drug is called DNCB, and has been used for decades against warts. ``People in San Francisco infected with the HIV virus have used DNCB on their own for years without any formal approval from the health care system,'' said Linda Morfeldt-Mansson, a physician at Danderyd Hospital, who specializes in infectious diseases, and who is a member of the network of Swedish HIV physicians. ``Until now, the drug has only been the subject of a single study, which was conducted in the United States. This study, however, was based on such a narrow base that we hardly can draw any conclusions from it,'' she noted. The Swedish study is supposed to include 200 HIV patients from all over Sweden. ``We will also include a number of patients who are seriously ill and who are not expected to survive for very long with the use of normal treatment methods. They may also test DNCB if they so choose. It is for their sake that we are eager to start the treatment as soon as possible,'' said Linda Morfeldt-Mansson.
