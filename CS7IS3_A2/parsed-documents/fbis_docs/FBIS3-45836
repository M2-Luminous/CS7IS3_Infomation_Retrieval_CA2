To achieve better tax receipts, the province took forceful measures to curb tax losses by keeping levies and management under strict control. The province's industrial output value last year hit more than 85.4 billion yuan, a 33.5 percent increase over the year before. The total annual output value in 1993 was 13.5 billion yuan, about 3.5 times the amount in 1980. Its economic returns also picked up last year, with an annual sales rate of 96.6 percent and an economic gain index of 106 percent. In addition, it set up 4,695 foreign-funded enterprises, and signed contracts with overseas businesses worth over 11.3 billion U.S. dollars, including 2.8 billion actually used. Most of its 5,753 joint ventures are now making profits, becoming major tax sources. The taxation departments kept a close watch on the management of tax exemption, removing or revising 140 stipulations concerning exemption. This made the provincial tax revenue rise about 1.62 percentage points in the first half of 1993. The government also raised the tax quota for the private sector by an average 34.5 percent, and the tax receipts increased by a total of 8.25 million yuan monthly.
