The head of the city's New Year Transport Committee, Ma Yijun, said soldiers were being used at train stations and along railway lines to "assist" public security officers, armed police and railway police in maintaining order. "We've got hundreds of plainclothes and uniformed soldiers out there every day," Ma said. "Nobody would dare step out of line." The number of soldiers has been increased since last Tuesday's tragedy at Heng-yang in Hunan province where 51 job seekers were trampled to death after two trains arrived at the station at the same time. Ma said the Hengyang incident was "a small thing", but admitted a national circular had been issued since then to tighten management at train station. [passage omitted]
