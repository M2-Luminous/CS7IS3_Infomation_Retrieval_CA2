This was the reaction of a German official (who wishes to remain anonymous) to the inspection of the weapons loaded on board the Algerian ship El Djorf, a case whose ramifications are said to reach all the way to Germany. According to the communique issued by security departments, FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] leaders residing in Germany, in particular Djamel Lounici who was named by the above-mentioned sailor, are implicated in this arms deal. For the German official, the existence of "the German connection" mentioned in the Algerian press is a rumor without foundation. He sees it as another manifestation of the will to damage Algerian-German relations, which has become the special goal of some Algerian newspapers. The accusation is too serious to be ignored, our source estimated. The German side already asked Algerian authorities to provide details of the case, we learned from reliable sources, to enable it to identify Germany's responsibilities and, if the accusations are founded, to decide on the measures to be taken under the law. "Let the Algerian Government give us names, with evidence showing that Algerian citizens residing in Germany are closely or remotely involved in gun running, and we shall make it our own business," they said. For this German official, it is clear that "my country will tolerate no criminal act on its soil." The federal government's position, he said, is clear: "no support for international terrorism, no matter what its color is." The same official estimates that, although his country's position with respect to the events that trouble Algeria may seem paradoxical, the explanation is quite simple: Algerian official circles resent the German judiciary's refusal to extradite Rabah Kebir. This, he said, was a decision of the German judiciary, which is sovereign, and it has nothing to do with the government's position on fundamentalism which, he indicated, is totally unambiguous. The file submitted by the Algerian judiciary to the German judiciary, he explained, did not contain any evidence warranting Kebir's extradition. Even if such evidence existed, it is said, Kebir could never be extradited to Algeria, but to another country of his choice, because German law does not allow the extradition of an individual sentenced to death in his own country. "I can understand that this position is not always as well understood in Algeria as would be desirable, that it may have serious political consequences, but there is nothing we can do about it; that is the price we pay for the independence of our judiciary," he observed. For him, the latest decision prohibiting Rabah Kebir from engaging in political activities while on German soil reflects the government's concern to see Algeria return to peace and stability. Kebir's application for political asylum is still under consideration. Eleven Thousand Applications From Algerian Citizens Processing the file may take months, even years, we were told. Kebir's is not an isolated case: last year, the German departments in charge of asylum applications received some 11,000 applications from Algerian citizens claiming to be FIS members and persecuted in Algeria. Nearly 10,000 applications were processed last year, and only about 50 were approved, we were told by a reliable source. In most cases, we were told, the rejected applications come from individuals viewed as economic refugees rather than individuals persecuted for their political opinions. The applications are studied one by one. But it so happens that most applicants who are denied asylum do not leave German soil and simply vanish into the crowd where, as illegal aliens, they evade any government control. Many of them soon find a trick to legalize their situation: they marry, or they provide a medical file. Sometimes warm, sometimes troubled, relations between Algeria and Germany never managed to achieve the measure of stability that both sides want but that events prevent. Nevertheless, we were told, the federal government clearly supports Algeria's efforts, as it just repeated at the opening of negotiations with the IMF "to find an acceptable solution to the crisis."
