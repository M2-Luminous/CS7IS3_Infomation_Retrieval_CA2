The foreign minister was addressing the parliamentary advisory committee. He said that he was forming a transparent policy on Kashmir. He said that the government had given permission to some members of the International Committee of the Red Cross and a group of ambassadors from four European nations to visit Kashmir. These members visited several parts of Kashmir valley last week and reviewed the situation there. Mr. Dinesh Singh said that this step will help counter the accusations of human rights violations in Kashmir being made at Pakistan's behest at the international level. He said that there is the danger that separatist and terrorist organizations might stage some drama for the benefit of foreign guests and communication media, however, the government will continue this transparent policy. Several members in the meeting suggested that an Indian deputation should try to aggressively stop Pakistan's propaganda in the UN Human Rights Commission meeting. Messrs Jagjit Singh, Umrao Singh, L.B. Rawal, B.B. Dutt, T.N. Chaturvedi, Ram Jethmalani, Chit Basu, Sharad Didhe, and G.G. Sawel were some of the prominent members present in the meeting. India has meanwhile advised the United States as a friend of Pakistan to prepare Islamabad for bilateral talks with Delhi over various issues including Kashmir. Prime Minister Narasimha Rao told Senator Patrick Monyhan (D) here today that it is imperative that Pakistan is made to understand that it is useless to raise the Kashmir issue at various levels. These actions are increasing tension and wasting time. Mr. Rao said that India was following all the diplomatic protocols while Pakistan was doing exactly the opposite. Mr. Monyhan during his visit with Home Minister Shankar Rao Chavan said that the Shimla agreement is a major support for improving Indo-Pakistan relations. He said that there has been no change in the U.S. policy on Kashmir. A senior official in the Russian foreign office said in Moscow today that internationalization of the Kashmir issue will not help resolve this issue. This problem should be resolved by India and Pakistan by working together. Mr. B.M. Yogorov, the chief of South Asian Bureau of the Russian foreign office emphasized in an interview today that the Kashmir problem was between India and Pakistan and it should be resolved peacefully. Mr. Yogorov said that the Shimla agreement can be used as a basis by India and Pakistan for resolving the Kashmir issue. These comments by the senior Russian diplomat are very important against the background of Pakistan's recent campaign to make Kashmir an international issue. Mr. Yogorov forcefully said that Russia always had the same stand on Kashmir and it does not see any reason to change this stand. He said that there are two aspects of the Kashmir problem--political and human rights. However, these two should not be mixed. *
