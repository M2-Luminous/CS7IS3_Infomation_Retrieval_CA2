Addressing the '94 China International Business Law Seminar, Xiao pointed out that in the near future, China should develop more self- disciplined law offices, loosen the restrictions on such offices, and gradually turn them into independent corporate bodies. He also called for establishing a new regulatory system, under which legal associations can play a major role in legal business management, and leave the justice administrative departments to conduct macro-control. About 100 experts from China, France, Germany, Italy, the United States, Macao and Taiwan attended the two-day seminar. They will exchange opinions on foreign-related tax laws, corporate law, investment law, intellectual property law and new trends for worldwide legal business.
