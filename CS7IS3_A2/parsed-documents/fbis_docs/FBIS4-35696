As the personal envoy of the Russian president continues his talks in the region about the peace process, there is talk that the American secretary of state will make a new Middle East tour by mid- June to break the logjam in the peace process and possibly to work out a date to restart the bilateral talks. Israel's posture on the peace process is as negative and rejectionist as ever, and it continues to pursue separate and incomplete deals, thus locking Washington's and Moscow's efforts into a vicious circle. Syria has made it clear over and over that it is committed to the principles and bases of the peace process as laid out by UN resolutions. Israel's recognition of its failure to promote a separate settlement with Lebanon, Syria, or Jordan is evidence that the peace process needs to proceed along the principles and bases on which it was launched. It is vital that the way to deal with the equivocating and temporizing Rabin government be rethought. This is because neither the peace process nor the general state of affairs in the Middle East is advanced by Israel's tactics of buying time, AL-BA'TH concludes.
