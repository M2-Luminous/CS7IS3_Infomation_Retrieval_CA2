The President did so despite his Administration's failure to elicit from Mr Adams the unequivocal renunciation of violence and declaration of support for the Anglo-lrish peace effort that it had agreed with Britain should be the minimum conditions for letting him in. The decision comes on the eve of the visit to Washington by Douglas Hurd, Foreign Secretary, and seems certain to raise new questions about the so-called "special relationship" since Mr Clinton took power. It is almost inconceivable that the Bush or Reagan Administrations would have delivered such a public slap in the face to America's closest ally. Though the move caught Downing Street officials by surprise, they said the decision to provide a visa was "a matter for the U.S." British officials in Washington were making representations to the White House at the weekend. Putting a brave face on events, Downing Street said it hoped the New York conference would impress on Mr Adams the need to end violence permanently. There was no indication that John Major considered Mr Adams's words as amounting to an acceptance of U.S. conditions. Mr Adams said last night that he had received no official notification of the American decision but had had "a very interesting exchange of views" with American consular officials. He said he had not been asked to renounce violence. John D. Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, said the decision was despicable and that the Clinton Administration had "given in" to pressure from the Irish lobby in Washington. Mr Clinton has been under pressure to let in Mr Adams from Senators Edward Kennedy and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whose support he needs for his health care reforms, and from 38 congressmen who argue that the U.S. should foster "constructive dialogue" instead of violence. The State and Justice Departments and the FBI had agreed with Britain that Mr Adams's application should be rejected because of his terrorist links, as eight before it had been. Their views were apparently overruled by the National Security Council and by Nancy Soderberg, NSC third-in-command and a former aide to Senator Kennedy. The White House said Mr Clinton supported the decision which he believed would "help advance the cause of peace in Northern Ireland."
