In his response to the matter of the basic peoples congresses yesterday, to the General Peoples Congress, the secretary for unity said that it was highly honourable for our great Arab people to ask its executive administration about the process of achieving Arab unity. This serves to increase awareness, a sense of responsiblity and revolutionary spirit among the people, foremost among whom is the leader of the great al-fatih revolution, the safekeeper of Arab nationalism and Arab unity after his strategic goal crystallised. This awareness entailed realisation of the strategic goals which threaten the existence of the Arab nation and the resulting state of division it is in. This reaffirms the full responsiblity to struggle to achieve Arab unity. This was entrenched in the declaration of the authority of the people. He reiterated his emphasis on the unity aspiring will which is continuing for the sake of struggle and to achieve Arab unity from the Gulf to the Sea. The secretary [word indistinct] that the matter proves the determination of the Libyan Arab people to follow up their executive bodies and to take them into account for any shortfallings in achieving Arab unity as a strategic option. The matter also shows our peoples determination, at the forefront who is Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, the leader of the great al fateh revolution, to pave the way for future Arab generations and become a model of revolutionary struggle. This shortcoming in achieving Arab unity was resolved in [words indistinct] fraternal bureau in Khartoum by replacing the [words indistinct] employees there with suitable inxivixuals and then a suitable candidate was chosen for secretary [words indistinct]. The bureau then issued a publication to all Libyans in the Sudan on a visit or on business, particularly those in Khartoum and Dunqulah, to contact the bureau if they needed help in any matter. In a short space of time, the secretariat of the General Peoples Committee for Unity has striven to draw up a programme on the level of the entire Arab world and to follow up the Arab union project which was presented by the leader to Arab heads of state and they decided on amendments to the Arab League's charter. 1) The secretary carried out several contacts with the secretariat of the League of Arab States and the Arab countries and succeeded in reviving the committee created for this purpose after it had ceased to exist in the face of the Arab situation in recent years. 2) A programme was devised to convene the joint higher committees between the Great Jamahiriyah and the fraternal Arab countries. These committees have so far met with Tunisia, Syria, the Sudan, and Egypt and preparations are underway to convene them with the remaining Arab countries. 3) The secretariat of the General Peoples Committee for Unity took upon the responsibility to draw up and implement a programme for co-operation with Chad, the Niger, and Mali on a new basis which takes into account the Islamic Arab ties with these countries. 4) The secretariat of the General Peoples Committee for Unity followed up the activities of the Arab Maghreb Union and participated in the various meetings, institutions, activities and sectors. 5) The secretariat followed up the implementation of the agreement on integration and co-operation with Egypt, and the Sudan and prepared projects to develop co-operation to the desired level for unity. 6) The secretariat took part in strengthening the idea of Arab reconciliation and reaffirmed the Great Jamahiriyah's willingness to exert efforts to bring an end to inter Arab differences and to achieve unity. The secretariat followed up the implementation of the Great Jamahiriyah's participation in the activities of the Arab League and proceeded to deal with solving political developments in the Arab world, whether on the individual or collective level. The secretariat resolved to deal with the matter of the lack of presence of peoples committees in the peoples bureaus and solved this by: a) [no "b)" as received] Establishing a peoples committee consisting of a secretary and members each responsible for either integration, economic affairs, information, and cultural affairs, to be approved by the General Peoples Committee. The secretary of the General Peoples Committee for Unity detailed the decrees issued by the basic peoples congresses which were drawn up at the general peoples congress at their session which dealt with the strategic plan for pan Arab action which is upheld by the continuous agitation by the leader to united the Arab world. This is the strategic framework of the General Peoples Committee for Unity. The basis for this are the ideas expounded by the leader since the eighties, where he highlighted the problems of Arab security, the water crisis and action to populate the uninhabited areas [word indistinct] Arab map, and also the Arab union proposal. The secretary added `The secretariat of the general peoples congress took the following steps in order to preserve the Arab identity south of the Sahara and the area of the Horn of Africa. These included drawing up several agreements within the framework of economic, social and cultural integration with its countries, establishing joint committees to lay down executive programmes for these agreements, ensuring that Arab culture, the Arab language, are widely disseminated and to ensure that the Arab Islamic and African identity of this nation is preserved. The secretariat of the General Peoples Committee for Unity stepped up its efforts to complete the process of integration with the Sudan whereby the Sudanese president, Lt Gen 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir visited the Great Jamahiriyah last year and several Libyan and Sudanese delegations concerned with political, economic and investment affairs exchanged visits. [no closing quotation marks as received] Toward this end, the secretary said that the following measures had been taken. The joint ministerial body convened its second session last year in order to lay down a practical framework for strengthening integration between the two countries in all areas. The follow up committee last [word indistinct] convened in order to follow up the implementation of the decisions adopted by the ministerial body, particularly those on trade exchanges and solving the negative aspects which are obstructing the way to their improvement. The value of Libyan exports for last year was about 34 million dinars matched with Sudanese imports at the same value. This created an improvement in the level of trade compared with the previous year, with the total value of the balance of trade being no more than 16 million dinars. Co-operation with Egypt: The leader conducted two visits to the Republic of Egypt in Ay Annar [January] and Al Timour [October]. President Muhammad Husni Mubarak also visited the Great Jamahiriyah and co-operation and integration between the Great Jamahiriyah and Egypt was followed up in this way. The follow up committee which was presided over by the secretary of the General Peoples Committee for Unity and the minister of state for cabinet affairs in Egypt convened in the month of al hanibal [August]. Libyan delegations from the various sectors convened meetings with the various specialists in Egypt particularly those concerned with education, investment, agriculture, information, trade, electricity and tourism. Similar Egyptian delegations visited the Great Jamahiriyah. Meetings took place of the working committees which were created to deal with the issue of unifying the regions of Tubruq and Marsa Matruh, programmes were drawn up towards this end, and their implementation will be followed up. The Great Jamahiriyah and Egypt are bound by eleven agreements which are on the verge of being implemented. Most important is the agreement on the right of ownership, employment, residence and travel. As for the matter of residency in the Sudan or Egypt, the committee dealt with the issue based upon the leader's insistence and belief that there should be no difference between any Arab country and therefore that each and every Arab citizen should have these rights in every Arab country, and therefore that these four freedoms should be included. Towards this end, the following measures should be entrusted to the members of basic peoples congresses to open the Libyan records which were prepared and to distribute them by the secretariat of the General Peoples Committee for Unity and the secretary of the General Peoples Committee for Agricultural Reform, Land Reclamation and Animal Husbandry in order to prepare a forecast with the practical measures which should be pursued.
