After staying in jail for five years to complete the "required course" for his being a "professional politician," Wang Juntao still kept his candid, self-confident style. A few days ago, he told reporters: "I, Wang Juntao, never evade any questions." Wang Juntao was quoted in Taiwan's CHINA TIMES and UNITED DAILY as saying that after going into jail, he once was handcuffed and placed in confinement for protesting against the authorities' decision to stop letting him met his wife, but apart from that, he was treated well by the prison authorities most of the time. It has been learned that the Ministry of Justice -- the highest administrative unit of prisons in the mainland -- had given clear instructions: "Anyone (warders) who harasses Wang Juntao will be punished." However, Wang Juntao said that he did not enjoy preferential treatment right from the beginning, but that his conditions improved every year. After being arrested in Changsha, Hunan, in 1989, he was locked up in Wuhan Public Security Bureau's detention center, then transferred immediately to that noted concentration center for political prisoners -- Beijing's Qincheng Prison. In 1991, he was condemned to 13 years' imprisonment and served his sentence in Beijing's No. 2 Prison and in Yanqing Prison. In his first year of prison life, he was locked up in a stinking, messy prison cell. In the second year, he contracted hepatitis-B and was sent to hospital for treatment, but he was still undernourished. In the third year, newspapers and periodicals were available, and a TV set and a Hi-Fi system were set up in his prison cell. Moreover, there was a refrigerator and he could eat anything he liked. To his surprise, he was sent to the No. 301 Hospital -- the best military hospital -- and received specialist treatment when he fell ill. Wang Juntao claimed that he and the warders got along quite well and that they called each other "brothers" in private. When he left the prison, a warder asked him: "Will you bear a grudge against me?" Wang patted the warder's arm and said: "I understand your plight. In the future, I will treat you leniently." Wang Juntao smiled: "I am not grateful to the CPC simply because of my enjoying preferential treatment. I would not accept the charges against me, even if I were locked up in Zhongnanhai because it was absolutely unjustifiable and illegal to sentence me to 13 years' imprisonment. I was deprived of my freedom illegally, I must defend my political integrity, and I must appear stronger than they.... So it was not that they reprimanded me, but that they educated us in the prison" [suo yi zai jian yu li bu shi ta men xun chi wo er shi jiao yu wo men 2076 0110 0961 4148 3739 5937 0008 2508 0100 0226 6064 2444 2053 5079 2508 2403 5148 2053 0226]." As people inside and outside the mainland were particularly concerned about the cases of Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming, and because Hou Xiaotian made unremitting appeals to the international community on her husband's behalf, the Chinese authorities were forced to consider Wang's release, even if he did not suffer any physical torture in the prison. In last November, when the APEC summit was held in Seattle, U.S. President Clinton brought up Wang Juntao's case in the presence of CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin. This year, in order to get the United States to extend its MFN treatment, China took quicker steps to release Wang Juntao. A month ago, Hou Xiaotian was informed of her husband's forthcoming release, while Wang Juntao also was notified of this news in prison. On 18 April, a deputy director of the Administration of Reform Through Labor of the Chinese Ministry of Justice came to Wang Juntao's medical ward and said to him: "To respond to the U.S. Government's request, we have consented to let you go to the United States for medical treatment." Wang Juntao was extremely grieved and tears started from his eyes, as a Chinese citizen being treated inhumanely cannot ameliorate his fate until foreigners step in, and he even had to go abroad to cure his illness! He asked in reply: "What if I do not agree?" The deputy director said: "You may disagree, but then you must remain here." Finally, Wang Juntao compromised with the authorities. He told reporters: "I could not lose this opportunity. I married Xiaotian in 1986, but we have been separated from each other for five out of the past seven years; she pays a too high price for us. However, I stated clearly to the deputy director of the Administration of Reform Through Labor that my consent to go to the United States did not imply that I confessed myself guilty. The deputy director said: `You have not reformed yourself well.'" Soon afterward, the official politely said that the authorities placed three hopes on him, stressing that "this is not a request": 1. Devote your energies to receiving medical treatment. 2. Pay attention to your health, and do not carry out any activities unrelated to this. 3. Remember that you are a Chinese, and do not do anything to harm your motherland's interests. Wang Juntao immediately said that it was necessary to clarify the meaning of "motherland" since the "motherland" should not represent the interests of only a few. The authorities concerned hinted that if Wang Juntao "behaved well" outside the country, this would contribute to the release of other dissidents. Hence, on the day when he arrived at New York's Kennedy International Airport, Wang Juntao said he felt "vexed" at himself. He was worried that his friends in prison, including Chen Ziming and Liu Gang, would be implicated, so he could not speak out freely. It was precisely such a "not well-reformed prisoner" who was sent, with many officials crowding around, to Beijing International Airport on the morning of 22 April. At the airport, officials shook hands with him and extended their congratulations one after another. Moreover, "humane" arrangements were made to allow his father, a lieutenant general, and his relatives in Beijing to bid him farewell in the airport's VIP lounge. At that time, his mother's face was "bathed in tears." Before leaving Beijing, an official of the U.S. Embassy in China had a brief conversation with Wang and asked him two questions. The first was: "Do you volunteer to go?" Wang answered: "Yes, I do." The second one was: "After all, how is your health?" Wang answered: "In China, a patient is not informed of his real health condition, only his family members or his unit know." It was precisely in this way that on the same day, Wang Juntao, accompanied by the first secretary of the U.S. Embassy, took a United Airlines flight to the United States and sat in the first-class cabin. He held a "PRC passport" and filled in the occupation column with the word "unemployed"; the passport will expire after April 1999. Wang Juntao is still as self-confident as he was before going to jail. He said: "In the plane, I dozed off three times and passed my five years of prison life to my memory. I have already adapted myself to my new life." Wang Juntao said he did not think that the upsurge of doing business in Mainland China had already stifled the people's grievances against the current regime; on the contrary, it can be said that a latent crisis is present everywhere which may break out at any time, no matter whether Deng Xiaoping is dead or not. In his view, China's future situation is subject to all kinds of changes, including an out-of-control situation of massive collapse and chaos. Once there is massive chaos, the consequences will be dreadful to contemplate, and no one knows how many people will die. In this way, the goal of democracy may finally be fulfilled, but it certainly will be achieved at the expense of innumerable deaths. Therefore, such a path must be averted at any cost. Wang Juntao said that when the intelligentsia debated the idea of "new authoritarianism" prior to the 4 June Incident, he had tried his best to evade such a debate. He even did not want to make any explanation when someone described him as the one who believed in "new authoritarianism." He was not eager to take part in ideological debates because he was soberly aware that the best way to deliver China from the crisis was to put forward a concrete proposal and to devise tactics to make it work. In the past, he and his comrades had done so, and in the future, they would do the same. He has many old friends in overseas democratic organizations, and he said he would meet them. If someone really proposes to him to do something, he wants to do something inside China, but not outside. He said: "For those who are engaged in China's politics, there is too little room for maneuver outside the country. Therefore, I will return to China once I am healed." He repeatedly stressed that his greatest concern at present is his friend Chen Ziming, who also was sentenced to 13 years' imprisonment and who remains in prison. He will try his best to strive to win the earliest possible restoration of Chen's freedom, and he hoped that people inside and outside China would continue to show their solicitude for Chen.
