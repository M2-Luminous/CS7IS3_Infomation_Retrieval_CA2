He said the word `fundamentalism' is a result of the western propaganda and has been used with the idea of discrediting the political opposition to the west. Fadlallah said Arab governments should learn a lesson from what has befallen the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and learn also that their recognition of the Zionist regime will offer them only infamy and wretchedness. Meanwhile in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, leader of the Islamic Unity Movement of Lebanon, Sheykh sa'id Sha'ban, said during his Friday prayer sermons today that the United States and other arrogant world governments are drafting a scheme with which to pit Muslim and Arab nations against one another. He criticized the Arab governments that promote the goals of the United States. Sha'ban said had the resources of Muslim governments been devoted to the promotion of the Islamic movement the world would now have witnessed the creation of a big Islamic force.
