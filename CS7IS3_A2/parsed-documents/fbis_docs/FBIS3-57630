At a news conference after the talks, the Russian and Italian premiers expressed satisfaction with the state of bilateral ties, stressing that both countries have big potential for their development in the future. Ciampi said he was pleased to hear from his Russian counterpart that there will be no backtracking on reforms in Russia. He admitted that Russia is facing certain difficulties which are inevitable on the way towards a free market economy. Chernomyrdin said that the upcoming G-7 summit meeting to be held this coming summer and to be attended by Russian President Boris Yeltsin should begin the transformation of G-7 into G-8, at least on a political level. Both prime ministers had discussed various aspects of cooperation with international organisations, including the European Union and NATO, paying special attention to the Partnership for Peace programme. The sides also focused on bilateral trade and economic relations between Italy and Russia, prioritising cooperation in power engineering and oil and gas production. "As for Italy and Russia, our business is going pretty well. Italy is our second largest, after Germany, trade partner in Europe. We have signed such contracts with it, of which not every country can boast. For example, a contract with the group ENI to modernise gas pipelines in russia is estimated at about 2 billion U.S. dollars. In return, Italy will receive extra six billion cubic meters of gas annually," Chernomyrdin said. Ciampi told ITAR-TASS that Italy supports reforms in Russia, stressing that the boosting of energy production and energy exports are vital for the Russian economy. Speaking about Russia's position on the Bosnian settlement, Chernomyrdin said that this topic had not been discussed during the talks. He pointed out to Russia's desire to settle the conflict in the Balkans as soon as possible by using "civilised political methods." "In this respect the positions of our countries are close," the premier said.
