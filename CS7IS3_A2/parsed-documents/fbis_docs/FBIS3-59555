Elettra's light cannot be held back. A ray squirts outside the experimental area and gets lost on the dome of the elegant building. Even we can see the violet-colored reflections of the radiation produced specifically to study the microscopic details of matter, both organic and inorganic. We are on the Carso, in the area where the Elettra light machine (synchrotron light in technical terms) began operating a few days ago. From the outside it looks like a doughnut squatting on lime-impregnated soil, whose round shape fits in with the beauty of the surroundings. Inside complexity triumphs: 10 million pieces, both mechanical and electronic, to generate and pilot a swarm of 100 billion electrons from which the magic radiation originates. "When we turned on the machine the first time, we were not at all sure that it would work," admitted Albin Wrulich, an Austrian scientist who took over the direction of the project following the premature death of Prof. Mario Puglisi. "Then with great joy we saw that everything was working as it should and that we had even beaten all records." Elettra, in fact, is one of the three new synchrotron light machines in the world (the other two are in Berkeley and Grenoble) and all three have reached the finishing post almost simultaneously. The goal is to launch a scientific competition that should revolutionize the world of applied research. The Synchrotron Trieste company has an exceptional president, Nobel Laureate Carlo Rubbia: "Now we have a strategic tool that is extremely important for scientific, industrial, and economic development. A machine developed using particular technical innovations that will enable us to observe organic and inorganic matter in detail." The Elettra structure consists of a particle accelerator. An 80-meter long electron cannon (LINAC [linear accelerator] fires its shots inside a ring with a 260-meter circumference. Here the electrons are accelerated by radio frequency cavities and forced to run along a circular trajectory by powerful magnets. When passing through the curved magnets and inverters the electrons radiate synchrotron light which is radiation with a very wide spectrum: from infrared to X ray. "The radiation," explained Elettra Scientific Division Director Prof. Renzo Rosei, "is channeled into a series of lines that are tangential to the ring and brought to experimental areas where it is focused on the samples to be analyzed. The most appropriate wavelength for each type of research is selected. There are eight light lines available but there are plans to bring this number to 22." By observing the wavelengths that correspond to the dimensions of the atoms and molecules, the most inaccessible structures of matter are revealed. "The machine cost 300 billion lire, the same as two football fields," said Synchrotron Managing Director Giuseppe Viani. "Now the company is stipulating contracts with public and private organizations." It Can Be Precious In Many Sectors Live Chemistry This is how the functions of the first light line activated alongside the Elettra synchrotron can be summarized. The scientific name of the line is "super bait." It is based on the principal of photoemission discovered by Nobel Laureate Siegban. The X ray produced by Elettra, which focuses on a sample to be analyzed, has the capacity to extract electrons from the various chemical elements that make up the sample. An analysis of the electrons leads to a determination of the single elements at play as well are their reciprocal interactions. It promises to have applications in the field of catalytic processes, corrosion, and other chemical reactions. Semiconductors This is what is expected of the other two Elettra light lines called Vuv Photoemission and Esca. They are also based on the principle of extracting electrons from samples by means of incident X rays. The first piece of equipment, managed in collaboration with the CNR [National Research Council] will be used to design semiconductor joints and high temperature superconductors. The second, in collaboration with ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation], will be used to understand how a diamond is made. Another photoemission light line dedicated to gases will be used to perform a detailed study on the process leading to the destruction of ozone. Chemotherapies These are one of the many applications that could emerge from the Elettra "diffractometry" light line. There are three: diffractometry, scattering, and aloisa. In this case the incident radiation is used to perform a kind of radiography of biological and pharmacological materials. But acquiring an in-depth understanding of how specific proteins and crystals function, it is hoped to develop pharmaceuticals that act selectively by depositing themselves only on sick tissues and avoiding other healthy organs, and bombarding using highly toxic chemical substances. Mammography It is an eloquent name for a light line that has still not been activated but whose opening is slated for 1994. It has been seen that synchrotron light is one of the most effective methods for the early diagnosis of breast cancer. The wavelength of the light will be varied according to the dimensions of the organ under examination, thereby permitting 50-micron tumor granules to be seen. The radiation will be 10 times less than that absorbed using traditional equipment. The light line will probably be assigned to a health authority in the area and will be positioned on the outskirts of the Elettra area.
