FBIS3-32403 "drlat025_o_94011" FBIS-LAT-94-025 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Feb 1994 Colombia * Attitudes Toward Gaviria, Country's Problems Surveyed 94SM0199A Santa Fe de Bogota SEMANA in Spanish 11 Jan 94 pp 42-55 94SM0199A Santa Fe de Bogota SEMANA Language: Spanish Article Type:CSO [Excerpts] As it has every year since 1988, this year SEMANA contracted for a poll aimed at learning the opinion of Colombians regarding some 20 issues. It compared the results with those from previous polls, in order to analyze the people's changing views on these matters. For this purpose, it contracted the services of the Gallup Colombia firm, which collected the information between 3 and 13 December 1993: in other words, during the 10 days following Pablo Escobar's death. That event had unquestionable implications for the general attitude and mind-set of Colombians. The poll was taken at 100 sampling points in Bogota, Medellin, Cali, and Barranquilla, among 1,000 men and women over age 18, belonging to the three social classes. On this occasion, SEMANA attempted to make use of the information accumulated during the six years of polling, to compare the changes in opinion. Outstanding Person of the Year ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Who do you think is the outstanding Colombian personality of 1993? (figures | |are percentages) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Pablo Escobar |25 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cesar Gaviria Trujillo |16 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Carlos Vives [popular singer] |8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gustavo de Greiff |5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Faustino Asprilla [soccer player] |5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Noemi Sanin |2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Andres Pastrana |2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Carlos Valderrama [soccer player] |2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ernesto Samper |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Antonio Navarro |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gabriel Garcia |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Francisco Maturana |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rudolf Hommes |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Colombian Soccer Team |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Carolina Gomez |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other persons |9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Don't know |21 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Because the poll was taken during the days following the death of Pablo Escobar, the "capo's" image receives a high degree of mention among those polled, exceeding President Gaviria, with whom he shared first place a year ago. As an odd note, Carlos Vives appears in third place, ahead of Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, soccer player Faustino Asprilla, and the best known political leaders. Noemi Sanin is by far the leader among the women in this ranking. How Gaviria Is Faring ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |All things considered, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way in w-| |hich Cesar Gaviria is performing as president of the republic? (figures ar-| |e percentages) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Satisfied |Dissatisfied |Don't know/no opi-| | | | |nion | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dec 1992 |22 |71 |7 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dec 1993 |44 |49 |8 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- It is indisputable that 1993, with its economic results and the death of Pablo Escobar, was the year of the recovery of the president's image. Nevertheless, the indicator obtained last December is lower than those recorded in 1991 when, after Escobar's surrender and the approval of the Constitution, Gaviria's performance attained degrees of satisfaction exceeding 65 percent. Gaviria's Reelection ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |If Cesar Gaviria should run again as a candidate for the presidency, what | |is the likelihood of your voting for him? (figures are percentages) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Would vote for him|Wouldn't vote for |Don't know/no opi-| | | |him |nion | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dec 1991* |59 |35 |6 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dec 1992 |13 |80 |7 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dec 1993 |23 |68 |9 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |* National Consulting Center poll in the five major cities | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- In this question as well, one can perceive that the recovery of the president's image is a long way from the popularity levels of 1991, when 59 percent declared themselves willing to reelect him. The Most Serious Problem ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |In your judgment, what is Colombia's most serious problem at present? (figur-| |es are percentages) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Climate of Insecurity |26 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Unemployment |15 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Violence |14 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Guerrillas/Public Order |10 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Corruption |9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Drug Trafficking |7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Poverty |4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Economy |3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Drug Addiction |3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cost of Living |3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Education |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Foreign Debt |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Waste Disposal |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other Problems |5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It is interesting to note that insecurity is currently considered the most serious problem by far, having displaced the guerrillas and violence combined, which had traditionally led in this ranking. The higher ranking of the corruption problem is also significant, now registering 9 percent, compared with only 1 percent the previous year. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |In your view, which is more serious at present: the guerrillas or drug traff-| |icking? (figures are percentages) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Guerrillas |34 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Drug trafficking |20 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Both equally serious |43 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Don't know |3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |In your view, which is most serious at present: the guerrillas, drug traffic-| |king, or corruption in the public sector? (figures are percentages) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Corruption |46 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Guerrillas |11 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Drug trafficking |9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |All three equally |33 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Don't know |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just as last year, the guerrillas are being regarded as a more serious problem than drug trafficking. However, when corruption is included among the options, it wins by a wide margin: something that never happened in the past. Guerrillas and Armed Forces What should the government do about the guerrillas? (figures are percentages) Combat them Hold dialogue Both Don't know/no militarily with them opinion Dec 1992 53 38 6 3 Dec 1993 39 51 6 4 When this question was asked at the end of 1992, the cruel guerrilla offensive that had begun with a massacre of policemen in Putumayo was just being unleashed. This could explain why, last December, that question again produced the traditional results, showing that Colombians favor dialogue with the guerrillas. Nevertheless, this 51 percent supporting dialogue falls far short of the 72 percent obtained by the National Consulting Center in a poll taken during December 1991 in the five major cities. Do you think that the Armed Forces' ability to defeat the guerrillas is better, equal to, or less than it was a year ago? (figures are percentages) Better Equal Less Don't know Dec 1992 41 30 23 6 Dec 1993 51 27 16 6 Those polled think that the Armed Forces have improved their capacity to combat the guerrillas. This means that, if the majority now support dialogue, it is because they believe in a political solution, and not because they consider the guerrillas invincible. Drug Consumption ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Have you tried any of the following drugs? | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Date |Percentage of positive responses | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Marijuana |Cocaine |Basuco | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nov 1990* |5.2 |1.3 |2 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dec 1993 |8 |3 |2 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |* National Consulting Center poll of Nov 1990 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Degree of Happiness and Optimism ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |In general, all things considered, how happy do you feel? (figures are per-| |centages) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Very |Not very |Not at all | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nov 1990** |43 |44 |13 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dec 1991* |69 |29 |2 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dec 1992 |63 |34 |3 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dec 1993 |75 |23 |2 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |* National Consulting Center poll in the five major cities | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |** National Consulting Center poll in 20 cities | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Last December, just after Pablo Escobar's death, the country registered its highest degree of happiness, at least for the past four years. Three-quarters of those polled declared themselves "very happy," compared with 63 percent a year before. The November 1990 figure, which revealed a high rate of unhappiness, should be read carefully, because it relates to a poll taken in 20 large, medium, and small cities, and is not readily comparable to a poll taken in the four capitals. Nevertheless, it indicated a very high degree of dissatisfaction among Colombians with their lives. Would you say that your life, compared to that led by your parents, is better, the same, or worse? (figures are percentages) Better Same Worse Don't know Nov 1990** 49 10 39 2 Dec 1991* 72 12 15 1 Dec 1992 44 19 36 1 Dec 1993 53 19 26 2 * National Consulting Center poll in the five major cities ** National Consulting Center poll in 20 cities In this question, one can see the same positive state of mind in December 1993 as in previous years. The difference from 1992 (the year of Escobar's escape) is considerable. Do you believe that your children's lives will be better than, the same as, or worse than yours? (figures are percentages) Better Same Worse Don't know Nov 1990** 39 11 44 6 Dec 1991* 45 13 38 4 Dec 1992 31 10 53 6 Dec 1993 41 11 40 7 * National Consulting Center poll in the five major cities ** National Consulting Center poll in 20 cities Just as at the end of 1991, the optimism regarding the lives that the children will lead is slightly greater than the pessimism. Again, one notes a significant difference from the previous year, when the degree of pessimism among Colombians appeared high. Economic Situation and Openness ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Compared with a year ago, do you feel that your economic situation is bett-| |er, the same, or worse? (figures are percentages) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Better |Same |Worse | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dec 1992 |33 |35 |32 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dec 1993 |46 |36 |18 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- The difference between the end of 1992 and that of 1993 is appreciable. Nearly half of those polled admit that their economic situation has improved. Only 18 percent claim that it has worsened. How good or bad do you think economic openness has been for the country? (figures are percentages) Very Rather Totally Rather Very Totally Don't good good good bad bad bad know Dec 16 39 56 15 20 35 10 1992 Dec 20 40 60 13 17 30 10 1993 Economic openness, a policy against which many leaders preached, believing that they would thereby gain the people's support, is becoming more popular every day. At present, 60 percent of those polled consider it good: four points higher than the previous year's figure. h3}Confidence in Institutions ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |How much confidence do you have in the following institutions? (figures perc-| |entages) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Catholic Church |45 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Army |28 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Television Newscasts |25 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Inspector General's Office |24 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Private Enterprise |23 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Treasury Supervisor's Office |21 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Radio Newscasts |20 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Newspapers |19 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Attorney General's Office |18 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |General Auditor's Office |13 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Judges |11 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Trade Unions |10 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Police |9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Congress |4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Political Parties |2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Catholic Church has maintained a leadership in this respect for years; although, as may be observed in the question asked of practicing Catholics, they do not, in fact, pay much attention to its severity concerning the sexual issue. The high degree of confidence in the Army is underscored; not so in the case of the police, who rank as low as the trade unions (victims of major discreditation). Their poor image is exceeded only by that of the Congress and the political parties. [passage omitted]
