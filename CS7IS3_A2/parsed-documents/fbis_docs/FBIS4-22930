There Won't be Any More Broad Research Front''] [Text] Minister Boris Saltykov warned journalists gathered at the round table in the Ministry of Science and Technology Policy that the subject was going to be mainly about money, or rather about the lack of it. As should have been expected, last year the Ministry of Finance came up 300 billion rubles short, which is 30 percent of the total budgetary expenditures for science. In January and February of 1994, totals of 27 percent and 40 percent respectively were allocated. Saltykov caused a sensation by stating that the space program had been 148 percent financed. Aircraft builders also got a surplus. ``And for all that, the general `science' budget was not increased by a single copeck,'' said the Minister. ``The chosen ones thus got some of the money of ``disowned'' fields.'' As it turns out, the mysterious reason for this situation is that last autumn Prime Minister Chernomyrdin visited ``Energiya'' Scientific Production Association. The Prime Minister confronted Saltykov: ``Why didn't you tell me before that such remarkable specialists are working there?'' ``The Russian Government cannot afford to support a broad research front,'' maintains Boris Saltykov. As an alternative to the Soviet course, where ambitious projects were carried out at the expense of the entire society, the Ministry of Science has put forth a program of priorities. Among these are production technologies, information science and communications, development of new materials, power engineering, transportation, life sciences and genetic engineering, ecology, space, research on fundamental problems of the social and cultural development of Russia, and also research on the fundamental properties of matter. Thirty three State Science Centers have been set up to deal with these areas. Of course, all science institutions of Russia are making efforts to get into State Science Centers. The Ministry of Science has received more than 200 applications. As implied by Saltykov's words, the State Science Centers are not entirely maintained by the State. Funding will be granted only to specific scientific developments that have passed muster by experts within the walls of the ministry. Among the other problems that have beset Russian science, mention was made of the exodus of skilled personnel out of the country, and also to the private sector. Vladimir Mikhaylin, chairman of the Union of Scientific Societies of Russia, has pointed out that there has been a drastic decline in the number of scientists in the 30-40 year age bracket. Saltykov gives assurances that he is doing everything possible to keep the powers that be from strangling our science. But he admitted that scientists do not have the capability of turning off a valve, like people in the oil industry, or cutting off coal shipments, like the miners. So the minister is pretty sure that it would do no good for scientists to go on strike.
