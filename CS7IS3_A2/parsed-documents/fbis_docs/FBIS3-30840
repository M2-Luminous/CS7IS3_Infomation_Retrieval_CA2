Mazowiecki is the special raporteur on Yugoslavia for the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. He made his remarks at a commission meeting at Geneva following the massacre of civilians in Sarajevo on Saturday when a mortar bomb killed 68 people and wounded 200. Mazowiecki said that Saturday's crime was not only an accusation against its perpetrators, but also against those who remained inactive or "again restricted themselves to words." Mazowiecki pointed out that in August 1992 in his first report he had recommended that heavy arms which were being used by the Serbs to bomb Sarajevo be seized. He also recalled the U.N. Security Council resolution of May 6, 1993 under which Sarajevo and 5 other towns were placed in a "security zone." He called for the Human Rights Commission to demand that the U.N. secretary-general and the Security Council take action to "bring into force their resolutions guaranteeing safety to the civilian population." Mazowiecki thought that the perpetrators of Saturday's crime should stand before a tribunal to be set up by the U.N. On February 24 Mazowiecki is to publish another report on atrocities perpetrated in the former Yugoslavia. He then intends to resign as special raporteur.
