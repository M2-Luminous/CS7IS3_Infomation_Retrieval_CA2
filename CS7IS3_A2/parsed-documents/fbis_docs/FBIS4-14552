The eight-page draft document consists of six sections. In part, the draft document obliges the parties to the agreement to refrain from introducing constitutional amendments harmful to the situation in society. The parties also commit themselves not to initiate any political campaigns in favor of early elections to federal bodies not mentioned in the Constitution. The participants in the agreement undertake to refrain from using violence to settle any kind of problem. Initiators of rallies, manifestations and strikes should assume responsibility for the peaceful character of such actions. The parties call not to use interpretations of the events of August 1991 and September-October 1993 as a pretext for further confrontation. The draft document requires the federation's constituent members to refuse to change their constitutional status within the next two years. A permanent Economic Conference is to be established in order to coordinate proposals in the sphere of economic policies for the period in which the agreement is valid. In accordance with the draft, representatives of the president, the government, the Russian Central Bank, the Federation Council, the State Duma, major trade unions of workers, commodity producers and entrepreneurs will participate in the agreement. In accordance with the document, political parties and movements and public organizations must under no circumstances establish any armed formations. Any attempts to utilize the state power structures for support of political programs and demands are to be considered as illegal and immoral. The parties believe that a permanent Conference on Security could become an efficient instrument for working out coordinated proposals in the sphere of security. The State Duma and the Federation Council leaders will be included in the Russian Security Council in order to shape coordinated state policies. A conciliation commission composed of representatives of the president, the government, the Federal Assembly chambers, the State Duma factions and well known public activists and artists is to be set up in order to work out a mechanism for implementation of the agreement. If the agreement is violated, the Conciliation Commission will: -- Make a statement in the media; -- Raise the issue of the exclusion of such a participant from the list of signatories; -- Make proposals on political accountability of those responsible for violation of the agreement going as far as their dismissal. In accordance with the draft, the agreement is to be concluded for a two-year term and can be extended with the consent of the signatories.
