According to Nurgaliyev, Article 4 of the Russian-Kazakh treaty provides for the joint use, in mutual interests and on mutual agreement, of army bases, shooting ranges and other defensive facilities on their territories, as well as the use of defensive facilities on each other's territory. Now that it was ratified by both the Kazakh and Russian legislatures, the treaty prevailed over the national legislations. Nurgaliyev felt there was nothing new or controversial in Yeltsin's order on Russian military bases outside Russia. Nurgaliyev failed to see as unacceptable long-term strategic deployment of units under the Russian flag in Kazakhstan. If no Russian troops remained on Kazakh territory, he said, it would be more difficult for his republic to keep up its defensive potential. In Nurgaliyev's view, Kazakhstan and Russia shared strategic interests in the field of defense and agreement would soon be reached on the Sary-Shagan and Emba missile ranges (near the Balkhash lake and the city of Aktyubinsk, respectively).
