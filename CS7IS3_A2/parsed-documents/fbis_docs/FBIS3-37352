The eighth round of negotiations on the terms and conditions of the 14th Army withdrawal will not take place very soon, Mr. Taranu also said, for the simple reason that the Russian Federation hopes that after the 27 February elections in the Republic of Moldova, the Chisinau Parliament will include forces prepared to yield more easily and thus concessions may be obtained.
