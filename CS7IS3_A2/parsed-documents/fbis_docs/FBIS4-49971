The National Police Administration will handle these cases by relying on letters of accusation and reports made by people, and by offering rewards to informants; the Investigation Bureau will be in charge of investigating the illegal entry of groups of people from the mainland. Yin Tsung-wen stated: From 1987 to March of this year, public security and intelligence agencies discovered a total of more than 28,300 mainlanders who entered Taiwan illegally, of which 26,324 have been repatriated back to the mainland. About 60 percent of those were discovered inside Taiwan, and 40 percent were caught at sea or when they tried to make shore. This shows the massive efforts taken by the National Security Bureau are quite effective.
