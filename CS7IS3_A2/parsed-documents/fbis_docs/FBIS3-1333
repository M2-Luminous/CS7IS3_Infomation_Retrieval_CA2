Doonan] [Text] Durban March 25 SAPA -- African National Congress [ANC] marshalls lost control of thousands of ANC supporters soon after they began marching from Durban's Curries Fountain to the city centre on Friday [25 March] afternoon. Near-chaos reigned as crowds broke free from the body of the march and marshalls struggled to maintain order in Grey Street. The crowd was estimated at more than 30,000, with hundreds more joining from buses and sidewalks. At least 20,000 African National Congress supporters had massed at Durban's Curries Fountain by 1 PM on Friday. South African Police [SAP] spokesman Col Johan Stoltz said between 700 and 800 policemen had been deployed in central Durban in preparation for the march. South African Communist Party spokesman Dennis Nkosi told SAPA at Curries Fountain: "Let (Inkatha Freedom Party President Mangosuthu) Buthelezi know we have majority support in the region." He claimed IFP supporters were "war weary" and were "joining the democratic movement in their thousands". Central Durban was virtually deserted except for police patrols and security forces ready to erect razor wire cordons. SAP spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said townships around Durban were quiet except for two shooting incidents in kwaMashu.
