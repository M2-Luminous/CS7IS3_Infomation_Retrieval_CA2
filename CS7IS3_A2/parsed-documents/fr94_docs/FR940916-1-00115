FR940916-1-00115 FR940916-1-00016 Sections 232.501 through 232.507 contain general requirements for the performance of Class 1 and Class 2 brake tests, as well as running tests and single car tests. These sections would apply to freight and passenger trains that exceed 79 mph. FRA recognizes that at this time there are a number of passenger and commuter trains that operate at speeds over 79 mph, and up to 125 mph. These types of operations currently employ braking equipment that can be sufficiently regulated by the proposed standards applicable to conventional passenger trains. Furthermore, neither the industry nor FRA foresees a significant change in the type of braking technology used by these operations within the next few years. Consequently, FRA proposes to require that intermediate speed passenger and commuter equipment that entered service prior to January 1, 1995 adhere to the brake inspection and test standards applicable to conventional passenger contained at §§232.403 through 232.411. FRA also recognizes that presently there are no freight trains operating over 79 mph and that there are very few passenger or commuter trains currently operating in excess of 125 mph. FRA realizes that the braking systems needed for these types of operations will most likely require the development of new types of braking systems that are currently unknown or are merely in the developmental stages at this point. FRA is also aware that advanced braking systems are being developed for high speed passenger and commuter trains. Thus, in order to allow for the development of this new technology and ensure its safe operation, FRA proposes to require that railroads that operate either intermediate speed freight trains, intermediate speed passenger or commuter trains in service after January 1, 1995, or high speed passenger or commuter trains develop train brake system tests and inspections tailored to the specific technology employed. Subpart G This subpart contains the provisions covering the requirements for the performance of single car tests, periodic freight brake tests, and single passenger train set tests. As stated earlier, FRA believes that the new repair track test and single car test, which have been used industry-wide since January of 1992, are a much better and more comprehensive method of detecting and eliminating defective brake equipment and components than the old, time-based COT&S requirements. FRA believes that performance of these tests will significantly reduce the number of defective components currently found and will dramatically increase the reliability of brake equipment. Thus, use of the repair track and single car tests will greatly improve the safety of both railroad employees and the public since brake equipment will be in better and safer condition. However, in order to fully benefit from the advantages of these tests, cars must receive the tests. Several labor commenters admitted that the new tests were very valuable, but stated that the tests were being circumvented by the railroads. Therefore, in order to ensure that all cars receive the new repair track test or single car test, FRA proposes to require the performance of the test on any car that receives repairs for various wheel or brake equipment problems, but in any event, at set intervals. In the near future, specialized passenger train sets that have been designed to operate for long periods of time as a single unit are likely to come into operation. Examples include the X&hyph;2000 and Inter-City Express train sets. FRA intends to allow railroads operating such train sets the flexibility to develop a single passenger-train-set test that is equivalent to the single car test, but that allows the train set to be tested as a unit rather than as individual cars. Section 232.601. This section provides the general requirements regarding single car tests, periodic freight brake tests, and single passenger-train-set tests. In order to ensure that railroads engage in the thought process of developing comprehensive test plans and to ensure that employees are provided sufficient guidance for the performance of these tests, FRA intends to require that railroads develop written, detailed step-by-step procedures for performing these tests. FRA believes that these written procedures can be an invaluable training tool and can serve as a check list for supervisory personnel performing spot checks. Section 232.603. This section contains a reference to the tasks required in performing these tests. For freight cars, FRA would require the ``periodic freight brake test'' on a time-based schedule and for deficiencies in certain peripheral brake components. A ``freight single car test'' is required for certain wheel defects and when brake control valve portions are replaced. The ``periodic freight brake test'' is essentially what the industry currently refers to as a ``repair track brake test.'' Periodic freight brake tests would be performed in accordance with AAR Standard S&hyph;486, Section 3.0, contained in AAR's ``Manual of Standards and Recommended Practices'' as revised in November of 1992. Freight single car tests would be performed in accordance with AAR Standard S&hyph;486, Section 4.0, contained in the same manual. For passenger cars, the standard passenger car single car test would be performed in accordance with AAR Standard S&hyph;044, contained in AAR's ``Instruction Pamphlet No. 5039&hyph;4, Supp. 3'' as revised in April of 1991. FRA will incorporate these AAR rules as revised on the dates previously specified into the federal rule.
