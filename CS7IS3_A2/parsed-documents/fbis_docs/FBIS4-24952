The most fundamental aspect of this theory is the answer it has provided to the question of what socialism is and how to build socialism in the present historical context. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is an important development of the basic theory of Marxism. This development mainly finds expression in the following aspects: 1) the theory of initial stage of socialism; 2) the theory of developing and emancipating the productive forces and the "three-beneficial" criteria with "the criterion of productive forces" at the core; 3) the theory of planned commodity economy of socialism and socialist market economy; and 4) the theory on the nature of socialism. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has steadfast faith in socialism and puts all his mind on the socialist cause. He has put forward many new ideas for the purpose of better adhering to Marxism and adhering to the socialist orientation, emphasizing adherence to the socialist orientation not just in terms of the primal system but also in all his reform, opening up, and modernization policies. The 14th CPC National Congress highly appraised Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as "the latest achievement in the integration of Marxism with China's reality and the Marxism in today's China." The Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, as a historical record of the full-scale reform and opening up of our country and the enormous changes in the process of socialist modernization, actually reflects the process of founding, enriching, perfecting, and developing this Marxist theory of today's China based on the reform, opening up, and modernization. Understanding a great ideological theory often takes time. As we carry on studying the third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping in greater depth, we will be able to perceive ever more keenly the great radiance of this Marxist theory in today's China. [end abstract] I. It has been nearly 80 years since scientific socialism evolved from theory to practice. In our country, it has been almost 40 years since the socialist system was established. Over the past decades, the orientation of our building socialism has been perfectly correct [wan quan zheng que 1346 0356 2973 4292] and we have made great achievements and changed China's face. However, quite a number of errors have also been made and we have encountered setbacks and tribulations. The reasons are many. In a theoretical sense, a fundamental reason is the failure to be completely aware of or clear about the basic question of what Marxism is, what socialism is, and how to build socialism. We are communists and have practiced socialism for many years and yet we have not clearly understood the question of what socialism is and how to build socialism. This seems hard to understand when one first hears it but, on thinking it over, one realizes that as far as our country is concerned, this is the very crux of the matter. Taking class struggle as the key link and failure to shift the focus of the party's work to energetically developing the productive forces over a long period of time made it impossible to put an end to the poverty in the people's livelihood. Can one say we had a clear understanding of this issue? Pursuing some economic and other policies over a long period of time beyond what was feasible in the respective historical phases restricted, and even seriously dampened, the enthusiasm in production of the broad masses of workers. Can one say we had a clear understanding of this issue? Obviously, our socialist practice in the past carried a certain subjectivity, one-sidedness, and blindness to a large extent. Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out: "Today, though we are practicing socialism, in fact we are not up to it yet." The argument that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is Marxism in today's China can be proven from many angles. However, the most fundamental point is that he answered the question of what socialism is and how to build socialism in today's historical context. What is today's historical context? Since the 1970's, the historical context of this phase at least has the following three distinct features: First, peace and development have become the theme of our times. To boost the economy and improve livelihood has become the common aspiration of all peoples. Second, the scientific and technological revolution worldwide is moving ahead at lightning speed. The economy of some developed countries continues to prosper, further widening the "south-north" gap and putting some underdeveloped countries in a more disadvantageous position. Third, the rapid rise of the economy of some burgeoning industrialized nations and regions surrounding China has brought not only a rare opportunity but also a grim challenge and pressure on China in its development. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, while summing up our country's experience of successes and setbacks in practicing socialism and drawing on the ups and downs, successes and failures which other countries had experienced in practicing socialism, Comrade Xiaoping never stopped seeking to understand and solve the question of how to build socialism by referring to this new historical context. Pursuing the policy of reform and opening up was to find a correct answer to this question through practice. The putting forward of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics was to take a further step in answering this question from a theoretical approach. By studying the volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, one can easily see that in the process of developing the theory of building socialism with Chinese characters, Comrade Deng Xiaoping made the following five unequivocal points while treating the misunderstandings on the issue of understanding and building socialism: 1) poverty is not socialism and excessively slow development is not socialism either; 2) egalitarianism is not socialism and neither is polarization; 3) socialism cannot be developed with rigidity and self-closure, nor can it be developed by copying other countries indiscriminately; 4) no democracy, no socialism; no legal system, no socialism; and 5) socialism cannot be successful without due attention to both material and spiritual civilization. These five aspects were Comrade Xiaoping's rethink about "what socialism is" from the perspective of integrating theory with practice. They clarified the distinction between scientific socialism and various distorted forms of socialism. By clarifying what socialism "is not," he actually answered the question of "what it is." Comrade Xiaoping is not a "book worshipper" and has never studied problems using a scholastic approach. Instead, he has always grasped the core of an issue by closely integrating it with reality. He has repeatedly emphasized: The Marxism we must adhere to "must be the Marxism which integrates with China's reality"; the socialism we must adhere to "must be the socialism with Chinese characteristics which fits in with China's reality." This understanding of socialism is in line with the world outlook and methodology of dialectical materialism and is a flexible application of the Marxist, scientific ideological line. This correct understanding of socialism standardized the path of developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in all dimensions. The 13th CPC National Congress in 1987 summed up the experience in building socialism with Chinese characteristics and made a macrosummary of the theory, thus further clarifying this issue. Therefore, when meeting with foreign guests in May 1988, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Our mind used to be full of do's and don'ts but we have now broken out of them" and "it is not until now that we have solved the question of what socialism is." Solving here means finding a "new road" and "putting forward a series of new principles and policies." As Comrade Xiaoping put it, its "focal point is to shift from taking class struggle as the key link to centering round developing productive forces, from closure to opening up, and from sticking to the old ways to carrying out reforms in various fields." According to this idea and on the basis of Comrade Xiaoping's talks on his inspection tour of southern China in 1992, the 14th CPC National Congress made a new summary of this theoretical system, clearly putting forward the new concept of "Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics" and made an appeal for "equipping the whole party" with this theory, thus upgrading the understanding partywide of this new theory which was considered "Marxism for today's China." II. As "Marxism for today's China," Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics has a very rich content. Looking upon it as both Marxist and Chinese, both socialist and contemporary, we can find the following especially important aspects in which it is a development of basic Marxist theory. 1. The theory of the initial stage of socialism. This was a great creation made by the second-generation central leadership collective with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at the core and is of great significance both in theory and in practice. First, this theory is a profound analysis of the national conditions of our country. It confirmed that to build socialism in a context of backward productive forces and an underdeveloped commodity economy, it is imperative to first accomplish the task of industrialization and of the commercialization, socialization, and modernization of production. Thereupon, it clarified the the starting point in formulating the party's line, principle, and policy and laid the first theoretical cornerstone for the establishment of the theoretical system of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Second, highlighting the initial stage of socialism, considered quite a lengthy period, in the entire history of socialism helped us improve our understanding of the protracted and arduous nature of building socialism and overcome the "left"-leaning impetuosity transcending the confines of each historical phase which we had failed to overcome for decades. Third, the theory of the initial stage of socialism is the theoretical basis of the theory that the party's basic line should be upheld unswervingly for 100 years. It takes at least 100 years to basically realize socialist modernization and achieve the level of medium-developed countries. All this period belongs to the initial stage of socialism. The party's basic line is the basic line that takes care of the entire initial stage and ensures the fulfillment of this goal. To achieve this goal, the party's basic line must not be shaken. Lastly, the theory of the initial stage of socialism has opened up a new approach to building socialism for underdeveloped countries. The specific national conditions of our country determined that China could not directly conduct a socialist revolution and that China's revolution must be carried out in two phases; in the same way, they determined that after its revolution succeeded, China could not directly copy the formulation for building socialism in developed countries conceived by Marx and Engels but must first go through an initial stage of socialism. If the theory of new democracy provided a model for the convergence between democratic revolution and socialist revolution in underdeveloped countries, the theory of the initial stage of socialism has provided another approach to the convergence between the socialist construction of an underdeveloped country and the socialist construction in the developed phase. 2. The theory of developing productive forces, emancipating productive forces, and the "three-beneficial" criteria with the "criterion of productive forces" at the core. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics first of all confirms the idea that the fundamental task of socialism is to develop productive forces and lays special emphasis on their development. If finding an answer to the question of what socialism is and how to build socialism is the theme of the three volumes of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, the main answer to this theme, namely, emphasizing the need to concentrate energies on the development of productive forces and that "socialism with Chinese characteristics is the socialism that continuously develops social productive forces," is a main line running through all three volumes of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. He used this idea to answer every question he raised about what socialism is. He emphasized that "development is the last word" and that we must rid ourselves of all interference and strive to boost economic construction even if it means we will have to toughen our scalp [ying zhe tou pi 4289 4192 7333 4122]; this is our overriding concern and "everything has to give way to this overriding concern." He also suggested that "the most important principle of socialism is to develop production" and emphasized that the basic line of the party is to "center round economic construction." That "reform is also the emancipation of the productive forces" is another new viewpoint in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. There was no mention in Marxist and Leninist books regarding whether or not the issue of emancipating the productive forces would remain after the establishment of the socialist system; and neither was any answer given to this question in Mao Zedong's works. Through his rethink on the socialist practice, Comrade Xiaoping believed that it does not fit in with the context of a socialist country to only talk about developing the productive forces without mentioning the need to emancipate the productive forces through reform. Generally speaking, the basic contradictions of a socialist society, production relations versus productive forces and superstructure versus economic base, which are two aspects of the unity of opposites, basically conform with each other. However, under special circumstances, the two sides can also experience sharp conflict. For example, the old system may seriously restrict the development of the productive forces and wrong lines and policies may cause repeated setbacks to economic construction. Therefore, Comrade Xiaoping suggested emancipating the productive forces through reform and that "we should be inclusive when talking about emancipating the productive forces and developing them. Here, "being inclusive" means that the socialist system in our country actually shoulders the dual task of developing the productive forces and emancipating them. This further deepened our understanding of the movement of the basic contradictions of socialism and developed the socialism theory of Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought. The "criterion of productive forces" is a Marxist concept with a well defined meaning put forward by the 13th CPC National Congress. In his talks made during his inspection tour of southern China, Comrade Xiaoping developed the theory of the "criterion of the productive forces" into the theory of the "three benefits" criteria. We consider it a development for the following reasons: First, it not only upholds the theory of the "criterion of productive forces," (being the most important of the "three benefits"), but also makes more concrete and practical the abstract theoretical form of the theory on the "criterion of productive forces." The second and third "benefits" are the extension, supplement, and specification of the first "benefit." Second, in terms of epistemology, the theory of the "three-benefit" criteria is more comprehensive. As productive forces develop and the overall national strength increases, does it mean the people's living standards will definitely improve accordingly? The dramatic changes in some socialist countries indicate that the answer is no. Theoretically, they should go hand in hand but, in practice, there is often a contrast [fan cha 0646 1567]. In view of such historical lessons, proposing the theory of the "three-benefit" criteria will be more conducive to the consolidation and development of the socialist system. Third, it embodies an understanding of the principal social contradiction in our country at present more clearly and integrates the criterion of productive forces with the criterion of people's interests. At present, the principal social contradiction of our country is that between the ever growing demand of the people for materials and culture and backward social production. The way it is written, the theory of "three-benefit" criteria not only highlights the fundamental task of putting development of the productive forces in the first place but also emphasizes the need to implement it at the basic point of improving people's living standards. In other words, it puts whether or not something is conducive to improving people's living standards together with whether or not it is conducive to developing the productive forces, making it a criterion for measuring the correctness and performance of the party's work. This is the integration of the criterion of productive forces with the criterion of people's interests. In practice, it is more conducive to reflecting the party's aim of serving the people wholeheartedly and the socialist nature of our country which puts the people's interests first. 3. Theory on socialist planned commodity economy and socialist market economy. These were epoch-making breakthroughs in the traditional socialist economic theory and can also be considered two revolutionary structures [jian gou 1696 2845] of Marxist political economy by the second-generation central leadership collective with Comrade Xiaoping at the core. As far as the social-economic form is concerned, for a long time, it was believed that socialism was a society of product economy and its management system follows that of the planned economy. From Lenin to Mao Zedong, though this opinion was changed somewhat in theory and practice, there was no thorough breakthrough. The reform and opening up since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee has been "an earth-shaking cause, a great experiment, a revolution." As a summary of the experience of the great revolutionary practice, the "Decision By the CPC Central Committee on the Reform of the Economic Structure," made by our party in October 1984, put forward the formulation that the socialist economy "is a planned commodity economy on the basis of public ownership." For the first time, it admitted that the commodity economy is an intrinsic, innate, and essential requirement for socialist economic development and laid a theoretical foundation for making a series of major economic policies in China's overall reform and opening up. With the surging tide of reform and opening up, the conflict between planning and market in the system and the mechanism of economic management has become progressively intense. While equating the planned economy with socialism, long-standing traditional values also mixed up the market economy with capitalism. It has been very difficult to change this fixed concept. Comrade Xiaoping has made a dozen speeches since 1979, repeatedly pointing out: "There is no fundamental contradiction between socialism and the market economy," that socialism can also practice the market economy, that "productive forces can be better emancipated" by integrating planning with the market, and that "it is untrue that practicing a bit of the market economy means following the capitalist road." In his talks during his inspection tour of southern China in 1992, he once again pointed out that planning and market "are both economic means" and "not an essential distinction between socialism and capitalism." Later, through the 14th CCPC National Ccongress, our party officially established the theory of the "socialist market economy." The "Decision By the CPC Central Committee on Certain Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic System" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, further enriched and developed this theory. The founding of the theory of socialist planned commodity economy and the theory of socialist market economy are the "latest achievements" in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as a product of the integration of Marxism with China's reality. They are the chief markers of his theory reaching the height of Marxism. 4. The theory on the nature of socialism. This was a new viewpoint presented by Comrade Xiaoping during his southern China tour. How should we look at the theory of "the nature of socialism," this new summing-up definition? In my opinion, this new definition, compared with all previous definitions, has at least the following four merits: First, it highlights the object of the effort to dispel chaos and restore order. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Concentrating energies on the development of the productive forces on the basis of adhering to the four cardinal principles" is the "most fundamental effort to dispel chaos and restore order." It is obviously in view of the grave historical lessons that the theory on "the nature of socialism" emphasizes the need to develop the productive forces. Second, it highlights creativity which contains new ideas. Comrade Xiaoping believes that it was incomplete to talk about developing the productive forces in the context of socialism in the past without talking about emancipating the productive forces through reform; we should talk about both emancipating and developing the productive forces. Summing up the two tasks of socialism, namely, emancipating the productive forces and developing them, the nature of socialism not only underlines the role of the productive forces issue but also underlines the significance of reform. Third, it highlights the dynamic nature of socialist development and the gradual fulfillment of the nature of socialism. Socialism is a very long historical phase, divided into the initial stage and other stages, and is in a constant state of change and reform. Fulfilling the nature of socialism is a historical process. It cannot be achieved soon after the socialist system is established, nor can the deadline be categorically set for the conclusion of the initial stage of socialism. "Eventually reaching common prosperity" embodies this historical feature. This is conducive to overcoming the long-standing tendency toward "egalitarianism" and stabilizing the party's current basic policies while preventing polarization. Fourth, it highlights the ultimate goal in pursuing and developing socialism. Volume three of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping contains many expositions on the goal of socialist construction. The ideas are clearly presented and are mainly concerned with "developing production" and "common prosperity," culminating in the conclusion that developing production also has the purpose of eventually achieving common prosperity. The theory on "the nature of socialism," this new summing-up definition, fully reflects this ultimate goal. III. As the Marxism for contemporary China, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is certainly "Marxist" and "socialist." Comrade Xiaoping has firm faith in Marxism and spares no effort either of thought or action in the socialist cause. A thorough understanding of volume three of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping can easily make us see that many of his new thoughts are aimed at upholding Marxism and socialism in a better way. There are enormous elaborations on this point, the following few of which are particularly outstanding: 1. The emphasis that Marxism is a scientific theory --"We cannot desert our theoretical lineage!" Comrade Xiaoping has a profound understanding of Marxism and an uncanny power to grasp and use it. Whenever he asks, and answers, what socialism and Marxism are, he starts from the basic tenets and spells out briefly, precisely, accurately, and plainly the theoretical foundation for the series of reform and opening up policies. He said on his southern inspection tour: "We have been talking about Marxism all our lives. Marxism, in fact, is not at all esoteric. It is quite down-to-earth and simple." Comrade Xiaoping lays much emphasis on the fact that his thought has only inherited and developed Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. In August 1991, he told some central comrades-in-charge: "We have not dropped Marx, Lenin, nor Mao Zedong in pursuing reform and opening up and focusing our work on economic construction." He firmly opposes the alleged opposition between his thought and theory and Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. When American reporter Mike Wallace asked about this, he pointed out explicitly: "I am a Marxist and I have always followed basic Marxist principles" and while his thought "differs in some aspects from Mao Zedong's concepts, the two share certain principles." This explains the relationship between Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and Marxism but not between his theory and Mao Zedong's, which is more complicated. Here we need to make two distinctions. One, following the "Resolutions on Certain Problems in Party History Since the Founding of the Nation" adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, we separated Mao Zedong Thought from his mistakes in his later years. Mao Zedong Thought refers specifically to the theories and principles proved correct by practice and excludes his mistakes in his old age. Two, we distinguish between basic theoretical principles and certain specific policies or concepts. What Comrade Xiaoping describes as "some difference" between his and Mao Zedong's ideas refers mainly to the difference between his ideas and Mao Zedong's erroneous thoughts and some of his individual policies in his old age. Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics was founded on the negation of Mao Zedong's mistakes in his old age. Moreover, even if they were both right in policies or ideas in a given circumstance, different historical conditions and different social exposure, cultural characters, and intellectual perspectives between the two would have resulted in different options taken -- hence the "difference." However, this is not the main thing. When Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is compared with the basic principles of Mao Zedong Thought, we find that "the two are identical [yi yang 0001 2876] after all" and proceed along the same lines. There are obvious common points and continuity between the two in the general line of thinking (both affirm combining the general principles of Marxism with China's specific realities), theoretical character (both stress choosing one's own path, opposing blind faith in the canon, and upholding Chinese characteristics), theoretical approaches (seeking truth from facts, case analysis for individual cases, and so on), and theoretical content (compare certain viewpoints under the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics with related viewpoints in Mao Zedong Thought). Of course, we cannot simply identify one with the other, holding that Mao Zedong Thought already contains the view of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This does not accord with reality and is another kind of partiality. As explained above, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's building socialism with Chinese characteristics is grand theory; we can even say that it took Mao Zedong Thought to a new dimension. A new stage in historical development necessarily demands a parallel new phase in theoretical development. Once we recognize that the historical development following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee had moved to a new stage, the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as a scientific summation of historical experience must necessarily develop Mao Zedong Thought and take it to a new stage. 2. The emphasis that socialism is a good system; and the pursuit of reform and opening up is aimed at consolidating and developing socialism. For some, the question whether or not China should choose the capitalist or socialist road has never been properly solved. This, coupled with confusing propaganda by overseas hostile forces, has enabled a few to cherish the hope of edging China toward capitalism. Comrade Xiaoping's attitude toward this is very clear: He remains firm throughout in criticizing this mistaken tendency and has explained from varied angles and perspectives, why China cannot pursue capitalism and why only socialism can save and develop China. His analysis is based on modern Chinese history and a comparison between the two systems and he approaches the issue in a global context, explaining it in terms of peace and development for mankind. He points out: China's pursuit of socialism is also a key issue for the world; "if a 1-billion-strong China took the capitalist road it would be a disaster for the world"; China shows its sense of responsibility for one-fifth of humanity and "might make greater contributions to mankind" in opting for a socialist path. Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics upholds socialism not only in matters concerning fundamental structures but also in all the policies on reform, opening up, and modernization. Comrade Xiaoping has pointed out repeatedly: "The four modernizations we pursue are socialist in nature because only socialism is cohesive enough"; "the enlivening of the domestic economy and opening up to the outside world we are talking about develop under the principle of socialism"; "the absorption of certain good elements from the capitalist society is done to complement the development of a socialist society." This is why he has been consistently tough on bourgeois liberalization. He believes that "bourgeois liberalization" is a political concept with a definite meaning which is identical to "taking the capitalist road." Any tendency which dilutes or blurs the political content of this concept is harmful. This helps us understand why, during the entire process of reform and opening up, he, as he put it himself, "has talked most of the time about opposing bourgeois liberalization and I have been firmest about it" and "on this I have never yielded." 3. The emphasis that it takes the unceasing and unyielding effort of several or even dozens of generations to achieve long-term peace and stability in Chinese society. Socialism in China is a hard-won achievement. What must we do to consolidate and develop the present status and achieve the heroic objective of catching up with medium-developed countries in per capita GNP by the mid-21st century? This has been a key problem long on the mind of Comrade Xiaoping. He has been occupied above all by two issues: One, keeping the party's basic line and policies unchanged for a long time and two, grooming and selecting successors from whom to form a good central collective leadership. With these two problems solved, "China will be as steady as a mountain" and "socialist China will be unconquerable." The problem of keeping the party's basic line and basic policies unchanged for a long time is a theme running through volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and is expounded and explained scores of times in the book. This shows that this thinking of his has taken a long time to mature and is highly consistent. More striking is the fact that, after the 1989 political turmoil, he not only did not "change course nor what he advocated" but dwelt on the subject even more frequently, showing the extraordinary firmness of his thinking. On his southern inspection tour he stressed that "the basic line must be kept unchanged and is untouchable for the next 100 years." Whoever wants to change this line "will be struck down." Given the consistency and firmness of his thinking, this emphasis of his is a logical necessity. In May and September 1989, he talked about "the political assignment" to the party. Keeping the party's basic line and basic policies unchanged for the next 100 years is the most important political assignment he has given to the whole party and people of the whole country, Comrade Xiaoping also talked a great deal about selecting, promoting, and grooming successors, because the political task of keeping the party's basic line and policies unchanged for a long time requires organizational guarantees, specifically in the form of the passing of leadership from cadres of the older generation to younger cadres. He said on his southern inspection tour: "In a certain sense, the key to a sound pursuit of Chinese affairs, a sustained effort at socialism, reform, and opening up; speedier economic development, and long-term peace and stability for the country, lies in the personnel." "Personnel are what we have to rely on when we talk about keeping the party's basic line in command for the next 100 years and long-term peace and stability. What really determines the whole situation is personnel." This is something we cannot just take light-heartedly. He also said: "If ever there is a problem with China, it will most probably come from the party." How profound this observation was! When this problem is solved, and when generations of leaders can be selected, promoted, and groomed through a relatively perfect system and mechanism, who can guide various tasks with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in a comprehensive and accurate fashion, uphold the party's basic line and policies comprehensively and correctly and keep them unchanged, remain firm throughout in upholding the principle of wholeheartedly serving the people, work for the benefit of the people in a down-to-earth and sustained fashion, the broad masses of the people, who are masters of the historical fate of this country, will certainly feel that "after all, socialism and reform and opening up are good and that our cause will remain relevant forever!" As the Marxism for contemporary China, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a theoretical system with an open structure. As explained above, its greatness lies in its ability to anchor socialism in the contemporary world and make it more open, more receptive to all the civilized achievements of human society, including absorbing and digesting all advanced knowledge and skills embodying the laws of modern and socialized production in contemporary capitalist countries, turning them into nutrients for socialism, hence endowing the embattled world's socialist cause with new vitality and a bright future. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a brilliant paradigm of how Marxism can be integrated with China's practical conditions and socialism with contemporary realities. Of course, it has not, and cannot, ended the search for an understanding of how China constructs, consolidates, and develops socialism. The theory will be continuously enriched, perfected, and developed in the process of studying new situations, solving new problems, and being verified by practice. This is precisely its brilliance and greatness.
