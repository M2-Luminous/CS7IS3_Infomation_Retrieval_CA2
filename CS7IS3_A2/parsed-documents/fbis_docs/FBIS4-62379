As many people know, at issue is the second move for the Russian Press House from premises where nearly 40 mass media editorial offices operate. The document states that the new move has paralyzed the work of dozens of editorial offices. The collectives are incurring losses running into millions. The children's newspaper GLAGOL has been forced to announce closure. The board of the "Echo of Moscow" joint-stock company made a decision on liquidating the "Echo Moskvy" radio station if the losses and outlays are not paid. In its appeal the Judicial Chamber urges the organs of state power "to find a wise solution."
