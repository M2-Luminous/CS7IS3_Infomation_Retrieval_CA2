ACTION: Notice of the Office of Management and Budget review of information collection. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has recently submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review the following proposal for the collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35). 1. Type of submission, new, revision, or extension: Revision. 2. The title of the information collection: 10 CFR Parts 30, 32, and 35_Preparation, Transfer for Commercial Distribution, and Use of Byproduct Material for Medical Use. 3. The form number if applicable: Not applicable. 4. How often the collection is required: On occasion. 5. Who will be required or asked to report: Manufacturers of radioactive drugs, independent nuclear pharmacies, and medical use licensees. 6. An estimate of the total number of responses: 16 additional responses (307 responses required and 291 responses eliminated). 7. An estimate of the total number of hours needed to complete the requirement or request: A reduction of 408 hours (an increase of 43 hours for recordkeeping and a reduction of 451 hours for reporting). The estimated 307 responses average 0.6 hour per response versus the 291 responses eliminated that average 2.2 hours per response. 8. An indication whether Section 3504(h), Public Law 96&hyph;511 applies: Applicable. 9. Abstract: In response to a petition for rulemaking submitted by the American College of Nuclear Physicians and the Society of Nuclear Medicine, the NRC is amending its regulations for the medical use of byproduct material. This rule is necessary to provide greater flexibility by eliminating current regulatory restrictions and allowing properly qualified nuclear pharmacists and authorized users who are physicians greater discretion in preparing radioactive drugs containing byproduct material for medical use. This rule will also allow the use of byproduct material in both research involving human subjects and the medical use of radiolabeled biologics. In addition, this rule also contains other miscellaneous and conforming amendments necessary to clarify or update the current regulations. Copies of the submittal may be inspected or obtained for a fee from the NRC Public Document Room 2120 L Street NW (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Comments and questions can be directed by mail to the OMB reviewer: Troy Hillier, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, (3150&hyph;0001, &hyph;0010, and &hyph;0120), NEOB&hyph;10202, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.
