The SLD obtained an absolute majority in Sosnowiec, Ostrowiec Swietokrzyski, Walbrzych, and Wloclawek.

Compared with parliamentary elections, it had a worse result in 69 cities and a better one in 29. In 23, there was no change. The largest drop in the SLD's popularity was noted in Katowice Province. Analysis of the results in single-seat constituencies is still continuing. According to data available now, the alliance has won an absolute majority in seven rural parishes. During today's meeting, the SDRP Supreme Council will make an initial analysis of the party associates' performances in the election campaign.
