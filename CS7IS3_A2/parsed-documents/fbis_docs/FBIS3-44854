The essence of democracy is to let the people have the right over their own interest and happiness, and the top interest of the Hong Kong people is to maintain the region's prosperity and stability. Only the Basic Law can satisfy the wish and demand of the compatriots in Hong Kong, and this is common knowledge among the people. However, three months after Chris Patten was appointed governor of Hong Kong in June 1992, he put forward a "political bill", claiming to assume a moral responsibility for Hong Kong's democratization. In the past one year and more, Governor Chris Patten has clung to his bill, taking no heed of the agreements and understandings reached between China and Britain and the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong. People can hardly understand such practice by Chris Patten. Britain has governed Hong Kong for over 150 years during which it has never advocated democracy. Why does the British side suddenly remember to give democracy to Hong Kong people when it is soon to end its rule over Hong Kong? The Chinese side has reiterated time and again that over 150 years of British rule over Hong Kong, the center of differences between China and Britain on the Hong Kong issue is not democracy, but of whether acting in good faith. Democracy is an important symbol of social progress, and the Chinese Government has always given support to democratic reform in Hong Kong. It is China which first proposed to implement a pattern of democracy of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong and let the Hong Kong people to enjoy the democratic right of "high autonomy" in Sino-British talks in 1982. Later, China spent four years and eight months to formulate "the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China", which advocates the principle of "gradual and orderly progress for Hong Kong democratic reform". In the world, all things have their own development rule and need a process of emergence, development and maturing. The same is true with the establishment of a democratic system. For example, Britain and the United States spent 200 to 300 years to realize their modern democratic reforms. The democracy of Hong Kong cannot be fulfilled in one day. If things are done against the law of development, that would lead to turmoil and affect social stability. And further more that will not be conducive to the Hong Kong's investment environment. Such a situation is surely not desired by the Hong Kong people. Based on this, the Basic Law proposes that in the first ten years after 1997, the year for China to resume its sovereignty over Hong Kong, it will carry out both direct and indirect elections, and in 2007 a general election will be held according to a legal process. The process of democratic reform in Hong Kong stipulated in the Basic Law has given full consideration to the wish of the Hong Kong people and is in keeping with the development law of democracy. During the discussions of the Basic Law, the central government had listened extensively to opinions from various circles in Hong Kong. The announcement of the Basic Law has won praise from people in Hong Kong, the mainland, and the world as whole. Even the British Government spoke highly of the law. Among all the developments, Governor Chris Patten dished out his "political bill". People who know the history of rule by colonialism can see the real purpose of Chris Patten is to help a group of pro-British persons to power, especially those who wish to challenge the central government, so as to make the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region powerless. By doing so, Britain can reach its goal of continuing the colonialist rule over Hong Kong in another form. The same old tricks had been used in some British colonies in Asia, Africa and Europe. The majority of the Hong Kong people are able to see through those tricks. It is known to all that during the five years of drafting the Basic Law, China had carried out a very open and democratic way of discussions on all issues, especially on the method of selection of the chief executive of the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the forming of the Legislative Council. The selection method for the chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR and forming of the Legislative Council are open and just, and are supported by the Hong Kong people. In contrast, the "political bill" of Governor Chris Patten is not open and democratic. Chris Patten arrived in Hong Kong in June 1992 and dished out his "political bill" in September. Besides deliberations with the British Government, the bill was announced without consultation with the majority of the Hong Kong people. In the transitional period before 1997, more and more Hong Kong people will see through the real purpose of the British authorities in Hong Kong and work jointly with the people from the mainland for the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
