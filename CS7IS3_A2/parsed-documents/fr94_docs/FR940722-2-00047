FR940722-2-00047 FR940722-2-00028 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;656&hyph;000] General Services Administration; Notice of Application for the Construction, Operation, Maintenance, and Connection of Facilities for Importation of Natural Gas at the United States/ Canada International Boundary July 18, 1994. Take notice that on July 12, 1994, the General Services Administration (GSA), Denver Federal Center, Building 41, Room 200, P.O. Box 25006, Denver, Colorado, 80225&hyph;006, filed an application pursuant to section 3 of the Natural Gas Act, Executive Order No. 10485, as amended by Executive Order No. 12038; and Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;112 of the Secretary of Energy. GSA seeks a Presidential Permit for a point of entry for the importation of natural gas and section 3 authority to construct, operate, maintain and connect natural gas import facilities. The proposed facilities will extend from the Canadian border to the Piegan Immigration and Customs Station near Babb, Montana. GSA's proposal is more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. GSA says the import facilities will consist of 2,155 feet of 1 and one-half inch pipe. The proposed pipe will deliver up to 146 Mcf per day to the Piegan Border Station and several adjacent Staff residences. The estimated cost of the facilities is $12,500. The line will connect to the facilities of the Chief Mountain Natural Gas Cooperative, who will also build a tap and meter in Canada. GSA says that natural gas service is needed to replace propane which currently fuels heating equipment at the Piegan Border Station. GSA says the current propane heating system is sub-standard and violates local mechanical codes. The GSA requests that the Commission grant this application on an expedited basis. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest this application should file a motion to intervene or protest on or before August 1, 1994, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All motions to intervene or protests should be submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426. All protests filed will be considered, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene in accordance with Rule 214. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
