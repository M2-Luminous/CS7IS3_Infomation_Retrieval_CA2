Surin said, however, that Australia and other countries considering the request from Cambodia had taken their own positions into account when deciding on the arms request. The minister was referring to a report that Canberra preferred to implement the promise to provide about US$2.2 million for mine clearing and training with a separate programme for civil servants. "Any additional assistance that we provide is likely to be focused on the area of training and institutional support," Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evens was quoted as saying. Cambodia has sought military aid from several countries, including the U.S. and France to fight against the guerrillas. The request for the weapons coincided with the failed roundtable talks hosted by King Norodom Sihanouk in North Korea last month. Surin said stressed that the Thai position on Cambodia's request to three western countries to provide weapons for the Cambodian government to fight the Khmer Rouge is based on its sincere and honest desire to see lasting peace in Cambodia. "Thailand's position on the issue is not to interfere in the internal affairs of Cambodia. We want to deny that. Our country and ASEAN have long participated in helping to solve the Cambodian conflict, we have the right to state our position," Surin said. Bangkok opposed the request on the grounds that more weapons would prolong the fighting and the ill-disciplined and unpaid Cambodian government troops may sell the weapons to others, even the Khmer Rouge. Surin had earlier said that military aid should focus on a training programme for civil servants. Cambodia's First Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, had criticized those who opposed the request for weapons as interference in Cambodia's internal conflict. "I am glad that Thai position on the issue was taken into consideration," Surin said. According to Surin, the Australian Foreign Ministry's Permanent Secretary, Michael Costello, had explored the Thai position on the issue with Surin during a recent meeting. "The western countries are well aware that Thailand and other ASEAN countries have taken part in solving the Cambodian conflict. Therefore they explored the idea and I explained the Thai position when asked," Surin said. The U.S. and France have also sought Thai opinion on the issue, which has already been conveyed through the Thai embassies in the two countries. Meanwhile, an informed source said yesterday that Son Sann, leader of Cambodia's Khmer People's National Liberal Front, during talks with Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri last month also voiced opposition to the request, saying that the supply of weapons would prolong the fighting. He added that Cambodia also forwarded the request to Canada and Japan. A Cambodian party, the Khmer Neutral Party, has appealed to the international community to stop military aid to Cambodia to end suffering, but instead provide it with financial aid to implement economic development. The party's chairman, Buo Hel, said in a statement dated May 23 that to overcome "this terrible reality" the Cambodian conflict must not be solved by military aid from foreign countries but by a political solution through the participation of all Cambodian parties at a roundtable conference. "On behalf of Khmer Neutral Party I would like to make an appeal to the international community to cease military aid. To solve the problem, all factions concerned should hand full power to His Majesty the King Norodom Sihanouk, to decide the future of the country," said Buo Hel.
