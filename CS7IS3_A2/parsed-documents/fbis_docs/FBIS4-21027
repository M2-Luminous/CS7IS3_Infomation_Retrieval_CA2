Three other men with him in the rented small plane were given suspended prison sentences. The 29-year-old Helsinki pilot Hannu Soppela in August 1993 brought 4 kg of amphetamines from Estonia to Helsinki's Malm Airport. He had arranged with a couple of other men to bring in the substance. The case involving these is still not completed. Soppela received 1 kg of amphetamines as pay for his courier trip, and he further distributed this amount. Some 140 grams was confiscated from him. In connection with further investigation a total of around 1.2 kg were seized. The court took into account as a mitigating factor that Soppela had cooperated with authorities in solving the case. A 30-year-old Riihimaki pilot who had been along as a courier received a suspended prison sentence of two years. That pilot denied the guilt during the entire trial, saying he did not know that the smuggled substance was amphetamines. He claimed he understood that they were bringing hormones from Estonia. In the opinion of the court, the flyer understood at least when he was in Tallinn that amphetamines were involved. According to Soppela, he had shown the substance to the other pilot before the trip home. He and Soppela had together planned concealing the amphetamines in the body of the airplane. The court gave two other men suspended prison sentences for complicity in a felony narcotics crime. A 31-year-old Helsinki fireman received a term of one year and nine months, and a 29-year-old Helsinki porter one year and six months.
