FR940922-2-00080 FR940922-2-00052 [Investigation No. 337&hyph;TA&hyph;315] Certain Plastic Encapsulated Integrated Circuits; Enforcement Proceeding; Decision Not To Review an Initial Determination Granting Partial Summary Determination AGENCY: U.S. International Trade Commission. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined not to review an initial determination (ID) (Order No. 7) issued on August 11, 1994, by the presiding administrative law judge (ALJ) in the above-captioned enforcement proceeding. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrea C. Casson, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, D.C. 20436, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;3105. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission instituted this formal enforcement proceeding on January 10, 1994. 59 FR 3123&hyph;27 (Jan. 20, 1994). The enforcement proceeding complaint was filed by the Commission's Office of Unfair Import Investigations (OUII), and alleges violations of the Commission cease and desist order and modified cease and desist order issued in the underlying investigation against respondent Analog Devices, Inc. (Analog). The complaint seeks appropriate sanctions for these alleged violations. The parties to the enforcement proceeding are OUII, represented by its investigative attorneys (IAs); enforcement proceeding respondent Analog; and Texas Instruments, Inc. (TI), the complainant in the underlying investigation. In its response to the complaint, Analog denied that it violated the terms of the Commission's cease and desist orders. In addition, Analog alleged several affirmative defenses, including: waiver against the Commission, equitable estoppel against the Commission, and Commission action that is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and contrary to law. On June 28, 1994, Analog filed a motion for summary determination seeking termination of the enforcement proceeding on the grounds that there are no genuine issues of disputed facts. The IAs and TI filed responses in opposition to Analog's motion for summary determination. The IAs also filed a cross-motion for partial summary determination with respect to Analog's affirmative defenses. TI supported, and Analog opposed, the IAs' cross-motion. On August 22, 1994 the ALJ issued an order (Order No. 7) denying Analog's motion for summary determination, and an ID granting the IAs' cross-motion for partial summary determination regarding Analog's affirmative defenses. Analog petitioned for review of the ID granting the IAs' cross-motion, and the IAs and TI filed responses in opposition to Analog's petition. Analog also requested oral argument on its petition. The Commission denied that request. See 19 CFR 210.56(a) (1994). This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. ยง1337, and ยง210.53 of the Commission's interim Rules of Practice and Procedure, 19 CFR 210.53 (1994). Copies of the nonconfidential version of the ID and all other nonconfidential documents filed in connection with this enforcement proceeding are or will be available for inspection during official business hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, D.C. 20436, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;2000. Hearing-impaired persons are advised that information on this matter can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal on 202&hyph;205&hyph;1810. Issued: September 13, 1994. By order of the Commission. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23381 Filed 9&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
