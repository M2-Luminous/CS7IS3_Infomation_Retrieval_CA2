They have been charged with terrorist acts on the al-Balamand road on 28 June 1993, detonating bombs in several resorts, and possessing arms. Hulayhil has confessed that he is a member of the Islamic Group and that he participated in detonating an explosive device on the road to the al-Balamand Monastery. He said his role consisted of tying the detonating wire in such a way that when the targeted bus hit it the explosion would occur six seconds later. Hulayhil explained that this type of denotation requires no special expertise. He said he received bombing training in al-Dinniyah several years ago. Bilal al-Kasan, another suspect, said his role in that attack was to stand guard. He reported that the bombing was staged to retaliate for events in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to expel the Christian clerics from al-Balamand. All the suspects denied bombing tourist resorts.
