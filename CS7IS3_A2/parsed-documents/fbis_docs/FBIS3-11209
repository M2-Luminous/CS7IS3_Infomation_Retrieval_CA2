In this connection, a group of jurists made up of Jose Guillermo Andueza, Ricardo Combellas, and Tulio Alvarez have completed the drafting of the document containing the proposals pertinent to this effort that will be set forth by the National Convergence spokesmen. It appears that this effort will be plagued by obstacles. There are sectors in Congress that belong to various political movements and that favor beginning the discussions on constitutional reform again, from the zero mark. This would involve setting aside four years of work carried out by the Bicameral Commission, over which Rafael Caldera, the president-elect, presided. The Convergence, for its part, wants a new Constitution approved this year. To this end, Jose Guillermo Andueza will meet at 1100 this morning with the board of the Supreme Court of Justice to analyze possible changes in the judicial branch. The strategy involves launching a discussion with all sectors in the country as soon as possible and maintaining the idea that the work of many years should not be jettisoned simply because sectors interested in blocking the "initiatives for change" might exist. The document in question is entitled "Proposed Constitutional Reform (comments on the proposal approved by the Senate on first discussion)." It is 44 pages long and, as was to be expected, it deals with many aspects. The most novel were chosen for the purposes of this article. The editorial commission agreed that the four types of referendum, or direct vote by the citizens on specific proposals, should be maintained. They are the approbatory, abrogative, consultative, and revocatory forms. According to the document, the initiative for the convocation of an approbatory referendum should come from the majority of the members of one of the legislative chambers, "and not while they are meeting in joint session." Also, reconsideration of the Senate proposal according to which this form could also be used when 5 percent of the electors in each body so desire was recommended. This was not, however, set forth as an alternate proposal. Where the revocatory referendum on members of the executive branch designated prior to election is concerned, the document deems it desirable that the requirement for convocation be reduced. That requirement is currently estimated at 15 percent of the registered electors, "and its effects on revocation of the mandate when more than 50 percent have cast negative votes." The document also proposes that the authority of such a referendum be extended to include the dissolution of the Congress as a whole, rather than just its members considered individually." Concerning the abrogative referendum for revoking laws, the document urges "reconsideration of the Senate proposal to limit the time allowed for convocation to the six months following approval of the law." There were no comments made on the proposal regarding the advisory referendum. With the Convergence version of a new constitution, not only would it be possible to dissolve the parliament through an electoral method, but the president of the Republic could also dissolve it, as suggested by Francisco Eguiogunen, the Peruvian treatise writer. On this basis, if the chief of state had to deal with an adverse parliament, he could order it dissolved and could immediately convoke new elections. If the balance of forces should fail to change, the executive branch would then find itself under interdiction and would have to be replaced. If, on the contrary, votes favorable to the government party were obtained, this would be interpreted as popular support of the executive administration. On the state level, the norm would be modified, since according to the document, the legislative assemblies could only be dissolved if the people were to approve the governor's administration, after the legislature itself had rejected the reports and statements. This represents an effort to establish a mechanism for exerting control over possible "political excesses." The document of the Andueza-Combellas-Alvarez commission expresses the belief that "the complexity of government functions has made it necessary to rethink the possibility of establishing the position of prime minister" in order to assist the president in the task of coordinating the work of the executive branch. The duties of this official would include the following, among others: to propose the appointment and removal of cabinet members; to coordinate the national plans with those of the states and municipalities; to receive the accounting reports of the ministers; and to take responsibility for the relations between the executive and legislative branches. According to recommendations of this document, the prime minister could be removed by presidential decision, or after approval of a censure motion by at least three-fifths of the members of the Chamber of Deputies. This would entail, in addition, the resignation of the entire cabinet. Because of space limitations, other aspects dealt with in the document (elimination of the Judicature Council, reestablishment of the contracts of national interest, creation of frontier zones, etc.) could not be included in this article. The debate is just beginning, however, and the plan that emerges from it will have to be submitted to the people for approval, on a basis similar to the Guatemalan experience last Sunday.
