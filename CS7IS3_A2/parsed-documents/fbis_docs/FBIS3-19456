A sign of an "economic revival" is a "reversal of the trend" in the labor market. At the moment 13,000 more persons are employed than in mid-March 1993. As Vranitzky said yesterday at a press conference after the Cabinet meeting, unemployment went down by 25,000 persons over the past two weeks. For men, who had been particularly affected by job cuts in industry, unemployment is 8.5 percent below the value of March 1993, Vranitzky said. A total of 32,000 foreigners currently are unemployed, compared with 38,000 at the end of February. Vranitzky stated that the more favorable development is due to the fact that construction work began earlier this year. He expects the latest development to have a positive effect on the referendum for membership in the European Union.
