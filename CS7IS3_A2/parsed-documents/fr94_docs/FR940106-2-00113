FR940106-2-00113 FR940106-2-00062 [Docket No. 50&hyph;331] Iowa Electric Light and Power Co.; Issuance of Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;49, issued to Iowa Electric Light and Power Company (the licensee), for operation of the Duane Arnold Energy Center (DAEC), located in Linn County, Iowa. Identification of Proposed Action The amendment would consist of a change to the Operating License that would increase the storage capacity of the spent fuel pool to 3152 fuel assemblies, including a rack which can be used for temporary storage of 323 fuel assemblies. The amendment to the TS is responsive to the licensee's application dated March 26, 1993, and supplemented by additional correspondence dated September 15 and November 23, 1993. The NRC staff has prepared an Environmental Assessment of the proposed action. Summary of Environmental Assessment The ``Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement (FGEIS) on Handling and Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel'' (NUREG&hyph;0575), Volumes 1&hyph;3 (1979), concluded that the environmental impact of interim storage of spent fuel was negligible and the cost of the various alternatives reflects the advantage of continued generation of nuclear power with the accompanying spent fuel storage. Because of the differences in design, the FGEIS recommended evaluating spent fuel pool expansions on a case-by-case basis. For DAEC, the expansion of the storage capacity of the spent fuel pool will not create any significant additional radiological effects or nonradiological environmental impacts beyond those assessed in the Commission's Final Environmental Statement (FES) issued in March 1973 related to the operation of DAEC, and in the Safety Evaluation Report issued July 7, 1978, in support of a previous license amendment concerning storage capacity. The occupational radiation dose for the proposed operation of the expanded spent fuel pool is estimated to be less than 2 percent of the total annual occupational radiation exposure for this facility. Finding of No Significant Impact The staff has reviewed the proposed spent fuel pool expansion to the facility relative to the requirements set forth in 10 CFR part 51. Based on this assessment, the staff concludes that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological impacts associated with the proposed action and that the issuance of the proposed amendment to the license will have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.31, no environmental impact statement needs to be prepared for this action.

Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 29th day of December 1993. Robert M.
