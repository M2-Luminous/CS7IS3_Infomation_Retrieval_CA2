After graduating from China People's University in the History Department's undergraduate course in July, 1961, he studied Western European economics at Fudan University, Shanghai, and for eight years studied Western economics at Fudan University's Capitalist Countries Economic Research Institute. In October, 1985, he was appointed as CP General Secretary in Xuzhou City, and in March, 1990, he was appointed Mayor of Shenzhen. In October, 1992, he was appointed Deputy Governor of Jiangxi Province. He now holds concurrent appointments as Professor at Fudan University and the China People's University. Question: In a market economy, self-operated enterprises and consumers making consumption choices of their own free should be the microscopic foundation of the entire market economy. With the cancellation of commodity supply licenses and development of a consumption area, consumers' sovereign rights are being fulfilled. Therefore, the most prominent feature of China's microscopic structural foundation is this point of self operation and vitality problems for enterprises. What do you think are the difficulties and problems? Zheng: The greatest success of the past more than a decade's reform has been the breakthrough in the situation of state-owned enterprises dominating the economy, enlivening the nonstate-owned economy (especially the privately owned economy) encouraging it to survive through market competition and to develop. Contrasted to this, the achievements of reform in the key area of state-owned enterprises have turned out to be not very satisfying. For many years, cities which centered their reform efforts on state-owned enterprises tried out many reform plans: these range from invigorating self-operational rights, implementing multiple pattern responsibility systems, converting profits to taxes, reorganizing the external environment for industries by making price reform breakthroughs, down to the present contracting system and joint stock system experiments. Although the production and operations system in state-owned enterprises has improved, the problems of sluggishness, low efficiency, lack of ability to self-adjust and a slow pace in adjusting the mix are still very prominent. The key to integrating the socialist system with the market economy lies in finding a way to fulfill state-owned property rights under the market economy. And this is also the difficulty. In a market economy situation, some enterprises become bankrupt, but more enterprises are started and develop. becoming the motive power for adjustment of the industrial mix and technological progress. The state-owned enterprises we have now are hard to match up with this sort of adjustment procedure. This is most prominent in the two features of administrative restrictions brought on by social restrictions and the twisting of government's role because of enterprise adjustment under the old pattern of distribution. In the first place, the state-owned enterprises that we have built up over several decades are at the same time a society. Employment of family members, education of the children, housing, providing for the elderly, and cultural life all became a part of enterprise management. This is determined once an enterprise is formed, it must develop steadily, it is difficult to bankrupt and clear accounts. Although we have come a long way in invigorating enterprises since implementing reform and opening, a tendency to be short of revenue has meant that matters which should have been handled by society have continued to be left to enterprises. Financial pressures and social burdens on enterprises grew constantly, and certainly placed obstructions in the path of reform moving on to free competition. Therefore, 1) enterprises bear heavy burdens with low ability to self-develop, and with old facilities and technology. They lack the ability to adjust themselves to suit market competition, referred to as being "old, weak, and frequently ill." If this fact is not taken into account, it will be hard for any kind of measures for converting the operational system to work. 2) Employment: since we chiefly consider it from the standpoint of social stability, pursuing the employment rate becomes our objective, and we often put two and even more people in a single job; staff and their family members have a relationship with enterprises which cannot be severed. 3) State-owned enterprises have very little capital of their own: their production and operations are dependent for the most part on loans from state-owned banks, and for some enterprises which lack sufficient capital to repay their loans, banks are their biggest creditors, so that bankruptcy means bankruptcy for the bank too. Although the laws governing dismissal of staff and enterprise bankruptcy are clearly defined, they are very hard to implement. A second point is that it is currently impossible to sever the relationship that exists between government and the development of enterprises: first, because the government relies on enterprises to resolve social problems, so that when losses by enterprises harm the staff's social lives, they will definitely turn to the government to resolve their difficulties. Second, the government still has the right to review and approve projects, and can influence bank loans. Three, the government holds allocation rights for energy, transportation, and important good resources. Fourth is the subjective relationship that exists between operators named by the government and government at higher and lower levels, a situation where organizational reform lags behind the conversion of governmental functions. This is a long-standing problem with state-owned enterprises, and it has to a considerable degree restricted enterprise reform and the pace of converting the operational system. Question: In these circumstances, how do we speed up converting the operational system in state-owned enterprises? Zheng: The key to speeding up converting the operating system of state-owned enterprises lies in fulfilling state-owned property rights. The way to do this is to reorganize state-owned enterprises into a modern enterprise system. All the regulations and laws of market economics are based on clear property relationships; strictly speaking, they are all property laws and regulations. The separation of ownership rights and operating rights should be a separation which is founded on clear property rights and under the condition of property restriction. The state-owned enterprises should have not only the operators' initiative power system, but also a system of balances; this is not just to invigorate the enterprises, but also to maintain the state's restrictive function as the owners' representative. So, it can be implemented on two levels of separation: separation between final ownership rights and legal person ownership rights; and separation between legal person ownership rights and enterprise operational rights. The ultimate owners will become enterprise shareholders, owning stocks, and the enterprises will have legal person rights as independent legal bodies undertaking civil responsibility. In this level of separation, enterprise boards of directors act as legal owners responsible for ultimate ownership, having the occupational rights to enterprise property, rights of use and handling, while the ultimate owners have the right of ultimate profit income. The ultimate owners only undertake responsibility for debts of enterprises limited by the amount of pledged assets in that enterprise; based on the shareholders trust in them, the board of directors will have full powers to run enterprise property and undertake operational responsibility. This forms the property organizational system in modern enterprises. The second level of separation of two rights is appropriate separation of operating rights and ownership rights. This means that the enterprise management is nominated by the board of directors, and production, supply and sales, personnel, property, and goods are managed in detail by managerial staff, and they are responsible for implementing operating policy, having enterprise operating rights. The ultimate ownership restricts operations and management in enterprises by means of the modern enterprise organizational form, letting them endeavor to make maximum profits and in the end continue to both the state's and the individual's property. In China, enterprises are going in the direction of system reform which will establish a new type of enterprise system in which the modern joint stock corporation is the substance, realizing a separation of property rights under value formation and material object formation and unification of socialization of property and clarification of enterprises' property rights. This direction for reform of the enterprise system in China shows that reorganization of joint stock enterprises should become a major content of enterprise reform. In reorganizing state-owned enterprises into a modern corporate system, the key is to accomplish the separation of ownership rights and legal person ownership rights restricted by the state-owned property rights responsibility. In corporations, the state acts as the stockholder or one of the stockholders, entrusting the directors to act as its agent, participating or forming the board of directors, while the board of directors independently assumes civil responsibility for enterprises' property. Having the right of property handling, they can pay off debts with their property and make up losses. As the ultimate owner, the state assumes only limited responsibility for enterprises, which completely removes the enterprises from the state's "big iron pot." The state reviews the performance of the board of directors and makes decisions on its members' appointment and dismissal on the basis of value preservation and value added to assets authorized by the state and profits gained from the property; the board of directors makes the decisions concerning the selection and appointment of managers. A system of mutual encouragement and balance among owners, operators, and workers will be established inside enterprises. To form an association between property rights and responsibilities, actually pushing the state-owned enterprises to market will not only protect the state-owned property rights, and restrict enterprises' short term activities, it will also not directly interfere with enterprises, completely implementing their self=operating rights. Question: What are the difficulties involved in converting the state-owned enterprises in accordance with the modern enterprise system? Zheng: Besides having to resolve the social restrictions on enterprises, there are many complex problems involved with running the enterprise which must be resolved. The first of these is, how to form the state-owned assets property rights representatives (members of the board of directors)? The problem here lies in the operational system which produces cadres: can the current personnel system guarantee the selection of talent who are not only responsible to the state but also good at operations in leadership positions in enterprises? The second is, how do we delineate quantity and quality of property rights? Meanwhile we must reject nonmanagement factors concerned with enterprises' achievements. There is a question here concerned with perfecting the information and evaluation system and making it fair. The third is, how to establish relationships of responsibility, rights and profits between members of the board of directors and losses or profits of state property rights: by what means do state property rights management departments restrict them? These three questions are unavoidable for us in the joint stock system trial, and must be resolved after thorough study. From this, we can see that reform of the state-owned enterprises is actually involved with reform in every aspect of the political and economic systems, and relies on perfecting the market system. Question: What points should we work on in order to speed up converting to the new enterprise system? Zheng: The reform practice of making the state ownership system match up with the market economy both overseas and in some parts of China has provided us with experience for probing into the problem of accomplishing state-owned property rights in the market economy. 1) Continue to encourage development of the nonstate-owned economy (including the nonpublicly owned economy), thereby putting the state-owned enterprises increasingly into the environment of nonstate-owned economic market competition. The leading role of the public economy cannot be judged simply on the bases of its proportion and quantity; even more important are territory, quality, its status and role in the joint stock economy. 2) We should first of all do a good job of perfecting state-owned asset increments. One, have state projects raise capital by floating shares, which means that the state pledges a part of its assets and other economic component parts to form joint stock enterprises under the management of joint stock system regulations; two, manage newly invested production lines, workshops, and branch plants of enterprises through the new operating system implement a contractual system and hiring system for staff and cadres, protecting socialization. Three, encourage joint mutual stock among enterprises to build up new enterprises or workshops, under joint stock system management. 3) On the basis of delineating property rights for large and medium scale state-owned enterprises, through the gradual distribution of property rights, gradually change over to multi-patterned enterprise structures with the state owning property rights, the state holding shares, and the state participating in stocks. In the present situation where the state has a bigger portion of the capital for running enterprises, we can go the way of dispersing it into the different main parts of property rights profits; for example, exchanging some of a creditor's rights for stock equity, breaking down the state capital enterprise into joint stock enterprises in which shares are held by the central government, localities, commercial banks, industrial departments or enterprises, with the different profit groups assigned members of the board of directors by the amount of shares they have, and the enterprises managed by joint stock system regulations. 4) As for small scale state-owned enterprises, it would be inappropriate to adopt the enterprise system as their property organization system. They can adopt such forms as "state ownership, run by local people" or sell the state-owned property rights, transferring the operating system. Lease the legal person ownership to local people (natural persons or operational bodies of a joint stock cooperative system) and let them run the enterprises. Some small scale state-owned enterprises which are unsuitable for state joint stock system management can go the way of auction, selling and transferring property rights with a charge as one sort of direct and effective means. We should realize that auctioning state-owned enterprises is not a reduction, and still less a loss, but rather a transformation of state-owned assets from material objects to a form of value; indeed, it is a kind of structural adjustment, a means of perfecting the distribution of assets. 5) For basic industries and public utilities which must be jointly managed and operated by the state, such as posts and telecommunications, railways, water conservancy, etc., and for large scale resource industries, the key lies in improving their operating model. The state controls management staff by clearly defined regulations concerning responsibilities, rights and profits, appointing and dismissing managers according to their operational performance, while management of internal personnel and property must suit the market, to form a competitive initiative system.
