Colonel-General Boris Pyankov, the commander of joint peacekeeping forces, communicated to reporters that the situation may grow worse after 15 March. According to information from the general, antigovernment formations armed with Stingers, mortars and heavy artillery are beginning to concentrate on the Afghan coast. The frontier regions of Shayertuz, Kumsangir and especially Pyandzh, where according to some data the main forces of the Tajik opposition are concentrated, are evoking serious concern. The situation in Kurgan-Tyube is becoming explosive. A year and a half ago it was here that the civil war in the republic began, claiming the lives of tens of thousands of inhabitants. Local armed confrontations between uncontrollable groupings that had formerly comprised the Popular Front are ongoing there. General Pyankov feels that "any provocation from either side could lead to slaughter." The situation in Tajikistan also depends directly on development of events on the Afghan coast. The possibility is not excluded that Afghan General Rashid Dustum, who is an ally of Prime Minister Khekmatiar in the war against Kabul, may add to the troubles of Russian servicemen. Most likely Dustum will begin pushing the detachments of the opposition across the border to the Tajik side. As for whether this prediction is correct, time will tell. But it mustn't be forgotten that the radical faction of the Tajik opposition is supported by the Afghan prime minister. On the other hand, Western observers in Tajikistan are not prone to exaggerating the scale of the danger from without. They feel that the positions of the powers that be may be seriously undermined by internal political instability. In the meantime, Russian forces in Tajikistan continue suffering losses. A 30-year old private serving under contract was shot point blank with an automatic round from a passing Zhiguli at a checkpoint of the Kurgan-Tyube regiment. The term of the mandate of peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan expires on 15 April. Tajik authorities intend to ask the heads of the Central Asian States and Russian to lengthen the term of their stay another half-year. Boris Pyankov has no faith in contacts with the Tajik armed opposition. The consent given in principle by the opposition to negotiations with the authorities in Dushanbe appears to be nothing more than a political gesture, which would hardly remain viable in the evolving situation. The Tajik opposition is heterogeneous. And most likely, Russian First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Adamishin was able to attract only its moderate faction. The positions of the sides are so far apart that it is hard to count on any compromise between them.
