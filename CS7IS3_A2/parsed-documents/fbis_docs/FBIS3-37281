Baburin's suggestion a majority of State Duma members included on the agenda the question of forming a parliamentary commission to investigate the causes and circumstances of the events of September-October last year. This was despite the perfectly reasonable argument that an official investigation is being conducted. "How do you explain your persistence in forming the commission," I asked Baburin. "We must call a spade a spade," he said. "There have been many mutually exclusive political statements on this subject, so deputies have agreed to investigate what's what themselves. People are saying that Yeltsin was defending the constitution in September-October last year, while most Russians hold the opposite opinion, as they confirmed in the 12 December elections." It seems that Baburin is deliberately exaggerating the election results while completely ignoring another result of 12 December -- the referendum on the draft constitution, which was proposed by the presidential side and supported by Russians. Let us turn to another State Duma deputy -- Pavel Bunich. What does he think about the inclusion of the item about forming a parliamentary commission on the agenda of the lower house's plenary session? "Dangerous tendencies are increasing in the State Duma. For example, one can sense a predisposition toward the controversial program of the Russian Academy of Sciences Economics Department and Reform Foundation, which essentially returns us to a command-distributive system. This could `galvanize' the government and incline it toward implementing this doubtful program. "As regards the formation of a parliamentary commission to investigate the causes and circumstances of the events of September-October 1993, it is an attempt to provoke a conflict with the president and General Prosecutor's Office. Baburin and his supporters are using this commission to try to achieve a global aim -- to prove that the president's actions were anticonstitutional and consequently that it is time to oust him."
