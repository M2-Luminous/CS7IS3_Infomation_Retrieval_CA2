At a meeting of the party's policy-making Central Executive Committee, the officials expressed strong opposition to a government proposal to rename the consumption tax to "welfare-purpose" tax and raise the rate from the present 3 percent to 7 percent, the sources said. Among the opponents was Shun Oide, a party vice chairman, the sources said. The Hosokawa cabinet, launched last August, includes six ministers from the SDP, the largest of the seven ruling parties.
