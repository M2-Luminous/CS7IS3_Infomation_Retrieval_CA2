Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar spoke in the Slovak parliament today [26 January] immediately after the deputies had invited him to explain why Economic and Foreign Affairs Ministers Jan Ducky and Jozef Moravcik did not accompany President Kovac to Poland and why no agreements were signed between Poland and Slovakia. [Begin Meciar recording] Let me first thank deputy Miklosko for starting a debate on these issues. They are really serious and deserve the attention of the Slovak parliament. I learned about preparations for a visit by the Slovak president to the Polish Republic on 19 January 1994, from his personal letter. Before that, I had neither information about the trip nor had I put forward any requests with regard to it. Presidential visits are, unfortunately, independent to such an extent that they are not coordinated with the government. The visit to Poland is not the only one with problems. Other trips were the same--for example, the latest visit to Prague. Allow me read out the president's letter: Esteemed Mr. Prime Minister: As you have already been informed, through the mediation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and also on the basis of our talks with the highest-ranking Polish representatives, on 25-27 January 1994 I will be on an official visit to Poland, at the invitation of President Walesa. Your official meeting with Prime Minister Pawlak is also being prepared. Both these events and a number of other Slovak-Polish activities that are being planned are very important with regard to the importance of relations between Slovakia and Poland as partners. On this occasion, I would like to ask for your cooperation in organizing my visit. I would welcome in particular Minister of Economy Ducky, who accompanied me at the talks with President Walesa in Prague, being a member of my official delegation in Poland. In addition to the official program, the Polish side will prepare separate talks for him with his partners--four ministries in the Polish Government. The Polish hosts are preparing a similar program for Environment Minister Zlocha, and I am asking you also to organize his participation. After the experts' talks that preceded this visit, Poland expects that at least two agreements will be signed, from a whole number of agreements in preparation. It is obvious that other agreements will be signed only during your meeting with Prime Minister Pawlak. I have been informed that the government, due to its heavy schedule, was unable to discuss the agreement between the Slovak Government and the Polish Government on environmental cooperation. I would welcome it if the government endorsed this agreement at a brief meeting, specially convened for this purpose, to enable Minister Zlocha to sign it in Warsaw. I have also been informed that the government had some comments on the agreement on cooperation between border regions and that this was the reason it was not endorsed. As regards the expectations of the Polish side, I would like to ask you if the agreement on the protection of investments or the agreement on the prevention of double taxation, which are not far from completion, could be offered as a substitute. I believe in you, Mr. Prime Minister, that, owing to the pressing circumstances that I have mentioned, you will carry out necessary steps for our joint contribution to the successful implementation of the tasks of Slovak foreign policy. I thank you in advance for cooperation and understanding. In the context of that letter, I would like to say that I do not know anything about the results of talks between the Slovak president and Polish President Walesa during the president's visit to Poland or during their visit to Prague. [passage omitted] Acting on the basis of the letter, I took all of the steps to meet the minister's--pardon me, the president's--request. I asked ministers to brief me about their progress in their tasks. An agreement on environmental cooperation was prepared to be signed, but, in mid-December, the Polish side presented us with a unilateral alternative proposal not previously assessed by the Slovak Government, and we have a lot of objections to it. An agreement on cooperation of border regions was not approved by the government because we are not satisfied with it. Among other things, it did not define, for instance, what is the territory of border regions, and thus, in fact, this term might be applied to the entire territory of one or the other side to the agreement. It also included other serious legal and political mistakes. It is true that the drafting of an agreement on prevention of double taxation and other agreements have considerably progressed, but within the three working days that were available to us, it was not possible to correct things and finalize the drafts without consultations with the Polish side. On the basis of these facts, I sent the following letter to the president on 24 January 1994: Esteemed Mr. President: The Government of the Slovak Republic is determined to give you all-around support in order to make all of your foreign trips properly prepared and successful. Together with Ivan Gasparovic, the chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, we have already been pointing out for some time now that you need to coordinate your foreign trips, including the entourage, if you are interested in being accompanied by members of the government. A foreign working trip by a member of the government has to be approved by the Slovak Government. Without such an approval, he cannot leave the country. Next time, plan your matters more in advance. The government should be informed about them in time if agreements between the governments, for the drafting of which the government of the Slovak Republic is responsible, are to be signed. During my visit to Prague, a meeting between the prime ministers of the Slovak Republic and the Polish Republic took place. At the meeting, Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak asked for a meeting between the members of the Slovak and Polish Governments to take place not in January 1994 but later. We agreed on this. The course of action you took contradicts this agreement between the prime ministers of the Slovak Republic and the Polish Republic. Despite the above-mentioned, the Slovak Government approved a visit by Environment Minister Jozef Zlocha to Poland. However, the agreement will still be subject to discussion as in December, new amendments were sent by the Polish side to the already discussed agreement, and we have not yet taken them into account. As far as other agreements you propose for signing during your visit to Poland are concerned, though their drafting has progressed a great deal, they are not yet ready for approval and signing. I am making an urgent appeal for improving cooperation with the Slovak Government. I leave it to you to reconsider whether in this situation you insist that Environment Minister Zlocha is among the members of your entourage, taking into account also a stance by the Polish prime minister. Economy Minister Jan Ducky's trip was not approved by the government, and this is why he will not take part in the trip to Poland. Yours respectfully, [signed] Meciar [passage omitted] During talks in Prague, the Polish prime minister turned to the Slovak Government delegation with a plea, explaining that he has such pressing duties in his country that he does not consider any meeting between the members of the government of the two sides in January to be suitable. We agreed only on a meeting between his adviser and the Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Jozef Prokes on the territory of the Slovak Republic. As the proposal for a meeting was made by the Slovak side with great urgency, the Polish side agreed to hold an informal one-day meeting between government members, probably in the Tatras mountains, to discuss cooperation questions. [passage omitted] The course of action chosen by the President's Office is not a usual one, but we are not entitled to express our view on it or to control it. This is a matter for you, the National Council of the Slovak Republic. It is up to you to assess what has happened. The government has done all it should have and could have done in the given situation to assure the success of the president's foreign trip. [passage omitted] As I have already taken the floor, and, as there are various pieces of information voiced by the media and in public, allow me to brief you about yet another thing, not because it involves me but because that action or its content are aimed at grossly damaging the interests of the Slovak Republic and its policy, as well as the Government of the Slovak Republic. [passage omitted] I assess the letter [allegedly sent by Yugoslav former Prime Minister Milan Panic] to be one of a number of provocations aimed partly against me, which is not important, and against the Slovak Republic. [passage omitted] This is a matter concerning the state. Following an attempt to subvert our state or its economy by forging a large number of stamped [Czechoslovak] bank notes, this is yet another one of a big number of provocations constantly being carried out against Slovakia. As far as insults against me are concerned, I have forgiven the past ones--as you sitting on the right at the back benches well know, and I will also forgive these. I only regret that hate toward me has led toward acts against the interests of our state, toward acts damaging them. [passage omitted] To put our state in danger of having to face international isolation, international sanctions for not complying with the embargo, I am afraid I cannot find a polite expression to describe this. [passage omitted] I want to say that our state has been internationally recognized but provocations against it took place, are taking place, and will continue to take place. As regards all those who are in a state of euphoria that we have already overcome all problems, I would like to draw their attention to the fact that we have not yet overcome anything. Nothing has been solved, nothing has been completed. Either we will unite behind our aims, fighting for them and protecting them together, or these purposeful provocations--and others about which we have at present received some preliminary intelligence information that they might be in the process of being prepared--can bring about the situations that will be substantially more complicated and more difficult. Therefore, consider your every step, your every statement and political stance! Much is still ahead of us, and it will not be the last thing we have to overcome. Thank you for your attention. [applause] [passage omitted] [end recording]
