There is a fairly broad range of opinions being voiced on this issue. At times it is even acquiring a fashionable political nuance. Here, however, is the opinion of Army General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defense minister: [Begin Grachev recording] What a rumpus has now been raised about these exercises! We signed the agreement a year ago, and everyone remained silent. Now certain people have suddenly remembered them and there has been a hullabaloo in the State Duma, and there has been a stir at government level, and even in the [Russian Federation] Security Council. Advice is being extended to the president. Boris Nikolayevich and I have also discussed this issue and what approach to take to it. If we really want mutually to get the enemy image out of our heads and really move step-by-step toward partnership, the exercises are, of course, necessary. Let the young American set his eyes on the young Russian. Let them have contact with one another. Let them tell each other about their lives. What, in the final analysis, is wrong in that? Moreover, they are not war exercises in the pure sense, but peacekeeping command and staff exercises, peacekeeping exercises, and, if we really respect one another and respect those people for whose sake we are engaging in peacekeeping activities, then even at the moral level these exercises should be held.
