Russian Diplomats Deliver Special Messages from President Yeltsin to Damascus and Amman"] [Excerpt] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and the Russian president's special representative Viktor Posuvalyuk brought Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad a personal message from Boris Yeltsin. The Russian diplomats are keeping the text of the message a secret. The outcome of the Palestinians' peace talks with Israel depends on Syria' stance. It was owing to Syria's and Jordan's refusal to continue the talks following the Hebron massacre that the Arab-Israeli negotiating process ran into delay five weeks ago. What is more, it has not proved possible to organize bilateral talks between Syria and the Jewish state, prompting Russia -- as one of the two sponsors of the Near East settlement process -- to pay particular attention to President Hafiz al-Asad. Following his visit to Damascus I. Ivanov returned to Moscow while V. Posuvalyuk went on to Amman to hand the King of Jordan a message from Yeltsin. The high-ranking Foreign Ministry staffers' visit to Damascus and Amman obviously marks a fresh attempt by Russian diplomacy to preserve its role as one of the patrons of the Near East negotiating process after Moscow's recent peace initiative failed to meet with support from the parties to this process. The boost to Russian foreign policy in the region is occurring amid the resumption of the peace process. Talks between the Israelis and the PLO have continued in Cairo. [passage omitted]
