FR941117-0-00107 FR941117-0-00011 (2) Same-day filing group. A same-day filing group comprises all mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is the same day, which is normally the filing date of the first-filed application(s). (3) Thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group. A thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group comprises mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is no later than 30 days after the date of the Public Notice listing the first-filed application(s) (according to the filing dates) as acceptable for filing. (4) Window filing group. A window filing group comprises mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is within an announced filing window. An announced filing window is a period of time between and including two specific dates, which are the first and last dates on which applications (or amendments) for a particular purpose may be accepted for filing. In the case of a one-day filing window, the two dates are the same. The dates are made known to the public in advance. (b) Procedures. Generally, the FCC may grant one application in a filing group of mutually exclusive applications and dismiss other application(s) in the filing group that are excluded by that grant, pursuant to ยง22.128. (1) Selection methods. In selecting the application to grant, the FCC may use competitive biding or comparative hearings, depending on the type of applications involved. (2) Dismissal of applications. The FCC may dismiss any application in a filing group that is defective or otherwise subject to dismissal under ยง22.128, either before or after employing selection procedures. (3) Type of filing group used. Except as otherwise provided in this part, the type of filing group used in processing of two or more mutually exclusive applications depends on the purpose(s) of the applications. (i) If one of the mutually exclusive applications is a timely-filed application for renewal of an authorization, a renewal filing group is used. (ii) If any mutually exclusive application filed on the earliest filing date is an application for modification and none of the mutually exclusive applications is a timely-filed application for renewal, a same-day filing group is used. (iii) If all of the mutually exclusive applications filed on the earliest filing date are applications for initial authorization, a thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group is used. (4) Disposition. If there is only one application in any type of filing group, the FCC may grant that application and dismiss without prejudice any applications excluded by the grant (i.e. not in the filing group). If there is more than one mutually exclusive application in a filing group, the FCC disposes of these applications as follows: (i) Applications in a renewal filing group. All mutually exclusive applications in a renewal filing group are designated for comparative consideration in a hearing. (ii) Applications in a thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group. (A) If all of the mutually exclusive applications in a thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group are applications for initial authorization, the FCC administers competitive bidding procedures in accordance with Subpart Q of Part 1 of this chapter. After such procedures, the application of the successful bidder may be granted and the other applications may be dismissed without prejudice. (B) If any of the mutually exclusive applications in a thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group is an application for modification, the FCC may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached within a reasonable time, the FCC may designate all applications in the filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this event, the result of the hearing disposes all of the applications in the filing group. (iii) Applications in a same-day filing group. If there are two or more mutually exclusive applications in a same-day filing group, the FCC may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached within a reasonable time, the FCC may designate all applications in the filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this event, the result of the hearing disposes all of the applications in the filing group.
