Rafael Mariano, Kilusang Magbubukid sa Pilipinas [Peasants Movement of the Philippines] (KMP) chair, and spokesman of PUMALAG, which has 45 member organizations nationwide, said the group will hold an anti-GATT summit to hear crystallize public opinion on the effects of GATT. Mariano said millions of small peasants and fisherfolk nationwide will mark this coming 15 April, when representatives from various governments around the world convene in Marrakesh, Morocco for the GATT signing, as an "International Day of Protest." The ratification of GATT, Mariano said, would cut across such issues as social equity, food security, agricultural production, trading and pricing, and environmental protection and development. "The Ramos Government's Medium Term Agricultural Program is attuned with the GATT in its thrust to liberalize agricultural imports which will put Filipino farm produce in an unfair competition with relatively cheaper imports," he said.
