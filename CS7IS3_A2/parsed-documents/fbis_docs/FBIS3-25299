Some time ago, as part of a campaign against MK [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] murders, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] staged a protest outside Shaik's house. It also announced that Mr. Shaik was the Natal director of the ANC's sinister Department of Intelligence and Security (DIS). Because of his position the IFP alleged that he must at least bear knowledge of MK's involvement in the serial murder of IFP leaders. The ANC's Southern Natal regional executive committee (REC) then issued a statement admitting that Shaik was an ordinary member of the ANC but denying he was a member of DIS or involved in MK. Shaik then shot to prominence during February 1993 when he was included in an ANC team tasked to investigate the Golela arms-smuggling incident, implicating several senior members of MK and the ANC. The ANC investigation team included MK Chief of Staff Siphiwe Nyanda and NEC [National Executive Committee] member Mathew Phosa. If the earlier Southern Natal REC statement is to be believed Shaik's rise through the ranks of the ANC was astounding. However the rise of the Secret Shaik does not end there. Moe Shaik has been appointed to the TEC's [Transitional Executive Committee] intelligence subcouncil but not as an ANC representative. The ANC representative is Alfred Nzo, one of Shaik's colleagues in DIS. Mr. Shaik is actually the SACP [South African Communist] representative on the subcouncil. ILANGA recently obtained a top secret National Intelligence Service (NIS) report which touted members for the proposed cabinet of a government of national unity. Imagine our surprise when one Riaz Moe Shaik was named as Minister of Intelligence Services. ILANGA soon received a further shock when it studied another top secret report, this time an ANC document entitled "ANC Proposals for a Government of National Unity Cabinet." Shaik was again punted for Minister of Intelligence Services. One doubts whether this is simply a coincidence. Instead it may be the result of what is known in the SACP as collective decisionmaking. What is new is that the South African Government has become part of the collective. One thing is clear though: a lot of people are clearly rewarding Moe Shaik for something.
