Big Investors Start Pouring in To Governor Lisitsyn"] [Text] The Days of Yaroslavl Oblast festival was under way in Moscow between 24 and 27 May. The oblast administration was pleased with the festivities' results, after having taken stock of them: Governor Anatoliy Lisitsyn announced at a news conference that two main goals could be reached -- to attract investments to the projects developed jointly with Gaydar's Institute of Economic Problems of the Transition Period, and to establish feedback between the capital and the major industrial and cultural center of Russia. More than 40 projects received support from Russian and foreign investors. Mr. Lisitsyn pointed out, among the more successful ones, a project worth $450 million to reconstruct an oil refinery (and agreement was signed on a credit of $230 million from an export-import bank) and a program for the construction of cottages developed jointly with the French firm "Phoenix." French Ambassador Pierre Morel confirmed the readiness of his government to provide a $40 million credit. The successful fulfillment of the investment projects, according to Mr. Lisitsyn became possible thanks to the regional economy development program drawn up by the Gaydar Institute -- its specialists have been working in Yaroslavl Oblast since 1993. During this time, according to Yegor Gaydar, it has become possible to identify the painful points in the structure of industrial production and to convert the enterprises to turning out products to match the current world trend. The institute is currently working on a scheme to create financial-industrial groups, and on a form of the local administration's participation in the process of bankruptcy of enterprises. Speaking about relations between the center and the region, Mr. Lisitsyn pointed out that "now that the province has acquired genuine independence, it is important to overcome the lingering dependence on the center in the medium management echelon." The constructive process was moving along successfully at a time when, under Premier Ivan Silayev, regional policy was shaped by Valeriy Makharadze: It was in his time that the Union of Governors of Russia was formed. But after Sergey Shakhray took over the charge of regional policy, normal relations with Moscow virtually stopped. With the coming into the government of Nikolay Yegorov, former governor of Krasnodar Kray, "there may come a new stage of normalization of relations between the center and the regions," the governor of Yaroslavl Oblast stated.
