Mr Alastair Goodlad, Foreign Office Minister, said an agreement signed in 1988 contained a formula for a set percentage of the money spent on British military equipment to be reimbursed in aid. In a Commons written question, Mr Alan Williams, Labour MP for Swansea West, asked whether the 1988 protocol "contained figures relating amounts or percentages of civil aid to amounts of arms purchases." Mr Goodlad replied: "Yes." But he added that a letter was later sent by Mr George Younger, then Defence Secretary, to say aid could not be linked to defence sales. "As a result, the issue was not taken up in the memorandum of understanding on defence procurement signed in September that year," Mr Goodlad explained. However, the answer will bring renewed questions over ministerial assurances that no links existed between the aid package and arms -- something that could be challenged in law. Mr Major and Mr Hurd, Foreign Secretary, overruled official advice to clear the 234 million pound aid, which has been described by MPs as a waste of money. Around the same time, a 1.3 billion pound defence contract was negotiated with Malaysia.
