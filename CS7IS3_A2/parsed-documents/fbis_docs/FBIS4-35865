Senior political sources in Jerusalem said yesterday that the United States has relayed the message to Riyadh, calling on it to change its position. Israel presented its complaints regarding Saudi Arabia to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and made an official appeal to the State Department in which Israel detailed the negative steps Saudi Arabia has taken. Israeli representatives have said that the Saudis have become an obstructive element in every regional or multilateral forum, placing obstacles in the way of decisions on easing the Arab boycott and normalizing relations between Arab countries and Israel. Another claim Israel has made is that Saudi Arabia refuses to aid the establishment of the Palestinian autonomy. Israeli sources have said that according to information obtained in Jerusalem, Saudi Arabia pressured Oman and Qatar to slow down their normalization with Israel. The two emirates which neighbor on Saudi Arabia had agreed to host Israeli delegations in multilateral talks and started economic talks with Israeli elements. The foreign ministers of both countries met with Foreign Minister Peres. The charges against Saudi Arabia emerged against the background of its conduct at the multilateral talks on arms control, held in Qatar last month. Unlike in the previous rounds of talks, the Saudis dispatched a rather high-level delegation to Qatar, but the delegation foiled every attempt to make progress in ratifying a declaration of principles and establishing confidence-building measures. "The Saudis have become the pawns of the Syrians, representing them in the multilateral talks," political sources said last night in Jerusalem. "They have been torpedoing every proposal and preventing progress, claiming that regional cooperation is unattainable without the participation of Syria and Lebanon. That means that Saudi Arabia has been granting Syria a right to veto every step of the talks." Israel and Saudi Arabia had attempted to establish a direct channel of contacts between them through their ambassadors in Washington. Last year, Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the United States, held a series of secret meetings with the Saudi ambassador, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan. The meetings were held in the private residences of U.S. officials and Jews who are the prince's acquaintances. Rabinovich reported the content of the meetings to the highest political echelons in Jerusalem. The meetings between the two stopped several months ago, but Israeli sources have claimed that there is no link between the termination of the talks and the current Israeli charges against Saudi Arabia. Foreign Ministry working papers regarding the future of the political process say that Saudi Arabia, as a major representative of the Gulf states, should be given a leading role in the process.
