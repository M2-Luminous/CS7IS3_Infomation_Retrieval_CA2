Nevertheless, the RMK Defense Army headquarters report, the Azeri forces shelled the Karabakh defense positions at the villages of Talish, Seisulan, Hasanghaya in the Mardakertskiy District and Shurabad and Namirli in the Agdamskiy District. No casualties are reported. At the same time "YERKIR" reports, the situation at the South-Eastern fronts aggravated again in the night of May 25. Several Azeri units carried fierce shelling of the Armenian defense positions at the villages of Karakhanbeyli and Gorgan in the Fizulinskiy District, followed by an offensive attempting to recapture a number of important heights. Fierce battles have been carried out in this direction. The RMK armed forces stopped the offensive and drove the enemy back to the initial positions. Thirteen Azeri soldiers have reportedly been killed. Commenting on violations of the cease fire, a representative of the RMK Defense Army, Serzh Arushanyan, said the Azeri command is unable to completely control the armed forces. In particular, they have no power over the units controlled by the opposition. According to Arushanyan, this is a consequence of the political tension in Baku. This may again result in further increase of tension at the RMK fronts, if Geydar Aliyev does not convince the corresponding spheres in absence of prospects in continuing the war. Using the temporary cease fire, the Karabakh side started the procedures of exchanging prisoners of war and corpses. According to the head of a corresponding department Aleksandr Agasaryan, representatives of the Azeri authorities are not quite willing to carry the exchange, and prefer selling the prisoners to their relatives. A number of high-ranking Azeri authorities make great money through this trade. Nevertheless, the Karabakh Commission on Prisoners of War and Hostages freed 5 Armenians from the Azeri prison, having exchanged them with 12 hostages, among them 5 fighters.
