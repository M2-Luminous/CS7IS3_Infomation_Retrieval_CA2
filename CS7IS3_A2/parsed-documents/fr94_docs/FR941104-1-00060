FR941104-1-00060 FR941104-1-00009 2. Illegal trade in whale meat. There was extensive discussion at the May, 1994 meeting of the IWC regarding illegal international trade in whale meat, including involvement by CITES Parties. All whales subject to the IWC moratorium on commercial harvest are listed in CITES Appendix I. A resolution on this topic was introduced by the United States and other Parties, and was adopted by IWC at its 1994 meeting. The issue is discussed in the IWC Infractions Report. The Service submitted the information in the IWC Infractions Report on international trade in whale meat to the CITES Secretariat. The Service in consultation with NMFS, will develop a background paper on this agenda item for submission to the Parties before COP9. Continuing Actions In mid July, the Service received proposals made by other CITES Parties to amend the appendices. Resolutions and a list of other agenda items that were submitted by other Parties are expected to be received at intervals in September and October. The Service's tentative negotiating position on the species proposals was announced in the Federal Register on September 6, 1994, (59 FR 46023) and a comment period initiated. The Service also held two public meetings on September 14 and 16, 1994, as announced in September 1 and 7, 1994 Federal Register (59 FR 45307 and 59 FR 46023). These meetings provided an opportunity for the public to comment on the species proposals submitted by other countries and on any resolution or agenda item. In the October 4, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 50609), the Service presented information and tentative negotiating positions on resolutions and agenda items, especially those for which official documents have been received. The Service will consider all information presented at the public meetings and in writing during the comment period, as well as all other available information, in developing a negotiating position on each species proposal, resolution, and agenda item. These positions will be announced in the Federal Register (s) in late October or early November just prior to COP9. Also in this pre-COP notice the Service plans to request comments on any reservations that should be taken on any species amendments, i.e., species changes to the CITES Appendices, should any of the proposed amendments be adopted by the Parties. Immediately after COP9, the Service will announce the species amendments to the appendices adopted by the Parties; under CITES, these changes will become effective on February 16, 1995. Reservations Article XV of CITES enables any party to exempt itself from implementing CITES for any particular species if it enters a reservation with respect to that species in accordance with the terms and limitations of the treaty. In the case of a country that is a Party at the time an amendment is adopted, a reservation may be entered only during the period of 90 days following the meeting at which the Parties voted to place the species in Appendix I or II. Just before COP9, the Service will solicit comments with regard to entering reservations. If the United States enters any reservation, such action would be announced in the same Federal Register notice that incorporates the listing decisions of the Parties into the Code of Federal Regulations (50 CFR part 23).
