JUVENTUD REBELDE presents today's debate on prostitution and hustling. The packed bus stop is right across from the house, but that is not where she will go for her night out. Somewhere else her "friends" await--leaving other homes, crossing other thresholds, leaving behind other families--to pair up or proceed separately to a foreseeable destination, beginning the game that takes them away from commitments, the daily routine, clean, everyday love. She adopts a theatrical pose and signals to a taxi for tourists. She is lucky: A hand opens the back door and someone makes room. The first glance seems to put her in her place as if she were one more object among the cheap goods, as if one could guess the vignettes that every element of her attire could tell. The blouse, for example, would tell of the double she drank in a hotel bar; her shoes the screech of tires skidding to a halt; the other items words not understood and loveless nights that have gradually filled the clothes rack in her room. Parallel Histories A number of myths are collapsing. Evidence of prostitution does not mean that the anecdotes, the motives, the interests of this notoriously unstable group that frequents a number of the capital's streets and tourist zones fit together into one whole. After weeks of research and many interviews with persons involved or connected with it, we discovered that the topic is far broader and more complex than appearances might suggest. Not all the prostitution afflicting us fits the most common definition of the term precisely, nor can it be categorized under the picturesque label of "hustling" jineterismo, a word in widespread use in Cuba that apparently comes from Mexican popular speech and describes the activities of those who make a profit in an improper or exploitive way. Nor is it organically linked to the form of tourism most commonly seen here, the type that arrives on "package" tours with a schedule organized ahead of time. Although it can also be seen in this connection, it tends to proliferate in highly singular, specific sectors, with a preference for temporary residents in Cuba. Estela, one of those interviewed, explained why: (She is 18 but looks older under her makeup. She is dark-skinned and has a slinky, provocative walk. In the dazzling noonday sun, she wears a brightly colored, very low-cut dress.) "You don't go out with just anyone who comes along. For example, a man who stops on 5th Avenue is nearly always someone who has been in Cuba for some time, who comes and goes freely, who sometimes even has business here. The ones who come on excursions are generally penniless, and since they have a set program, they do not have time and are not interested in looking for a woman to spend time with." Neither Estela nor the others become prostitutes to meet pressing economic needs. The study done by the JUVENTUD REBELDE research team reveals that these persons sell their bodies to buy whatever strikes their eye, luxuries, things like trips, clothes, cosmetics, shoes. They sometimes do so with the complicity of workers at the tourist complexes they frequent. It would be erroneous to view the phenomenon in political terms. Only two women openly expressed a desire to leave the country. The rest of those interviewed merely want to have a good time and buy things they cannot find on the market. They want to satisfy a consumer need awakened by the movies, distorted education, a pattern of happiness that makes material things a cult. Prostitution here borders on the ethical. It is the demoralization of a minority on the threshold of or within the confines of crime and that tries to monopolize relations with foreign visitors. One also observes a certain somewhat caricaturish reproduction of the structure of classic prostitution. However, most of the persons interviewed are not connected with pimps, or with the somewhat ghostly "houses." Estela is the exception among the women who spoke to the newspaper: "I began about a year ago. In the eleventh grade, I fell in love and dropped out of school. Then I got bored with the relationship and started going to bed with anyone that appealed to me. I met Julian, who told me about the business with foreigners and who initially made my `dates' for me. However, they caught him selling clothes from the `shopping center' and threw him in jail. Now I am `helping' him!" JUVENTUD REBELDE interviewed several dozen persons picked at random from among those "in the business." Their ages range from 18 to 25. We interviewed 33 of them at length. They have all completed at least ll years of schooling and many have an "intermediate" technical education. One girl has a degree in accounting and finance. While they have highly diverse backgrounds and experience, the group shares a lack of vision of the future. Very few give much thought to the risks involved or are troubled by the prospect of what they do. [passage omitted] No Set Price The rate changes and varies. JUVENTUD REBELDE learned that one young woman said she set a price for her "work," while another, a procuress, demands at least $30 from her "girls" or the equivalent in kind (clothing, jewelry, shoes, and so on, whose prices at stores for tourists she knows well!). However, in general, there is no set price, nor is one thought out in advance. The middleman--a specimen also existing in this milieu--usually hikes up the price of the "goods" when dealing with a foreigner. All the women interviewed said the same thing, although they also said they are not taken advantage of. [passage omitted] The belief that this type of prostitution is very cheap is rather deceptive. Having sexual relations in exchange for a cute child, for example, would amount to economic suicide in Spain or France or exoticism in extremely poor taste. The high cost of living even inflates the price of love for money. However, in Cuba, with an economy that gives priority to the basic needs of the population, shortages on the market and crime that imposes exorbitant prices on the black market substantially raise the real worth of the "presents" on which our specific type of prostitution is based. Someone acquiring a pair of shoes and a blouse might be earning in a matter of hours the equivalent in money of several months of professional wages! In addition, one is struck by the fact that JUVENTUD REBELDE's informants come from families whose economic level is far above the national average published by the State Statistics Committee. The results also suggest that the practice of prostitution in the capital does not coincide with other very isolated and primitive forms of selling sex included in other studies. The women we interviewed do not come from homes characterized by a criminal or antisocial atmosphere. They do not even come from homes with crammed or precarious living conditions. The lack of any systematic elements is the very reason why this group is so unstable. The frequency of relations varies quite a bit, to the point where it becomes difficult to find anyone engaging in them on a daily basis. Our research showed that those engaging in the "hunt" for foreigners do so three or four times a week, basically from Friday to Sunday. The rest do so two or three times a month. Over 60 percent of them work or go to school and not a single one is forced to engage in prostitution in order to eat every day or have a roof over her head every night. Nevertheless, one observes a trend of going from the purely "vocational" practice of prostitution to making it a way of life. [passage omitted] What about their families? Their social environment? With what concealed complicity does this environment spread? The family was present in nearly all interviews, explicit in some and by omission in others. For most, the home is not removed from or totally oblivious to the going out, type of company, and gifts that many of these young women do not hide. Only three of the women interviewed said they engaged in prostitution unknown to the family and only two were seriously worried about being discovered. All exhibited marked evidence of having grown up with deficiencies in their upbringing resulting in being dazzled by material things and a search for easy economic benefits. Law of the Body The hardening and alienation typical of these young people as they increasingly engage in such relations is alarming. They all separate sexual activity from any sentiment even remotely connected with love. Bitterness and even cruelty mark arguments over the issue and some, who also confess their experiences with no reserve whatsoever, speak of prostitution as "a profession like any other." [passage omitted] What is sad is that no longer can she tell who is a friend and who simply wants to use her. She is not happy and stopped being happy long ago. Anyone who takes up this type of life becomes hollow inside and loses the ability to love, believing that love has to be repressed because it is an ugly, inhuman world. The enchantment of life turns into distrust. [Box, p 7] Sowing Shame Confronted with certain views, many would say we have no other choice but to resign ourselves once and for all to the "girls" who go around holding up aging tourists, as our colleague Soledad Cruz learned while writing this piece. One even hears with some frequency the tolerant apology, the conformist indulgence toward those who throng to our hotels and thoroughfares, trading sex for dollars. There are even those who take the ostrich attitude, suggesting that prostitution be assigned a street in Havana that is less popular than Fifth Avenue, a practice followed in most of the world's cities. It is a hypocritical theory, a kind of duplicity that would lump us together painfully with those who practice it. Fortunately for us, we continue to use the exact same definition of "prostitution" given by the dictionary. It is what it is: debasement, vile use made of a thing, rather than a sign of modernity and free sexual expression by which some would try to justify it. These are the very people who forget that we were once the victims of it, that Cuba was the great prostitute of the Caribbean and, whether they want to admit it or not, following the Revolution, that there was not a single district where it was tolerated or a single woman who had to sell herself in order to eat. That is still the case. Our prostitution is notoriously one of a kind. This is probably the only place on earth where it is practiced for the sole purpose of enjoying luxuries. The romantic world of La Dame aux Camelias or those poor creatures who in so much good and bad literature alike debased love just to survive is totally foreign to those practicing the so-called "oldest profession in the world" in this country. This is borne out by the research done by JUVENTUD REBELDE over a period of months, by interviews with dozens of persons who frequent the milieu and who admit selling themselves to anyone willing to pay and without feeling anything remotely connected with love. Although the motives of those engaging in prostitution are not all the same--there is evidence of family abandonment, the practices of teenagers seeking the recognition of peer groups--there is a general moral and human deterioration among these persons who, in addition to viewing life with deep cynicism, feel no inherent need for virtue, dignity, or decorum. They are afflicted with an absence of values and even though the malady is grave--even incurable in many practitioners--it is not something that we have to resign ourselves to tolerating permanently. Nor does the fact that it now exists in proportions difficult to measure, threatening in certain sectors to monopolize relations with foreigners, mean that we must tolerate it, much less give our blessings to it. We even believe it is possible to cure it, to stop its spread in time. Moving toward austerity, goodness, honesty, and decency, viewed as discretion and nobility of customs, is not enough if the family and our surroundings, our centers of work and study, do not harshly penalize such forms of conduct. Without turning into policemen of sexual mores, without turning to castrating morality, it is time to say what we think, time to call such attitudes by their real name and--in an attempt to to duck the issue--stop hiding behind the country's situation or the equally hypocritical phrase that "everyone is free to do with his/her body what he/she wishes," as if both things pardoned the vanity, selfishness, ambition, and criminal result of such an attitude. It is a fact that the economic depression catalyzed the phenomenon, but the "bad seed" already existed. Its origins lie in the home which worships trash and needs great ostentation to conceal the internal vacuum. How else is one to interpret the fact that all the persons interviewed by JUVENTUD REBELDE have decent homes, their families have a living income, some even work and earn a good wage and yet, it is not enough! In the face of all this, we still have to defend staunchly one's enjoyment of the human body, the freedom to love, a freedom that neither needs nor demands payment, one that thrives without betrayal of the soul. In a country that freed itself from it, why take on that shameful spectacle of Fifth Avenue and other streets of Havana crowded with this new breed of prostitutes? It is not irrelevant to recall the tradition of the tribe of Amazon women that once baffled a famous novelist: Living without identity was the sanction imposed on the women who traded their favors for crystal beads and fake feathers. They could not paint themselves with the solar signs or colored stripes that were the secular guarantee of dignity and beauty. Without a face to show, without any personal traits with which to worship the gods, they were no one. They had only their shame.
