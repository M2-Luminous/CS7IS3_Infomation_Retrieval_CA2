FR940228-2-00130 FR940228-2-00082 (2) Assessing training and service needs of eligible residents; (3) Working with service providers to coordinate the provision of services on a HA-wide or less than HA-wide basis, and to tailor the services to the needs and characteristics of eligible residents; (4) Mobilizing public and private resources to ensure that the supportive services identified can be funded over the five-year period, at least, following the initial receipt of funding under this NOFA; (5) Monitoring and evaluating the delivery, impact, and effectiveness of any supportive service funded with capital or operating assistance under this program; (6) Coordinating the development and implementation of the FIC program with other self-sufficiency programs and other education and employment programs; or (7) Performing other duties and functions that are appropriate for providing eligible residents with better access to educational and employment opportunities. Supportive Services means new or significantly expanded services essential to providing families in public and Indian housing with better access to educational and employment opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency and independence. (HAs applying for funds to provide supportive services must demonstrate that the services will be provided at a higher level than currently provided). Supportive services may include: (1) Child care, of a type that provides sufficient hours of operation and serves appropriate ages as needed to facilitate parental access to education and job opportunities; (2) Employment training and counseling ( e.g., job training, preparation and counseling, job development and placement, and follow-up assistance after job placement); (3) Computer skills training; (4) Education ( e.g., remedial education, literacy training, completion of secondary or post-secondary education, and assistance in the attainment of certificates of high school equivalency; (5) Transportation, as necessary to enable any participating family member to receive available services or to commute to his or her place of employment; (6) Personal welfare ( e.g., substance/alcohol abuse treatment and counseling, self-development counseling, etc.); (7) Supportive Health Care Services ( e.g., outreach and referral services); and (8) Any other services and resources, including case management, that are determined to be appropriate in assisting eligible residents. Vacant Unit means a dwelling unit that is not under an effective lease to an eligible family. An effective lease is a lease under which an eligible family has a right to possession of the unit and is being charged rent, even if the amount of any utility allowance equals or exceeds the amount of a total tenant payment that is based on income and, as a result, the amount paid by the family to the HA is zero. E. Eligibility (1) Eligible Applicants. Funding for this program is limited to public and Indian housing authorities. The factors for award reflect that more than half of the points possible are for the provision of supportive services, whether provided by the HA or through partnerships with other social service agencies. Facilities assisted shall be on or near the premises of public or Indian housing. Two or more HAs may apply jointly if they demonstrate that it is feasible to run the program together; however, the maximum grant per application under this NOFA is $1,000,000. Although the program is intended to benefit public and Indian housing residents, an applicant that is otherwise eligible and is combining FIC activities with FSS activities may use FIC funds to serve both HA residents and section 8 families who are participating in the FSS Program. For all other families using FIC services, costs incurred are to be borne by other resources. To be eligible under this NOFA, a HA cannot have serious unaddressed, outstanding Inspector General audit findings or fair housing and equal opportunity monitoring review findings or Field Office management review findings. In addition, the HA must be in compliance with civil rights laws and equal opportunity requirements. A HA will be considered to be in compliance if: (a) As a result of formal administrative proceedings, there are no outstanding findings of noncompliance with civil rights laws unless the HA is operating in compliance with HUD-approved compliance agreement designed to correct the area(s) of noncompliance; (b) There is no adjudication of a civil rights violation in a civil action brought against it by a private individual, unless the HA demonstrates that it is operating in compliance with a court order, or implementing a HUD-approved resident selection and assignment plan or compliance agreement, designed to correct the area(s) of noncompliance; (c) There is no deferral of Federal funding based upon civil rights violations; (d) HUD has not deferred application processing by HUD under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Attorney General's Guidelines (28 CFR 50.3) and HUD's Title VI regulations (24 CFR 1.8) and procedures (HUD Handbook 8040.1) [PHAs only] or under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD regulations (24 CFR 8.57) [PHAs and IHAs]; (e) There is no pending civil rights suit brought against the HA by the Department of Justice; and (f) There is no unresolved charge of discrimination against the HA issued by the Secretary under section 810(g) of the Fair Housing Act, as implemented by 24 CFR 103.400.
