Was this an emotional slip of the tongue prematurely articulated by one of Hizballah's representatives in Lebanon's parliament, or was it part of a new tactic set forth by the party to get out of the cycle of deadlines, namely, the coming agreements with the Zionist enemy? Hizballah must now either respond to that situation, or it must break the hold, which that situation has over it. If it tries to break the hold, it could use force. But if it goes along with those agreements, Hizballah will have to use political methods. The al-Ghubayri demonstration was Hizballah's dress rehearsal for breaking out of this cycle. Was this calculated "slip of the tongue" an indication of a new distribution in the balance of power in Hizballah? Did it come out to indicate a new beginning [in the party]? And if there is a new distribution of power in the pro-Iranian party, who is the preeminent power now? Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah contends that he controls 70 percent of Hizballah's power, policy, and decisions. Does this mean that Hizballah's decisions are actually Fadlallah's to make? We will not join the chorus of those who are questioning the significance of the denial that always accompanies the Sayyid's utterances when reference is made to his relationship to the party. That denial is now considered by some to be confirmation of the Sayyid's relationship to the party as well as an indication of the fact that the reference to the 70 percent [which he claims to control] did not come out of nowhere. We will not question [the significance of the denial] because behind the Sayyid's control of the party is something that reaches beyond the boundaries of the geographic decision between the party's Consultative Council and the Sayyid's home. Both are located in Bi'r al-'Abd, a few meters apart. Sayyid Fadlallah is setting himself up to become something more than the party's spiritual guide in Lebanon. He is setting himself up to become the marja'iyah shi'iyah 'ammah [the supreme Shiite source of emulation: marja'-al-taqlid]. His reach, of course, would extend beyond the boundaries of Lebanon where Shiites make up more or less one-third of the population. In Iran, however, Shiites make up more than two-thirds of the population, and that same percentage may also exist in Iraq and in some Gulf countries. The Sayyid printed his treatise to set the stage for establishing a link between him, the treatise, and the muqallidin [emulators of a mujtahid]--if they wanted to have such a link. That link would also be established with disciples or persons who want to meet their obligations by paying khums and zakah [tax and alms tax, respectively, paid by Shiites to the source of emulation, that is, marja'-al-taqlid]. These payments provide enormous amounts of money, which the budget of each institution of a supreme Shiite source of emulation has to have to ensure the success of its role. The fact of the matter is that there is a thin line linking Fadlallah's statement about controlling 70 percent of the party with his efforts to set himself up for the institution of the supreme Shiite source of emulation. After all, Hizballah is Iran's most prominent foreign tool, and as such, its importance stems from its effectiveness in one of Iran's most dangerous areas of activity. That is an area where Shiites have a popular presence; it is an area that has borders with Palestine (the control of the Zionist enemy); and it is an area where the struggle in the Palestinian question has gone into a new phase. The course of that struggle for many years in the future will be determined by the West and through direct contact with the West, primarily the United States of America. Iran established Hizballah so that it can play an effective role in Lebanon. But when Iran established Hizballah, it had to have a leader for the party whose religious and political nature was the same as that of Iran. At the time Iran found that leader in Lebanon's Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, an official of al-Da'wah [Islamic Call] Party. It made a deal with him according to which Fadlallah joined Hizballah in return for the public dissolution of al-Da'wah [the Islamic Call] Party. Although the dissolution of the Lebanese chapter of al-Da'wah [Islamic Call] Party created problems and difficulties for him with the original party in Iraq, which was founded by Sayyid Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, Sayyid Fadlallah managed to deal promptly with those problems. The dissolution of that chapter made it possible for the Sayyid to play a distinguished role in Lebanon throughout the period of the confrontation between Iran and the West. Hizballah, which needed a spiritual guide in Lebanon, was the vehicle by means of which Fadlallah played that role. Furthermore, Sayyid Fadlallah did not offer his positions to the party free of charge. He rather tried to implant himself within the party by using the cadres he was grooming. Those cadres, who made up the student organization of al-Da'wah [Islamic Call] Party, were known as the Association of Muslim Students. During the period of Imam Khomeyni's presence Sayyid Fadlallah played the part, which Iran wanted him to play. At the same time he was preparing himself for the post-Imam Khomeyni period. After all, he turned out to be the most fortunate party in the confrontation, which occurred between supporters of Imam Khomeyni and Shaykh Hoseyn 'Ali Montazeri, Khomeyni's successor. That confrontation ended in the ouster of Shaykh Montazeri from the position of succession. Sayyid Fadlallah was fortunate in this confrontation and its outcome because a principal obstacle, which could have obstructed his private plan to set himself up as the supreme Shiite source of emulation had been removed. Shaykh Montazeri was the last mujtahid in Iran [a religious leader who makes and issues independent interpretations of theological questions] who was also a source of emulation. He was the last such religious figure to uphold the notion of a jurisconsult's guardianship. With him out of the picture and then with the departure of the imam, proponents of an Islamic republic and of the guardianship of a jurisconsult found no one to perform the part of a spiritual guide but Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i, who had not yet completed his treatise. This meant that Sayyid Fadlallah was no longer under the obligation of following Khamene'i. Since Fadlallah had completed his treatise, he was more learned and more knowledgeable than Khamene'i, and he was not required, therefore, to follow his guidance. (AL-SHIRA' had published in a previous issue that Fadlallah had printed his treatise and had placed it for safekeeping in a warehouse.) Accordingly, it was Fadlallah and not Khamene'i who deserved to become the supreme source of emulation in the context of accepting a Khomeyni style guardianship of a jurisconsult. Sayyid Fadlallah was even more fortunate in the departure of Sayyid Abolqasem Kho'i, the world's supreme Shiite source of emulation, who had objected to the universal application of a Khomeyni-style guardianship of a jurisconsult. Sayyid Kho'i had also objected to the establishment of an Islamic government, particularly since the person who was favored by most Shiite Muslims to become the supreme source of emulation was Seyyed Reza Golpayegani, a man who was over 90 years old and who was also opposed to the Khomeyni-style guardianship of a jurisconsult. Iranians had consented to his proposal that Seyyed Khamene'i be nominated to succeed Seyyed Golpayegani as the supreme source of emulation until circumstances are straightened out. The fact that Sayyid Fadlallah and Iran parted company on this matter seems normal here because Sayyid Fadlallah himself wanted to become the supreme source of emulation. That Khamene'i should become the supreme source of emulation before completing his own ijtihad [independent interpretation and judgment in theological questions] treatise was something that Fadlallah could not rationalize. What would Fadlallah do if Tehran were to decline supporting him or if it were to confine the source of emulation to its borders or show that Fadlallah had departed from its policy? Would he, the man who controls 70 percent of Hizballah, resort to inciting the party against Tehran? Was this the context for that slip of the tongue by Hizballah's representative in parliament? Will other forces within the party remain silent about Fadlallah's pro-al-Da'wah Party stance? Will they remain silent if Fadlallah decides to present and circulate his treatise and accept the position of becoming the source of emulation? Whereas Lebanon has exposed Fadlallah to confrontations stemming from Hizballah's defiance of the Lebanese state's decisions and the state's determination to prevent Lebanon from becoming an arena for conflict and for the settlement of scores, Hizballah from now on will be exposed to more incompatible positions, which have already started to manifest themselves. At first, the cost of these incompatible positions in the al-Ghubayri demonstration seemed high. (See the previous issue of AL-SHIRA'.) The sorting that became evident in that demonstration was between the different slogans of Sayyid Fadlallah's supporters who had lined up together in a manner that distinguished them from others, and between the Party's fundamentalists who are led by Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli. More of this sorting will take place in the coming days, and the position of Sayyid Fadlallah himself will be scrutinized locally, regionally, and internationally. Why Fadlallah? Because Fadlallah, according to his own assessment, is the one who controls the party, he is the one who will use this control to get the party to block an agreement between Lebanon and Israel, that is, if he takes no action about any agreement, which Damascus might reach with Israel in the context of the prescribed settlement. Will he decide to confront Israel's coming agreements with Lebanon and with Syria? Will he object to them and fight against them, or will he be satisfied with the lesson of the al-Ghubayri demonstration? Will he give his political concerns a religious dimension, which he will be careful to extend beyond the boundaries of Lebanon? An answer to that question will not be long in coming. From now on let us watch Lebanon much more closely than we did any time in the past.
