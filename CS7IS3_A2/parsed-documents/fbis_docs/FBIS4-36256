I made no promises to 'Arafat or to the PLO. I never promised to establish new Christian institutes. Since I am certain Knesset Member [MK] Matza feels strongly about Jerusalem, I suggest that we do not tell the whole world that here in the Knesset there are people who are willing to give up on Jerusalem. This is totally unfounded. Jerusalem is dear to us all, and I am speaking to MK Ze'evi as well. [passage omitted] I would like to describe the Israeli Government stand -- past, present, and future -- regarding Jerusalem. According to the view, stand, and action of the Israeli Government, Jerusalem will not be divided, and we will accept no division of Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be no Berlin; no wall will be erected in it and it will not be split in two. It will remain united, according to the map the Knesset ratified, under Israeli sovereignty. It will not be part of the autonomy, and the autonomy institutions will not be run from Jerusalem. This is our position, and this is the purpose of our struggle. Before I start debating with the Likud, I would like to tell MK 'Imanu'el Zismann: The problem with Jerusalem is that there are two religious worlds that hold Jerusalem sacred -- the Christian and the Muslim worlds. I believe we reached a truly historical agreement with the Vatican in Jerusalem as it is -- united, Israel's capital, under Israeli sovereignty. This kind of event takes place once in every 1994 years, and it happened this January. Also, we want to tell the Muslims that we have no intention of hurting their religious feelings or institutions; not theirs, not the Christians', and there is no need to mention the Jews because this is our capital. It is self evident. We made a supreme effort to salvage Jerusalem from the autonomy, and everything we see is the result of an effort, not just a story about how someone tried to fix this, that, or the other. We did not want to fix anything. To the best of my knowledge -- and I know about this more than anyone -- we came up with the idea of Jericho only to avoid the demand that the autonomy institutions -- some of which already were in Jerusalem -- be placed in Jerusalem. I am very sorry that people here mix various political matters together. Not everything is a document. When negotiations are held notes, documents, and things are exchanged. I would want to tell MK Dan Meridor: There is no question of credibility; there is a debate over interpretations. Dan, with all due respect, your interpretation is totally unfounded. The document does not speak of institutions that will be established. As a lawyer and one who speaks of honesty, you should be honest. No commitment was made to the PLO or to 'Arafat. This is an attempt by the opposition to portray the government stand in reverse. I do not mind you doing that, only it does not bolster Jerusalem. Now I would like to comment on what 'Arafat said, why Minister Shahal denied it, and why it is credible. In Johannesburg, 'Arafat said that he did not want to sign the document in Cairo before he receives a letter about Jerusalem. But the letter had existed before Cairo. It was no accident that the letter was written to Holst. It was written to Holst to tell 'Arafat: You have nothing to do with this. No commitment was made to 'Arafat regarding institutions that will be established in the future. The letter only describes the state of affairs as it was when the letter was written. There are thousands of letters in the Foreign Ministry; do you want me to disclose them all? This is not a document; this is a letter. MK Meridor should know the difference between the two. The letter was not written to 'Arafat to avoid establishing a link between Jerusalem and 'Arafat. The words PLO or PLO institutions do not exist in the letter. It mentions East Jerusalem because it does not pertain to the autonomy. You are making an attempt to reverse the facts. Now, why Shahal was right. 'Arafat said three things that are not true: One, that he did sign in Cairo because he was given a letter in Cairo; no letter was given to him in Cairo. Two, 'Arafat was given no letter regarding Jerusalem. Third, the things that were written to Holst were stated from this podium as well. [as heard] [passage omitted] Hence, I hereby determine that nothing was kept secret from the Knesset; that nothing was promised to the PLO; that no letter was sent to 'Arafat. There is a matter of interpretation and I would like to say clear things about this as well. Several reporters were offended, and thus they joined those charging us with a lack of credibility. There is no credibility problem. We spoke the truth. When things were presented to the Knesset, there was no such letter. Had there been one, we would probably have appended it to the documents despite the fact that it is a letter and not a document. This letter was not marked secret, confidential, or top secret. It was published as it is. [passage omitted] I would like to add one more thing. If the Palestinians attempt to establish a political authority beyond that which existed when the letter was written, they have no [word indistinct] to do so. If they are illegal, they will be canceled. [Passage omitted] With the permission of the speaker, I would like to opine that the world today is divided along different lines than in the past. Almost all matters of importance have no boundaries. Almost all of those that have boundaries, their boundaries lost much of their importance. What are the important things in our world today? Science, technology, economy, ecology, and freedom, and they have no boundaries. In fact, even strategy today is measured in ballistic boundaries more than by geographic borders. Furthermore, as a result of the borders' losing their value and the rising value of relations, the three major factors of international policy making lost much of their importance. The three were political parties, armies, and superpowers. Almost all of the events in the past decade took place without the three. Russian Communism collapsed not due to military operations, the establishment of a party, or superpowers's intervention. A communist and television toppled communism. In South Africa, a tremendous event took place: The black rights were made equal to those of the whites, ending skin color as a racist distinction. This was done without superpowers, armies, or parties. Peronism was toppled by a Peronist. Here in this region as well, most of the work was done without armies, superpowers, or parties. I say that there are many conclusions to be drawn from this. The question is where Israel is headed? Backwards or forward? If Israel wants to move toward the world that has completely changed, if we want to buy the correct admission ticket, we need bulldozers to move the conservatives among us to see the world as it is. I would like to tell the religious MK's sitting in front of me: I believe the most difficult struggle for us in the next century would be to preserve Israel's tradition and uniqueness. It will be no less difficult a struggle than defending our borders. To me, the Jewish nation is based on homeland and tradition. We must prepare for both, and we will do that with the utmost possible stamina. I know that in this ever changing world, Israel could not have found its right place had it not changed itself. What we did in Jericho and Gaza is a historical and realistic enterprise of the first rank which gives Israel the necessary fuel to march in this changing world and defend our historic values, land, the Jewish nation and the residents of Israel. [passage omitted] Mr. Speaker, honorable Knesset: I will now answer the query by MK Ya'aqov Shefi [on the relations with the new Italian Government]. It is inconceivable for Israel to make compromises with fascism, racism, dictatorship, and discrimination of any kind. The problem is how one goes about examining this in complex cases. How do you distinguish between the policy of a government and policies attributed to some of its members? At the same time, I would like to say something that is not very pleasant. Unfortunately, on more than one occasion in the past we were forced to make compromises with these principles. We maintained diplomatic relations with a country that professed racism in the most formal way, namely apartheid. We had relations with countries that were ran by ugly dictatorships with cruel murderers at their helm, such as the USSR. I have not yet recovered from this. We have very complicated problems being the Jewish nation and the State of Israel. I will not lie. We are trying hard to observe those principles, but -- and not only us -- countries maintain diplomatic relations not because they are in love with some other countries, but because they believe diplomatic relations would distance the threat and pressure that country to change its policy. [passage omitted] As for the question from MK David Magen [regarding the possible establishment of a Palestinian state]. Let me tell you: The problem was born in the Camp David accords. That was the first time the State of Israel gave the Palestinians the title of the Palestinian people [last three words in English]. When you create a Palestinian people, it is like asking that this nation demand a Palestinian state. I would also like to say that anyone believing you can hold 120,000 people in prison without them crystallizing into a nation is wrong. Had we remained in Gaza, the number would have grown even further. Therefore, I have been and am opposed to a Palestinian state, I am for a Jordanian-Palestinian confederation. I have never made my position secret, nor did I ever change it. I am only telling you that the first time autonomy was introduced -- full autonomy for the Palestinian people and their right requirements [last 10 words in English] -- it was done in the Camp David accords. Do not run away from this. Be honest once and for all. [passage omitted] I would like to thank MK Dalya Itzik for her question regarding the missiles in North Korea. The United States has warned us that one cannot trust North Korea in either word or in deed. It said that, considering the U.S. strength and comparing it with ours, we should allow it to head the campaign against the building of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles and selling them to other countries. You are asking me, in terms of political logic, who is better suited to head this campaign, the United States or Israel. I will tell you, after seriously considering the answer, it is better that the United States do this. And it does. The United States has now garnered the support of the United Nations. This struggle concerns us all, and we trust them. We have no reason to doubt the United States. We know the U.S. intentions, we see its acts, and I welcome everything it does. [passage omitted]
