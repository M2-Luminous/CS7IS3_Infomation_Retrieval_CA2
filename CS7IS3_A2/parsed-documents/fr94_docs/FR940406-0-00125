(a)(2) Maintenance performed on vehicles, engines, subsystems, or components used to determine exhaust, evaporative or refueling emission deterioration factors, as appropriate, is classified as either emission-related or non-emission-related and each of these can be classified as either scheduled or unscheduled. Further, some emission-related maintenance is also classified as critical emission-related maintenance. (b) Introductory text through (b)(3)(vi)(D) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;25. (b)(3)(vi)(E) through (b)(3)(vi)(J) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.098&hyph;25. (b)(3)(vii) through (b)(6)(i)(E) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;25. (b)(6)(i)(F) Evaporative and refueling emission control system components (excluding canister air filter). (b)(6)(i)(G) through (H) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;25. 9. A new §86.001&hyph;26 is added to subpart A to read as follows: §86.001&hyph;26 Mileage and service accumulation; emission measurements. Section 86.001&hyph;26 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from §86.094&hyph;26, §86.095&hyph;26, §86.096&hyph;26 or §86.098&hyph;26.

(b)(2)(iv) Service or mileage accumulation which may be part of the test procedures used by the manufacturer to establish evaporative and/or refueling emission deterioration factors. (b)(3) through (b)(4)(i)(B) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.094&hyph;26. (b)(4)(i)(C) Exhaust, evaporative and/or refueling emission tests for emission-data vehicle(s) selected for testing under §86.096&hyph;24(b)(1) (ii), (iii) or (iv)(A) or §86.098&hyph;24 (b)(1)(vii) shall be conducted at the mileage (2,000 mile minimum) at which the engine-system combination is stabilized for emission testing or at 6,436 kilometer (4,000 mile) test point under low-altitude conditions. (b)(4)(i)(D) through (b)(4)(ii)(B) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.095&hyph;26. (b)(4)(ii)(C) Exhaust, evaporative and/or refueling emission tests for emission data vehicle(s) selected for testing under §86.094&hyph;24(b)(1) (ii), (iii), and (iv) shall be conducted at the mileage (2,000 mile minimum) at which the engine-system combination is stabilized for emission testing or at the 6,436 kilometer (4,000 mile) test point under low-altitude conditions.
