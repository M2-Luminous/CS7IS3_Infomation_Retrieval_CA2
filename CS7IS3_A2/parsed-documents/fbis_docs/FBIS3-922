Minister of Home Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa said 7,600 static centres manned by 7,900 civil servants, and an undisclosed number of mobile booths for remoter regions, would register voters. He hoped the process would be completed in two weeks, although authorities had an extra 45 days to cope with unexpected problems. The date for the elections, the fourth since independence in 1980, would be announced by President Robert Mugabe, he said. "We are gambling he will go for between March and May next year," he said. One-hundred-and-twenty seats will be contested in the election in the 150-seat parliament. Mr Mugabe has the right to appoint another 30. Elections for the post of president are every six years, and are due in 1996. The announcement will heighten growing political activity among the ruling ZANU [Zimbabwe African National Union] (PF [Patriotic Front]) party and about 10 opposition parties already preparing their campaigns. It also suggests it is unlikely Mr Mugabe will call an early election to beat deepening disenchantment with the government, as has been forecast by some political commentators. All the previous elections have been won overwhelmingly by ZANU (PF) and pundits predict another outright victory for the party. Mr Dabengwa made a point of promising that the election campaign and the voting would be free, fair and peaceful. "I assure you there will be no violence during the elections," he said. "Police will be deployed at full strength throughout the country." The election will be the first since 1964 to be held under ordinary legislation. Until late 1990 they were held under state of emergency legislation which gave authorities wide-ranging powers to curb opposition activities. Special provision is being made to register an estimated 300,000 Zimbabweans living in South Africa, and extra staff will be deployed at the Zimbabwe Trade M$ssion in Johannesburg. Zimbabweans resident in other countries would not be able to register because of the government's "limited resources". In apparent recognition of criticism of hasty and often chaotic voter registration for the previous election in 1990, authorities this time have started six months earlier. Registrar-General Mr Tobaiwa Mudede said the electorate consisted of about 5.5 million people.
