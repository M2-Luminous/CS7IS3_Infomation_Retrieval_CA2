The radio said the air raids occurred at 5:00 A.M. (0400 GMT) and a second at 10:15 A.M.. Earlier last week, NATO jet fighters shot down four Serb warplanes on a similar sortie. However, the radio did not give details of casualties. U.N. officials in Zagreb said they had "no information" on any Serb air attack, and there was no immediate response from NATO. Maglaj has been besieged by the Serbs for eight months and its residents are said to be living in appalling conditions.
