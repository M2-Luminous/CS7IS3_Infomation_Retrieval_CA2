This has led to a reduction in Thai investment in Laos because investors could not tolerate Lao Government's witchhunt. The Lao Government's suspicions about Thai investment resulted from behavior of unscrupulous Thai businessmen. Suphachai said the Thai Government could not gain correct understanding of the Lao Government in every issue involving Thai investment. The private sector, particularly the chambers of commerce in the northeastern provinces, should play a role in this matter. The chambers of commerce could join to form a "northeast business council" or a committee on Thai-Lao trade to screen prospective investors to find good people whose investment would not exploit Laos as in the past. The council could also set regulations governing Thai businessmen making investment in Laos and protect their interests when Laos changes its regulations. These frequent changes of Lao regulations have always troubled Thai investors. [passage omitted]
