"It doesn't fully make sense," Clinton said at a press conference with reporters from over 40 countries in Atlanta, Georgia. North Korea would have "more possibilities, more security and more prestige" if it honored its commitment to be non-nuclear. Asked about U.S. alternatives in deterring North Korea, Clinton said the "options are clear but they aren't easy." "No one wants this confrontation, but neither does one want to have a state not only with nuclear power but with the capability to proliferate nuclear weapons," the President said. "The options we have are largely in the hands of the North Koreans themselves." The controversy over Pyongyang's secretive nuclear program flared up with its restrictions on free and complete International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections. At the end of the last inspection in March, the agency said it was unable to confirm whether North Korea had diverted nuclear material for non-peaceful purposes. Clinton stated, "I would say to the North Koreans, 'the United States wishes to have a friendly and open relationship. We wish to have a constructive relationship and we want you to have a constructive relationship with South Korea. "'You have pledged yourselves to a non-nuclear Korean peninsula. That's what we want,'" the President emphasized. If Washington sought to isolate Pyongyang, it would only be because North Korea had not honored its promises to be a non-nuclear state and to accept IAEA inspections. "North Korea agreed to be a non-nuclear state, to follow non- proliferation policies," he said. Unless it fulfills these commitments, "North Korea will be much much more severely isolated," Clinton said.
