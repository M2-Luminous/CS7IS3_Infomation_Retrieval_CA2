According to statistics, people's courts at all levels from 1986 to 1993 accepted and held first-instance hearings on 3,505 intellectual property rights cases, including 1,783 patent rights cases, 1,168 copyrights cases, and 554 trademarks cases. Liu Jiyang [0491 3423 2254], secretary general of the China Intellectual Property Rights Association, said: Because they have adhered to the principle of being strict and impartial when protecting intellectual property rights, and because they have drawn on the successful experiences of other countries, China's law- enforcement departments are getting close to international standards on law enforcement. Before July 1993, no special judicial courts that try intellectual property rights cases existed among China's courts; such cases were tried separately by judicial courts that handle economic or civil affairs. Because Beijing Municipality has the highest occurrences of disputes over intellectual rights among China's cities, the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court and the Municipal Intermediate Court finally established, simultaneously, judicial courts to handle intellectual property rights cases in July 1993. Those were the first courts of such nature to be established in the Chinese court system. Since the beginning of this year, higher people's courts and some intermediate people's courts in Shanghai Municipality, Guangdong Province, Fujian Province, and Hainan Province successively established judicial courts to handle intellectual property rights cases. According to Su Chi [1372 6688], president of the Intellectual Property Rights Court of the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court, his court accepted and heard all types of intellectual property rights cases: patent rights, trademarks, copyrights (including copyrights over computer software), technical disputes unrelated to patent rights, and all other cases of disputes arising from unfair competition brought about by failure to observe the principle of honesty and trust and by acts infringing on other people's business credit and trade secret. Following its establishment, the intellectual property rights court accepted and heard 271 cases concerning all types of intellectual property rights, including 21 involving foreign nationals. The amount of money under dispute totaled 156 million yuan renminbi. Su Chi said: Our court, without exception, uses a collegiate bench to try intellectual property rights cases. It even employs experts as jurors when the collegiate bench tries cases that are highly technical, or which involve disputes over patent rights and copyrights over computer software. However, most cases are tried by a collegiate bench of judges. When it comes across technical problems, the judicial court will invite two or more experts to provide explains and assessments on technical issues. He pointed out: Without exception, all cases involving intellectual property rights are tried in public unless stipulated otherwise by law. In addition to announcing in advance the schedule for each court session according to legal procedures, the Beijing Municipal Intellectual Property Rights Court also informs society in advance about its monthly schedules for court sessions and expresses the wish to see people from all sectors of society come and witness the court sessions. According to statistics, over 3,000 people came to the court sessions in over half a year. Rights-infringement cases account for over 80 percent of all intellectual property rights cases tried by the Beijing Municipal Intellectual Property Rights Court. When handling lawsuits over rights-infringement disputes, the court abides by this principle: Once evidence proves that a case constitutes rights infringement, the court will act in accordance with the proposition of relevant rights holders and in accordance to the law, and will order the person who infringes rights to compensate relevant rights holder the total amount of losses suffered by him due to rights infringement. The amount of compensation paid will be in accordance with the criteria that it is sufficient enough to compensate the losses incurred on the rights holders and to prevent future rights- infringing acts. Su Chi said: During the trial of a case involving disputes over trademark infringement, filed by the Beijing-Paris Damofang Food Company Limited against Beijing Sun City Bazaar, the Beijing Municipal Intellectual Property Rights Court had, for the first time in its court decisions, made clear that the rights-infringing party had to pay the rational amount of fees incurred on the rights- holding party during the rights-holding party's investigation of rights-infringing acts and when the party initiated legal proceedings. He explained: The court made that decision because it fully carried out the principle of "leveling up," which is provided for by Chinese civil laws. This is so the person whose rights has been infringed upon can be compensated fully for his losses, and that he will have less to worry about financially when he is in a legal tussle with rights-infringing acts. The decision was also made in reference to relevant stipulations on the intellectual property rights agreement reached at the Uruguay Round. Over the past 14 years, China established a complete legal system to deal with intellectual property rights. The National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee successively promulgated the Trademark Law, the Patent Rights Law, the Copyrights Law, and the Anti-Unfair Competition Law. From 1992 to 1993, the NPC Standing Committee successively adopted the amended Patent Rights Law and Trademark Law to extend patent rights protection to chemical substances, medicines, food, drinks, and condiments; to expand the scope of patent rights to include imports rights and the scope of patent rights over production methods to include products; and to extend trademark protection to service trademarks. China has also participated actively in international cooperation in intellectual property rights, performed its international duty, and joined relevant international organizations. Dr. Arpad Bogsch, director general of the World Intellectual Property Organization, once offered this appraisal: "In terms of intellectual property rights protection, the speed with which China accomplishes everything is unparalleled."
