What are the direct reasons for the escalation? [Nahnah] We expected an escalation of violence because political rivalry is not based on rules that guarantee power rotation or participation in power so as to safeguard security and property and prevent bloodshed. The swelling of the tide of violence remains natural as long as some people are pursuing the policy of breaking bones and destroying the country, its present and future, even at the expense of values, virtues, and achievements. [passage omitted] Liamine Zeroual's arrival is another experience to be added to the other experiences. However, what attracts attention is the fact that the man has the presidential and defense powers and does not need to hesitate as much as those before him did. This is why we saw him move toward dialogue and toward expanding it and securing mechanisms and a date for it -- which is indeed a glimmer of hope. But the armed party -- so it seems -- felt that the rug had been pulled from under its feet, so it decided to increase the tide of violence so as to attract attention to the claim that it is the party concerned with the dialogue of negotiation, not anyone else. Especially as the Islamic Salvation Front realized that the policy of confrontation would lead to the required outcome, so it displayed a degree of reason, which armed parties tend to ignore. These parties tend to threaten or criticize anyone who insists on adopting reason, which most regrettably came after the devastation of the country. Had the conflicting parties accepted dialogue from the first day, we would not have reached the verge of this painful devastation. [passage omitted] [Al-Hajj] Hocine Ait-Ahmed, leader of the Socialist Forces Front, has said that a civil war will break out in Algeria and that the more extremist will win it. What is your opinion? [Nahnah] Numerous hands are involved in the Algerian situation, because of the explosive issues which have found a good climate for explosion in the critical situation. Even before this crisis erupted, our movement warned about the serious situations which could develop in Algeria along the lines of what is happening in Lebanon, Afghanistan, or Somalia. Especially since some people are working to kindle the political, religious, and frontal sedition in Algeria. Anyone who says that the most extremist will win is actually openly calling for more extremism, which damages the image of Islam and political Islamist movements. Muslims rushed into many battles, but the sly reaped the fruits. The policy of decay pursued by the Algerian and foreign octopuses serves only the idea of settling scores at the expense of the nation and its constants. [passage omitted] [Al-Hajj] Preacher Cheikh Mohamed Bouslimani was assassinated recently. Do you believe that this will lead to inter-Islamic confrontations inside Algeria? [Nahnah] Martyr Cheikh Mohamed Bouslimani, may God have mercy on him, was a man of knowledge, call [al-da'wah], and reform for 30 years. He was killed by the hands of treachery, sin, and recklessness. They have ignorantly assumed the task of shedding innocent blood directly or indirectly in order to exploit the critical situation. We cannot say that this action is the result of the understanding of Islam. Not at all. The Islamic banner is exploited to achieve cheap and base objectives, namely to spread terror, plant despair, expand the circle of frustration among citizens, and push the Algerians toward infighting and sever their necks and ruin their homes with their own hands. [passage omitted] [Al-Hajj] Do you believe that President Zeroual is the man of the hour in Algeria? And how can he succeed in salvaging the country? [Nahnah] The country's success and extrication from the crisis cannot be achieved by putting diluted ointments on malignant tumors, but by abandoning deception, falsification, and the policy of playing for time, and turning to the people, respecting their will, and opening channels to express their ideas and proposals without any compulsion, domination, subservience, arrogance, or marginalization. I welcome Liamine Zeroual's endeavor to ease the crisis by expanding the dialogue, alleviating the citizens' suffering, hastening to hold elections, and not taking any notice of the voices of the crows of socialism, secularism, and ignorance, who are the cause of the calamity and the bankruptcy. They promote French influence and Marxism. And I urge President Zeroual to shorten the transitional phase as much as possible. And if necessary, he should at least be a fair tyrant in this period.
