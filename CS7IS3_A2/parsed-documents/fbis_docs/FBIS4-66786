One reason perhaps is Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's proposed visit to Washington. At a time when a topic like the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] is to be discussed in Washington, raising the Special-301 issue would be creating unnecessary bitterness from diplomatic standpoint. There already are differences over several issues between India and the United States. More serious that trade issues are the political and defense issues. President Clinton and Prime Minister Narasimha Rao will discuss all these issues. Therefore, we do not understand why the U.S. Department of Commerce showed the Special-301 sword. Granted, the two month extension is over now; however, the official report on GATT talks has been confirmed during this time. India has signed it. GATT contains answers to all the questions that had led to the Special-301 proposal in the U.S. Congress. The U.S. Government should be satisfied with India's agreement on the Dunkel proposals of the GATT and should work on ending Special-301. Instead, it has warned that India will be brought back under Special-301. It appears that India is facing Special-301 because of China. They want to make China a GATT member. It has applied for it. China has made the delay in decision on its entry an issue for opposing it. Until China joins GATT, the United States will continue to threaten it over copyright and patent infringement. China and India are in the same category on the U.S. list. That is why India is repeatedly warned about Special-301. It is possible that the U.S. Congress does not want to end Special-301 because of China. At present, China, Argentina, and India are the Special-301 countries. India and Argentina have signed the GATT documents and both have to change their patent and copyright laws under this agreement. Enough time has been allocated under GATT for it. The United States is putting psychological pressure for making new laws by giving warnings every two months. Nothing will happen if India ignores these. India should not worry about Special-301 now. How can we accept U.S. highhandedness after signing a multi-party international trade agreement? All patent and copyright issues are considered in the new trade agreement. At a time when multiparty trade arrangements are being made, how can the United States become an enforcer in a bilateral arrangement? Perhaps, the U.S. administration has understood it and has not taken any action and India has not wasted time in expressing its reaction.
