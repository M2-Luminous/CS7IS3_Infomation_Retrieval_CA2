FR940902-1-00034 FR940902-1-00003 (A) Is offered by an institution of higher learning, and (B) Does not lead to a standard college degree; and (ii) The institution of higher learning requires as part of the reservist's program of education one or more unit subjects for which credit is granted toward a standard college degree. (2) When measuring a reservist's enrollment during a semester or quarter when he or she is pursuing one or more courses which the educational institution measures on a credit-hour basis, VA will convert the credit to equivalent clock hours as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and combine them with the clock hours of the other courses measured by the school on that basis, as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. (3) VA shall_ (i) Determine the equivalent clock hour factor by dividing the number of clock hours which constitute full time for the enrollment as stated in paragraph (e) or (f) of this section by the number of credit hours which constitute a full time undergraduate enrollment at the educational institution as stated in paragraph (a) of this section, and (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5) and (6) of this section, multiply the number of credit hours in which the reservist is enrolled by the equivalent clock hour factor as determined by paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. This will result in the number of equivalent clock hours in which the reservist is enrolled. (4) VA will add the number of clock hours in which the reservist is enrolled to the number of equivalent clock hours in which he or she is enrolled. The result will be compared to paragraph (e) or (f) to determine the reservist's training time. (5) When the number of class sessions per credit hours is so low that §21.4272(f)(2)(ii) or (3) would control the way in which VA would measure those credit hours, VA will make the calculations required by paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section by multiplying the number of class sessions determined by the equivalent clock hour factor. (6) When the reservist is attending a nonstandard term, VA will make the calculations required by paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section by determining the equivalent credit hours in which the reservist is enrolled as provided in §21.4272(g), and multiplying the equivalent credit hours by the equivalent clock hour factor. (7) In calculations required by this paragraph, fractions of an equivalent clock hour will be dropped. * * * * * (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3688(e); Pub. L. 101&hyph;237) (Dec. 18, 1989). 19.

In §21.7720 paragraphs (a), (b)(1) introductory text, (b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(vi) and (b)(1)(ix) are revised; paragraph (b)(1)(x) is added and the authority citations for paragraphs (a) and (b) are revised to read as follows: §21.7720 Course approval. (a) Courses must be approved. (1) A course of education offered by an educational institution must be approved by_ (i) The State approving agency for the State in which the educational institution is located, or (ii) The State approving agency which has appropriate approval authority, or (iii) VA, where appropriate. In determining when it is appropriate for VA to approve a course, VA will apply the provisions of §21.4250(b)(3) and (c)(2)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). (2) A course approved under 38 U.S.C. ch. 36 is approved for purposes of 10 U.S.C. ch. 106 provided it is not a course of instruction beyond the baccalaureate degree level.
