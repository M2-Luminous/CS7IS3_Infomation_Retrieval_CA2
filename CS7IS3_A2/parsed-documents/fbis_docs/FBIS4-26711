According to a water resources management official, the latest survey shows that the reservoir meets the national standards for drinking water and its transparency is increasing. The Dahuofang Reservoir, covering an area of 5,437 sq km and with a water storage capacity of 2.187 billion cu m, is one of the country's biggest and provides drinking water for millions of urban dwellers in Fushun and Shenyang cities, as well as water for industrial use. To protect the water resources in the reservoir, the provincial government formulated a special regulation as early as in 1990 to shut down all industrial enterprises that could cause pollution in the area of the reservoir. Other steps taken to keep the water from pollution were a ban on swimming and sports in and around the reservoir and the removal of several poultry and pig farms.
