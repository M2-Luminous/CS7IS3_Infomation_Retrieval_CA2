In her opening address at the First National Aluminum Sector Seminar on Potential and Opportunity, held in this city, Marielena Posada, the president of CVG [Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana]-Bauxilum (the result of the merger of Bauxiven and Interalumina), outlined the local and international situation of the sector. On the world level, the aluminum industry is facing a difficult situation. It is the result of the continued price decline that began in 1989 and the great increase in the inventory levels resulting from reduced consumption in America and Europe, which was accompanied by substantial increases in production in the Western world during the same period." Posada said that the situation in the Eastern part of the world is no different, since while a decrease can indeed be seen in production, it is not by any means as great as the decline in consumption. This situation has had an even greater impact on the industry because of the inclusion of the metal from the Community of Independent States (the former Soviet Union) on the international markets, to a great extent reflecting the changes that have come about in the war-materiel industry on the international level as a result of the political events of recent years. [passage omitted] Reducing Costs: The Goal The president of Bauxilum commented that in addition to the effects of low prices, this Venezuelan industry has been affected in recent years by low levels of productivity, high production costs, a high level of indebtedness, and a critical cash situation. A review of the situation of the aluminum sector of CVG in 1993, she said, makes a realistic view of the situation possible on the level of the basic sector of the industry. The results of such a review reveal an industry in crisis, in which an encouraging recovery process began in the second half of the year. This was evident from the very major reduction in total production costs, which declined from $1,460 per ton in the month of July to $1,120 per ton at the end of the year, clearly revealing the potential this business enjoys, she noted. "The existence of an integrated complex for the production of aluminum, which was consolidated with the incorporation of Bauxiven as a processor of bauxite on entirely competitive terms, and with excellent results in the Interalumina operation; the undeniable energy advantages that are available in Guayana; and the capacity for response that has been evidenced by the aluminum people, leading to a change in the trend in the development of the business to which we referred previously, constitute a firm foundation for the future consolidation of the Venezuelan aluminum industry. Posada maintained that we will reach the goal of producing at a total cost of less than $1,000 per ton in 1994. Our forecasts show that we will have reduced the cost to less than $900 per ton by 1996. "This will make us one of the most competitive complexes in the world. Our goal, therefore, is to achieve world leadership in the production of aluminum." Second Phase On being asked about the future of ALCASA [Caroni Aluminum, Inc.] in the short run, this official explained that at that aluminum enterprise, "advances are being made in the privatization process. The alternative that is gaining support involves the massive and immediate incorporation of the private capital obtained in the first phase, through the negotiation of the Guacara reducing plant, by means of affiliation with the national bank. "The second phase, involving the reduction plant in Puerto Ordaz, is still pending. Work is being done in the CVG on the problem of saving ALCASA, and privatization is one of the solutions being considered." [passage omitted]
