ACTION: Proposed Rule. SUMMARY: The Commission today is proposing amendments to its rules and forms regarding the filing of ownership reports by officers, directors, and principal security holders, and the exemption of certain transactions by those persons from the short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') and related provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Investment Company Act'') and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The proposed rules are intended to streamline the Section 16 regulatory scheme, particularly with respect to employee benefit plans; broaden exemptions from short-swing profit recovery where consistent with the statutory purposes; and codify several staff interpretive positions. DATES: Comments should be received on or before October 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted in triplicate to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Comment letters should refer to File No. S7&hyph;21&hyph;94.

I. Executive Summary and Background In February 1991, in response to developments in the trading of derivative securities, the growth of complex and diverse employee benefit plans, and substantial filing delinquencies, the Commission adopted extensive changes to the beneficial ownership and short-swing profit recovery rules and forms applicable to insiders 7 pursuant to Section 16. 8 After three years of experience, unanticipated practical difficulties still arise in applying the new Section 16 rules, particularly with respect to thrift and similar employee benefit plans. 9 The rule changes proposed today address these practical problems and further streamline the rules, to the extent consistent with the purposes of Section 16. 7 The term ``insider,'' as used in this release, refers to officers, directors, and holders of more than ten percent of a class of equity securities who are subject to Section 16. 8 Release No. 34&hyph;28869 (February 8, 1991) [56 FR 7242] (``Adopting Release''). The rules generally became effective on May 1, 1991, except for the phase-in period for compliance with the substantive conditions of new Rule 16b-3. The phase-in period has been extended until September 1, 1995 or such different date as may be set in further rulemaking (Release No. 34&hyph;34513 (August 10, 1994)). See Section VI, below. 9 Following the Adopting Release, the Commission issued two other releases relating to the revised rules; one set forth the Commission's interpretive views regarding shareholder approval for amendments to employee benefit plans under Rule 16b&hyph;3, as well as certain technical amendments (Release No. 34&hyph;29131 (April 26, 1991) [56 FR 19925]), while the other adopted a technical amendment to Form 4 (Release No. 34&hyph;28869B (April 10, 1991) [56 FR 14467]). A. Employee Benefit Plan Transactions The focus of the proposed rules is the treatment of employee benefit plan transactions. In particular, the proposals would: • Exempt from short-swing profit recovery all purchase transactions in thrift and other broad-based, tax-qualified plans, other than those involving transfers to and from an employer securities fund; • Exempt from short-swing profit recovery transfers to and from employer securities funds in thrift and other plans that are effected either during a quarterly window period or pursuant to a diversification election under the Internal Revenue Code; • Expand exemptions for plan distributions in connection with retirement or specified transactions authorized by the Internal Revenue Code; • Provide that exempt dispositions within six months of an exempt grant would not destroy the exemption for the grant; • Exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' cash-only instruments issued as compensation by an employer to an employee; • Exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' rights that include non-market price based conditions; • Exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' rights to withhold (or to deliver securities already owned) to satisfy tax or exercise price obligations, and exempt cash settlement of such rights where granted pursuant to exempt employee benefit plans; •Eliminate the transferability restrictions applicable to derivative securities issued under an employee benefit plan. B. Reporting The proposal also would simplify and clarify the reporting requirements by: • Permitting joint and group reporting where more than one person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities; • Providing that Section 16 applies to a trust only if the trust beneficially owns more than ten percent of a class of registered equity securities; • Eliminating officers' and directors' post-termination reporting obligations with respect to exempt transactions and other transactions that are not matchable with a pre-termination transaction; • Requiring a discrete caption for the disclosure about delinquent Section 16(a) reports required by Item 405 of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B. The Release also solicits comment on a variety of approaches to simplify the reporting of exempt transactions, including elimination of the total holdings column in Forms 4 and 5, proposals to replace Form 5 with alternative reporting schemes (including a Form 10&hyph;K summary of insider transactions), and elimination of the requirement to report exempt employee benefit plan transactions. C. Other Issues Finally, the proposal would codify certain staff interpretive positions, and would establish new categories of transactions exempt from short-swing recovery by:
