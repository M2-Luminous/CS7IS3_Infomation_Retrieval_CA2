Everyone knows that so far, there has been a tendency seemingly to tie up the government's limbs, preventing it from doing anything while the Khmer Rouge continues its violation and destruction against innocent people. Analysts of the Cambodian situation say that the government has suffered a serious defeat in its psychological warfare. When it counterattacks the Khmer Rouge in the wake of the latter's onslaught, the government instead has been accused of being a warmonger. It is certain that defeat in the psychological war can lead the government to other failures. It is also certain that only after the government suffers a real defeat will the people realize that they, themselves, are the real losers; however, it then will be too late. This being the case, it is a must for the government to change this situation urgently by making the people clearly understand that the government's victory is also the victory of each of them. It is ironic that the Khmer Rouge and its supporters, who oppose the government, are able to live in government-controlled regions throughout the country. Nevertheless, the Khmer Rouge-held areas are completely safe -- there are neither Khmer Rouge opponents nor demonstrations calling for an end to the nonsensical Khmer Rouge war. In view of this, the government is facing two problems, namely the problem of the Khmer Rouge outside and the problem of the Khmer Rouge inside. It is expected that in "the step toward reinforcing its legitimate authority," the government will begin to crack down on corruption which is most abhorrent to the people in general. Along with this, it should restrengthen its police, army, guards, and state authorities in order to effectively ensure security, order, and safety in society and to circumvent the Khmer Rouge's sabotage activities. This is part of the earnest request of the people. Another issue of life and death is that if it does not want to dissolve itself, the government, with the massive strength of the two major political parties, should review the alliance between the two parties by taking into consideration the nation's interests above all. It is perfectly rational that the government should firm up its legitimate authority at a time when the Khmer Rouge is consolidating its clout against the law. Somehow, what is most important is that the government should be in a quest for the people's support as well.
