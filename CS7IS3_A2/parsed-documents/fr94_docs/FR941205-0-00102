FR941205-0-00102 FR941205-0-00024 72. Section 325 states that no cable system or other multichannel video programming distributor shall without consent retransmit ``the signal of a broadcasting station, or any part thereof, *␣*␣*'' In contrast, Section 614(b)(3)(B), the must-carry provision, states that the cable operator shall carry ``the entirety of the program schedule *␣*␣*.'' Further, Section 325(b)(4) states that if a station elects retransmission consent, ``the provisions of section 614 shall not apply to the carriage of the signal of such station by such cable system.'' While, at first blush, the statutory language appears to permit broadcasters to negotiate with cable operators for retransmission consent for any part of their signal (i.e., any programs), we now believe that a more correct and harmonious reading of Section 614 and 325 together leads to an interpretation that Congress intended cable systems to carry all the programming of must-carry eligible stations regardless of whether the broadcast station opts for must-carry status or not. While it is clear under Section 325 that some negotiated partial carriage is permitted, Section 325 does not mandate the availability of partial carriage in all negotiations. Given this fact, and the congressional emphasis on full carriage for must-carry qualified stations (discussed above), we believe the statutory provisions read in concert suggest that qualified must-carry stations should, as a matter of policy, be carried in their entirety even if they are carried pursuant to retransmission consent. 73. This interpretation is bolstered by Congress' direction to the Commission in Section 325(b)(3)(A) to fashion ``regulations to govern the exercise by television broadcast stations of the right to grant retransmission consent under this subsection and of the right to signal carriage under section 614.'' By including this provision in Section 325, we believe that Congress recognized the interplay between the two sections and gave the Commission authority to fill in regulatory gaps. Thus, at the very least, the Commission has the flexibility to require carriage in the entirety for qualified must carry stations carried pursuant to retransmission consent to ensure that the basic underlying objectives of the 1992 Cable Act relating to local broadcast service would be fulfilled. Otherwise, the statutory goals at the heart of Sections 614 and 325_to place local broadcasters on a more even competitive level and thus help preserve local broadcast service to the public_could easily be undermined. 74. The Senate Report confirms this interpretation by stating that the ``rights granted to stations under section 325 and under section 614 and 615 can be exercised harmoniously, and it anticipates that the FCC will undertake to promulgate regulations which will permit the fullest applications of whichever rights each television station elects to exercise.'' We believe that our rules should provide the wildest possible range of opportunity for both broadcast stations and cable operators, where the must-carry provisions are not applicable. Thus, any station which is eligible for must-carry status must be carried, if at all, in its entirety regardless of whether the station elects must-carry or retransmission consent. Similarly, any station which is not eligible for must-carry status under Section 614, because it is not a local commercial broadcast station, or does not qualify under the definitions of Section 614, may negotiate for partial carriage. Thus, we conclude, based upon a reading of both Sections 614 and 325, that broadcast stations whose signals are entitled to must-carry but are instead carried pursuant to retransmission consent are not permitted to negotiate for carriage of less than their entire signal. We note that this interpretation of the statute is supported by the legislative history which notes that the retransmission consent provision was drafted in such a way as to promote the ``established relationships between broadcasters and cable systems,'' and to ``minimize unnecessary disruption to broadcasters and cable operators.'' 75. The 1992 Cable Act was specific in stating that ``[c]able systems carrying the signals of broadcast stations, whether pursuant to an agreement with the station or pursuant to the provisions of [must-carry], will continue to have the authority to retransmit the programs carried on those signals under the section 111 compulsory license.'' The Committee emphasized that nothing in the 1992 Cable Act was ``intended to abrogate or alter existing program licensing agreements between broadcaster and program suppliers, or to limit the terms of existing or future licensing agreements.''
