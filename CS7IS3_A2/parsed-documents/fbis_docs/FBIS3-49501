FBIS3-49501 "dreeu007__a94006" FBIS-EEU-94-007-A Document Type:Daily Report 11 January 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Official Denies Allegation AU1001192194 Prague CTK in English 1237 GMT 10 Jan 94 AU1001192194 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, Jan 10 (CTK) -- Security and Information Service (BIS) Director and former deputy director of the Federal Security and Information Service (FBIS) Ivan Devaty today dismissed as "not based on the facts" allegations that FBIS had actively worked against U.S. President Bill Clinton during the 1992 presidential election campaign in the United States. The statement by Basta and an unnamed FBIS officer was published by the Czech independent daily MLADA FRONTA DNES at the weekend. According to Basta, the Czechoslovak intelligence services provided incumbent President George Bush's election staff with information about Clinton's stay in Prague in 1970 and interviewed his acquaintances in Prague, looking for information to discredit him. The unnamed FBIS officer had told the paper that information was recorded for Bush's staff not only regarding the fact that Clinton had visited Moscow shortly after the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact troops, but also regarding details about Clinton's hosts in Prague, the daughter and son-in-law of early Czech communist and later reformer and Charter 77 signatory Marie Svermova.
