Good morning to you, sir. [Siemiatkowski] Good morning to you, too. [Woyciechowski] Could you explain to everybody in two or three sentences--well, five at the most--what is currently happening in Poland? [Siemiatkowski, hesitating] I mean, we are definitely dealing here with some form of political crisis associated with the fact that the president refuses to approve the candidate for finance minister and deputy prime minister, whose name had been submitted by the prime minister--that is, Professor Rosati. For that reason, discussions are becoming lengthy, and also there is the fact that Poland continues to go without a finance minister. [Woyciechowski] Why does the president refuse to approve of Rosati? What do you think of this? What is your assessment? [Siemiatkowski] I mean, of course an official [hesitating] explanation was provided by the president. I will just echo what Mr. Rosati has said: These accusations that were levied against him are ridiculous, and I think we are dealing here with a political game being played by the president, the goal of which is to destabilize the current political arrangement and to disavow the existing coalition majority, and perhaps the president hopes, through these measures, to break the coalition and perhaps lead to other types of political configurations. It is a well-known fact that the president always feels very comfortable with situations of political instability. At such times, his activity is always on the increase. But, in periods of hard and peaceful work by cabinets, the president's activity kind of slows down. At any rate, that is no coincidence: If one were to trace the whole period of President Walesa's term, one would see that, more or less three or four months into each cabinet's term, the president decides to launch a counteroffensive. Of course, that is not a good sign for the future of the political situation because every cabinet, including this one and this coalition, is then forced to deal with issues of third- or even fourth-order importance from the standpoint of goals and tasks for which the Cabinet and the coalition were established. This way, we cannot focus our attention on fundamental tasks, such as the current issue of budget implementation and the implementation of economic policies and the big social reforms, which we want to continue. [Woyciechowski] Mr. Sejm Deputy, does the president want to break the coalition? [Siemiatkowski] I think the president's goal in this case is perhaps to find differences in the existing coalition. Every coalition is composed of two parties that have their own identities and their own interests, and a coalition is always based on compromise, and, in this case, the coalition between the SLD and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] is also a compromise. [Woyciechowski] So can one say that President Walesa wants to set the coalition members at odds. Can one put it this way? Could you put it in a short phrase [words indistinct]? [Siemiatkowski] We thought that was the president's goal at the beginning of his measures, except that he came across a reaction that he probably could not have predicted--namely, a unanimous position by the PSL and the SLD, as well as the tough position of the prime minister, who in a very persistent manner confirmed that Mr. Dariusz Rosati, the SLD's candidate for finance minister, is also the prime minister's candidate, and we highly respect Prime Minister Pawlak for his position. Mr. Rosati is also a candidate for the prime minister's deputy for economic affairs, and, despite resistance from the Belweder, the prime minister confirmed several times that Mr. Rosati is his candidate. So, if the president did indeed have the goal of setting us at odds, he failed to achieve it. [Woyciechowski] Is it true that Mr. Rosati returned to Warsaw yesterday? [Siemiatkowski] Yes, it is. He returned for the Easter holiday. [Woyciechowski] Is it true that Mr. Rosati withdrew his candidacy? [Siemiatkowski] After yesterday's conversation with Aleksander Kwasniewski, Mr. Rosati upholds his willingness to be a candidate for the post. He made a decision to be completely at the SLD's disposal, and also at that of the entire coalition and the prime minister himself. We respect Mr. Rosati very much for his behavior because we can appreciate the very difficult situation he is in. Anyone else in his shoes, when faced with such attacks and accusations by the president and his closest aides, would perhaps withdraw. But still, Mr. Rosati decided that, because he is supported by concerted action by the entire Cabinet, the prime minister, the coalition, and Aleksander Kwasniewski, it would be inappropriate if he were to withdraw at this stage of the negotiations. [Woyciechowski] Do you think it is still politically possible at this point for Rosati to be appointed deputy prime minister, after everything that has been said about him? [Siemiatkowski] Ladies and gentlemen, both the SLD and the prime minister decided to make efforts to convene a meeting with the president himself. It is our view that, during such a direct meeting and conversation, when we will present once again all of the arguments in favor of Mr. Rosati's candidacy and in favor of the need to end this situation of temporariness that exists in the Finance Ministry, we think that, during the meeting, President Walesa will perhaps hear us out and change his mind because it is our view that the opposition should not be ambition driven, on both the part of the president and the coalition. What should prevail is thinking along substantive lines, and, in that regard, we think and are convinced that Mr. Rosati fulfills all of the criteria that should be met by the best candidate for finance minister. It is our view that he is the best candidate for finance minister right now. Poland cannot afford to once again see such talent and such a professional go to waste. [Woyciechowski] You mentioned the Walesa-Pawlak-Kwasniewski summit meeting. When will it take place? Will it be before Easter? [Siemiatkowski] I mean, it is the president who has the initiative in that regard. For our part, we have submitted--and that was something agreed upon by the coalition--that the prime minister play the role of an intermediary in these talks. The prime minister has such powers; it would be hard to expect Aleksander Kwasniewski, who is just a faction chief and has not been authorized to [words indistinct].... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Does that mean that the prime minister has addressed the president and asked for such a meeting and is now awaiting a reply? [Siemiatkowski] According to information we received yesterday, the prime minister has indeed asked that a date for the meeting be set. [Woyciechowski] Could the meeting take place today, tomorrow, or over the next few days? [Siemiatkowski] Of course, it is up to the person who makes the invitations to the talks--that is to say, President Walesa. [Woyciechowski] So you, gentlemen, are simply waiting for [words indistinct].... [Siemiatkowski, interrupting] Yes, we are waiting. Right now, the situation is somewhat impractical because Mr. Aleksander Kwasniewski could not [hesitating] wait yesterday, and today, a Sejm delegation with Speaker Oleksy is coming from Moscow. [Woyciechowski] Today he is meeting Yeltsin. [Siemiatkowski] Yesterday, he [Kwasniewski] met the Russian prime minister, and a meeting with Russian President Yeltsin has been announced for tomorrow.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Then we will have Easter, so the meeting will probably take place after that. [Siemiatkowski] He is coming back on Friday [1 April]--we will regard Saturday as a holiday--so, realistically speaking, one can expect such a meeting at the beginning of next week. [Woyciechowski] Mr. Deputy, can the president dissolve parliament? He did mention such a possibility yesterday. [Siemiatkowski] He certainly can dissolve it if three conditions, which are very precisely defined by the Small Constitution, are met. The president has already once taken advantage of such a possibility.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, what are these conditions? Can you tell us about them? Is it the budget.... [Siemiatkowski, interrupting] It is the budget.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, this is no longer possible.... [Siemiatkowski, interrupting] No, it is no longer possible because the Sejm has managed to do this within three months; right now the [word indistinct] is in the hands of the president.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] The second possibility? [Siemiatkowski] The second possibility is when the Sejm cannot form the government. However, the government has already been formed. Finally, the third possibility appears if a nonconstructive no-confidence vote is submitted, for this reason.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] If it is submitted and passed, that is? [Siemiatkowski] Certainly, if it is passed. [Woyciechowski] Now, such a veto cannot really be passed in today's Sejm. It is hard to imagine.... [Siemiatkowski, interrupting] Of course. If we considered something like that at all, it would be a constructive no-confidence vote. This Sejm has drawn conclusions from the experiences of its predecessor.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And it does not want to allow itself to be dissolved? [Siemiatkowski] It is not that it does not want that. Simply, it would not serve Poland at the moment if we entered a new stage of the campaign. Incidentally, we believe that what the president is doing today is the beginning of the presidential campaign, a year and a half before the actual vote. [Woyciechowski] I will ask my question once again: Can the president dissolve today's Sejm? [Siemiatkowski] I believe that this is unrealistic and impossible, with the majority and the strong will of political action in the Sejm. [Woyciechowski] Is then another situation possible, which is for the time being only tentatively mentioned by the commentators of some dailies, that the SLD might leave the coalition? Do you take such a possibility into consideration? [Siemiatkowski] Well, we defined this very precisely in the coalition agreement. For the SLD, the condition that must be met is the positive influence on the economic processes going on in our country. We can exert this positive influence on those processes by participating in the Cabinet and being in control of the economic ministries--that is, having our own finance minister, ownership transformations minister, chairman of the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers [KERM]. In another case, the SLD could not see the possibility of functioning in any other governments because we realize that, in such a situation, our role would be merely a decorative one. [Woyciechowski] However, if you were to boil this all down to just a few simple words, if the SLD could not appoint its own finance minister, we would deal with a situation that the SLD would leave the coalition. [Siemiatkowski] We would find it hard to justify our further participation in the cabinet of any coalition if we lost real influence on the economic processes. We can even say more: We can proudly say that, under the SLD leadership in those economic ministries, economic processes are going on exceedingly positively. It is worth recalling that, in the first quarter of the year, the inflation index is at the 5-percent level. In both January and February, we recorded increases in the GDP on the level of over 4 percent. At the same time, the state's revenues are bigger than expected in the Budget Law. [Woyciechowski] All of this was achieved without a finance minister. Maybe, then, we do not need a finance minister? [Siemiatkowski] I would certainly not draw such far-reaching conclusions. Of course, this was made possible by the fact that the budget was prepared as it was, by the budget-related laws passed by the Sejm. It was also made possible by the economic team, which was headed by Deputy Prime Minister Borowski and people who stayed in the leadership of the Finance Ministry and KERM after Mr. Borowski resigned. Finally, these achievements result from the efforts made by the entire Cabinet of Mr. Waldemar Pawlak and Prime Minister Pawlak himself, as well as all of the ministers responsible for the economy--the industry minister, the foreign economic cooperation minister, and the ownership transformations minister. It is all the result of the work of the entire Cabinet. [Woyciechowski] Mr. Deputy, what will happen if President Walesa does not sign the budget? What will be the constitutional fate of this budget? [Siemiatkowski] It will, of course, return to the Sejm, and I believe that the Sejm is able and efficient enough to override the president's veto by a two-thirds majority vote. I would.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, the coalition does not have such a majority in the Sejm today? [Siemiatkowski] Well, yes it does. This can be very precisely calculated. Even the four people who are no longer members of the SLD club announced when the budget was being read for the second time that, if the president vetoed the bill, they would vote for rejecting this veto. So, even in such a situation.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That means that you would have to be backed by someone from the parties that does not belong to the coalition, such as the Union of Labor or the Democratic Union? The coalition would still need a few votes, would it not? [Siemiatkowski] Well, it would not. Exactly two-thirds....[pauses] I do not have the data now, but it has been calculated that the coalition is able to achieve this threshold of two-thirds of the votes. I believe that, in such an extreme situation, we would be backed by many votes from noncoalition parties, which would help us override the president's veto. However, I would rather be inclined to agree with the commentators who, commenting on yesterday's statements by President Walesa, write in today's press that the president will not decide to veto the Budget Law. He would be in a very difficult situation. He must take into account international opinion.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You believe, then, that, despite all that, the president will sign the budget? [Siemiatkowski] Yes, I do, because this is a development-oriented budget. It continues the positive trends in our economy that became visible toward the end of last year. This budget was favorably received by international economic circles. I believe that quite significant was the decision by the London Club, which annulled a substantial part of the Polish debt. If there had not been such a budget, if it had not contained such prodevelopment and growth-oriented indicators, the club's decision would have been different. The president, who has so far been regarded practically everywhere as a supporter of reforms and a man who sees to it very rigorously that economic reforms in Poland are continued, would have to negate the activities that he has pursued so far. I believe that the economists the president wants to ask for advice should tell the president very clearly all the political and economic costs that Poland, and the president himself, will incur if he decides to oppose the trends outlined in this budget. [Woyciechowski] Mr. Deputy, I am sure you have heard this rumor, which everyone has heard, that Aleksander Kwasniewski might be appointed deputy prime minister. [Siemiatkowski] For today--I will use the expression of President Walesa--our candidate for the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister is Mr. Dariusz Rosati. [Woyciechowski] How about tomorrow? [Siemiatkowski] This will definitely call for a new discussion in the coalition. [Woyciechowski] Is the candidacy of Paga at all possible? [Siemiatkowski] It would be rather awkward if we accepted candidacies proposed to us from outside. [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview. [Siemiatkowski] Thank you.
