FBIS4-37379 "drnes119_n_94005" FBIS-NES-94-119 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 LEBANON AL-'AHD on Reaction to Israel's 2 Jun Raid AL-'AHD on Reaction to Israel's 2 Jun Raid NC1706121394 NC1706121394 BFN [Editorial report] Beirut AL-'AHD in Arabic devotes its entire 3 June 15-page issue to the Israeli air raids against a Hizballah training camp in Ba'labakk on 2 June. On page 2, the paper publishes the names of 26 people killed and 40 wounded in the raids. On page 3, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately 1,000-word statement issued by Hizballah in the wake of the Israeli raids. The statement says that "the Zionist enemy, backed militarily, politically, and morally by global arrogance, is waging a vicious war against our homeland, people, livelihood, and waters." The statement adds that "the enemy has been using the so-called peace negotiations as a way to undermine our society and nation. While America, the archsatan and the Zionists' principal ally, is demanding that in the name of negotiations and peace the Arabs and Muslims give up their mainstays of power and lay down their arms in return for eliminating the sources of tension--as Washington puts it--America at the same time declares its commitment to maintain the Zionist enemy's superiority and defend its security. Washington's objective is to destroy our nation and the Resistance and plunder our resources." On the same page, the paper publishes an approximately 400-word statement by head of the Hizballah Political Bureau al-Hajj Husayn Khalil commenting on the Israeli raids. Khalil says "the continuing Zionist attacks on our land, people, plantations, and waters-- attacks culminating in the treacherous aggression against Ba'labakk early today--are equivocal evidence that the decision to participate in the peace negotiations was wrong. Everyone realizes that Lebanon's participation in the negotiations continues to give Israel pretexts and excuses to pursue its policy of terrorism. Khalil goes on to say that "all officials, regardless of their positions, are called upon to take a responsible, firm stand toward the deep wound inflicted by the Zionist aggression and to withdraw from the negotiations indefintely." On the same page, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately 450-word eulogy delivered by Hizballah Secretary General Nasrallah. After exalting the martyrs, Nasrallah says that "the bestial Zionist aggression today will only increase our reliance on Almighty God and will make us more determined to forge ahead along the road of jihad regardless of sacrifices." On page 4, AL-'AHD publishes the approximately 1,300-word eulogy delivered by Ayatollah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah in honor of the souls of those who fell as a result of the Israeli raids on Ba'labakk. Fadlallah says: "As Muslims, mujahidin, and oppressed people, we decided there is no place for Israel among us, and that global arrogance will no longer have influence on our positions. Israel might win several rounds, and global arrogance might win several positions, but it is justice that will win in the end." Fadlallah continues that "the United States is a wolf that devours man, peace, and life. We know that every Israeli bullet is in fact an American bullet directed at the chests of the oppressed and the entire people." He adds: "We cannot accept the United States as a friend, no matter how events might develop. The United States will never be a friend of the Arabs and Muslims nor a friend of the oppressed." On page 5, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately 1,500-word analysis by Ja'far Fadlallah on the Israeli aggression and the options to confront it. The writer says that the Israeli enemy "is pursuing a scorched earth policy to force the people to emigrate after losing the sources of their livelihoods and to spread an atmosphere of instability and tension that will create a vacuum." The writer adds that the Israeli enemy "aims to put the blame on the resistance and to instigate divisions and make the people abandon the resistance. This is an old strategy that the Zionist entity has been trying to implement by all means." Fadlallah continues that "the Zionist escalation is aimed at the Lebanese authorities, who would have quickly responded to the contents and conditions of the Zionist message if it had freedom of action. The substance of the message is that reliance on Syrian support will not guarantee protection and internal stability. This is obvious from the fact that the long Zionist arm can penetrate any area in Lebanon." On pages 10 to 13, the paper publishes an approximately 5,500-word selection of reactions by various organizations, officials, and deputies to the Israeli raids on Ba'labakk. The Islamic Revolutionary Army Organization for the Liberation of Palestine [Munazzamat al-jaysh al-thawri al-islami li tahrir Filastin] denounces the aggression and says that "it is confirmation of the Zionist capitulationist negotiations with traitors like 'Arafat and those panting for an illusionary peace with the Zionist entity." The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command says that "the new Zionist aggression is a manifestation of the provisions of the Oslo-Cairo Agreement and is aimed at the forces rejecting the U.S.-Zionist designs of hegemony." The General Secretariat of the Union Party "calls on the Lebanese Government to stop negotiations in view of this continuous aggression." On page 14, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately 400-word report on an interview given by Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Shaykh Na'im Qasim to the BBC's "Other Opinions" program. While denying that Hizballah is holding Israeli pilot Ron Arad, Qasim says: "We have two Israeli soldiers; we do not deny this. They were captured during an Israeli commando operation in the south in 1986, and their names are known."
