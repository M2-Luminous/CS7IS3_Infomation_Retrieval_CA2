The intensive hearings on this problem that are being held in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee provide evidence of the fact. Recently, for example, it examined once more the White House's proposals to lift the restrictions on the number of ABM systems capable of destroying missiles with an operational range of up to 2,000 miles. In this connection it should be noted that a law on ABM defense went into force in the United States back in December 1991. It incorporated the old approaches of strategic nuclear deterrence and new ones which reflect the trend toward the regionalization of U.S. military policy. The law obliged the defense secretary to step up the development of theater ABM systems with a view to the subsequent selection of the most promising options for deployment in the mid-nineties, using cost and efficiency as the criteria. The law also talks about the creation of ABM systems to protect the country's territory against limited ICBM strikes, including those resulting from accidental and unauthorized launches, as well as missile attacks from Third World countries. It should be noted in this context that under the 1972 ABM Treaty both the USSR and the United States are allowed to have only one ABM complex each -- around Moscow and at the Grand Forks air base respectively. Nevertheless, the U.S. ABM law envisages the modernization of the complex at that air base as an initial step in the deployment of an all-embracing ABM system for the continental United States in the near future. But that is nothing less than a clear departure from the 1972 Treaty. The Clinton administration has not only confirmed its readiness to implement these amended Reagan plans but even, by all accounts, intends going further in that direction. Thus the law leads one to conclude that the United States is trying to split ABM defense into two parts and "separate" strategic ABM defense from theater ABM defense. It is doing this, on the one hand, to retain greater freedom in case Russia insists on the precise observance of the 1972 Treaty and returns to the old principle of the comprehensive examination of offensive and defensive arms. On the other hand, some of the strategic tasks formerly assigned to strategic nuclear arms are being "reassigned" to nonnuclear systems, which will then be dispersed and stationed where possible outside U.S. territory. And finally, while continuing the program of creating an ABM defense system in this new interpretation, the United States retains the lead in the sphere of the latest military technologies. But why did the idea of ABM deployment not disappear into the past along with the end of the Cold War? The threat of communism seemed to have been "dispelled." Russia and China are taking the path of market reforms and the democratization of society, and the main U.S. adversary -- the USSR -- has disintegrated. Treaties on unprecedented reductions of strategic offensive arms have been signed. The 1994 accord on the mutual non-targeting of nuclear weapons against installations in the United States, Britain, and the CIS is being implemented. The nuclear weapons remaining outside Russia's territory are gradually being dismantled and there are prospects of further progress in this direction. Thus the issue is not solely one of communism and the "Soviet threat." For the United States one problem now is how to maintain and expand its sphere of influence in the world and how to ensure the further promotion of U.S. interests and capital in the absence of the old consolidating factor -- the threat to the West from the communist camp. It is no coincidence that, with the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact and the USSR, U.S. experts began trying to foist on world public opinion a new "scare" to the effect that Moscow could not control its own missiles and nuclear weapons and that they would now be sold off and proliferate around the world. Of course, it may be conceded that these fears are to a certain extent justified. But that problem could have been settled in the process of bilateral relations without a clamorous worldwide propaganda campaign. You cannot help suspecting that this campaign has been undertaken for the purpose of preparing public opinion for the possible deployment of new U.S. arms systems, including theater ABM defense. In any event the Pentagon is already modernizing the ground-launched Patriot missile and the sea-launched Aegis missile right now for use against short-range missiles. Work is also in progress to create an ABM complex to destroy high-altitude targets or THAAD, as it is known. A quite specific question arises here: In that event, what is Russia supposed to do? It must be stressed here that, whereas previously the USSR was still able to link the ABM problem to the question of reducing strategic offensive arms, Russia no longer has that ability now. In 1989, first E. Shevardnadze at the meeting in Wyoming and then M. Gorbachev in Malta agreed, under pressure from the Americans, to abandon the comprehensive examination of the problem of strategic offensive weapons and ABM defense. Admittedly, in the event of a full-scale American deployment of a strategic ABM defense system we can announce our withdrawal from the START treaties. But from the military viewpoint that will probably be too late, and from the political viewpoint it will not be very productive. It may also be assumed that the United States will try to share the blame for breaching the ABM Treaty with Russia by offering it some participation in its own program, with appropriate rewards. Such attempts are already being made. However, let us not flatter ourselves about the results. Suffice it to recall how the United States treated the British at the dawn of the nuclear era: The Americans made use of their interim achievements in the creation of nuclear arms and then broke their promise to share the end results of that work. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to think that Russian policy is ready to let the ABM question slide. Our country is conducting a fairly intensive negotiation process with the United States in which it is upholding the inviolability of the 1972 ABM Treaty. Its position is also based on the opinion of those American politicians and specialists who believe that the revision of that treaty's provisions could undermine the international efforts to ensure the nonproliferation of especially dangerous types of armaments. As for theater ABM defense, this problem must be resolved in two areas, in my view. One is to work with the United States to define the criteria for this type of armament and formulate them in, for instance, an additional protocol to the ABM Treaty. The other is to discuss at international level the possible consequences of the deployment of new U.S. regional weapons systems, including theater ABM defense. It probably makes sense to propose holding talks on these problems with those countries on whose territory they might appear first. Efforts must be made to prevent the emergence of new ABM systems -- which would undoubtedly provoke countries to create arms capable of overcoming them. In practice this will lead to a new round of the arms race.
