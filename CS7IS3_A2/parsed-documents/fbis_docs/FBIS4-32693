Moravcik stated that, if he were to compare official trips before [under Meciar's government, when he was foreign minister] and now, the present ones are far more concentrated and businesslike. He specified that one of the serious shortcomings under Vladimir Meciar's government was that, from the viewpoint of diplomatic practice, official trips were not of the required standard. Moravcik stated that, throughout his term as prime minister, Meciar did not pay a single official visit to any country of the European Union [EU] because of the lack of an official invitation. In that sense, Moravcik's visit to France was the first official trip made by a Slovak prime minister to an EU country since the founding of the independent Slovak Republic. According to Moravcik, the trips of the other Cabinet ministers can be positively evaluated as well. The level at which they are being received is higher than was the case of representatives of the previous cabinet.
