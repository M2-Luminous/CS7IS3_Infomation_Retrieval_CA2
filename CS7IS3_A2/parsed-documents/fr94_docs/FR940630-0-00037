FR940630-0-00037 FR940630-0-00011 PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION 29 CFR Part 2647 Reduction of Waiver of Complete Withdrawal Liability AGENCY: Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation recently issued a final rule that amended its regulations for the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability by prescribing a procedure and standards for amending a multiemployer plan to provide alternative rules. Under the amended regulations, an amendment adopting such alternative rules may not be put into effect until approved by the PBGC. This technical amendment adds the control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget to the collection of information in the amended regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Judith Neibrief, Attorney, Office of the General Counsel, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 1200 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005&hyph;4026, 202&hyph;326&hyph;4024 (202&hyph;236&hyph;4179 for TTY and TDD). (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') administers the pension plan termination insurance programs under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA'') (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq. ). Part 2647 of the PBGC's regulations (29 CFR Part 2647), Reduction or Waiver of Complete Withdrawal Liability, implements ERISA section 4207 (29 U.S.C. 1387) by providing rules for reducing or waiving the liability for complete withdrawal of an employer that subsequently resumes covered operations under or renews an obligation to contribute under a multiemployer plan. As amended on March 2, 1994 (59 FR 9926; effective April 1, 1994), Part 2647 includes, in §2647.9 (Plan rules for abatement), a procedure and standards for the amendment of a multiemployer plan to provide alternative rules for the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability. An amendment adopting such alternative rules (and any subsequent modification thereof) may not be put into effect until approved by the PBGC (§2647.9(a)), and §2647.9(d) prescribes the information that a plan sponsor (or duly authorized representative thereof) must include in its request for PBGC approval. Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') approved the collection of information in §2647.9 under control number 1212&hyph;0044 (expiration date: September 30, 1994), and the PBGC is not issuing this technical amendment to display the OMB control number at the end of §2647.9. (A notice of the PBGC's request that OMB extend approval of this collection of information for another three years appears elsewhere in today's Federal Register .) Because this rule is limited to a technical change, the PBGC has for good cause found advance notice and public procedure thereon to be unnecessary under section 553 (b)(B) and (d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553 (b)(B) and (d)(3)). Therefore, the PBGC is issuing this amendment as a final rule, effective upon publication. E.O. 12866 The PBGC has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in Executive Order 12866 because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productively, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. List of Subjects in 29 CFR 2647 Employee benefit plans, Pension insurance, Reporting requirements. For the reasons set forth above, the PBGC is amending 29 CFR Part 2647 as follows: PART 2647_REDUCTION OR WAIVER OF COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY 1. The authority citation for Part 2647 is amended by removing ``and'' and adding, in its place, ``,''. §2647.9 [Amended] 2. Section 2647.9 is amended by adding ``(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1212&hyph;0044)'' at the end. Issued in Washington, DC this 27th day of June, 1994. Martin Slate, Executive Director, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15927 Filed 6&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7708&hyph;01&hyph;M
