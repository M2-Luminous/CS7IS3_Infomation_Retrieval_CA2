The Tariff Policy Commission of the State Council has decided that provisional tariffs are to be levied on imports of major raw materials for agricultural and industrial production, including farm chemicals and pesticides. Imports of products which China either does not produce or in which the country faces shortages, such as spare parts for major machinery and electric products, is also on the list of provisional tariff rates. China will also collect tariffs at provisional rates on nine categories of exports, including lead, zinc, tin, phosphorus and benzine. The customs official said that the move is part of the bid to reduce the effects on the prices of imports which may be brought about by the currency reform to going into force on January 1, 1994. The provisional tariffs are lower than the present preferential tariffs spelled out in the country's tariff rules for imports and exports, and some tariff rates on export commodities will be reduced to zero under the provisional rates. China cut tariffs on 2,898 categories of imports last month.
