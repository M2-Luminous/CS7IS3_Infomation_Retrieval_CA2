He described as positive the talks with an IMF mission but refused to give details on any possible agreements. Moreno said that progress was achieved with the World Bank, which disbursed $2 billion to cover the first stage of a program to modernize the Finance Ministry's tax system. He also commented on adjustments that must be made to the 1995 budget. Here are his remarks on reducing fiscal expenses: [Begin Moreno recording] As for a reduction of expenses, we already made an important adjustment that represents about 7 to 8 percent of what was planned in the budget and about 200 billion [currency not specified] from special requests. [sentence as heard] I think that in next year's budget we need not only an adjustment but an in-depth reorientation of expenses. At the ministry we are already working on regulations that will be presented to the minister for discussion by the Council of Ministers. I think that the government should begin to implement its program in next year's budget, because this year we had to adjust to the situation that confronted us. Next year, however, we must begin to implement the letter of intent presented by the president to the Venezuelan people by reorganizing the 1995 budget. [end recording] The Finance Ministry adviser added that revenues obtained from gasoline price increases will be revealed before year end.
