Diplomatic sources here think that King Sihanouk, who underwent an operation for cancer at the hospital, is now in serious condition. Immediately after his rectum was operated on in October last year, King Sihanouk announced: "I have contracted cancer." He is currently being hospitalized at an army hospital in Beijing. Prime Minister Ranariddh reportedly visited the king at the hospital on the evening of 17 January, upon the delegation's arrival in Beijing. Prime Minister Hun Sen visited the king on 18 January. The Sihanouk Office [name as published] and the Cambodian Embassy in Beijing have not given answers to why the two did not visit the king together. Claiming that he is ill, King Sihanouk has been controlling Cambodian politics from Beijing. A diplomatic source said: "His health condition does not seem to be the same as it was when he initially chose to `pursue politics' from here. Despite the visits by the two prime ministers, no message has been delivered from the king. This indicates that his health condition is worsening."
