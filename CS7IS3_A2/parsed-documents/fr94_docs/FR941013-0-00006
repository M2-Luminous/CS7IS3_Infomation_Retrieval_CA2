FR941013-0-00006 FR941013-0-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;83; Amendment 39&hyph;9036; AD 94&hyph;20&hyph;08] Airworthiness Directives; Pratt & Whitney JT8D Series Turbofan Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines, that currently requires initial and repetitive inspections of installed third and fourth stage low pressure turbine (LPT) blade sets for blade shroud crossnotch wear, and removal of blade sets found with excessively worn blade shroud crossnotches. This amendment continues to require inspections, and removal, if necessary, of blade sets, but also requires, as a terminating action to the inspections: installation of improved LPT containment hardware, and installation of an improved No. 6 bearing scavenge pump bracket bushing. This amendment is prompted by reports of additional uncontained engine failures since publication of the current AD, and the availability of improved LPT containment hardware. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent damage to the aircraft resulting from engine debris following an LPT blade or shaft failure.
