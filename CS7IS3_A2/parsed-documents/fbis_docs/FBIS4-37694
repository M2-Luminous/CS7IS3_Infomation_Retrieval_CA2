The news conference was attended by a number of journalists and media figures. During the news conference, brother al-Zir stressed that the Palestinian leadership, because of its great eagerness to preserve strong, brotherly Palestinian-Jordanian ties, wants to give Jordanian contractors an opportunity to work in the self-rule areas on an equal footing with their Palestinian brothers. Mr. al-Zir called on Palestinian and Jordanian contractors to now join efforts; huge efforts are required to rebuild the infrastructure of Palestinian authority, destroyed by years of occupation. He stressed that the projects in the self-rule areas will be large and numerous and will encompass all aspects of life. He added: The projects under proposal are large and beyond the capabilities of local contractors. We have worked together with our Jordanian brothers in several countries and we must work together again. As the economic agreement between Jordan and Palestine provides for free trade between the two countries, contracts should also be free from restrictions, he said. Brother al-Zir concluded by saying that the agreement to be signed by the two countries will include this fundamental issue so that Palestinian-Jordanian relations will be strong and free. He called on everyone to cooperate, bolster mutual interests, and coordinate the conditions of work.
