A leader of a southern city sighed with regret because he had not known about the corporation earlier. At a recent meeting to exchange experience in points selected for experiments on comprehensive reforms in the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, convened by the State Commission for Restructuring Economy, a representative expressed his feelings as follows: "A small match (meaning the case of the relocation of a match factory) has lit up the whole space around." We heartily rejoice at such strong repercussions of the reforms in the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation because, in the course of making reports about the corporation, we indeed had the feeling of a soft breeze blowing toward us. However, because the enthusiasm to learn from the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation is intensifying, we are worried that what is learned may be different from what is expected and that things which should not be stressed, may be stressed. Our desire and responsibility is to help our readers correctly understand and grasp this typical example. The focus of the reforms carried out by the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation is not to enliven the enterprises but to enliven the assets. The corporation has pushed reforms a big step forward and such reforms mark the raising of the curtain of a new stage in the reforms of enterprises. "If I were the boss, what I should consider at present would be how to enliven all the assets instead of how to save each individual enterprise," said Zhou Dali, deputy director of the State Commission for Restructuring Economy Distribution Department, at an informal discussion meeting. "How should we change the situation of three one-thirds in state enterprises? If we concentrate our efforts on saving each individual enterprise, all enterprises will be half dead. Assets must be current assets. This is an essential demand of the market economy. Some enterprises must survive while others must perish and the disposal of resources should be optimized in the course of readjusting the structure and layout. Only by enlivening state assets will it be possible to enliven the overall situation." The shift of the focus from enlivening enterprises to enlivening assets is a new change and a new demand of reform of the economic structure. It is also something that makes the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation so prominent. Of course, this does not mean enlivening enterprises is unimportant. Enlivening enterprises is the foundation. How can we enliven assets without enlivening enterprises? However, enlivening assets is the goal. To attain this goal, some enterprises which should survive should be allowed to live on happily, while other enterprises which should perish should be allowed to die a "natural and unrestrained death [xiao sa si yi hui 3469 3155 2984 0001 2585]." "Enlivening assets is different from enlivening enterprises," said Li Yuan, director of the State Commission of Restructuring Economy Distribution Department. "First of all, in enlivening enterprises, impetus is often required only once. Such impetus can be a policy, funds, or technology and if it can last three to five years, it will be good enough. However, the enlivening of assets needs a long-term effective mechanism and the formation of such a mechanism is based on the construction of systems. Second, the enlivening of assets needs comprehensive reforms. In the reforms carried out by the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation for example, the solutions to the two major difficult problems regarding the sources of funds and the placement of surplus personnel must involve the reforms of various systems, such as the land use system, the personnel and labor system, the system for training staff members and workers, and the social security system. Third, since the reforms are comprehensive, a new role is needed. The person who plays this role should undertake responsibility for state assets and should be able to manage state assets with a free hand, in accordance with the laws of the market economy, in a bid to preserve their value. However, such a new role should be established through reforming the enterprise property rights system." Bai Jinrong, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Committee for Restructuring Economy said: "The existing enterprise systems cannot meet the demands of the market economy on enterprises--to become competitive main bodies which raise funds on their own, carry out construction and operation on their own, and assume sole responsibility for their profits and losses. Nor can they meet the needs of large-scale socialized production--assets to float and disposal of resources to be optimized. In carrying out reforms of enterprises in the past, we always focused our attention on the relationships of production. However, the universal significance of the reforms carried out by the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation lies in the new path it has explored for enlivening the state economy--the organic integration, through comprehensive reforms, of the readjustment of the production setup, the enterprise organizational setup, the layout of industries, the transformation of the old urban areas, and the development of the land resources with the reform of the enterprise property rights system, with the goal of establishing a modern enterprise system to realize the unity of the readjustment of the production relationships with the development of the productive forces. That is, the unity of reform and development, as we usually put it." The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation shifted from the management of production and enterprises to the operation and management of state assets. Ever since then, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has lost its original meaning and like "Yiqing" and "Fazhan," has become a code name for large enterprise groups with assets of several billion yuan. If you agree with the above views, do you accept the following judgment? The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Committee put forward the establishment of a modern enterprise system and this enabled the reforms of enterprises in our country to enter a new stage. With the intensive work carried out for some time, the curtain of this new stage has been raised and the opera has started. The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has been able to carry out operational activities to enliven state assets thanks to the reform of the enterprise property rights system. Through authorized management of state assets, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has acquired the status of the representative of the proprietor of assets and, therefore, can handle affairs which a single production enterprise could not handle and which government departments should not handle. Although there are different views on the comprehensive reforms of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, we hold that the sequence of ideas is very clear: The point of integration of deepening reforms in enterprises with the development of the productive forces is to enliven assets; in the market economy structure, enterprise actions should be dominant ones in enlivening assets; and we must reform the existing enterprise system, otherwise the property rights relationship will not be clear and enterprises will find it difficult to fulfill this task. Cui Zhian, chairman of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation board of directors, recalled the formulation of the train of thought on reforms, saying: "Our new exploration of reform began in 1991 and the train of thought was really formulated after Comrade Xiaoping made his remarks in the south in 1992. The remarks about being beneficial to promoting the productive forces, beneficial to reinforcing the comprehensive national strength of our socialist country, and beneficial to enhancing the living standards of the people have enlightened us a great deal and have become the ideological weapon for us to deepen reform. We conducted investigations and made analyses of our own position and discovered that we were in a very difficult situation. The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation mainly produced daily necessities and any other enterprise could also do that. Besides, preferential policies were implemented for joint ventures, township and town enterprises, and open areas, but we were under the impact of contraband. We had no strong points at all. What was the way out? We summed up the experience of reforms carried out in some of our enterprises and our train of thought became clearer. In the past, the consumption rate of the No. 3 Glass Plant was great and its products were of lower grade. After it was moved to Daxing County and became a joint venture, it introduced advanced technology and produced high-grade glass products. The price for each tonne of glass products rose from 1,200 yuan to 8,000 yuan. Then came the lighting device plant which had been a loss-making plant for many years. After it used the building of a branch plant to do business, it was able to give jobs to over 100 surplus personnel and to bring in an additional income of 3 million yuan. It was most profitable to develop tertiary industry in prosperous areas and everybody was able to see that. The idea of relocating secondary industry enterprises and developing tertiary industry enterprises, and of moving production factors out of the Fourth Ring Road to develop secondary industry at a high level was put forward on this basis. "At present, state enterprises commonly face three difficulties: Funds are in short supply, personnel are excessive, and assets cannot be enlivened," said Cui Zhian. "Viewed from the reality of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, the last of the three difficulties was the crux and once this knot was untied, the other difficulties could be overcome. Once the assets were enlivened, there would be money and more jobs could be provided for the surplus personnel. How could this knot be untied? We must have the right to operate assets. To whom should the rights to operate assets be given? Should they be given to a certain production enterprise? Given the difficult situation the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation was in, it would not make things any better no matter which production enterprise was given the right to operate assets. Should such rights be given to government departments? But government departments cannot take part in operational activities. What should we do then? The only thing for us to do was to change ourselves and shoulder the task." "Unclear property rights relationships are the root cause of the poor operation of state enterprises," said Li Yuan. "To solve this problem, the idea of separating the two rights, that is, separating ownership rights from the rights of operation, was once put forward in carrying out reforms in the past. This played a great role in ensuring the right to make decisions on the operation of enterprises. However, since the state was the proprietor and the enterprises were operators, it was still difficult to separate the government from enterprises. The crux of the problem was to find an appropriate position for the proprietor in enterprises. Through authorized rights to operate state assets, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation acquired the status as the representative of the proprietor. This shows that separating government from assets is an important condition for separating government from enterprises." To enliven assets, we must establish a property rights main body. The ultimate ownership of state assets belongs to the state and enterprises only have legal person property rights. Who then should exercise ownership of assets on behalf of the state and undertake the responsibility of preserving and increasing the value of such assets? The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has provided us with a train of thought. The reforms by the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation have both universal and special significance. The reforms by the corporation have been carried out on the basis of its own reality. In learning from the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, we should also proceed from our respective realities. There are two direct reasons for the success in the reforms of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation: The right to operate state assets and the right to develop land resources. However, these two cannot be equated with the reform of the property rights system and the construction of the modern enterprise system. The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has found its own position in reform. It has changed from an organization for the management of a trade into a company of an enterprise nature for the operation of state assets. "Can we also do the same?" This is perhaps the most directly associated thought in some administrative departments. Speaking about this question, Li Yuan said, "Where this new role can be played should be based on the characteristics of the respective specific situations and productive forces. In a big city like Beijing, for example, if such a role is played at a level higher than the original specialized administrative department, the range of administration will be too wide. In a small city, it is perhaps more appropriate for one or two companies to play this role. Another idea is for the role to be played by a single production enterprise but this has to be determined by the scale and capacity of that enterprise. In the Beijing light industry system, if the role is played by a certain production enterprise, that enterprise can be enlivened. However, the role of enlivening state assets of the entire system will be greatly reduced." "What is more important," stressed Li Yuan, "is to select the player of this `new role.' We must take into consideration its quality and ability, including its sense of reform, its comprehensive ability, and its operational capacity. Before it was authorized to operate state assets, the leadership of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation had already made numerous attempts at reform. Under difficult conditions, it constantly optimized the disposal of the production factors and achieved initial results and valuable experience. Therefore, if we want to follow its example we should act in the same way and learn from them properly." Whenever comrades of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation talk about the reforms they carried out, they never forget the support of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and Municipal Government and the guidance from the State Commission for Restructuring Economy. In fact, the reforms in the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation have been carried out ahead of time. It is precisely because of this that some practices are not completely in keeping with certain existing rules, regulations, and policies. The Beijing CPC Municipal CPC Committee and Municipal Government, from the angle of carrying out experiments boldly, have given special treatment to the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. The right to comprehensively develop real estate within the system, for example, has been granted specially. According to a comrade from the Beijing Municipal Committee for Restructuring Economy, land is a state asset. The use of land has to be compensated and has a time limit. The responsibility for land management is undertaken by special government departments and specific work is carried out by local governments. Taxes and fees collected are used for urban construction. The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has changed the purpose in using land. According to regulations, the land should be taken back, new applications should be submitted for examination and approval, and taxes and fees concerned should be paid. In this respect, there is no exception for the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. However, the municipal government has adopted some relatively lax policies and flexible practices in the relocation of enterprises. For example, the amount of money to be handed over to the state for the sale of land can be handed over by installments and part of the money can be returned to the enterprises as reinvestment by the state. In redeveloping the land originally occupied by the Beijing Match Plant, the land was converted into 47 million state shares in the Hongyun Company. At present, the value of this part of the state assets has increased by 200 percent. In this way, the reforms of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation acquired the necessary means and funds for the start. Therefore, in this sense, it can be said that the attempt to reform the system of using land has benefited the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation and the credit should go to the municipal government. This is precisely a concrete action of "supporting reform with reform" put forward by the Beijing Municipality. Li Yuan holds that the reform of the land use system centering round the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation carried out by the Beijing Municipality can meet the needs of the market economy and has not changed the nature whereby land belongs to the state. Compared with various practices of using land to attract foreign capital in some localities and giving preferential treatment to foreign businessmen and allowing them to have more profits, the method adopted by the Beijing Municipality is more normal. The merit of this practice is that it has demonstrated the value of land assets and has prevented the loss of land assets. However, the land use system is an important state system and we should safeguard its solemnity and authority. Reforms must be carried out in an orderly way, step by step, and under the guidance of the government departments concerned. We should not just focus our attention on land in optimizing the disposal of resources but should also pay attention to management, technology, equipment, qualified personnel, and the ways of combining various production factors. In Beijing, because differential land rent exists, land resources are very important. This may not be so in other localities. The reforms of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation have been carried out on the basis of its reality. In learning from the corporation, we should also proceed from our respective realities.
