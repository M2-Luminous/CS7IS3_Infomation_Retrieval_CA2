Every wheeler-dealer wants to be a Knesset member and there is unbridled competition between hawks and doves, she said. Aloni cautioned that this disintegration might lead to the collapse of the peace process and to a war in which Egypt would also take part. According to her, Meretz must make the government's basic guidelines more pronounced and make sure that it abides by its commitments. In response, Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili told our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal that Meretz's peace is not Labor's peace. He noted that Labor had been dealt a blow, but is currently recovering and not disintegrating.
