Investment funds are characterized mainly by: collective investment, expert operation, decentralized risk, and joint benefits. Investment funds, through orderly and decentralized investment packages, optimize investment efficiency, risk-dispersion efficiency, and expert-operation efficiency. In today's China, where our socialist market economy is developing rapidly, investment has become a keen undertaking for the Chinese public and enterprises. All sorts of investment activities, such as buying stocks and bonds, and investing in self-run enterprises, joint ventures, partnerships, and trusts, are unfolding. The public asks: Of the many investment forms, which option is actually the more ideal? In response to readers' inquiries, I interviewed Xu Zhantao, a young economist studying this business. Reporter: While investment is a hedge against inflation to proliferate assets and earn higher returns, which makes sense, can the current decentralized, industrial, or securities direct-investment options achieve this goal? Xu Zhantao: The popularization of investment subjects shows that investment subjects have shifted to a deeper level. The profit-forces incentive of investment to proliferate assets as a hedge against inflation, the drive of entreprenurial creativity and aspiration, and the conversion of investment operating forces, have sharply strengthened the public oversight and restraint mechanisms for investment, promoting a steady increase in investment microeconomic efficiency. In contrast to a single financing means, this is a great advance. But it needs to be noted that for the ordinary small and midsize investor, these investment means also involve many adverse factors. 1. In industrial investment, as the public lacks the knowledge and skill to do feasibility studies of projects, the ability to make accurate market analyses and projections, modern business management techniques, and the capability to utilize advanced S&T, this unavoidably creates unchecked and duplicate investment in enterprises, thus making it hard to avoid poor investment efficiency, and even the risk of bankruptcy. Moreover, as such investments are small, it is hard to make decentralized and package investments, thus making it difficult to disperse and reduce investment risks. Also, due probably to the ulterior motives and fraudulent fundraising of certain private enterprises, it is hard to keep public investors from being cheated and engulfed by unfortunate evil consequences. 2. In securities investment, as small investors have no stock market knowledge, and inadequate investment might for repeated investment in many securities, the investment risks are obvious. 3. Macroeconomically, small investments are adverse to a rational pooling of construction funds, the control of investment scale, the upgrading of investment structure and improvement of efficiency, the optimum disposition of resources, the stability and growth of stock markets, and even social stability. Reporter: Prosperity leads to thoughts of investment. Since reform and opening, China's productive forces have been developed sharply, with public and enterprise self-accumulation growing steadily. Incomplete statistics show the Chinese public to now have over 2 trillion yuan in financial capital, an average of nearly 2,000 yuan a person, and almost 4,000 yuan a person in coastal zones, with enterprise self-owned assets-accumulation also quite sizeable. What investment means would you choose to effectively avoid risks and earn higher returns? Xu Zhantao: I hold that the development of a new public pooled trust and investment means--investment funds, is the more ideal option. Investment funds are a unique means of fundraising, differing from fundraising through either bank savings and various bonds or through stocks and stock rights, rather using fund shares or beneficiary documents to raise funds from small and midsize investors. While they have set terms (which stocks do not), they do not have fixed, advance-set returns (which deposits and bonds do). Moreover, they give investors some powers similar to shareholders. Investment funds are a unique investment means, being neither a simple credit investment or one in the shares of a single enterprise, but rather a comprehensive investment integrating creditor rights, property interests, and stock rights. Investment funds are a unique investment-operation system. While bank loans are a bonded debt credit system, and stock investment is an ownership system, investment funds are a pooled trust system, an expert agent investment-operation system in which "agents are entrusted with money management." Investment funds are a unique financial commodity and investment instrument, being a financial commodity somewhere between savings, deposits, bonds, and stocks, or a borderline, composite financial commodity, and a comprehensive investment instrument integrating stock rights, property interests, and creditor rights. Investment funds reflect unique, diversified economic relations. Financial allocations reflect voluntary distribution relations, bank deposits and all types of bonds reflect intermediary relations between bonded debt and credit, and stocks or stock rights reflect the relations between owners and operators, while investment funds reflect diversified economic relations among the four parties of investors, sponsors, managers, and custodians. It could be said that investment funds create a public, pooled, trust-agent investment means between bank-credit intermediate investment and public and individual direct investment, being a popular, democratic, and collective investment means. Their appearance will inevitably set off another investment-system change, being bound to speed up the formation of a new fundraising and investment mechanism, to make the disposition of public resources more efficient and optimal. This means will be more suited to the public investment needs of a country like China with a huge population that is just beginning to prosper, where individual assets are relatively decentralized, and where most investors are small and midsize. Reporter: It is understood that China now has 45 investment funds of all types, with funds topping 4.2 billion yuan. What do you believe is the significance and impact of the birth and development of this new investment means suited to public investment? Xu Zhantao: While its significance is multiple, it is mainly: 1. It will contribute to further investment-system change, strengthening public oversight and restraint forces for investment; 2. It will help to intensify financial reform, promoting a rational adjustment of our national financial-capital structure, and lowering commercial-bank risk; 3. It will be favorable to stock market stability and development, reducing blind with-the-wave transactions by and short-supply manipulation of small and midsize investors; 4. It will benefit the attraction of foreign investment, expanding foreign-investment scale, limits, and targets, without turning China's foreign-currency debt into a case of killing many birds with one stone; 5. It will be advantageous to macroeconomic regulation and control. As investment funds are a standardized means of public fundraising, the state can regulate, control, and guide them to regulate, control, and guide stock markets. In contrast to regulating hundreds of thousands of small and midsize investors to stabilize stock markets, this will be much easier and produce much better results.
