The group, which officials said operated out of Maghnia on the border with Morocco and which includes 22 defendants being tried in their absence, is charged with smuggling arms into the country and helping repatriate via Morocco Algerians who fought for Afghan guerrilla groups against Soviet troops. The trial is being heard in Oran before one of Algeria's three special courts responsible for trying "terrorism and subversion" cases. The group is charged with "forming armed terrorist groups, holding and selling weapons and explosives, and threatening the security of the state." Since they were set up a year ago, the three courts have handed down more than 4,000 sentences, including 420 death penalties. Meanwhile security authorities here said six armed fundamentalists were killed by government forces Thursday and Friday in various parts of Algeria. An armed gang had killed a teacher Tuesday while he took a class in a village near Jijel, northeast Algeria, the authorities said. Islamic fundamentalists launched a guerrilla war against Algerian authorities in December 1991 after the government voided general elections which the since-outlawed Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.
