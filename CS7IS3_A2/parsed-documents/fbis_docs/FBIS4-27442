"The Five-man Committee on Administrative Reform," the gathering of top leaders of five major economic organizations, which has played a major role in pushing deregulation, cannot tell when it can meet again in face of objections from some business sectors. Moreover, on 25 May, the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry issued a statement jointly with three organizations representing small and medium companies, declaring opposition to any further easing of the Large-Scale Retail Store Law. So far feeling in the business world has in general kept step with moves to deregulate, but as the debate on deregulation enters its final stage, clear differences of view are emerging. The Five-Man Committee on Administrative Reform was set up in February 1981 to give a push to the Ad Hoc Commission on Administrative Reform. At the time it was led by Toshio Tsuchimitsu and leaders from the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations [Keidanren], the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Kansai Economic Federation also took part. Last September the committee even invited Koshiro Ishida, director-general of the Management and Coordination Agency, to a meeting and handed him a statement giving its views on the need for deregulation. Keidanren and other organizations have recently asked for a meeting of the influential committee to be called, the reason being they want to keep the business world informed about important issues such as the promotion of deregulation, and thereby reduce the resistance of bureaucrats who oppose the move. But a Keidanren official admitted: "We don't know when the meeting will be called because some organizations have since become hesitant about the idea; they are concerned that deregulation might adversely affect small and medium companies and employment figures." Shoichiro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corporation, who will be formally appointed as new Keidanren chairman on 27 May, regards deregulation as one of the most important tasks facing the country. However, it looks as though he will face rough going in promoting it, given the conflicting views now arising among businesses on the issue of deregulation.
