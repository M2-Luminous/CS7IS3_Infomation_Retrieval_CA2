Their conversation mainly focused on the growth of relationship between China and Eritrea. Noting that the peoples of the two countries have traditionally enjoyed friendship, Qiao said that since they established diplomatic ties one year ago, their contacts have increased and areas for cooperation have gradually broadened. The NPC intends to establish ties with the national assembly of Eritrea so as to promote exchanges and cooperation between the two parliaments, he said. Isayas said Eritrea has always worked hard for the enhancement of its friendly relations with China, adding that Eritrea's independence has laid a solid foundation for furthering such a relationship. He noted that since the two countries established diplomatic ties, bilateral ties have grown rapidly, which, he said, conforms to the fundamental interests of the two countries. Qiao said he admired the unremitting efforts that the Eritrean Government and people have made in healing the wounds of war and rebuilding the country's economy under extremely difficult conditions. He said the key to avoiding a road of twists and turns for a newly independent country depends on whether it will strictly act in accordance with its national conditions. Qiao said he was sure that under the leadership of President Isayas, the diligent and wise Eritrean people will achieve success in exploring a new way for development suitable to its national conditions. Isayas said he agreed with Qiao's view on learning from other countries' experiences and not copying from others. He said that Eritrea and China may differ in national conditions. However, he added, there are many useful things that Eritrea can learn from China. China's assistance to Eritrea is particularly playing an important role in the latter's reconstruction. Tan Qinglian, chairman of the Chinese Government reception committee and vice-minister of construction, participated in the meeting.
