The latter live in fear of terrorist attacks against themselves or their businesses. And they feel they are kept poorly informed about current economic conditions in Algeria... 0930. Hamoudi Belatache, general manager of an EPE (economic public [i.e., parastatal] enterprise[.sup]1[/] that specializes in distribution, finishes reading the four major local French-language dailies. "For some months now," he sighs, "the only economic news I get comes from the newspapers." Most public-sector industrial leaders are in the same boat. Political uncertainty and questions about the future are making both supervisory ministries and participation funds (similar to boards of directors on which other EPEs hold seats) increasingly tight-lipped. Many managers complain of being kept in the dark about developments in the just-concluded negotiations with the IMF (see LA TRIBUNE of 11 April 1994) and decisions coming in the next few months about the restructuring of the Algerian economy. "The metaphor of a ship captain battling the storm alone is not too strong," says Hamoudi Belatache. "Today, everyone knows things are going to change, but I can't even allay the misgivings of my executives or other employees by telling them what is going on. How can we talk about `motivation' when the very survival of the enterprise as an economic unit is in question?" Two days before, three men armed with automatic rifles appeared on the premises of the enterprise. A guard, seriously wounded, managed to sound the alarm. Firemen responding to the alarm were able to save a large part of the company vehicle fleet from the fire the terrorists had set in an effort to destroy it. The damage: a truck destroyed by fire, and the departure of three guards whose families received threats the day after the attack. The past year has seen an ever-increasing incidence of arson, sabotage, and hold-ups targeting public enterprises. Many industrialists say security has become a major concern in their everyday lives. "I'm looking out first of all after myself," one of them confides. "As manager of a public enterprise, I am seen by the terrorists as an accomplice of the state. We are under as much of a threat as journalists and intellectuals. A friend pointed out to me the other day that the fact I have a duty vehicle and driver could make them mistake me for a government official--except that I don't get the same close protection." So this manager no longer keeps regular hours or arranges appointments over the telephone, trembles whenever his secretary announces visitors, and compulsively calls the office three times a night to make sure all is well. Despite all the terrorist attacks, the Algerian Government does not seem to be moving quickly to respond to industry's need for protection. The much-publicized addition to the security forces of the first graduating class of security agents is not enough to calm employers' fears. "Arson destroyed part of our facilities," explains the manager of a furniture manufacturing company. "We're still waiting for supplemental appropriations to install effective systems." Installers of alarms, anti-intruder systems, and remote surveillance equipment are overwhelmed by requests for estimates, but firm orders are few and far between. "I wonder sometimes if the state really knows what's going on," muses the manager of Secu-electro, a small PME [small or medium-size enterprise] specializing in industrial security. "Every day our technicians visit Algerian companies where it would be child's play to gain entry and set a fire." Image Problems So far, most public enterprises are doing well just to post sentry teams composed of regular employees. "It would be stretching the truth to say all workers feel personally concerned about this," says Hamoudi Belatache. "Motivating them by trying to tell them that because the enterprise is partly theirs they owe it to themselves to protect it amounts to reviving demagogic slogans of the socialist era that no one wants to hear anymore." Years of centralized, bureucratized management have also tarnished the image of managers. Most blue-collar workers still equate them with the nomenclatura of the old regime and believe all their managers, with or without diplomas, are equally incompetent. So it is difficult, at a time of rumors of massive layoffs, to be candid with employees, especially since the majority of them voted for the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. Interior Minister Selim Saadi acknowledged recently that some workers had been involved in setting fires at their own enterprise, often under duress but sometimes on their own initiative. Unthinking, vindictive actions... "As a general rule, Algerian employees do not like management," says Hamid Larbaoui, instructor at the Advanced Institute of Management and Planning. "Under the circumstances, the heads of public enterprises oscillate between authoritarian and paternalistic approaches, both of which tend to engender hostility. The contradictions are exacerbated, naturally, by the climate of violence raging in our country, and the company's internal cohesion is put to a rugged test." Even while faced with the urgent need to cope with a deteriorating security environment, public-sector enterprise managers must try to keep up production levels. The growing scarcity of foreign exchange and drastic reductions in raw materials imports have caused industrial production levels to plummet to less than 50 percent of capacity. "The situation is almost catastrophic," says the manager of a garment factory. "We produce little, and what is worse, we sell little." It is easy to see why. The crushing weight of external debt, which leaves nothing left for investment, is one of the prime villains. Also cited repeatedly is unfair competition from the black market, which imports the finest quality Western products from Tunisia and Morocco on a massive scale. But few managers questioned admit the need to completely rethink their production options and the way their company is organized, even though restructuring is the order of the day. Last autumn, a report prepared by experts underlined the necessity of rethinking Algeria's development model. The entities most directly affected, public enterprises, are marking time, waiting for their fate to be decided, while local experts entertain serious doubts about the ability of managers now in place to implement the coming reforms. "The majority of public enterprises have been audited by international research consultancies," explains an official in the Ministry of Industry and Mines. "We have concrete solutions that will make the EPEs the spearhead of economic activity. What we do not know, though, is whether the public-sector enterprise managers are going to work with us." The latter say they are ready to adapt to the market economy. "I hope at last I will have the chance to do what I am professionally trained to do," says the manager of an enterprise that manufactures industrial machinery. "We have never had the means to be managers. The enterprise was always subject to outside influences. Interventions by the minister or politicians were and still are pervasive in every domain. If I issue a call for tenders, I know the choice of foreign supplier will not be ours. If I start hiring, I will have a dozen applicants forced on me, and if I decide to fire an insubordinate executive, I will come under pressure from every direction to rehire him." Educated at elite institutions, dispatched frequently on "overseas missions," Algerian managers dream of being able to put into practice the expertise that local exigencies have always relegated to the backburner. "In the meantime, we content ourselves with managing day-to-day activity," Belatache confesses. "That means signing documents put in front of me and receiving the occasional Western commercial representative stationed in Spain, analyzing for the nth time our plans--temporarily on hold--for a partnership with some Italian firm." Optimistic in spite of all obstacles, public-sector employers hope the successful IMF negotiations will presage a long-awaited break with 30 years of statist economics. That question is on everyone's lips, even though many local officials are predicting that the Algerian state will do everything possible to "rehabilitate" the EPEs. "Many employers are uncomfortable about seeing their enterprise privatized," admits a member of the national union of public entrepreneurs [UNEP]. "Some, naturally, are afraid of losing their job, but a fair number simply mistrust private entrepreneurs, whom they judge very harshly." Long marginalized, the private sector is gradually coming out of the shadows. Employer associations have become indispensable partners in the social dialogue, while large financial groups have been put together to prepare for the opening of the economy. But few Algerians believe private-sector industrialists will be able to play a dynamic role. Redha Hamiami, himself both an entrepreneur and minister for small and medium-size enterprises, admitted recently that the private sector did not have CEOs able to become competitive managers in the global marketplace. In the end, the minister says, it will be necessary to call on managerial skills of foreigners and encourage public-sector managers to start up their own enterprises. "We're just like the public sector," shrewdly observes one official in the Algerian Employers Confederation. "It is true we have never had the benefits that were showered on the EPEs, but most of us still depended on state-imposed protectionism for profitability. Decontrol of foreign trade is going to cut a wide swath of destruction. At present, and with very few exceptions, our manufactures aren't competitive--even within the Maghreb." Battle for Finance Little by little, a new breed of employer is emerging. The majority are young, most have attended an Algerian university, and they have decided to create their own business rather than join the swollen ranks of executives in the state-owned companies. "I don't have anything to do with the branch of the private sector that has grown fat under the protection of state monopolies," claims Azzedine Fares, who heads a printing house in the suburbs of Algiers. "Being a young private-sector entrepreneur in Algeria is a constant struggle." There's no lack of battles, and the biggest is the battle to obtain financing to support production. Azzedine must constantly "chase after black-market foreign exchange." The French franc is worth 13 dinars on the parallel market, while the official rate is 4:1. "The private operators that meet at the big hotels in the capital and owe their fortunes to the largess of the system under Boumediene and Chadli are not having problems. They know where to get lines of credit, and they jealously guard that sort of information," says Azzedine, who hopes to form an association of private entrepreneurs. (If established, it would be the fifth of its kind, as Algerian entrepreneurs are incapable of unifying.) The only thing that unites the private operators are the "shakedowns" that victimize them all. Karim Zerrouki, who heads a construction company, is among those who has "paid." On the order of a hundred million centimes, in a series of small installments, and there is absolutely no way he can afford to report it to the police. The scenario is almost always the same. First comes a letter telling the private-sector CEO "to prepare to contribute to the war effort." Next comes a telephone call setting forth the amount to be paid, and finally an impromptu visit by several young men, always elegantly dressed, to pick up the cash. Sometimes, what is even more terrifying, a letter is delivered in the name of the Armed Islamic Group or the Armed Islamic Movement. "There is nothing to be done about it," says Karim Zerrouki. "Even private-sector industrialists who are tied in with politicians opposed to the Islamists have paid. You have to budget for shakedowns the same way you make provision for possible losses on currency exchange, the erratic tax regime, and inflation in the price of foreign currency on the black market." In all these tribulations, it is the managers of the local public enterprises (EPLs) that suffer most. These small state-owned PMEs, mostly operating in the red, may end up being sold on the auction block to the highest bidder--a scheme that the government of Redha Malek, which resigned yesterday, refused to give up despite protests from the unions, though it did agree to postpone implementation until after the forthcoming devaluation of the Algerian dinar. "It has now been more than six months since our workers have been paid," explains the manager of one EPL. "The banks do not want to hear about it, and the government, after an initial effort at financial reform, announced a year ago it was going to sell the EPLs. The workers are frustrated, hanging on to the hope the enterprise will be bought by a rich private investor with deep pockets." This embittered manager, who hopes to find a position in an EPE, notes nothing is being done to prepare public-sector managers like himself for the change. Many EPL managers are trying to create an association to lobby against systematic privatization of the local enterprises. "The state has never listened to the voices of public-sector enterprise managers," regrets one member of UNEP, "and it is greatly to be feared that the liberalization under way will blow us away like straw in the wind." Brain Drain Engineers, architects, doctors, young graduates, and experienced managers are leaving Algeria in ever larger numbers. In the last few months, the trickle has grown to a veritable hemorrhage. "I'm getting out so my daughter can get decent schooling," said Kader, a department head at Algiers effort, the other day. The slow decay of security conditions and the very real fear of a sudden slide into civil war are spurring many of the Algerian elite to emigrate. Morocco and Tunisia are the most popular destinations, far ahead of France. "Mr. Pasqua can relax," quips Hadi Moncef, head of an agrofood enterprise. "Algerians with diplomas or money know it will be 10 times as easy to relocate in the Maghreb as in France, to which it is almost impossible even to get a simple tourist visa!" Many private-sector entrepreneurs have resettled in Tunisia, especially in the Zarzis free zone or in the Tunis suburbs. No visa or work permit is required, and Algerians there are standing in line for jobs, mostly managers from the public sector who decided they have had enough. "Setting up a company is much easier in Tunisia than in Algeria," gloats an entrepreneur in the construction field who liquidated all his assets soon after the failure of the national dialogue conference. "And I can hire Algerian cadres who would never have agreed to work for me in Algeria." By contrast, relatively few entrepreneurs have installed themselves in Morocco, though the latter attracts a goodly number of Algerians with graduate degrees and former public-sector managers. "Morocco and Tunisia will reap the benefits of Algeria's education policy," drily notes an official in Algeria's Education Ministry. According to a recent study made by a private consultancy for a Western client, two out of three white-collar Algerians are considering leaving Algeria before the end of the year. The prospect disturbs both political decisionmakers and employers, confirms Ould-Khallef Farid, a member of the Algerian Employers Confederation. "The departures will be bad for the economy here. Liberalization of external trade and future privatizations will create a large demand for expertise and professional experience that is going to be difficult to meet." Many specialists note too that, in contrast to the trend in the 1980's when numerous students on scholarships defected overseas, it is experienced cadres that are leaving now. Not even the flagships of Algerian industry have been spared. Thus training program officials at Sonatrach [National Company for the Transport and Marketing of Hydrocarbons], a state-owned oil company that has been largely immune from austerity, admit they now think long and hard before sending cadres to training programs overseas. "Any training abroad will improve their resume," admits one computer engineer who hopes to be able to emigrate legally to Canada. "We talk a lot about the flight of the intellectuals," concludes a functionary in the Ministry of Economic Affairs, "but the emigration of employers, managers, and white-collar employees is more serious, even if less publicized." Algerian Economy: Industrial Flight of Educated Cadres: Footnote [.sup]1.[/] There are two types of public-sector enterprises in Algeria. Economic public enterprises, EPEs, are an outgrowth of the restructuring of big state-owned companies in the early 1980's. The local public enterprises, EPLs, are smaller--rather like public-sector PMEs--and they are owned or controlled at the local government level.
