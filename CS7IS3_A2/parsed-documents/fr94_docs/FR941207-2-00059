FR941207-2-00059 FR941207-2-00045 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,773] James River Corporation Old Town, Maine; Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration On November 16, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration for workers and former workers of the subject firm. This notice will soon be published in the Federal Register. On reconsideration, the James River Corporation submitted new information showing that hardwood pulp sales by the company declined in 1993 compared to 1992. The initial findings show substantial worker separations in 1993. U.S. imports of hardwood pulp increased absolutely and relative to domestic shipments in 1993 compared to 1992. Further findings on reconsideration show that a major declining customer increased its imports of hardwood pulp while decreasing its purchases from the subject firm. Conclusion After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that the James River Corporation workers in old Town, Maine were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with hardwood pulp producer at James River Corporation in Old Town, Maine. ``All workers of James River corporation in Old Town, Maine who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after April 5, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.'' Signed at Washington, D.C., this 22nd day of November 1994 Victor J. Trunzo, Program manager, Policy and Reemployment Services Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.
