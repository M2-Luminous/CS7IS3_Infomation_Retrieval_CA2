Takeo Nishioka, head of the group, told reporters they will cooperate with the coalition government led by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to enact the political reform bills now pending in the House of Councillors and to implement measures to stimulate the sluggish economy. Nishioka also said he will ask upper house members to join his force, noting there still are many pro-reform lawmakers in the LDP. The group is called Kaikakunokai (Reform Group). The five members are Nishioka, former chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs Research Council and a former education minister, Kunio Hatoyama, another former education minister, Shigeru Ishiba, Masamitsu Oishi and Takashi Sasagawa. Hatoyama left the LDP and became independent in June last year and the other four did so in December. Last year, more than 50 Diet members left the party, which surrendered its 38-year-old grip on power in August. The four who quit in December defied the LDP's boycott to vote with the ruling coalition to extend the Diet session for another 45 days beyond the December 15 deadline. The coalition government wants the extension to enable it to enact political reform bills which Hosokawa had vowed to make law by the year-end. The LDP now has 222 members in the 511-seat lower house. Of the seven ruling parties, the Social Democratic Party has 76 seats, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 61, Sakigake [Harbinger] and the Japan New Party a combined 53, Komeito 52, and the Democratic Socialist Party 19. The Japanese Communist Party has 15 seats, the new group five, and independents eight.
