FR941130-1-00004 FR941130-1-00001 Small Business Considerations In accordance with the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) [5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .], the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small agricultural service firms, which include handlers regulated under this order, have been defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA) [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts for the last three years of less than $5,000,000. Small agricultural producers are defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Interested persons were invited to present evidence at the hearing on the probable regulatory and informational impact of the proposed amendments on small businesses. The record indicates that handlers would not be unduly burdened by any additional regulatory requirements, including those pertaining to reporting and recordkeeping, that might result from this proceeding. The record also indicates that a majority of handlers and producers would meet the SBA definitions of small agricultural service firms and small agricultural producers, respectively. During the 1992&hyph;93 crop year, 66 handlers were regulated under Marketing Order No. 945. In addition, there were approximately 2,200 producers of potatoes in the production area. The Act requires the application of uniform rules on regulated handlers. Since handlers covered under the potato marketing order are predominantly small businesses, the order itself is tailored to the size and nature of small businesses. Marketing orders and amendments thereto, are unique in that they are normally brought about through group action of essentially small entities for their own benefit. Thus, both the RFA and the Act are compatible with respect to small entities. The proposed amendments to the order include amending: §945.20 Establishment and membership pertaining to operations of the committee, including providing seed producers representation on the committee; §945.23 Redistricting and reapportionment authorizing changes in committee size, composition, and representation; §945.30 Procedure regarding quorum requirements; and §945.42 Assessments removing a $1 per carload maximum assessment rate and allowing the committee to impose late payment and interest fees on late assessment payments and borrow monies in an extreme emergency for program administration. These proposed amendments would provide an opportunity for broader based representation on the committee and more flexibility to adjust to future changes in industry structure, potato production and financial operations. These changes are designed to enhance the administration and functioning of the order and would have negligible, if any, economic impact on small businesses. The proposal amending §945.9 Ship or handle would broaden the scope of the order by revising the definition of these terms to include the handling of potatoes in the current of commerce within the counties covered by the order's production area. This would require the inspection of all regulated shipments of potatoes for fresh market and compliance with order requirements, including grade, size, quality, pack, and payment of assessments. This proposal would improve the market for potatoes handled within the production area. This would benefit both producers and handlers because minimum grade, size and quality requirements established under the order are important to the industry in fostering consumer satisfaction, increasing the demand for Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes, and improving industry returns. The additional assessment income would improve the financial operations of the order. Any added burden on small businesses should be outweighed by the added benefits accruing to them. The proposed change to allow the rate of assessment to be based on a hundredweight of potatoes, rather than an outdated maximum amount of $1 per railroad carload, would improve the financial operations of the order and not adversely impact small businesses. This change would provide more efficient funding of order operations and activities. Fresh potato shipments have stabilized in recent years, and if costs continue to rise, the current maximum rate is likely to be insufficient to properly fund committee operating costs beyond the next few years. Another recommended change would amend §945.52 Issuance of regulations to add authority to require accurate and uniform marking and labeling of the containers. The benefits of the expected higher returns that could result from increases in buyer and consumer satisfaction due to accurate marking and labeling should outweigh any potential burden on small businesses. Another proposed amendment, to §945.80 Reports, would provide confidentiality requirements for reports submitted to the committee. This would safeguard handlers' proprietary information, including that for small businesses, without imposing any burden on them. Additionally, new §945.80 provisions would add authority for the Secretary and the committee to verify the accuracy of reports filed by handlers, and handler compliance with recordkeeping requirements. The requirement would not have a significant impact on small entities in the industry. Finally, the proposed amendments would have no significant impact or burden on small businesses' recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
