The agreement was signed by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan. Both ministers noted that the agreement, which was signed at the end of talks between the two countries' delegations, bases bilateral relations on a sound foundation. During the talks, Russia once again expressed the changes it wants to introduce with regard to the implementation of the CFE agreement and briefed Golhan on NATO's Partnership for Peace plan and the sharing of the Black Sea fleet with Ukraine. After the signing ceremony, the two ministers replied to questions by reporters. Grachev declared that Russia received approval from Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan concerning the bases it wants to establish in the Caucasus, but the installation in Azerbaijan will be an early-warning station, rather than a base. Pointing out that his country wants to deploy Russian troops in bases in the CIS countries with the approval of the relevant governments, Grachev added that this must also be ratified by the legislative organs of these countries. Golhan, in response to a question on Bosnia-Herzegovina, declared that from the beginning Turkey has been exerting efforts to put an end to the clashes, stressing that the status of the Turkish troops to be sent to Bosnia should be approached within the framework of these peaceful efforts.
