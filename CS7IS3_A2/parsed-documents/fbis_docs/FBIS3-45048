The most dramatic changes in China's tax system since 1949 were implemented January 1, and there has been confusion over the implications of the reforms, principally aimed at boosting central government revenue. Foreign firms are mainly concerned with the fate of the preferential corporate-tax rates they have enjoyed as a result of China's push to attract foreign investment in recent years. "The preferential treatment already extended to foreign investors in terms of their corporate income tax will remain unchanged," state administration of taxation director Jin Xin told a news conference here. The preferential 15 percent income-tax rate is for foreign-funded firms operating in China's special economic zones, coastal economic and technological development areas and Shanghai's special Pudong industrial zone. The new tax reforms abolish the old unified industrial and commercial tax on sales, replacing it with a unified corporate-tax rate of 33 percent. A new value-added tax (VAT) of 17 percent on most products has also gone into effect. Luxury goods, such as tobacco, alcohol and cars, now carry a stiff 45 percent excise tax in addition to the VAT. While the reforms will inevitably bring some changes to the tax bills of foreign-invested enterprises, Jin said, he stressed that they primarily involved a restructuring of the taxation system rather than a blanket tax hike. "The majority of foreign-funded enterprises will have a similar tax burden before and after the current reform," he said. Jin also outlined a special policy for refunds to foreign firms whose tax payments increased as a result of the changes. While the new taxes are still being levied, any resulting additional tax burden will be refunded for the duration of those firms' existing contracts over a maximum period of five years, Jin said. However, within those five years--or until their contract expires--"they have to transform their operational mechanisms, improve their economic efficiency and create conditions so as to compete with domestic enterprises" at the same tax rate, Jin said. The special policy will only apply to foreign-investment projects approved before January 1. Jin admitted that during the transitional five-year period, foreign-funded firms that set up in China before and after January 1 would operate on a different tax scale, but added that it was normal for a dividing line to be drawn somewhere. Jin also said there were no immediate plans to introduce production-related reductions in the amount of VAT paid by foreign firms purchasing equipment in China. Some foreign companies have expressed concern that the proposed system makes no provisions for reducing VAT payments in the long term as exist in other countries. However, Jin added that such provisions could be introduced at a later stage if they proved reasonable and feasible.
