"If we allow them in, it would certainly offend North Korea and have an adverse impact on overall inter-Korean relations," a Foreign Ministry official said Saturday. Russian Vice Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov said in New Delhi Friday that if Seoul agreed, Russia would send all escaped North Korean loggers to South Korea. The ministry official said that if South Korea allowed the escaped loggers to come, it would set off an avalanche of would-be asylum seekers, a development certain to alarm the Pyongyang regime. President Kim Yong-sam said Thursday that about 90 North Korean loggers had applied at the South Korean Embassy in Moscow for asylum in South Korea. "But we are not accepting them under a policy not to offend North Korea, and there will be no change in this policy for a considerable period of time," Kim said. The ministry official said that accepting North Korean loggers at this stage would involve a set of complicated problems. In addition to offending Pyongyang, he said, there would be the problem of raising funds for their resettlement, of handling outlaws among the escaped loggers, and of similarly accepting loggers who manage to enter China. "We must cope with the question prudently and flexibly from a far-reaching viewpoint in consideration of future developments in inter-Korean relations," an official at the National Unification Board said.
