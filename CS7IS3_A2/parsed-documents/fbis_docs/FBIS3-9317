Deputy Rakaj, who took the floor in the name of the SDP [Socialist Democratic Party] parliamentary group, said the draft budget is the main point of the government for the year 1994. But it would be better, Rakaj said, if we should have approved the platform of the economic reform before the draft budget. That is because the platform defines the medium government program until 1996. Deputy Angjeli, representative of the SP [Socialist Party] parliamentary group, said that the draft budget for 1994 reflects the economic and financial difficulties our country is passing through in this transformation period towards the market economy. After he made an analysis in what degree the last year budget have been realised, Mr. Angjeli explained the reasons why the SP parliamentary group gives an abstention vote. Speaking in the name of independent deputies, Deputy Pashko was in favour of the abstention, saying the budget shows Albania is going to a very social market economy. "We abstain," Pashko said, "because we are not for a such market economy." Deputy Jemin Gjana, speaking in the name of DP [Democratic Party] parliamentary group, said a special thing in this draft law is that discussions, debates, and the confrontations between parliamentary members, between parliamentary commissions and groups have lasted relatively long showing their responsibility. No one, excepting criticizers, can reject the achievements in the economic and financial situation, in the bank system, in gradual installing and perfecting the fiscal system, in prices and salaries policy, in privatization and investments continuation and in communication and trade development. These achievements were reached by the support of international bodies such as EU, World Bank, IMF, G-24, etc. Deputy Gjana mentioned two essential elements of the state budget for 1994: expenses for social support will be risen at a level of 45 per cent covering 30 per cent of the total expenses compared to 25 per cent of the last year. The second element in the budget is the raise of the public investments. Their program raises by 15 per cent for 1994 covering about 8.5 per cent of the GDP [expansion unknown]. "The budget presented to us is a program which expresses all the endeavours for building the market economy and the legal state," Mr. Gjana said in conclusion. Then Pjeter Arbnori, speaker of the parliament, invited deputies to vote for approving the draft project. Taking in consideration the remarks and the proposals of parliamentary respective commissions and deputies, the draft law on the state budget for 1994 was approved in principle, article by article, and a majority of votes.
