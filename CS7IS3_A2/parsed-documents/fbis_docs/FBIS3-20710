FBIS3-20710 "jpeer007__s94039" JPRS-EER-94-007-S Document Type:JPRS Document Title:East Europe SUPPLEMENT 2 March 1994 SLOVENIA Factional Strife in Party of Democratic Action 94P20374A 94P20374A Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] The 28 January issue of the Ljubljana daily DELO carries on page 6 a report by "Correspondent" Zdravko Latal titled "Silajdzic Severely Criticized" based on a one-page-long article published in the Bosnian paper BOSNJACKI AVAZ and written by that paper's director and owner, Fahrudin Radoncic. According to the DELO article, Radoncic accuses Haris Silajdzic of having failed to "establish Bosnia-Herzegovina diplomacy" while he was foreign minister in the Bosnian Government and questions his qualifications for his current post of prime minister, since "he has no background in economics." Radoncic claims that Silajdzic's government has done nothing to improve living conditions, which he describes as its most important task other than defense. According to Radoncic, Silajdzic still prefers the "diplomatic salon life" to solving the everyday problems of survival in Sarajevo and the "free territories." As reported in DELO, Radoncic also disparages Silajdzic's education (a religious school in Sarajevo, a theological school in Libya, and a doctorate from the Pristina University), and his work experiences (a translator for Belgrade businesses in Libya, a chief of cabinet a former reis-ul-ulema). As for Silajdzic's private life, DELO writes, Radoncic disapproves of the fact that Silajdzic's family has been sent to live safely in Turkey, while his sister was appointed ambassador to Turkey and later to Pakistan. Silajdzic himself, DELO cites Radoncic as writing, has never visited the front lines or liberated areas, and he tries to "overshadow" President Alija Izetbegovic. DELO correspondent Latal comments that while some of this criticism is not new, it is "most specific and severe." The logical question, Latal observes, is who stands behind BOSNJACKI AVAZ and Radoncic. According to some sources, Latal reports, Radoncic's supporters can be found among older Party of Democratic Action members or the party hardliners who favored Dr. Edib Bukvic for the post of prime minister and also opposed three new members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency: Kljuic, Komsic, and, in particular, Durakovic. Other sources, Latal states, claim that both Silajdzic and BOSNJACKI AVAZ are supported by foreign powers. Latal cites Dr. Ejup Ganic, a member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, as a supporter of BOSNJACKI AVAZ and another plausible source of the criticism of Silajdzic. Ganic first publicly attacked Prime Minister Silajdzic for the "lack of a government program." He then denounced the Geneva Declaration as a "continuation of the Karadjordjevo agreement" between Presidents Milosevic and Tudjman. Latal notes that Silajdzic, on the other hand, had assessed the Geneva Declaration positively, saying that it could lead to "mutual recognition." But most people believe, Latal concludes, that BOSNJACKI AVAZ is supported by Sefer Halilovic, former Bosnia-Herzegovina army chief and "the strong Sandzak lobby." Radoncic and Halilovic are both from Sandzak. Radoncic used to be Halilovic's spokesman before Silajdzic, as prime minister, purged the army of all commanders involved in war crimes and other criminal activities. Latal cites rumors that Halilovic will be rehabilitated soon and receive the rank of general. According to DELO, Silajdzic has yet to prove himself. Among other things, he is being attacked in Sarajevo for his "futile" meetings with Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the Srpska assembly.
