Grants by the American AID [Agency for International Development] organization have also helped. Such projects have proved to be successful in all parts of the world when supervised by community institutions such as businessmen's associations. As we have said before, the Alexandria Businessmen's Association's project has made it possible to provide 20,000 jobs. The association's sense of the dimensions of the unemployment problem is leading it to make an effort to carry such a project to all the governorates of Egypt. Furthermore, AID has decided to implement five similar projects in five governorates. The Alexandria Businessmen's Association has volunteered to make every effort to provide the necessary training and bring its experience to the governorates in which the new projects will be implemented. Training has already begun. Transferring this expertise is necessary for all the associations that are going to take charge of these projects--especially for the leaders and cadres working in such a project. Transferring the systems followed in accounts, information extraction, monitoring by highly developed computer programs, and training on the record-keeping cycle of all operations, as well as management systems, incentive systems, legal systems and compensations for workers, surely will save much time and effort. It will enable the new projects to achieve positive results in the shortest possible time. This will make us very happy in Alexandria because of our sense of having given something to the country. Perhaps private, nongovernmental associations will begin to implement such a project in all governorates of Egypt. We know that AID has a great desire to establish and fund such important projects as soon as an organized group of businessmen exists eager to serve its country and ready to shoulder this responsibility in one of the governorates. The Alexandria Businessmen's Association currently manages a project funded at 39 million pounds by the Social Fund in cooperation with Bank Misr. The project's goal is to establish new enterprises for graduates of universities and technical institutes and schools. Many young people frequently ask about the terms for obtaining these loans. The terms, briefly stated, involve presenting a good study that explains how the enterprise can succeed and the existence of a place where it can be implemented. The association has already begun implementing the project. Four months ago, some 3,000 young people submitted studies in which they applied for loans to begin new businesses. About 2,500 applications were rejected due to lack of places for the young people to set up their desired enterprises. The rest of the applications are proceeding well. The association, in cooperation with Bank Misr, is allocating about 1 million pounds a month in loans to young people who fulfill the terms in many areas of industry, agriculture, livestock fattening, and services. Those responsible for the project at the Alexandria Businessmen's Association are determining by experience the problems that small industries confront in development. The association has a number of observations about these problems. The most important of them are: 1. We all know that the bulk of the unemployed are concentrated in old cities and zones of haphazard development. Because these small industries depend for their marketing on members of the community, they cannot survive if they are moved outside the community. Decisions now being implemented aim at moving all industries away from the cities in order to improve environmental conditions. This is being done at a time when alternative locations have not been prepared near the communities, so that the industries can expand in them without restrictions. These decisions prevent any small enterprise from making any change in the place it uses or rearranging it so that it can expand. Thus, they aim at combatting expansion, while Egypt's welfare demands that these enterprises develop and expand. Also, these decisions provide a golden opportunity for the bureaucrats charged with overseeing them to control these industries and thus create an unstable condition for them. We all know that on New York's Seventh Avenue there are tall buildings completely filled with small factories that produce everything imaginable. We see the same story in Hong Kong and Taiwan. In many countries there are hundreds of large buildings containing factories of all specialties located inside the cities and on all streets. We must also remember that the electric motors that run these industries have developed so that they no longer produce any noise. The laws allow the installation of air conditioners everywhere. They are run by electric motors whose horsepower often is much greater than what some handicraft industries use. Certainly, the unemployment problem is so serious that it must take priority over the environment problem, especially in the conditions that the country is currently experiencing. Implementing such decisions in the old cities not only hinders the development of small industries, it prevents the possible establishment of new industries. Studies estimate that at least 50,000 new enterprises could start every year in these communities. Currently they cannot be established, and their [potential] owners become not only a force that is unemployed but one that is destructive to society. We hope that all the decisions will be changed so that they promote the expansion of small industries or the establishment of new enterprises in the old cities, as long as they do not emit noise, gases, fumes, or odors that harm the environment. Other than this, it is not right to place any restrictions. The pioneering productive families project that the Ministry of Social Affairs is sponsoring under the leadership of its minister, Dr. Amal 'Uthman, depends on employing these families in productive activities inside the residence where they live, thereby transforming the families into a self-supporting productive force that can contribute to economic development. It is not right for decisions to be implemented that go counter to this national strategy. 2. Encouraging the establishment of light, labor-intensive, nonpolluting industries is one of the most important ways of dealing with the unemployment problem in Egypt. We all know that high wages for workers in the advanced countries are causing such industries to be closed in those countries and move to countries that enjoy cheap labor. Egypt can benefit greatly from putting millions of workers to work in these industries. The most important of them are the ready-made clothing industry, handmade carpets, electronics, and assembling industries. Any ready-made clothing or electronics factory can easily absorb a thousand workers. These industries do not lend themselves to establishment in new communities because the operation of transporting thousands of workers daily from the old cities where there is an accumulated work force to the new cities is a very costly operation that tires the workers and affects their productivity. Such enterprises must be established in old cities, villages, and zones of haphazard development, so as to turn unemployed workers in those areas into a healthy, productive force. Unfortunately, this principle conflicts with the decisions now being implemented. Such industries therefore are not spreading or expanding to absorb thousands of workers because the operation of transporting workers every day increases the industry's cost and reduces the workers' productivity. Furthermore, these industries need to enjoy the same years of tax exemption set in the new communities. We hope this problem will be studied seriously. We ask officials to visit the clothing factory in al-Badrashayn. It employs 3,000 workers, and all of its production is earmarked for export to the United States. It is an example of what we are talking about. 3. When it issued the recent unified tax law, the government paid attention to giving a five-year tax exemption to new enterprises funded by the Social Fund. In the People's Assembly committee that held hearings on the aforementioned law, the Alexandria Businessmen's Association proposed that the same exemption be applied to the loans that any registered nonprofit association grants to combat unemployment, just as is done with the Social Fund. We hope that this view will be followed in the future. These are some observations that will help with formulating the necessary plans to deal with the problem of unemployment.
