The EZLN argues that their participation is a matter of interest to them, as one of these candidates will be president of the Republic. The EZLN indicated they want the presidential candidates to make a commitment to respect the agreements that might be reached with the current Mexican Government. Some presidential candidates have already replied that they will attend the meeting while others will do so through delegates. Now, back to the communique sent last night by members of the Indian revolutionary clandestine committee, the EZLN General Command, to the presidential candidates of National Action Party [PAN]; Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI]; Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD]; Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party [PFCRN]; Labor Party [PL]; Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution [PARM]; Mexican Green Ecologist Party; and the Popular Socialist Party [PPS]. The UNO [National Opposition Union] was not mentioned because it is not registered. We now go to Congress where Reporter Juan Carlos Atoyo went to obtain the so-called opposition party's response to the EZLN invitation. [Atoyo] The presidential candidates from the PRI, PARM, Mexican Green Ecologist Party, PL, and PFCRN, have already accepted the EZLN invitation to attend or to send delegates to the encounter with Manuel Camacho Solis, special commissioner for peace and reconciliation, in Chiapas. Meanwhile, the PPS rejected the invitation and the PAN will issue its response through its national executive committee which is analyzing the EZLN invitation. [Announcer] At first, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos [PAN candidate] had stated that he considered this invitation to be inconvenient. [Atoyo] That is right. From the beginning, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos said the invitation was inconvenient, nevertheless, he left this decision to be made by his party's national executive committee. This has also been confirmed. I will go one by one on what each political party said: PRD candidate Cuahutemoc Cardenas Solorzano said he accepted this invitation as this guarantees continuity in the commitments to be made during the pacification dialogue in Chiapas. When disclosing his candidate's reply, PRD leader Porfirio Munoz Ledo said the following: [Begin Munoz Ledo recording] This is an invitation addressed to the party candidates. I have consulted with our candidate, Engineer Cardenas, who is in favor, as I am, of accepting the invitation. Of course, I have called for a meeting of the party executive committee to define the terms of our participation and to appoint our representative. [end recording] [Atoyo] Meanwhile, PARM candidate Alvaro Perez Trevino said he officially accepted the invitation. Nevertheless, he sent a message to the EZLN to issue a personal and direct invitation for him to directly accept. In the interim, the PAN said that in a few hours it will disclose its position. Here is what PAN deputy candidate Gabriel Jimenez Remus said: [Begin Jimenez recording] From a positive point of view, this invitation is of interest. Theoretically speaking, no one knows who will be the winner on 21 August. It is obvious that the EZLN needs to talk to or engage in a dialogue with the presidential candidates. I have no doubt the actions that the federal government takes and the participation of the diverse commissions will lead to the adoption of emergency actions to benefit Chiapas. There is no doubt, however, that these actions will have a bearing on the coming administration. [end recording] [Atoyo] Meanwhile, PL candidate Cecilia Soto said that the EZLN invitation was another sign of this armed group's goodwill. Soto said she accepted the invitation but it would be her party's leadership that would decide if she would attend personally or if a delegation would be sent. In the interim, PPS candidate Marcela Lombardo declined this invitation outright. Lombardo said that above all she did not accept the invitation because she did not agree with the attitude assumed by the EZLN to take up arms to solve diverse problems. Meanwhile, the UNO members indicated they had no comment to make given that their candidate has not been invited to the dialogue. [Atoyo] In another turn of events, today during a meeting of the Chamber of Deputies' permanent commission, the Chiapas issue undoubtedly had to be brought up. The debate concentrated on permanent attacks between the PRI and the PRD. The first to take the podium was PRI Deputy Laura Lizia Gaza Galindo who launched severely criticized the PRD. Gaza Galindo said that the PRD has called on the EZLN to form an alliance to struggle; it speaks about laws and then turns around and supports the use of weapons to achieve goals, she noted. After indicating that the call to violence is a way of violating the peace and democracy agreement signed by all the presidential candidates, Laura Lizia Gaza Galindo challenged the PRD members as follows: [Begin Gaza Galindo recording] They [PRD] want to break the political agreement signed by all the political forces. This implicitly means: Either they accept we have won on 21 August or there will be violence. They will get involved [word indistinct] through the armed struggle. All of these comments have been made by their top party leaders, who appear to take as their own a declaration of war; the EZLN's declaration was one of war. To Mexico's good fortune, this declaration seems to have been left behind. Is the PRD taking over this declaration of war as its own? What is this all about? Does this mean that the PRD will become the EZLN's political arm? Or does this mean that the EZLN becomes the armed body of the PRD? [end recording] Afterward, PRD Deputy Jose de Jesus Martinez Campos launched his reply. Martinez Campos said that his party's call for the EZLN members to join the party seeks to incorporate them into the struggle through democratic means, by granting them representation. The PRD deputy said they had the right to their differences but to talk of the situation that could arise on 21 August if the votes are not respected has serious implications, as this is closely tied to the Chiapas case. [Begin Martinez Campos recording] If we do not guarantee that the election will be honest, that votes will be respected and well counted, that these issues can be discussed, the outcome of these 1994 elections will not be legitimate. Then, there will not be an EZLN but many civilian outbreaks and maybe unwanted violent outbreaks if this right is not guaranteed to be secure. [end recording] [Atoyo] This is what happened today at the Chamber of Deputies during the session of the Congress of the Union permanent commission's session and the political parties' reaction to the EZLN invitation to participate in the first dialogue of the special commission for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas with Manuel Camacho Solis.
