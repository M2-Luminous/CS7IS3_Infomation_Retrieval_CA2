Negotiators, observers, and mediators have been observing a pause since yesterday afternoon, and the talks will only resume tomorrow. It seems that Chief Blondin Beye wants the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] to change its stand. He wants a more responsible UNITA to assume a position that meets the highest aspirations of the Angolan population. Our correspondent Pedro Manuel reports: [Begin Manuel recording] Blondin Beye is still trying to approach the two delegations, which until now maintained distant positions on the national police issue. It seems that Beye is still making efforts to persuade UNITA in particular to review its position, which is not supported by anyone. The fact that Jonas Savimbi's men remain hardened in their position leads analysts in Lusaka to reiterate their view that UNITA may break this negotiating round at any time. The talks resume on 17 January, and the mediators and observers will continue working on approaching the negotiating teams to begin discussing specific principles. [end recording]
