During the visit by representatives of the Nordic Battalion, the aggressor fired more than 30 howitzer shells on the town itself." The shelling continued overnight at regular intervals and "a true cannonade started at 0400 this morning. From all directions and all types of arms, the aggressor has been attacking the lines of our fighters in Novalici, Vida, the industrial zone, Sibovac, Ukici, and Mionica. The tanks from Osmanovici, Gornje Krecane, Bucje, and Huskici are devastating the civilian installations in the town and the settlements on the outskirts. At the same time, projectiles from the howitzers of the largest-type calibers are pounding the town center. The defense positions are being attacked with mortars and it is estimated that some 800 projectiles have landed on the free Gradacac territory." However, as the report says, "our fighters will not allow any surprises. Despite all these attacks, the defense lines are firm and stable." "The enemy offensive on the defense lines of the 109th Doboj and 111th Gracanica Brigades has reached its climax in its ninth day," Izudin Durakovic says about the situation yesterday, claiming that "more than 1,000 projectiles from tanks, howitzers, mortars, recoiless guns, and antiaircraft arms" have been fired in the process. He reports that Gracanica itself was shelled in the afternoon, and continues to say that "although only a few hours are left before the agreed cease-fire is supposed to take effect, the behavior of Karadzic's criminals early this morning implies that the Chetniks are continuing with their old practice of saying one thing at the negotiating table and doing another on the ground." Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko that "as the moment when the agreed cease-fire is supposed to come in effect on the Bosnia-Herzegovina fronts, the attacks of the Serbian aggressor on the Brcko battlefield are intensifying. The enemy's artillery attacks, accompanied by the intensified activities of the enemy infantry, directed at the positions of Brcko's defense, have continued in the course of the previous night." As he says, "the fighters of the 108th Motorized and 108th Infantry Brigades and the affiliated units of the 2d Corps did not carry out combat activities last night." Deronjic also notes the arrival of Serbian reinforcements and the regrouping of Serbian troops in the area overnight.
