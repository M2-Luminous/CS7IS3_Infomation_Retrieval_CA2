It is impossible to speak about NATO countries as of potential partners and allies and in a situation when they have to take a complicated decision to distance itself from them, Zieleniec told the Czech Television station NOVA. He said not only air strikes were concerned but an ultimatum that should lead to separation of the warring sides. "Sarajevo is a town experiencing awful sufferings, the town which is being strangled. I believe this action could lead to Sarajevo being relieved and that is why I support it," Zieleniec said. On February 10, the NATO Council approved a communique giving a ten-day ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs and Muslims to withdraw their heavy weapons and put them under UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force] control, otherwise they would be subject to air strikes.
