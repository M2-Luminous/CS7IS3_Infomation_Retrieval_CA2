FR941122-2-00095 FR941122-2-00073 IV The staff has reviewed ComEd's submittal regarding the Appendix J test interval exemption request. Based on the above, the staff concludes that the licensee's corrective action and administrative leakage limit have reduced the likelihood of excessive leakage during the proposed extension of the Type A test interval. Further, considering the intent of the 18-month interval cap and its relation to longer fuel cycles, the staff finds that the safety benefit to be derived from performing a Type A test at 18 months rather than 26 months does not justify the hardship of a forced plant shutdown. Therefore, the staff finds that the requested Type A interval extension should be granted. This is a one-time exemption from the 18-month Type A test interval requirements as prescribed in 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, and is intended to be in effect until July 14, 1995. In its October 28, 1994, letter, ComEd also identified special circumstances. As discussed above, the exemption request is for a short duration relative to the 18-month requirement. This meets a criterion for a special circumstance per 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v), i.e., ``The exemption would provide only temporary relief from the applicable regulation and the licensee or applicant has made good faith efforts to comply with the regulation.'' V Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), that (1) this exemption is authorized by law and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest, and (2) the Exemption would provide only temporary relief from the applicable regulation and the licensee has made good faith efforts to comply with the regulation. Therefore, the Commission hereby grants an exemption as described in Section III above from 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Section III.A.6.(b), to the extent that the 18-month interval for performing the Type A test may be extended for 242 days until July 14, 1995, on a one-time only basis, for Dresden, Unit 2. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32 the Commission has determined that the granting of this Exemption will have no significant impact on the environment (59 FR 56095). This exemption is effective upon issuance. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 10th day of November 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Jack W. Roe, Director, Division of Reactor Projects_III/IV, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
