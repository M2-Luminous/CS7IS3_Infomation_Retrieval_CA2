He described the Israelis as liars and said: I know and Egypt knows that the Israelis presented forged maps during the Taba talks. Qaddumi noted that one of the reasons he expressed reservations over the Declaration of Principle is his confidence that Israel would not carry out its promises, as he put it. Qaddumi was talking to reporters upon arrival in Cairo last night. Qaddumi will meet with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa today and then leave for Amman tomorrow to resume coordination with Jordan in view of King Husayn's statement in which he clearly voiced resentment over the absence of serious coordination. Within this context, Qaddumi regarded talk about a Jordanian-Palestinian confederation to be premature. Discussing this at present would complicate matters, as he put it. It is worth mentioning that King Husayn has recently said that he has asked Yasir 'Arafat to drop the word confederation from his lexicon.
