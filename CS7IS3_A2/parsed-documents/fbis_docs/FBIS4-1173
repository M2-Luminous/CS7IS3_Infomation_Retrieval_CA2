He is in hiding in neighboring country. Robin White got in touch with him, and asked him if he thought he had a role in sorting out the mess that Rwandans are in: [Begin recording] [Twangiramungu] Of course yes. Well, as far as Rwandans are concerned, most of them have respected the peace agreement. Therefore, I think I still have a role to play. Our intention was to have this broad-based transitional government set in place. But as you are probably informed, we had some delay tactics initiated mainly by the political party called the MRND [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development] which is the political party of the late president. What they really wanted was to wage another war against the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and probably win it. But it appeared that they are not going to win this war. Secondly, they did not want what we call and what is contained in this peace aagreement, the power sharing. And we believe that this power sharing is the only solution to the situation we have in Rwanda. [White] So, what you yourself propose should happen now? [Twangiramungu] Well, what I do propose, is not a military solution. What I propose is of course a political solution. And a political solution requires that RPF meets these military officers and decides the cease-fire. But to get to this cease-fire, of course, there are some preconditions. In certain place, they have to accept that... [pauses] to denounce this government which is self-proclaimed. Second, they have to (?disband) the Presidential Guard. [White] It sounds to me as if you have rather more in common with the rebel RPF than you do with the other side now? [Twangiramungu] Well, it is not to having common views. I believe it is a question of being practical and being pragmatic with regard to the situation which prevails. After all, who started these incidents which have cost us a lot? This is the Presidential Guards. [White] Will you be going to the Arusha peace meeting? [Twangiramungu] Well, if I am invited, yes I will. And I think it would be better for me to go there and give my views on this particular issue. And I am still insisting that I be invited to go to Arusha. [end recording]
