Certificate of State Approval (FORM B) An application from a State or local court must include a copy of FORM B signed by the State's Chief Justice or Chief Judge, the director of the designated agency, or the head of the designated council. The signature denotes that the proposed project has been approved by the State's highest court or the agency or council it has designated. It denotes further that if funding for the project is approved by the Institute, the court or the specified designee will receive, administer, and be accountable for the awarded funds. 3. Budget Forms (FORM C or C1) Applicants may submit the proposed project budget either in the tabular format of FORM C or in the spreadsheet format of FORM C1. Applicants requesting more than $100,000 are strongly encouraged to use the spread-sheet format. If the proposed project period is for more than a year, a separate form should be submitted for each year or portion of a year for which grant support is requested. In addition to FORM C or C1, applicants must provide a detailed budget narrative providing an explanation of the basis for the estimates in each budget category. (See section VII.D.) Applications for a package grant must include a separate budget and budget narrative for each project included in the proposed package, as well as a combined budget that reflects the total costs of the entire package. If funds from other sources are required to conduct the project, either as match or to support other aspects of the project, the source, current status of the request, and anticipated decision date must be provided. 4. Assurances (FORM D) This form lists the statutory, regulatory, and policy requirements and conditions with which recipients of Institute funds must comply. 5. Disclosure of Lobbying Activities This form requires applicants other than units of State or local government to disclose whether they, or another entity that is part of the same organization as the applicant, have advocated a position before Congress on any issue, and to identify the specific subjects of their lobbying efforts. (See section X.D.) B. Project Abstract The abstract should highlight the purposes, goals, methods and anticipated benefits of the proposed project. It should not exceed one single-spaced page on 8&hyph;1/2 by 11 inch paper. C. Program Narrative The program narrative for an application proposing a single project should not exceed 25 double-spaced pages on 8&hyph;1/2 by 11 inch paper. The program narrative for an application requesting a package grant for more than one project should not exceed 40 double-spaced pages on 8&hyph;1/2 by 11 inch paper. Margins must not be less than 1 inch, and type no smaller than 12-point and 12 cpi must be used. The page limit does not include the forms, the abstract, the budget narrative, and any appendices containing resumes and letters of cooperation or endorsement. Additional background material should be attached only if it is essential to obtaining a clear understanding of the proposed project. Numerous and lengthy appendices are strongly discouraged. The program narrative should address the following topics: 1. Project Objectives A clear, concise statement of what the proposed project is intended to accomplish. In stating the objectives of the project, applicants should focus on the overall programmatic objective (e.g., to enhance understanding and skills regarding a specific subject, or to determine how a certain procedure affects the court and litigants) rather than on operational objectives (e.g., provide training for 32 judges and court managers, or review data from 300 cases). 2. Program Areas to be Covered A statement which lists the program areas set forth in the State Justice Institute Act, and, if appropriate, the Institute's Special Interest program categories that are addressed by the proposed projects.
