FR941230-0-00058 FR941230-0-00011 In 1992, 112 visits were made by vessels to the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating beyond the EEZ. The most recent data available from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers concerning Hudson River vessel traffic reveals that vessels operating on the Hudson River after operating beyond the EEZ are primarily foreign importer vessels. Vessels carrying cargo, such as vessels engaged in importing, are generally not carrying ballast water. These vessels do not have to comply with the regulations. Vessels carrying ballast, but not discharging it, are only subject to the recordkeeping requirements. The Coast Guard has identified no vessels that have actually discharged ballast into the Hudson River. Therefore, the only aspect of the regulations that these vessels will be subject to is the recordkeeping requirements of 33 CFR 151.1516. It is estimated that it takes one half hour to complete. At the cost of $35.00 per half hour and assuming 120 visits by vessels subject to these regulations, the annual cost will be $4,200. Small Entities No comments were received on the affect of these regulations on small entities. Owners of vessels that will be engaging in ballast water management in the affected area are large corporations. No small entities have been identified as being affected. The economic affect on all entities will be minimal. No U.S. vessels have been identified as being subject to the regulations. The total cost per vessel has been determined to be $35 per visit for each vessel with a total annual cost in 1995 of $4,200 for all vessels. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rule contains collection-of-information requirements. The Coast Guard has submitted the requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), and OMB has approved them. The section number is ยง151.1516 and the corresponding OMB approval number is OMB Control Number 2115&hyph;0598. Federalism
