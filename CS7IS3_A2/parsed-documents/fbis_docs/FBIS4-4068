[Li] Zhejiang is situated in China's southeastern coastal region. It has 43 million people living in an area of about 100,000 square km. Historically speaking, Zhejiang was one of the areas in China that is relatively rich and well-developed in terms of its economy. [passage omitted on the history of Zhejiang's economic development] Thanks to the adoption of the policy of reform and opening to the outside world following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Zhejiang has achieved great economic development. [passage omitted on progress in the eighties and nineties] Notwithstanding a weak industrial foundation, a lack of mineral resources, and limited arable land, Zhejiang developed rapidly. Zhejiang's rapid development can be attributed to two major reasons. First, Zhejiang benefited from Deng Xiaoping's policy of reform and opening up. Second, Zhejiang enjoys unique conditions for developing its economy. [passage omitted on Zhejiang's superiority in development] [CHUNG KUO SHI PAO] What about the current operations of the Qinshan nuclear power plant? [Li] The Qinshan nuclear power plant was the first nuclear power plant designed and built by China. Its current electricity-generating capacity is 300,000 kilowatt hours [kwh]. A report prepared by experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency following their inspection of the Qinshan nuclear power plant in 1989 testified to the safety and reliability of this nuclear power plant in the areas of design, machinery equipment, and installation. The Qinshan nuclear power plant was designed with three protective layers. The operation of the nuclear power plant has been normal following two years of electricity generation. [CHUNG KUO SHI PAO] The Qinshan nuclear power plant is located at Hangzhou Bay, which is a densely populated area. Was this factor taken into consideration when making the decision to build this nuclear power plant? Were there objections from the masses and cadres about building this nuclear power plant? [Li] The Qinshan nuclear power plant is located at Hangzhou Bay, which is an area between Hangzhou and Shanghai that is known for its economic development and for its dense population. At the beginning, the masses did harbor some misgivings about the nuclear power plant, but following our explanations, local cadres and the masses realized that their safety could be guaranteed. We also told the local cadres and the masses that nuclear power is a form of power generation that is relatively safe and that produces less pollution. Therefore, we did not encounter problems with the cadres and masses over the construction of the nuclear power plant. The state plans to go ahead with the second-stage project of installing another two power-generating units, with each of them being capable of generating 600,000 kwh of electricity. I have visited the nuclear power plant several times. It is protected on the outside by a layer of cement. Unlike the former USSR's Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which looked like a workshop at an ordinary factory, our nuclear power plant is enveloped by a very thick layer of cement. Even if an accident should occur, it would not endanger the safety of the staff at the nuclear power plant and the masses who live near it because we have meticulously formulated accident- prevention and safety measures. Zhejiang is preparing to build an additional nuclear power plant. Its site has been selected at Sanmen Bay. Basically, the state has decided to build more nuclear power plants at the end of this century and in the beginning of next century by introducing foreign funds and by pooling domestic funds. The new nuclear power plants that are under consideration will be bigger than the Qinshan plant. Because there are many nearby islands, it is a rather ideal place to build several more nuclear power plants. [passage omitted on compulsory education, introduction of foreign funds, housing] [CHUNG KUO SHI PAO] Many people from Zhejiang went to live in Taiwan [after the communist takeover of China]. Therefore, there are many people in Taiwan who have relatives in Zhejiang. We also know that many Taiwan fishermen operate near the Zhoushan archipelago. Could you tell us how Zhejiang has developed relations with Taiwan? [Li] When talking about the Zhejiang-Taiwan relationship, people in Zhejiang can lay claim to many top honors. For instance, first place goes to Zhejiang for having the most people in the country who emigrated to Taiwan; one estimate puts the number of them at 200,000. Zhejiang also tops the nation for having the most people with relatives in Taiwan; that number is estimated at 400,000. Another No. 1 rank for Zhejiang is in the number of well- educated people who emigrated to Taiwan. They were mostly people from military, political, and commercial circles. Of course, there are historical reasons behind these numbers. Zhejiang holds another top title of attracting the greatest number of fishermen from Taiwan to the East China Sea fishing zone, to Zhejiang's coastal areas, to receive supplies, and to seek refuge from typhoons. Over the years, we have received some 22,000 Taiwan fishing boats carrying about 150,000 people. We have also taken advantage of our superiority to actively attract Taiwan capital to Zhejiang. Taiwan accounts for roughly 30 percent of all foreign capital invested in Zhejiang. Hong Kong still tops foreign investors in Zhejiang. There is a strong presence in Zhejiang of Hong Kong businessmen who are of Ningbo origin. Some 1,100 Taiwan-funded enterprises have invested $2.4 billion in Zhejiang. Because it is difficult to identify some of the Taiwan-funded enterprises, we tend to consider them foreign-funded enterprises, not Taiwan-funded ones. I have met a lot of the friends from Taiwan. I got the feeling that most of them, whether they are upper- or middle-class or businessmen, want more cooperation and exchanges between the two sides of the strait. Another thing that struck me is that most of the friends from Taiwan are very astute and are rather pragmatic. The younger generation is particularly well-educated. I should also say that most of the Taiwan-funded enterprises are well-managed. [CHUNG KUO SHI PAO] We know there are many Taiwan fishermen operating in the East China fishing zone and near the Zhoushan archipelago. Are there many fishing disputes? How do you handle these disputes? [Li] Many Taiwan fishermen fish in the East China fishing zone. Many people from Zhejiang work aboard Taiwan fishing boats. Because Zhejiang has a good fishing foundation and because the labor quality of Zhejiang fishermen is rather high, Taiwan fishing boats like to hire fishermen from our Zhejiang. Generally speaking, the relationship between Zhejiang and Taiwan fishermen is good. We have set up Taiwan compatriot reception centers along coastal areas for Taiwan fishermen who come to fish and who seek supplies. The greatest number of and the largest Taiwan compatriot reception centers can be found at Shaoshan Bay, near Ningbo. I have been there. The facilities there are quite good. There are hospitals, rest areas, and places that supply reasonably priced diesel oil and nonstaple foods. The management of the reception centers is also good. In recent years, Zhejiang's coastal areas have received a total of 150,000 Taiwan fishermen and have treated some 2,000 injured fishermen and some 300 seriously ill fishermen. I once visited injured and sick Taiwan fishermen at the hospital. There were also photos and newspaper reports about their treatment at the hospital. Taiwan fishermen are generally satisfied with their reception at the reception centers. There have indeed been some small frictions and small disputes between Zhejiang and Taiwan fishermen while fishing. Sometimes disputes erupt following the collision of fishing boats and the tangling of fishing nets due to a lack of the clear definition of navigational rights of way. Some instances of small-scale trade along coastal areas also give rise to some banned pornographic publications and lowbrow and unhealthy audio and visual products and books making their way to Zhejiang. [passage omitted on Zhejiang's per capita income] [CHUNG KUO SHI PAO] Do you see a possibility of cooperation between Zhejiang and Taiwan in the areas of nuclear power generation, the disposal of nuclear waste, and in agriculture and fisheries? [Li] I should say there are great possibilities as well as bright prospects for cooperation in those areas. Because of overfishing, marine resources in the East China Sea fishing zone are gradually being depleted. But, because Zhejiang has a long coast, there are great potentials for developing aquaculture along the coast. Zhejiang fishermen sell some of their catch to Taiwan on the open sea, but most of their catch is exported to Japan and Hong Kong. If the friends from Taiwan are interested in nuclear power generation, we welcome their investment in Zhejiang. We understand that many Taiwan friends invest in Zhejiang's farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries. We welcome Taiwan investment. I believe that there are great prospects for cooperation.
