FR941130-2-00056 FR941130-2-00033 Because of the withdrawal penalties and conference membership requirements, it appears that these four agreements, when examined in connection with each other and TACA, do not provide reasonable and equal terms and conditions for readmission to TACA and do not permit these conference members to withdraw from TACA upon reasonable notice without penalty. As a result, the carrier parties appear to accomplish indirectly through the interaction of TACA and these vessel sharing agreements that which they are precluded from accomplishing directly under the 1984 Act. Now therefore, it is ordered, That pursuant to section 11 of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. 1710, the vessel sharing agreements set forth in Appendix A and their members show cause why they should not be found to be operating in violation of section 5 (b)(2) of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. 1704(b)(2), for restraining readmission to conference membership for any former vessel sharing agreement member willing to serve the particular trade or route, and, if found to be operating in violation of section 5(b)(2) of the 1984 Act, why these agreements should not be disapproved, canceled or modified by the Commission; It is further ordered, That pursuant to section 11 of the Shipping Act of 1984, the vessel sharing agreements set forth in Appendix A and their members show cause why they should not be found to be operating in violation of section 5(b)(3) of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. 1704(b)(3), for not complying with the conference membership withdrawal provisions of that section of the 1984 Act and, if found to be operating in violation of section 5(b)(3) of the 1984 Act, why these agreements should not be disapproved, canceled or modified by the Commission; It is further ordered, That should it be determined that the vessel sharing agreements and their members have operated in violation of section 5(b)(2) or 5(b)(3) of the Shipping Act of Act the matter may, pursuant to section 13 of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. 1712, be referred to an Administrative Law Judge in an appropriate proceeding to determine whether penalties should be assessed and, if so, the level of such penalties; It is further ordered, That this proceeding is limited to the submission of facts and memoranda of law, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission; It is further ordered, That the Commission's Bureau of Hearing Counsel be made a party to this proceeding; It is further ordered, That the vessel sharing agreements set forth in Appendix A and their members are named Respondents in this proceeding; It is further ordered, That any person having an interest and desiring to intervene in this proceeding shall file a petition for leave to intervene no later than January 3, 1995, in accordance with Rule 72 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 46 CFR 502.72; It is further ordered, That affidavits of fact and memoranda of law shall be filed by Respondents and any intervenors in support of the vessel sharing agreements no later than January 20, 1995. Reply affidavits and Memoranda of law shall be filed by the Bureau of Hearing Counsel and any intervenors in opposition to the vessel sharing agreements no later than February 21, 1995. Rebuttal affidavits and memoranda of law shall be filed by Respondents and inrtervenors in support of the vessel sharing agreements no later than March 3, 1995; It is further ordered, That: (a) Should any party believe that an evidentiary hearing is required, that party must submit a request for such hearing together with a statement setting forth in detail the facts to be provided, the relevance of those facts to the issues in this proceeding, a description of the evidence which would be adduced, and why affidavits of fact are not sufficient to present such evidence; (b) Should any party believe that an oral argument is required, that party must submit a request specifying the reasons therefore and why argument by memorandum is inadequate to present the party's case; and (c) Any such request for evidentiary hearing or oral argument shall be filed no later than March 10, 1995; It is further ordered, That notice of this Order to Show Cause be published in the Federal Register , and that a copy thereof be served upon Respondents;
