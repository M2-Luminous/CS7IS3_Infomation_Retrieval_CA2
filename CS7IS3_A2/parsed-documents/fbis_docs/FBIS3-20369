A railroad is now high on the list of wants of Norwegian and Russian industry and commerce. From the terminus in Nikel it is only a few kilometers to Kirkenes. Industry and commerce also want there to be more that is concrete to emerge from all the fine-sounding solemn speeches. There has been a good increase in trading cooperation since the establishment of the Barents Sea region. "We fully agree that the time for talking is now over. Now the concrete results are starting to come," said Knut Eirik Olsen, head of information at the Barents Sea Region Secretariat. The cooperation between the various regions involved takes place on several levels, from ministerial to shopkeeper level. In 1993, 134 million kroner of the Foreign Ministry's East European package totaling 416 million kroner was used to stimulate cooperation between Norway and northwestern Russia. The largest part of this money went to industrial cooperation, infrastructure projects, and environmental protection. The Foreign Ministry is intent on continuing major economic investment in regional cooperation. Kvaerner Kimek A/S, a ship repair company in Kirkenes, was an early player in the field and is among those companies that have made the most progress. Russian ships want Western maintenance and at present the company is investing 300 million kroner in a new covered shipyard installation. The company now has plans for a shipyard in Murmansk for breaking up ships and military installations. The Telecommunications Authority has also paved the way for 3,500 Norwegian telephone lines to both Murmansk and Arkhangelsk provinces. Russian companies, which want closer contacts with the West are now acquiring such links. The Russian banking system is unable to keep up with developments. A money transfer between East and West can take months, and this creates major problems for industrial cooperation. Den norske Bank and Sparebanken Nord-Norge are helping their Russian colleagues with the introduction of Western banking systems. Norwegian entrepreneurs see a possible market on the Kola Peninsula and have received project support from the Foreign Ministry. Possibilities are also seen by Agricultural Cooperation in Northern Norway, the National Association of Norwegian Reindeer-Farming Lapps, the Sea Research Institute, the State Data Processing Center, Tromso University, and many others. So far, cooperation in the field of fisheries has had the greatest volume. Half the fish landed in Finnmark in 1993 was delivered by Russian vessels. A number of fish industry companies in Tromso and Finnmark are currently becoming dependent on Russian raw materials, at the same time as Russian fishing boat operators are dependent on access to Western currency. "Everything is changing very quickly, and industrial leaders in Russia have had to adapt themselves in a relatively short period of time from communist rule to market forces," consultant Roald Johansen of Business Competence in Hammerfest said. The organization helps Norwegian industry to find cooperation partners in the East, and to avoid the worst traps: "The Russians think that the Norwegians are not concrete enough. They want quick decisions and as few solemn speeches as possible."
