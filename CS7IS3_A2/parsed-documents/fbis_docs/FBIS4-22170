Grachev asked the generals escorting him: "How many of these aircraft do we need?" The generals did not think long: "100." Of course, being used to the principle of "ask for more, they will give you less," the generals overstated the number. Nevertheless, P. Grachev promised the Ulyanovsk aircraft builders to order a dozen Ruslans for the quick response forces. But for an enterprise that is experiencing difficulties today marketing the Ruslan, even such a compartively small order would be a blessing. In this regard, it is appropriate to recall that the An-124 aircraft was created specifically for quick-response operations of a global nature for timely airlifting of heavy armament. Incidentally, when the Ruslan was being developed and put into production, the Afghan campaign was in full swing, and D. Ustinov, the minister of defense at that time, is considered the "godfather" of this aircraft. Only the events of recent years, the temporary refusal of the Ministry of Defense--the sole customer--to purchase An-124 aircraft made it possible to create the civilian Volga-Dnieper Air Transport Company, which operates aircraft with the largest carrying capacity and which gained world notoriety by transporting unique cargo on Ruslan aircraft. Grachev's plan to order An-124 transport aircraft for quick response not only confirms the thoughts expressed by I. Serebryakov in the article "Russia's Military Doctrine" (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, No 8, 1994) but also expands them in that the Ministry of Defense, possibly, is going the way of creating quick response forces of unspecified, but apparently sizable, numerical strength. As we know, the missions of quick response forces are basically punitive in nature, unlike deterrence forces. But since use of quick response forces outside the CIS is fraught with a corresponding reaction by public opinion both within and outside Russia, as well as other consequences, it is natural to ask: Why are quick response forces being created that are equipped with heavy armament, for the airlift of which the Ministry of Defense plans to order the mighty Ruslans?
