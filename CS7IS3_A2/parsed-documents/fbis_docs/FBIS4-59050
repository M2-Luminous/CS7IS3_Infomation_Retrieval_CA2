The secretary of state does not usually publish articles in the press. He may issue a statement, give a statement, or answer a question. It is also unusual for the secretary to send an article to a newspaper while he is conducting a difficult official mission and travelling between Middle Eastern capitals. The issue must have been more serious that it looks for the U.S. secretary to depart from tradition. The meanings that can be deduced from the article do not depend much on its content, which was a repeat of the cliches we hear all the time: Iraq is not implementing the UN Security Council resolutions and the sanctions must continue. The more important meaning of the article is that the U.S. State Department has found itself in a position where it had to defend a racist policy rejected by the civilized world because it violates the most basic of human rights. Starting the article with a "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia" dateline is designed to suggest that the article is in response to an Arab demand. The United States failed to give a clear answer to a specific question from Tariq 'Aziz: What measures is Iraq required to take to end the sanctions? In fact, Iraq has complied with all the UN resolutions, although they were unfair. But the United States is not interested in seeing an implementation of the UN resolutions, which were never implemented by any country besides Iraq. Instead, the United States wants to change the ruling regime in Iraq and to impose on the Iraqi people other rulers of [Ahmad] al-Jalabi's type. In his unconvincing defense of the continuation of the sanctions, Christopher admits they are causing real suffering for the Iraqi people. He, however, lays the blame on the Iraqi government's policy, as if the U.S. policy is not responsible for the continuation of the sanctions against the Iraqi people and for their elongation without any justified reason. Thousands of the weakest segments of the Iraqi society are dying because of the U.S. sanctions. These are the children, the infants, the elderly, and the sick. Iraq's pharmacies are empty of insulin for diabetics and of medicine for people with chronic problems. Aspirin is also rare. Surgery in hospitals is limited because of the lack of anesthetics. All this is a crime against humanity, unparalleled even by Nazi crimes. The continuation of the sanctions is purely an American decision. It does not infringe just on the rights of the Iraqi people, but also inflicts major damage on Turkey, Jordan, Europe, and Japan. It also offends anyone with a pan-Arab, humanitarian, and moral feeling. Trying to defend sanctions is even worse than the sanctions themselves.
