FR940805-1-00021 FR940805-1-00003 Discussion The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) received a report of an aircraft accident involving an Ayres S2R&hyph;600 aircraft, with a modified AlliedSignal, Inc. (formerly Allied-Signal, Inc., Garrett Engine Division, Garrett Turbine Engine Company, and AiResearch Manufacturing Co. of Arizona) Model TPE331&hyph;1&hyph;151A turboprop engine installed. The FAA has determined that the engine installed on the accident aircraft was a model not approved for that aircraft and was improperly configured. Maintenance on that engine was performed by Mr. Eugene E. Shanks, mechanic certificate number 1914482, the owner of Fliteline Maintenance, domestic repair station certificate number GR2R856K. Since this accident, the FAA conducted further investigation of other AlliedSignal, Inc. TPE331 series engines repaired or maintained by Mr. Eugene E. Shanks under the name of Fliteline Maintenance. On these engines, the FAA found that the requirements of some applicable airworthiness directives (AD's) had not been performed when the engine records indicated that the work had been performed, the records for life-limited turbine components indicated more useful life than the components actually had remaining, parts were installed that are not approved for aircraft use, and modifications that had been performed without approved data. In addition, the FAA has determined that the records maintained by Fliteline Maintenance on the engines it repaired, assembled, modified, or installed do not identify all of the suspect engine models and serial numbers. These conditions, if not corrected, could result in uncontained failure of turbine rotors, fire, or loss of aircraft control. Since unsafe conditions have been identified that are likely to exist or develop on other AlliedSignal, Inc. TPE331 series turboprop and TSE331 series turboshaft engines of the same type design, the proposed AD would require a check of engine records to determine if any repair, assembly, modification, or installation work was performed by Fliteline Maintenance, or Mr. Eugene E. Shanks, or his associate, Mr. Carl Ramirez, mechanic certificate number 466432551. In addition, this proposed AD would require operators to accomplish a verification procedure for life-limited turbine components and to verify that the requirements of all applicable AD's have actually been accomplished. The FAA estimates that 500 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 80 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,200,200. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption `` ADDRESSES .''
