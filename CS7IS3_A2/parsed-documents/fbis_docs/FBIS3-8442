Mr. Petre Roman, president of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD-FSN] presented this lecture, while Messrs. Dan Amedeo Lazarescu, vice president of the National Liberal Party [PNL], and Andrei Plesu, acted as collocutors. At the beginning of his lecture, Mr. Petre Roman referred to an inescapable fact: "Reform is our country's road beyond communism. Certainly, all the former communist countries are experiencing a reform process. For us and in general, reform means seeking economic, social, and political normality, a normality of mentality, day-to-day normality, and, in the final instance, normality from a historical perspective. What is at stake is seeking not only our initial normality. We also have to ensure a synchronization with developments in the Western world and our entry into today's flow of world history. This self- discovery may be achieved not because it represents a recovery, but only because it represents the key to our access to modernity. In this century, Romania has run up a deficit of modernity caused by the fierce struggle with the numerous vicissitudes of history. This deficit exists and manifests itself in institutions with hardly any power, in a faulty and often confusing operation of democracy, in acute economic inefficiency, and in the insufficient competence of the most dynamic segments of practical activity. For those who love freedom, the way of post-communist transition cannot be anything other than openly moving toward the free world and then fusing with it (...) Romania's integration into the free world is not an ideal, but a tangible stage of our hopes. Our strength lies in the fact that we are able to say what we are; and we would be more powerful today if we clearly stated what we want to be (...) "For us easterners, our mission is to reestablish and repair the thread that was broken on the eve of World War II and replaced, for almost 45 years, by communist integration with the internationalist Gulag. Our country's totalitarian past did not only mean lagging behind, but also being torn away from its times altogether. We are able to demonstrate that communist totalitarianism isolated us compared with the progress made in the free world. Because it was utopian, communism felt threatened by everything that was real and thus became obtuse and terrorizing." Referring to Romania's economic situation between the two world wars, Mr. Roman specified the following: "The statistics demonstrated that the main influence on the rhythm, proportions, and structures of the economy was exerted by the process of expanding the free market, a process that was, however, characterized by a hesitant liberalization practice." He specified that "the statistics on our country's economic situation revealed disturbing facts: Both at the end of the inter- war period, and in 1989 -- after 45 years of communism -- Romania ranked 23d out of the 24 European states. In 1989, the country's GNP was 3.5 times lower than the European average. Also in 1989, for one GNP unit Romania used to consume 10 times more prime energy than Western European countries. During the 25 years of Ceausescu's dictatorship, $230 billion was injected in our economy, which ranked 23d in Europe in terms of efficiency. Given the injection into the economy of such important sums of money, it would have been absolutely normal for economic efficiency, in general, to come close to the European average, something that was not even achieved in, let us say, the better periods of the dictatorial regime. (...) The communist regime, specifically the Ceausescu one, made Romania lose out on the great and truly revolutionary changes in Western society. I am talking of the technological revolution both in industry and agriculture of the 1960's, the revolution of inexpensive energy and the technological economizing on energy of the 1970's, and, finally, of the data processing revolution in the 1980's." For Romania's integration into the free world, it is necessary, in Mr. Petre Roman's opinion, to take a number of measures: "Genuine national policies have to be put into motion, policies with precise aims, meaning primarily restructuring and privatization to ensure efficiency; conversion to eliminate waste; and adjustment and training to improve competence. We are no longer allowed to neglect, by any means in our political activity, such key words in the modern world as profitability, efficiency, efficient management, and productivity. It is clear that only economic freedom can ensure efficiency; exercising this freedom, however, should not generate unbearable effects for numerous people. (...) "Thus we favor a competitive and equitable economic order. To overcome our historically accumulated economic and social deficit, Romania needs to adjust its economic credit, for a relatively short time, to the development model based on intercorrelated strategies. Namely: Obtaining resources for financing credits; giving an impetus to all kinds of investment; the development of markets to encourage profitable investment; and a selective and dynamic role of the state in managing and guiding the development process." Summing up the ideas of his lecture, Mr. Petre Roman formulated the following objective: "Economic reconstruction and political democratization to ensure genuine national sovereignty." He stressed that without assistance on the part of the free world, Romania will not be able to integrate into Europe and recover.
