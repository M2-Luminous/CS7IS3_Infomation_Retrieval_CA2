The officials said the proposal was made in a report worked out by the Labor Ministry's Employment Policy Research Group. The officials said the report urged the government to map out a new employment policy that would include revising the seniority-based, lifetime employment system, long hailed as contributing to Japan's economic growth. In view of the changing industrial structure and graying society, new labor problems are expected to arise that the traditional employment system will not be able to overcome, the report said. To promote structural change through deregulation and maintain the labor supply-demand balance, it is necessary for the government to implement appropriate macroeconomic policies and investment expansion designed to achieve annual economic growth of about 3.0 percent, the report said. While basically maintaining the long-term employment system, new steps must be taken by enterprises to develop human resources and secure part-time workers, the report said. The officials said the report also stressed the need for the government to systematically foster workers engaged in public welfare-related fields to cope with the aging society. It urged the government to consolidate the environment in which middle-aged and senior workers are allowed to work to the age of 65. The report also called on the government to take positive steps to promote employment of female workers. The officials said the report will be reflected in a new employment policy to be worked out by the ministry.
