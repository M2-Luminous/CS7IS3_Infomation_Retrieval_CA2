French Defense Minister Francois Leotard said in Paris that the French troops would launch a limited operation to protect the Tutsis and it could begin as early as Thursday, once the UN Security Council authorized the intervention. The council gave the go-ahead hours later. The commander of the French joint chiefs of staff, Admiral Jacques Lanxade, said a first contingent of 600 troops would be deployed once the operation got under way. Here in Zaire, two huge French transport planes unloaded troops in the towns of Goma, near the Rwandan border, and Bukavu, just across the Ruzizi River from Rwanda, sources in Goma said. Lanxade in Paris said a total of 200 troops were in these two towns and a third, Kisangani. In Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic, three transport planes chartered from the Russian carrier Aeroflot began disgorging helicopters and vehicles at the city's airport. At an adjacent French military air base, six other large transport planes could be seen, with military vehicles on the perimeter of the air field. France has 1,400 troops stationed permanently in the Central African Republic. Leotard said 2,500 French soldiers would be involved in what he described as a humanitarian operation. Lanxade said 500 vehicles and 40 planes would be used. Leotard said the French troops would only be deployed in parts of western Rwanda controlled by the ethnic Hutu government, which has been accused of responsibility for most of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic killings that have rocked Rwanda for the past 10 weeks. Tutsi-led rebels who control the north of Rwanda and were engaged in a major offensive Wednesday to capture the capital Kigali have refused to allow French troops into their zones. They blame Paris for supporting and arming the Hutu authorities despite evidence they were involved in the systematic slaughter of minority Tutsis.
