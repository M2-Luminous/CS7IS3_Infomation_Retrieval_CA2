Aware that his remaining years are few, Deng Xiaoping recently talked about what would happen after his death. Sometimes he referred to China's situation after his death, and sometimes he talked about arrangements after his death. Recently, he talked soberly about arrangements after his death and the current situation. He said: I note that the world is still paying attention to me and regards my personal role, health, and life or death as a critical point. This is not normal. The day I meet the premier [Zhou Enlai] and my comrades in arms is approaching. This is the law of nature. But I am not going as fast as people overseas think. I have said time and again that neither I nor my remarks should be given too much publicity or lauded too much; instead propagation should be given to the party's line, principles, and policies, as well as the leadership of the party Central Committee and the State Council. I would like to say once again that after I am no longer around, do not hold large-scale ceremonies, do not praise me too highly, and do not give too much publicity to my remarks, writings, or work; still less should a memorial hall or statue be built for me. People in various circles should be discouraged from doing this. Document No. 94019 Quotes Deng Xiaoping's Recent Remarks Deng Xiaoping's remarks were relayed to the Political Bureau by Jiang Zemin recently. On 11 April the CPC Central Committee Secretariat issued "classified" document No. 94019, entitled "General Secretary Jiang Zemin Relays Deng Xiaoping's Important Remarks to the Political Bureau." This document summed up the main points of Deng Xiaoping's remarks at the National People's Congress in March and during a meeting of the Political Bureau Standing Committee members in early April. Apart from talking about arrangements after his death, Deng Xiaoping also appraised the Central Committee's work and current problems. Deng Xiaoping Confirms the Central Leadership Deng Xiaoping delivered a high appraisal of the central leadership. Jiang Zemin relayed this by saying: In the four years since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee to the new leadership elected at the 14th CPC Central Committee, practice has proven that this is a staunch, competent, united, and farsighted leadership, which enjoys the people's trust and support, as well as international support. The Political Bureau and its Standing Committee have withstood the stiffest tests; this is very important. Comrades of the Central Military Commission have a clear-cut stand and closely follow the party Central Committee. Now, our situation is stable, well-founded, and ensured. There is a stable political situation of unity between the party, the government, and the military. This suggests that the party's line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee have been correct and should be further implemented and developed. Chen Yun, Wan Li, Shangkun, Yibo, Desheng, and I are of the opinion that leaders of your generation are more competent than we are, more farsighted, less bookish, less dogmatic, less affected by old conventions, and are quick in changing your brains. When Talking About the Current Situation, Deng Xiaoping Revealed His Uneasiness Despite his satisfaction with the Central Committee leadership group, Deng Xiaoping revealed his uneasiness when talking about the party's main tasks. He pointed out that localism, intra-party corruption, and "leftist" interference are three major problems. The chief architect does not seem to have a method to resolve these problems. Localism Is Ruining the Party's Cause Deng Xiaoping expressed his indignation over intra-party factionalism, sectarianism, and localism. He said: We must frequently and repeatedly say in the party that it is impermissible to engage in factionalism or sectarianism, or to put oneself above the party committee; we must guard against this. Intra-party factionalism is not allowed because it will ruin the party's cause and the country's future. At present, it is necessary to rectify and overcome sectarianism and localism. We must admit and acknowledge that localism, sectarianism, and intra-party anarchy have played a destructive role in the implementation of the party's policies and principles and to our cause. Leaders who cannot consciously correct or do not acknowledge their mistakes in work must be replaced, transferred, rectified, and reorganized. We must be resolute. Corruption Has Caused Party To Lose Its Leadership Initiative Deng Xiaoping pointed out that intra-party corruption at present has gone beyond what people imagine and that the consequences are very serious. He said: I have noted that anticorruption work needs more courage and effort. Anticorruption work has yielded results in previous periods. Corruption is more serious and complicated than we imagine. In localities and departments where corruption is serious, they cannot be politically clean and their leadership groups are weak and lax. I have told some veteran comrades that in combating corruption, we should proceed from ourselves and our families and relatives; veteran and middle-aged cadres should not commit mistakes in this respect. Recently, some people have said that there is also corruption in Europe, Japan, Asia, and Taiwan and that their corruption is very serious. This comparison is very dangerous. If corruption cannot be resolved, our party and government will lose their leadership initiative and it will be hard for us to have a reputation for giving instructions and guidance. In this scenario, our cause will fail. "Interference From Many Aspects" Must Be Removed This chief architect admitted that reform is meeting interference from many aspects, particularly from the "left" aspect (he first mentioned such interference). He stressed the problem of "interference from within the contingent itself" and that the problem of not complying with the Central Committee ideologically or in actions should be resolved. This was targeted at conservatives. In relaying Deng Xiaoping's remarks, Jiang Zemin said: In carrying out socialist construction and reform, including political reform, we should be sober-minded instead of being intoxicated with self-satisfaction or complacency. There is interference from many aspects, and this interference has basically never stopped for the past 10-odd years. There is "left" and right interference. Of course, there is also interference from U.S. hegemonism and power politics; this has never stopped. But we must resolve interference and disturbances from within our own contingent. Namely, we must comply with the Central Committee ideologically and in actions. In this way, we will be able to overcome "left" and right interference in a timely manner, instead of becoming passive. Deng Xiaoping's "latest instructions" in classified document No. 94019, apart from the arrangements for after his death, soberly talked about information which is hard to obtain, and the rest was on "major principles" and does not contain anything new. But Jiang Zemin regards Deng Xiaoping's remarks as imperial edicts. In fact, Jiang Zemin understands very well that the CPC's corruption, sectarianism, and localism are deep-rooted habits which are difficult to remove. The chief architect's empty talk cannot help resolve practical problems. Deng Xiaoping said that "in political reform... one should not remain complacent." He does not mean what he says. Everyone knows that there is no political reform in the chief architect's blueprint. The problem is not one of marking time in political reform; there have been no first steps at all.
