This topic inevitably became the focus of discussion of central leaders and local officials at the recent "two sessions" [National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]. Against this background, the repeated calls of major newspapers in Beijing for subordination to the overall situation and strengthening macro regulation and control have attracted even greater attention. While attending National People's Congress deputies group discussions as an observer, this reporter often heard officials from underdeveloped areas ask the central authorities for preferential investment and taxation policies, and officials from developed areas also expressed their hope that the central authorities would continue to "provide water for breeding fish" and allow their localities to retain more revenue. The central authorities, for their part, stressed that the most important thing was for the whole nation to be of one mind, push forward reform, establish the relevant mechanisms, and act in accordance with the laws of the market. The central government repeatedly stressed the necessity of controlling the growth rate and the scale of capital construction, while a few local officials continued to talk about grand capital construction plans a great deal. Should the whole nation be of one mind and be subordinate to the overall situation? Or should the whole nation, like last year, blindly compete for more construction projects and investment and be overeager for quick success and instant benefits, ignoring the impossibility of supplying funds and materials, causing an imbalance in supplies, finance, credit, and foreign exchange, further deteriorating inflation, seriously affecting the improvement of comprehensive results, and landing the economic development in a strange "hot" and "cold" cycle? This question gives various localities much food for thought. The reform of the financial, taxation, banking, and investment structure has extensively touched upon many deep-level difficult problems in ideological concepts, the readjustment of interests, and specific operations. It has involved the issue of readjusting the interest pattern by breaking barriers between departments and between regions and has addressed sensitive questions, such as the redefinition of the scope of macro regulation and control, the scientific division of the limits of authority in economic management between the central government and local governments, and so on. How can the strengthening of the central authorities' economic management authority be ensured and can various kinds of power in macro regulation and control be concentrated in the central authorities while continuing to give play to the enthusiasm of both the central authorities and various localities? This is a problem which has not been properly solved ever since the founding of New China and which has not yet been completely solved despite attempts since the beginning of reform. In view of the serious consequences of the overheated economy last year, rational Chinese have come to understand: Strict control over the scale of fixed assets investment has a bearing on the overall situation of reform, development, and stability this year. The central government hopes to benignly integrate results with speed and build a market pattern with a unified standard by formulating and promulgating the "Budget Law" to strengthen macro regulation and control and to control the scale of capital construction and the speed of construction in various localities. Another means of macro regulation and control is the tax-sharing system. According to the financial budget this year, 75 percent of the value-added tax in various localities shall be handed over to the central financial departments, and this means the amount of taxes handed over to the state will grow as speed increases. This move should result in more effective macro regulation and control. What is worthy of attention is that, according to the financial minister's report, after the implementation of the tax-sharing system, the growth rate of local financial revenue will be higher than that of the central authorities, half of the central financial revenue will be returned to the localities, and the central authorities will not take away large amount of financial resources from the localities. Therefore, local governments have no reason not to favor the tax-sharing system. This year, reform is facing a severe test. The situation also demands the establishment of a sense of taking the overall situation into consideration and demands a strengthening of the central government's authority. This is because reform is no longer characterized by spontaneously moving forward from bottom to top and delegating power and interests from top to bottom; it has moved on to unified coordination and organized implementation from top to bottom. The process of reform has changed from moving one single item after another forward and conducting operations in batches to moving forward as a whole and making breakthroughs around focal points. The establishment of a sense of the overall situation is more necessary, and the way to guide reform is shifting more and more from pushing forward with policies to pushing forward with laws. It is precisely this point that requires local officials to understand that the central leaders have really given a great deal of thought to stressing the establishment of the market economic mechanism as the most important thing. They should not worry about gains and losses that have resulted from preferential policies, and it is also necessary to strengthen macro regulation and control to do away with the practice of being small but complete, to break regional monopolies, to give play to the strong points of various localities, and to develop the entire economy in a coordinated manner. Adopting the policy of subordination to the overall situation and strengthening macro regulation and control do not mean a return to the old path of the planned economy; rather, they mean that the entire nation, with one mind and one goal, will establish the operational mechanism of the socialist market economy, and the central government will more effectively give play to the means of macro regulation and control to ensure that the entire economy will develop in a sustained, healthy, and stable [chi xu jian kang wen ding 2170 4958 0256 1660 4489 1353] manner.
