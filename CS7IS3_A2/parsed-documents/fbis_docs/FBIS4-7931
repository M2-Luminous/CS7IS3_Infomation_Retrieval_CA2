More than 90 percent of the output and much of the pain of restructuring is concentrated in the bleak region around Ostrava, north Moravia, which already suffers one of the country's highest unemployment rates--6 percent. The Vitkovice company, Ostrava's 160-year-old steelmaker, has shed 10,000 of the 35,000 employees it had in 1989. Local authorities have decided to shut down the smelly blast furnaces and sinter plant around which the city grew up, a development that could cause another 5,000 workers to be laid off in the coming years. "We have to repair our equipment and buy cleaner and more efficient technologies while our sales keep on dropping," says Jan Svozil, head of development and ecology at Nova Hut, the country's largest steel producer. The complex churned out 3.8 million tons of steel five years ago, but the company expects production to stabilize around 2 million tons. Most of its Czech clients do not pay for their purchases. Nova Hut officials say that if the company stopped supplying those who don't pay, it would not produce any steel at all. "We never had to think about marketing under the communists," Svozil says. "Whatever was produced was sold." Fortunately, the company exports half of its output, helping to balance the cash-flow situation. However, the firm owes billions of crowns to the Ostrava mines for coal supplies. As for the future, "A lot depends on the state's plans for the region," Svozil says. Last week, the Czech Economics Ministry decided to provide a loan guarantee for the construction of a sheet-steel mini-mill at Nova Hut, which won out over its neighbor Trinecke zelezarny. Nova Hut's joint-venture project was better-prepared, according to Minister of Economy Karel Dyba. Trinecke zelezarny, however, is threatening to go ahead with its project regardless of the governmental decision. Its foreign partners are set to go through with the construction even without state guarantees, say sources in the office of the company's director. Nova Hut Director Svatopluk Velkoborsky reacted by offering to let Trinecke plug into its joint venture with American producer Intercontinental Steel. Better cooperation between companies is necessary for good results, says Ministry of Industry and Trade steel overseer Otakar Kopecny. One of Kopecny's main tasks is to encourage producers to coordinate their production programs so that they do not compete against each other, he says. But simple cooperation may not be enough, according to some specialists. The Ostrava factories need to merge production horizontally, says Frank Wheeler, senior steel executive at the Toronto-based engineering and management consultancy group Hatch Associates. "Coordination works as long as interests coincide. As soon as they don't, the companies could start destructively competing," he says. "It would be very inefficient if each one of them tried to make it on its own." The steel makers will only start seriously restructuring when they see how desperately they need to, says Wheeler, who earned a doctorate in metallurgy at Ostrava. "Right now, they haven't quite realized that it's a question of survival. They're still at the denial stage." The industry's challenge is to downsize, modernize and become environmentally compliant at the same time. "Putting off ecology as an expensive luxury, as [Prime Minister Vaclav] Klaus suggested, would be a costly mistake. When one accounts for the social costs of pollution, such as treatment of lung diseases, environmental investments become more attractive," Wheeler says. The Czech steel industry has excellent technical expertise, continues Wheeler, but it needs foreign help to prioritize problems, evaluate markets and develop strategic plans. "These companies often don't know which of their products earn money. They need to understand their markets. For decades, they haven't had to." Last month, the National Property Fund also guaranteed a bank consortium loan for the area's steel producers to introduce energy-saving continuous casting. The technology, which brings the steel into the rolling mill without cooling and reheating, was adopted in most Western factories many years ago. "We are grateful for the state-guaranteed loan," says Ivan Boros, spokesman for Vitkovice. But he adds that the Czech press exaggerated the loan's importance. The state's guarantee affects 900 million Kc (just over $30 million), less than a fifth of the improvements' cost. Companies can grow resentful when the state suddenly backs out of industries just when they need the most support. "The government has rid itself of its responsibility," charges Nova Hut official Svozil. Many Moravians and Silesians look at Prague as a huge bureaucratic parasite living off the sweat of the provincial economy. "Our taxes go up to Prague, and very little of it trickles back down to us. They get lost somewhere along the way," says Tomas Pavelko, ecology director of Moravian Chemical Works. "Regional authorities are more accountable." Less than 60 percent of the fees paid by north Moravian companies into the national environmental fund are reinvested in the region, a fact that has angered locals. But the state cannot go on mothering industries as it did before, government officials counter. "We chose to privatize and let the companies do the restructuring," says Kopecny, the Ministry of Industry's steel expert. "We are not like England. We can't afford to finance and direct the industries' restructuring. All industries here are restructuring here at once!" Though the National Property Fund is still the majority owner of all three Ostrava plants, the national government in Prague keeps the steel mills on a very loose leash. The plants hope a World Bank loan will help finance the project. Some observers, however, do not foresee this loan coming. "It's unrealistic to expect the steel-saturated West to finance any capacity expansion here," argues Hatch Associates' Wheeler. Rather than developing new facilities at great cost, better use should be made of the existing ones, he recommends. Inside the hulking plants, workers feel the brunt of the slowdown acutely. With monthly salaries averaging 8,000 Kc, laborers hover around outdated, ill-repaired equipment amid noxious gases. A man stands over the open door of a blazing oven manually spraying magnetized steel into the huge furnace to patch up the visible cracks in its walls. Extreme noise levels--up to 160 decibels--bombard the workers all day long. In some parts of the plant, airborne flakes of steel cover one's clothes in a few seconds. "It's all very well to talk about ecology and restructuring, but you have to see it from our side as well. We breathe in the pollution at its source, you out there get only a bit of it," says Vladimir Tajchert, a Nova Hut repairman. "The steel industry," he concludes, "needs more investment."
