[Danes] Do you share the feeling of Foreign Minister Zieleniec that the visit by U.S. President Clinton to Prague and the Partnership for Peace plan will bear fruit in the form of the expeditious membership of the Czech Republic in NATO? [Klaus] I really cannot say anything new on this topic: At present, no one is offering us NATO membership. It would be a delusion to dream that we could convince the NATO-member states to change their attitude by intense pressure or just by ardent rhetoric. Partnership for Peace is a workable way outm and there certainly is NATO membership at the end of this road. [Danes] What is a better alternative for you, no Ministry of Culture or a Ministry of Culture headed by Pavel Tigrid? [Klaus] Of course, today's option, and at least until the elections, is a Ministry of Culture headed by a good person. On the long-term basis, I believe that the Ministry of Culture is a bit of a relic of the past, and I really believe that we could do without it. [Danes] The departure of Deputy Josef Jezek from the ODS and the way it was commented on by Deputy Chairman Jiri Vlach are only additional signs that relations between the ODS and its deputies' club are not in the best shape. What are you planning to do to improve them? [Klaus] I do not believe that these relations are not in good shape or that they are in worse shape than standard relations between the executive and the legislative powers anywhere in the world. It is perfectly logical, and it must be so, that the government and parliament are struggling with each other over their powers. It is a normal phenomenon. This week, I spent an entire day in the ODS Deputies' Club, and I have not noticed any adverse relations there. It is not true, and I believe that it is all being unnecessarily blown out of proportion. The problem lies elsewhere. It is, as is common, that there are individuals with a very definite one-dimensional orientation who contemplate their problem from morning till night. They link many other things to settling or not settling this problem according to their ideas. This was the case with the "cartographer," a technocratic expert on the constitutional arrangement, Deputy Jezek, and it is the case with this or that deputy, who is mainly concerned with the settlement of the issue of the military zones here or there. I could go on listing certain monothematic affairs that frustrate individuals. I believe that this does not involve any fundamental conflict in the overall philosophy, ideology, or political stand, and therefore I do not see any reason to make it more dramatic than it is. [Zieleniec] I think that we would be making a bad job of defending our interests if our security interests were exactly the same as the security interests of all of the countries in the region. Incidentally, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher left his colleagues from the Visegrad countries in no doubt about the importance of regional cooperation, but cooperation in the security sphere must consist, first and foremost, of bilateral ties between these states and NATO. This point of view was also expressed in the speech delivered in Prague by President Clinton. It is essential within the framework of Visegrad to execute regional cooperation by carrying out specific deeds, for example, in the trade and economic spheres, and not just hold ostentatious summit meetings at which the perfidy of the West is cursed. This is not our policy. We are transforming our state so that it becomes a typical element of the West. This cannot be replaced by the "banging on the doors" kind of behavior. It is not true that if four fists bang on NATO's doors together it is more effective than one fist. We are not banging on doors; we are orienting ourselves toward the West definitively and straightforwardly.
