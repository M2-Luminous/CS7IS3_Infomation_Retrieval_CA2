This qualitatively new step in international relations opens up the real possibility for the Commonwealth states to move away from economic slump toward stabilization of the economy under market conditions. This opportunity must not be missed, as has occurred more than once. Unifying processes are supreme and predominant in the modern world. New economic associations are arising on practically all continents. An integral economic space of countries of Central Asia is being formed. The Maastricht agreements are establishing a higher level of integration of the Common Market in Europe. A break in economic relations between our countries not only weakens their position in the world, not only impacts on the destinies of the people, creating the threat of degradation for new generations, but also contradicts world trends. Constructive calls for peace, harmony, and cooperation have been heard from Tashkent more than once. Now, heading toward the turn of the 21st century, the industrialists and entrepreneurs who have assembled in this city, who united two years ago in the International Congress, perceive with satisfaction both the Moscow and Ashgabad (1993) agreements of the heads of states and governments of the CIS countries concerning the creation of an Economic Union, and firmly declare the intention to create a new economic community step by step. It is perfectly obvious that the Treaty on Creation of an Economic Union denotes only the first stage of long-term and multifarious work. Its effectiveness will in many ways be determined by the quality of the mechanisms of the Economic Union that are created and the actions of all the participants in their implementation. The role of effective interaction with the states and interstate organs of associations of industrialists and entrepreneurs will be exceptionally great in these processes. However, frequently there is no desire to listen to them, or they are simply ignored. The direct participation of industrialists and entrepreneurs in the activities of the structures of the Economic Union that are being formed would make it possible in a timely way to coordinate decisions being made with the interests of the main subjects of economic management--enterprises and organizations. National associations-participants of the International Congress of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs will actively promote setting up civilized trade and forming a customs union, a common commodity market, services, capital, and manpower for the development of a mutually interrelated investment policy and cooperation in the field of investment activity. The paramount tasks are normalization of monetary and settlement relations, consistent movement toward a currency (monetary) union, organization of direct relations between product producers, commercial and banking structures, and development of production cooperation. The Council of the International Congress of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs appeals to the heads of states and parliaments that are members of the Economic Union not to delay ratification of the signed treaty and to complete it in accordance with existing constitutional norms by mid-1994. This will give a new impetus to the intensification of economic reform and will promote the acceleration of industrial production, the stabilization and development of other vitally important branches of the economy, and, on this basis, the strengthening of the sovereignty of each state. The emergence of a new nucleus of Eurasian economic integration will stimulate the revival of economic relations among the states of Central and East Europe, the Baltics, and other countries, and responds to the basic interests of their industrialists and entrepreneurs, and of all people. Today the foundations of a unique economic community are being laid at the juncture of Europe and Asia. The realization of opportunities--this is the call of the times, the true path to the formation of the economy of the 21st century that will ensure for our countries and people peaceful development and well-being and a suitable life for future generations. The Tashkent forum of business people is for real integration processes and mutually beneficial cooperation!
