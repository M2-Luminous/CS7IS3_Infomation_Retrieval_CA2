FR940304-2-00160 FR940304-2-00083 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;33679; File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;94&hyph;01] Self-Regulatory Organization; The Depository Trust Company; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change Relating To the Implementation of the Standing Instruction Database Feature of the Enhanced Institutional Delivery System February 24, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 1 notice is hereby given that on January 31, 1994, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The proposed rule change consists of procedures for the Standing Instructions Database (``SID'') feature of DTC's enhanced Institutional Delivery (``ID'') system. 2 2 The enhanced ID system concept was approved in an earlier Commission order. The order specified that each individual feature of the enhanced ID system would be the subject of a separate filing under Section 19(b)(1). Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33466 (January 12, 1994), 59 FR 3139 [File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;93&hyph;07] (order approving concept of enhanced ID system). II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, DTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. DTC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change SID is a central repository for customer account and settlement information furnished by institutions, agents, and broker-dealers. The information includes items such as the agent for an institutional customer, the agent's internal account number for the institutional customer, and interested parties. A broker-dealer can link its internal account numbers for its institutional customers to the internal account numbers at the institutions. When entering trade data into the ID system, a broker-dealer can simply refer to its internal account number in SID, and the ID system will extract the necessary information from SID (such as customer name, agent, interested parties, and settlement related information) and automatically will add the information to the confirmation. SID will eliminate the need for the broker-dealer to provide all such information each time that the broker-dealer enters trade data into the ID system. SID is an optional feature for ID users. However, once a broker-dealer links its internal customer account number with account information furnished to SID by the institutional customer, data in SID will be used for certain fields in ID system processing, regardless of whether the broker-dealer submits data for those fields, when the broker-dealer submits trade data for that institutional customer's trades. The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder because the proposed rule change will further automate the process by which securities transactions are cleared and settled. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition DTC perceives no impact on competition by reason of the proposed rule change. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others SID has been developed through widespread consultations with securities industry members. Written comments from DTC participants or others have not been solicited or received on the proposed rule change. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (a) By order approve such proposed rule change or (b) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of DTC. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;94&hyph;01 and should be submitted by March 25, 1994. For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 3 3 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1992). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
