Pak Kil-yon, North Korean ambassador to the United Nations, told KYODO NEWS SERVICE that the speculation was based on groundless rumors and Kim celebrated his 52nd birthday Wednesday in good spirit. In a Seoul-datelined story Thursday, a foreign news agency quoted South Korea's opposition Democratic Party Leader Li Ki-taek as saying that he had heard from foreign diplomatic sources that Kim Chong-il had sustained serious, but unspecified, injuries. Li was told that if Kim did not appear at celebrations marking his 52nd birthday Wednesday, the reports could be considered "reliable." Pak said the reports were political propaganda designed to slander Kim, the No. 2 man in Pyongyang's ruling hierarchy.
