The delegation returned to Podgorica yesterday evening. The stands of the international community -- primarily the European Union -- on the futility of the policy of sanctions, which have, in a way, been conveyed to the Montenegrin delegation will, according to Djukanovic, encourage a flurry of activity leading to the establishment of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, after which the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will be alleviated. Assessing the talks in Great Britain as extremely useful and interesting, the Montenegrin prime minister stressed that it had been mutually noted that peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina is of paramount importance, and that this will be followed by all other moves on the part of the international community. Respect was also voiced toward the principled policies pursued by Montenegro, both in the sense of searching for a solution in the region of former Yugoslavia and of normalizing the situation in the entire area, Djukanovic said. He attaches great importance to the fact that, by making this visit, Montenegro's foreign policy, which does carry a certain amount of weight in the eyes of the international community, has announced the beginning of a new diplomatic offensive.
