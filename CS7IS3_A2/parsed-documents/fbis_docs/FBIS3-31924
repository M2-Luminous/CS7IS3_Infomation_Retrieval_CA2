These Brazilian Army and Air Force officers will replace colleagues who have already served one year of peacekeeping duty and are about to return to Brazil. Some 146 Brazilian military and police officers are carrying out nonmilitary duties -- observation, medical support and management -- in five of the 14 UN peacekeeping operations. Brazilians are working in Angola, El Salvador, Mozambique, the former Yugoslavia and on the Rwanda-Uganda border. The Brazilian Government has asked Congress for permission to increase its contribution to the peacekeeping force in Mozambique by sending 25 police officers and 100 Army privates.
