Their joint appeal urged residents of Derbent and Dagestan to show restraint, wisdom and not yield to nationalist provocations. Lezghian and Azeri rallies were held in Derbent this week under nationalist slogans. The rallies were accompanied by local clashes and fire exchanges. No casualties were reported. The police were sent to resume order. A reason for the rallies was a quarrel between several Lezghians and Azeris that resulted in a fight and a fire exchange, when two Lezghians were killed and several people, including those underaged, wounded. After that a hundred of Lezghians blocked the way to the town. A meeting of the Dagestan parliament presidium discussed the situation in Derbent and sharply criticized the Derbent authorities and the police. New heads of the city administration and city interior department were nominated. A special government commission is working.
