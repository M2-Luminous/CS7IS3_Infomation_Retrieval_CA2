Exaggerated importance is consistently given to the subject of the latest personnel reshuffle in the leadership of the internal affairs bodies of the autonomous republic. The Chief Public Relations Center of Ukraine's Interior Ministry has been instructed to inform the media and the public of the Interior Ministry's position on this matter. The current situation was analyzed at the Interior Ministry of the Republic of Crimea on 19 May. A team from the Ukrainian Interior Ministry recently worked in the Republic of Crimea and documents relating to the practical aid provided to official bodies and departments of the interior were discussed at the meeting. Among the questions discussed was the issue of incorrect actions that occurred when Aleksandr Plyuta, the interior minister of the Republic of Crimea, was dismissed from his post and a former army general, Valeriy Kuznetsov, took his place. We emphasize once again, as we have done many times before, that all such issues are to be decided solely by the interior minister of Ukraine, in accordance with Ukraine's law on militia. Valentyn Nedryhaylo, Ukrainian first deputy interior minister, who attended the meeting, read out Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's decree turning the Crimean Republic's Interior Ministry into the Ukrainian Interior Ministry's Main Directorate of Internal Affairs in the Crimea and making it directly accountable to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry. In accordance with the decree, administrative and service premises, weapons, vehicles, and other property are being handed over to the Main Directorate of Internal Affairs in the Crimea. Also read out was a Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers decision on changes in the complement and structure of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, providing for the introduction of an additional post-- Ukrainian deputy interior minister, who is also head of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry's Main Directorate of Internal Affairs in the Crimea. By order of the Ukrainian interior minister, the post has been filled by Militia Colonel Valeriy Chernyshov, a Russian, born in 1952, and a graduate of what is now the Ukrainian Academy of Internal Affairs, who has over 20 years' experience of working in internal affairs bodies. V. Chernyshov was born in the Crimea's Bakhchisarayskiy Rayon and worked for over 12 years in operational commanding positions in Crimea's internal affairs bodies. Over the past few years he has served on the staff of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry as deputy head of the Main Directorate for Criminal Investigations. Disregarding the decree of L. Kravchuk, the president of our state, on 19 May, the Supreme Soviet session of the Crimean Republic appointed Valeriy Kuznetsov to the nonexistent post of interior minister of the Crimean Republic. A dangerous precedent has thus been created that may have a negative effect on the activities of the internal affairs bodies as a whole and help to destabilize the peninsula's crime situation, which is already extremely tense."
