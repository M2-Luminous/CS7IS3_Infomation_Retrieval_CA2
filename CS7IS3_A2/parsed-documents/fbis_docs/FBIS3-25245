On the line right now we have Mr. Walter Felgate from the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and also Mr. Dulla Omar from the ANC to explain something about what the situation is at present. If we can begin with you, Mr. Felgate, what is the IFP's standpoint at the moment with what seems to be a fairly major deadlock in negotiations? [Felgate] Well, the IFP is seeking to give some kind of realistic and meaningful role for provinces in the building of democracy. Things hang together. The provincial constitution, the provincial power, the financing for provincial functions and the protection of these structures and functions all hang together. Damage to one is damage to all. And as the constitution is now written, the constitutional assembly with a text introduced by as little as a 50 percent plus one majority could replace the penned constitution with an entirely new constitution and that new constitution could obliterate everything that is done in the interim period at the provincial constitutional level. There is no continuity guaranteed, there's no powers that are guaranteed, there are no structures that are guaranteed, and indeed if you look carefully at the principles, the principles of any value only come into operation after the next constitution is actually adopted. [Trudgeon] Mr. Dullah Omar of the ANC is also on the line with us. Mr. Omar, why are you so keen -- having heard that -- that the IFP should take part in the elections? [Omar] We are keen that the IFP should participate in the election because we consider them to be an important player in South Africa, and it would be in the broader interest of the country that they do take part. I think, however, that Mr. Felgate is not correct in a number of things. Firstly there's nowhere in the constitution any provision that the constitutional assembly can by a resolution of 50 percent plus one adopt any constitution. This is completely incorrect. The constitution provides that a constitutional assembly shall adopt a new constitution by a two thirds majority. It also provides that when it also comes to the question of power, functions of regions, the provisions of a new constitution must also be adopted by the senate by a two thirds majority. [Trudgeon] Now, Mr. Felgate, we've also heard that the Freedom Alliance is going to register as a political party, which is quite a significant move, isn't it? [Felgate] But I think you must first allow me a very short rejoinder to what Mr. Dullah Omar has just said. It is entirely true that the only constitutional text that could go to a panel of constitutional experts, could go to a constitutional court, could be put before the people in a referendum. The only constitution in that process could in fact be introduced by a 50 percent plus one majority. I did not say adopt; I said introduce. But if that's the only constitution that we can consider, then it has very serious implications. Around the world it is already the other way round. A special majority is required to adopt a constitution or even introduce a constitution and a simpler majority is required in a referendum. That rejoinder just must be made, sorry I interrupted you. [Trudgeon] No, fine. I interrupted you. Do carry on about your comments about the Freedom Alliance becoming or registering as a political party. [Felgate] The Freedom Alliance has made no decision whatsoever to register as political party. The component members of the Freedom Alliance may or may not register. We as an alliance are adamant on one thing, and that is that we cannot enter into an election under the present constitution with its restrictions. The IFP has made it very clear as a component of the Freedom Alliance that we will not begin thinking about registration until we have got some kind of an all-inclusive constitutional settlement. So the registration issue arises only once we have got an all-inclusive constitutional settlement. [Trudgeon] Thank you Mr. Walter Felgate of the IFP for joining us and still on the line is Mr. Dullah Omar. Mr. Omar, this regional problem seems to be a major stumbling block with the Freedom Alliance, and with the IFP in particular. Do you agree that it is an important issue for them that should be considered by the government and the ANC? [Omar] It is an important issue. I also think it is an important issue for us. I want to add, however, that in respect of all those matters that Mr. Felgate has raised, adequate protection has been created. I think I must point out that with regard to Section 126 which deals with the powers and functions of regions. Both the ANC and the government moved considerably in order to accommodate the Freedom Alliance. You know the problem is you cannot negotiate at gun point. It is difficult for the ANC to negotiate when we are accosted with a set of demands which are put to us as being nonnegotiable and as a take it or leave it situation. Now with regard to powers and functions of regions, we moved considerably. The present constitution provides for concurrent powers only. We moved and said that there are a number of aspects in which we would agree to exclusive powers for regions, and regions would have been able, provinces would have been able to exercise autonomy in respect of all these powers. There are certain matters in respect of which concurrent powers should remain -- matters such as education, health, and generally matters of national concern. But even in respect of those powers the ability of central government to intervene would have been limited. So we met them in respect of that. When it came to the structures of government within provinces, there again we were prepared to say that provinces need not adhere to the provisions of the current constitution. [Trudgeon] Joining us on the line now we have the government's chief negotiator, Mr. Roelf Meyer. Good morning Mr. Meyer, and thank you for your time. We are discussing this issue of regionalism that seems such a stumbling block with the IFP. We were talking to Walter Felgate a few moments ago. Do you feel that the government has done enough in giving in on this regionalism issue? [Meyer] Well, it's not a question of giving in. It is what we have negotiated. The problem is actually the fact that the Freedom Alliance was not at Kempton Park at the Negotiating Council where we have negotiated the contents of the constitution, especially the IFP walked out of it on the 2d of July last year already. And throughout the last part of last year those parties that remained there negotiated exactly the way in which provision should be made in a constitution for the powers, functions and boundaries and so forth of the provinces in the future. And at those negotiations we took a particular viewpoint and that is that we want autonomous provincial structures as far as the future is concerned. So from government side that was our view and that is what I believe we have attained. In other words, we have succeeded in our goal as far as that goes through the process of negotiations. Now what the Freedom Alliance is actually wanting is something more, over and above what we have already written into the constitution. First of all they missed the opportunity while we were actually negotiating this already. But now we have come up with specific proposals on how to accommodate them as well and even at this late stage I would say give us your specific proposals so that we can look at it and see whether we can accommodate them. But you see, over the last week, 10 days, two weeks, we have made further and further compromises to accommodate them. In other words, we declared ourselves prepared to make amendments to the constitution in order to include them in the process. Now they want something more, and if we can just get clarity on that, maybe we can find a solution but then they have to provide us with that particular proposal today. [Trudgeon] Time is certainly running short, Mr. Meyer, just how much more conciliatory are you going to be toward the Freedom Alliance and what do you think still needs to be done to get them in or what do you expect from them? [Meyer] Well, the ball is in their court, in other words, to provide us with their specific proposals. You see, the problem is, we have from our side put the package on the table last Thursday for consideration. After we had looked at the total situation we said okay, look at the following proposal, and we included in that a number of critical items according to the wishes of the Freedom Alliance, as well including the two-ballot paper issue and so forth. And then Monday evening when we met, we heard from them that they would accept those proposals but they want something more. And what we say to them -- what we've said to them already Monday evening -- is give us a specific proposal in terms of what you want more so that we can look at that and see whether we can find an answer but the problem is, you know, every time it seems that the solution is probably coming, then new demands are being put, new goal posts are being set and I think that is the problem that the Freedom Alliance has internally because it is not a homogeneous organization. It is an organization consisting of four or five different components and each one has its own agenda almost. So that is the problem, but time-wise there is still some scope. The point is we would have preferred this all to have been concluded before the proclamation of the election. That was done last Wednesday. In terms of the Electoral Act, the time for registration of parties lapses this Saturday. So that is actually in a certain way the final moment because parties will have to decide before Saturday whether they are going to participate in the election. Of course if agreements can finally be reached in the next two days, consequential amendments flowing from those agreements can follow and of course we would be too happy to give effect to such agreements, but then we must get those agreement now over the next 48 hours. [Trudgeon] Thank you Mr. Roelf Meyer who's the government's chief negotiator. Mr. Dullah Omar, if you are still on the line I should like to talk about the ANC's decision to register as a political party today. Was this a unanimous decision and why today specifically? [Omar] Well, it is a unanimous decision. After all, elections is [as heard] what the ANC has been fighting for for so many years. There's no special significance in the day. We have to register before Saturday, and so we want to make sure that we have registered in time. I want to add that I hope that the Freedom Alliance and its components or its components will register for the elections. I don't think that the door to negotiations will ever be closed, and on the side of the ANC there will always be a preparedness to continue negotiating right up to election day and even after elections. [Trudgeon] So you feel confident perhaps that there's still time to get the Freedom Alliance and the right wing in general into the election process? [Omar] Well, I want to say that we are open in that regard, and the door to negotiations will never be closed. [Trudgeon] Thank you, Mr. Dullah Omar, a spokesman for the ANC on the line to Radio Today, and our thanks as well to Walter Felgate and to chief government negotiator Roelf Meyer.
