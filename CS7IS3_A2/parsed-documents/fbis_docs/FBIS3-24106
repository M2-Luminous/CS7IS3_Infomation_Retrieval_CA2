This was the conclusion, for instance, of observers from the delegation of the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly, the International Electoral Systems Foundation, and a number of far-abroad countries that monitored the course of the election campaign and elections in the republic. In their opinion, violations mainly boil down to 10 points. First and foremost, the republic's current system of candidate registration is complex. They note vagueness and a lack of concrete points in the programs of many contenders for deputy mandates, and their poor coverage in the local mass media. Among shortcomings impermissible for pluralistic democratic elections they also named one person voting for himself and relatives, bringing ballot boxes home to some voters, and the absence of guards at some election precincts. Foreign representatives also complained that they were not permitted to visit a number of restricted-access election precincts. From which it follows, according to them, that this provided an opportunity for various forgeries and machinations. To find out the reaction of the Central Electoral Commission [CEC], we turned to its chairman, Karatay Turysov, and asked him to comment on these and other allegations of foreign observers. The answer was: They are all being carefully checked out now and appropriate explanations on this subject are forthcoming. I personally, noted K. Turysov, am not inclined to overly dramatize the situation. We have to base the assessment of elections on current realities in Kazakhstan; to ignore them is to take a deliberately biased position. Take, for instance, voting by a state list. This procedure is built into the Electoral Code, which had been adopted by the self-disbanded Supreme Council, and ignoring it would be a direct violation of the current law. The same could be said about elections in some military units. Existing security procedures for protection of state secrets do not permit letting foreign observers enter special secret defense installations. But voting there was conducted under the personal supervision of members of district electoral commissions. By the way, many other foreign observers, who take a more realistic position, are well aware of this. In particular, those from France, Russia, Turkmenistan, and a number of other countries. For instance, the French Ambassador Plenipotentiary and Extraordinary Bertrand Fessard de Foukalt in a personal conversation with me characterized the organization and the initial results of elections as a clear success of the young Kazakh democracy.
