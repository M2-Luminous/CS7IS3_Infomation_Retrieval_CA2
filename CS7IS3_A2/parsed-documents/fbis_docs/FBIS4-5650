FBIS4-5650 "dreas071_a_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-071 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Singapore Given Developing Nation Tax Privilege Singapore Given Developing Nation Tax Privilege OW0904085694 Tokyo KYODO in English 0812 GMT 9 Apr 94 OW0904085694 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Singapore, April 9 KYODO -- Japan on Saturday [9 April] acceded to Singapore's request to retain until the year 2000 a tax privilege that Japan grants to developing countries, although the island republic is now Southeast Asia's most developed economy. Under a taxation agreement signed by officials from the two countries here on Saturday, most Japanese companies operating in the island republic will continue to be exempted from taxation on their profits both in Singapore and Japan. Currently, most Japanese companies here are exempted from paying corporate tax because Singapore has offered tax concessions to attract foreign companies to set up businesses in the country. These companies also do not pay tax in Japan because Japanese tax authorities view them as having paid tax in Singapore -- a privilege Japan normally grants only to developing countries to help them lure much-needed foreign investments to build up their economies. Japan and Singapore first signed the agreement in January 1971 when Singapore was struggling to reverse its poverty-afflicted status after independence from the British in 1965. With the island republic now enjoying a per capita income of more than 21,271 Singapore dollars (13,548 U.S. dollars), sources said Japan asked to revise the agreement in the hope of ending the tax privilege earlier. But Japan gave in to Singapore's request to keep the agreement during the negotiations. The revised agreement -- which prevents double taxation and fiscal evasion -- was signed by Japan's Ambassador to Singapore Tomoya Kawamura and Koh Yong Guan, Singapore's commissioner of inland revenue. In a statement issued Saturday, Singapore's inland revenue authority did not elaborate on the tax privilege, referring to it only as "continuation of the existing tax sparing provision for income" until the year 2000. It also said the new agreement will "further facilitate the cross flow of trade, investment, financial activity and technical know-how between Singapore and Japan."
