Police Minister Moshe Shahal said today that the Israel Police would evacuate their personnel within the very next few weeks, rather than the originally planned four months. Our correspondent 'Ofer Vardi spoke with the police minister: [Begin recording] [Vardi] Upon the evacuation and the redeployment in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, the Israel Police's Gaza District will be renamed the Shimshon District, Minister Moshe Shahal announced today in a meeting with journalists in Tel Aviv. Policemen are busy organizing the said withdrawal which, according to the police minister, will take effect soon. [Shahal] Israel Police troops will initially evacuate police stations and Gaza's central prison, according to the timetable stipulated by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. This timetable will apparently be shorter than the four months originally planned. I believe we are now talking about very few weeks. [Vardi] This fast withdrawal, however, will not change the Israel Police's plans to reinforce its troops in the territories. [Shahal] We have started discussing the issue, but the debate has not yet been concluded. We are mainly dealing with the second phase, the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which will call for additional troops; we are requesting an addition of some 1,400 policemen. Our immediate requirements in order to carry out first phase of evacuating the police stations in Gaza are: building stations in the Qatif Bloc, creating a police district near Gaza, integrating police personnel into the border terminals planned by the IDF, and reinforcing the border terminals in Rafah and especially at the Allenby Bridge especially.
