Roberto Maroni has proposed the idea of a relay-style government. [Begin Maroni recording] We must choose a person who understands constitutional techniques, a person who is a strong federalist. I am not thinking of Gianfranco Miglio [of the Northern League]. I believe that the person we choose should not even come from the Northern League. [end recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Following the split, we now have the re-launch. Faced with an intransigent Berlusconi who has resolved to let President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro decide who should form the next government, the League has sent out its mediator, Roberto Maroni. Maroni has played down the comments of Bossi and has put a softer gloss on them. He said that the solution to the problem could be handing over the reins of power from a government which was first constituent and led by a federalist, to one which would then become legislative. Possibly led by Silvio Berlusconi. So far there has been no comment from Berlusconi, although there has been some from the Northern League itself. It is a Northern League deputy from the Veneto region who has criticized Bossi. (Rocchetti) called Bossi a Bonapartist. He said that the party was losing support and the arguments were damaging the party. It is in these agitated waters that (Bassanini) from the Party of the Democratic Left is making the first cautious moves. He spoke of a possible agreement concerning federal reform.
