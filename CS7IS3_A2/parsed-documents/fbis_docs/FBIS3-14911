Kondratyev assessed the talks: I faced no problems in Armenia. The Armenian side, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, agrees to fully implement the Moscow agreement and cease fire as of 1 March. I am leaving for Baku today. I hope to receive a similar reply there. It could be stated that a first step leading to peace is being taken. Russia, Kondratyev noted, will terminate its mediatory mission if Azerbaijan refuses to implement or disagrees with any of the provisions of the agreement. After all, both the Armenians and the Azerbaijanis are longing for the war to end. He also noted that the planned visit to Stepanakert was not possible due to weather conditions. But the deputy defense minister assured that he will be there at the first opportunity.
