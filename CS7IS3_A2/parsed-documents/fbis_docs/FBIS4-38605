FBIS4-38605 "drsov105_a_94006" FBIS-SOV-94-105 Daily Report 31 May 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Working Meeting Discusses Russian-U.S. Maneuvers Working Meeting Discusses Russian-U.S. Maneuvers LD3105202294 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1845 GMT 31 May 94 LD3105202294 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] It is expedient to hold the first joint exercises of the Russian and American peacekeeping forces scheduled for this summer in the Orenburg region on the territory of the United States. This conclusion was reached in the course of a working meeting between the Russian parliamentarians and members of the American Senate held on Tuesday in Moscow. This information was made public at a press conference attended by the Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Defense Sergey Yushenkov, head of the analogous committee of the US Senate Sam Nunn, leader of the State Duma committee on international affairs Vladimir Lukin, and Senator Robert Couts. Responding to INTERFAX, Yushenkov indicated that "a campaign of protest against the presence of the American forces in the center of Russia is being waged in Orenburg and around it, it is difficult to conduct exercises in such a situation." However, the new variant providing for the exercises in the U.S. "will be subject to obstruction -- now due to the spending of state funds for the transfer of our forces across the ocean," Yushenkov believes. At the same time Yushenkov and Nunn believe that it is necessary to conduct such joint maneuvers "as a symbol of confidence and partnership between our countries." In particular, Nunn declared that "the American people will welcome Russian servicemen on their soil."
