According to the report, Taiwan, bowing to the Legislative Yuan's demand for low-priced high technology and expanded participation of domestic industrial sectors, has decided to temporarily postpone the purchase of M-60 tanks and other weapons from the United States. Taiwan is no longer an enthusiastic patron who would unconditionally buy all U.S.-made weapons on the list, and this is the first time in several decades that Taiwan has postponed the purchase of arms already approved by Washington for export, reported the weekly. The weekly's report says: At a secret meeting between the two sides at the Pentagon 5 January, officials from Taiwan's Defense Ministry disclosed that they must temporarily postpone the purchase of M-60 tanks and about two squadrons of T-38 trainer aircraft. In addition, due to domestic pressure, the Defense Ministry may temporarily postpone the purchase of at least two major equipment systems already approved by Washington for sale to Taiwan. Included in the purchase is an improved antiaircraft system valued at about $1 billion. According to the officials, Taiwan has postponed the purchase of arms because of the increasingly tight defense budget and growing pressure from the Legislative Yuan which is demanding that it examine each and every major arms purchase project.
