Cao Hengli, director of the Shanghai Customs Office, said that imports via the Shanghai port, the largest of its kind in China, shot up nearly 29 percent in 1993 to 16.95 billion U.S. dollars, while exports through Shanghai climbed almost 17 percent to 13.98 billion U.S. dollars. He described the growth in international container transportation via Shanghai as the most "impressive." the port handled a total of 901,000 standard containers last year, roughly up by 58 percent. For the first time, the number of people leaving and entering China via Shanghai topped the two million mark in 1993, at a record 2.53 million, Cao said. "We did everything in our power to assist the development and construction of the Pudong New Area and the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone, to boost exports from Shanghai, and to accelerate infrastructure construction and growth of new- and high-technology industries." For example, procedures for customs declarations and tariff reductions and exemptions were simplified last year. To date, Shanghai, China's leading manufacturing center, has formed eight bonded enterprise groups, 187 bonded factories and 297 bonded warehouses, the director said. Moreover, the Shanghai Customs Office continued to crack down on all kinds of smuggling activities in 1993, he said. Last year, the office cleared up 526 smuggling cases involving smuggled goods worth a total of 222 million yuan (about 25 million U.S. dollars). Cao Hengli pledged to step up reforms in passenger inspection, ship inspection and bonded goods handling in the new year.
