FR940126-0-00008 FR940126-0-00006 GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 48 CFR Parts 538 and 552 [APD 2800.12A, CHGE51] General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation; Contractor Identification of Products With Environmental Attributes AGENCY: Office of Acquisition Policy, GSA. ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: The General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) is revised to further policies expressed in various statutes and executive orders that are intended to promote technological innovation and the development of products that reduce energy consumption, conserve natural resources, and are less harmful to consumers and the environment. Established executive branch policy requires Federal agencies to adopt policies that encourage industries to develop such products and to maximize their use. This change to the GSAR prescribes a clause for inclusion in multiple award schedules that encourages offerors to identify those products that they market commercially with environmentally beneficial claims. DATES: Effective Date: January 28, 1994. Comment Date: Comments on the interim rule should be submitted to the address below on or before March 28, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of the final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to Ms. Marjorie Ashby, General Services Administration, Office of GSA Acquisition Policy, 18th and F Sts., NW., Washington, DC 20405. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Linfield, Office of GSA Acquisition Policy (202) 501&hyph;1224. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background Various statutes, including the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486), the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;549), and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.), require Federal agencies to consider energy-efficiency and other environmental considerations in their procurement practices. These requirements are reinforced in a number of executive orders, including Executive Orders 11912, 12759, 12843, 12845 and 12873. As a major procuring agency, the GSA, through its multiple awards schedule programs, provides encouragement to suppliers to produce products with environmental attributes and can assist Federal agencies in meeting their responsibilities expressed in the various statutes and executive orders through the identification of those products. B. Executive Order 12866 This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under multiple award schedules, contractors currently are required to submit certain marketing information with their offers and to publish and distribute to ordering agencies commercial catalogs and/or pricelists. This rule requests the voluntary identification of certain information currently submitted by contractors. D. Paperwork Reduction Act This regulation contains information collection and/or recordkeeping requirements that have been approved by OMB under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act and assigned OMB Control No. 3090&hyph;0250, Zero Burden Information Collection (expires 11/30/95). GSA believes that the time and financial resources necessary for members of the public to comply with the requirements of this rule are limited to those that are ordinarily incurred in the normal course of business activities. Specifically, contractors normally prepare catalogs and pricelists that are furnished to prospective buyers as a means of marketing and advertising the contractor's products.
