FBIS4-66030 "drweu103_e_94010" FBIS-WEU-94-103 Daily Report 27 May 1994 UNITED KINGDOM Health Chief Plays Down Fears of `Killer Bug' Health Chief Plays Down Fears of `Killer Bug' LD2705045594 London PRESS ASSOCIATION in English 0341 GMT 27 May 94 LD2705045594 London PRESS ASSOCIATION English BFN [By Amanda Brown, Health Correspondent, PA News] [Text] A leading Government health expert is insisting: "There is no killer bug sweeping the country." Dr Diana Walford, Director of the Public Health Laboratory Service [PHLS], attacked the barrage of publicity over the flesh-eating disease necrotising fasciitis. She issued a new official list which showed there had been 15 cases due to the disease since January 1, including four of the seven reported cases from the Gloucestershire area. Although she did not specify how many of the cases had proved fatal, at least 10 deaths are being officially attributed to the disease. The move, aimed at calming growing public fears of an epidemic, followed a top-level meeeting of public health experts and microbiolgisits, who have painstakingly sifted through the figures. Dr Walford's comments came as cases continued to emerge of the horrifying virus which can devour flesh in hours. The unofficial death toll this year rose to 13 with news of the case of an 85-year-old woman from Bridgend, Mid Glamorgan, earlier this month, but there were also reports of a 71-year-old woman who died in March from the bug in a Newcastle upon Tyne hospital. Dr Walford said of the official statistics: "These low figures therefore confirm that necrotising fasciitis arising from Group A Streptococci (bacteria) remains a rare disease. "The public should be reassured that there is no `killer bug' sweeping the country." Earlier yesterday, Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley appealed for calm, insisting everything possible was being done to fight the bug. She did not think it was necessary to make it a notifiable disease. "The Chief Medical Officer is briefing ministers regularly. There is no evidence that the numbers we are seeing are untoward," she added. Shadow health secretary David Blunkett called for the Government to reverse cutbacks and redundancies planned for the PHLS. He said: Instead of acting swiftly to maximise safety and to allay the understandable fears of many people, the Government is axing the vital research designed to protect us from this type of threat. "Virginia Bottomley cannot simply sit tight and hope that this outbreak is going to disappear." The widow of a man killed by the flesh-eating bug received a letter from a hospital saying he was getting better -- three days after he was cremated on January 28. Doreen Bargery was told by St Peter's Hospital in Cherstey, Surrey, that Les was making "slow but shaky progress", more than a week after he died. Mr Fash, chief executive at St Peter's Hospital, said: "We did apologise to Mrs Bargery profusely at the time. Mrs Bargery is understandably very upset about her husband's death. "We were investigating a number of points she raised about her husband's illness and we had kept in touch with her husband's case periodically."
