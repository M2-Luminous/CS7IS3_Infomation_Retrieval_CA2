FR940825-2-00143 FR940825-2-00095 [Release No. 34&hyph;34545; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;04] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1 to a Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to Equity Linked Debt Securities August 18, 1994. On March 1, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change relating to Equity Linked Debt Securities (``ELDS''). Notice and partial accelerated approval of the proposal appeared in the Federal Register on April 7, 1994. 3 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. On July 15, 1994, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. 4 This order approves the remainder of the Exchange's proposal, as amended. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1982). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 The Commission granted partial accelerated approval of that portion of the proposal providing for alternative minimum market capitalization and trading volume requirements for the security underlying an ELDS. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33841 (March 31, 1994), 59 FR 16671 (April 7, 1994) (``Exchange Act Release No. 33841''). 4 The changes proposed in Amendment No. 1 are described herein. See Letter from Daniel Odell, Assistant Secretary, NYSE, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated July 14, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). ELDS are intermediate-term (two to seven years), non-convertible, hybrid securities, the value of which is based, at least in part, on the value of another issuer's common stock or other equity security. 5 ELDS may pay periodic interest or may be issued as zero-coupon instruments with no payments to holders prior to maturity. 6 Furthermore, ELDS may be subject to a ``cap'' on the maximum principal amount to be repaid to holders upon maturity and, additionally, may feature a ``floor'' on the minimum principal amount to be repaid to holders upon maturity. 5 The Commission approved the Exchange's ELDS listing standards on January 13, 1994. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33468 (January 13, 1994), 59 FR 3387 (January 21, 1994) (``Exchange Act Release No. 33468''). 6 The Exchange has agreed to notify the Commission if an issuer of ELDS provides for periodic interest payments to holders based on a floating rate. Id. The Commission, at that time, may require the NYSE to submit a rule filing pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act prior to permitting the Exchange to list an ELDS with such terms. In addition to the Exchange's requirements with respect to a particular issuance of ELDS, 7 ELDS must also conform to the special listing criteria set forth in Paragraph 703.21 of the Manual which provide that: (1) An issuer of ELDS must satisfy the Exchange's listing criteria; 8 (2) each issuer must have a minimum tangible net worth of $150 million; (3) the original issue price of the ELDS, combined with all of the issuer's other ELDS listed on a national securities exchange or otherwise publicly traded in the United States, may not be greater than 25% of the issuer's net worth at the time of issuance; (4) each underlying linked security must have either (i) a market capitalization of at least $3.0 billion and a trading volume of at least 2.5 million shares in the one-year period preceding the listing of the ELDS, or (ii) a market capitalization of at least $1.5 billion and a trading volume of at least 20 million shares in the one-year period preceding the listing of the ELDS; 9 (5) the issuer of the underlying security must be a U.S. reporting company under the Act; (6) the underlying security must be traded on a national securities exchange or traded through the facilities of a national securities association; (7) the underlying security must be subject to last sale reporting; and (8) except under limited circumstances, the issuance of ELDS relating to any underlying security may not exceed five percent of the total shares outstanding of such underlying security. 10 7 Under Section 703.21 of the Exchange's Listed Company Manual (``Manual''), an issue of ELDS must have: (1) A minimum public distribution of one million trading units and a minimum of 400 unit holders; (2) an aggregate market value of at least $4 million; and (3) a term of 2&hyph;7 years. 8 If the issuer is an NYSE-listed company, the issuer must be a company in good standing ( i.e. , above the Exchange's continued listing criteria set forth in Section 802 of the Manual); if the issuer is an affiliate of an NYSE-listed company, the NYSE-listed company must be in good standing; and if otherwise, the issuer must satisfy the Exchange's initial listing criteria set forth in Sections 102.02&hyph;102.03 and 103.01&hyph;103.05 of the Manual. See Exchange Act Release No. 33468, supra note 5, at notes 10 and 11. 9 See Exchange Act Release No. 33841, supra note 3. 10 The only exceptions to this restriction are where either (1) the issuer of the ELDS and the issuer of the underlying security are affiliated; or (2) the issuer of the ELDS holds an amount of the underlying security at least equal to the amount of the underlying security represented by the ELDS. In either case, the maximum percentage of ELDS that may be issued will be evaluated by the Exchange on a case-by-base basis in consultation with, and with the approval of, the staff of the Commission.
