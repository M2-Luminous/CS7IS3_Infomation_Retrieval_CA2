"It is of great significance for China to hold the convention," said Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, today at the founding ceremony of the IAGC Organizing Committee, when its first session was also held. The top procurator said China has consistently cracked down on the crimes of embezzlement and graft in order to build a clean and honest government. He claimed that China has achieved great successes in its anti- corruption drives since its founding in 1949, especially the one since August 1993 till now. According to the Supreme People's Procuratorate, more than 22,000 corruption cases were investigated between September last year and March this year, among which 37 are major cases involving more than 1 million yuan each, 789 involve money from 100,000 to 1 million yuan each and nearly 10,000 cases involve sums between 10,000 and 100,000 yuan each. Nine hundred and four officials above the county level were punished according to the law in that period, of which 71 rank at the city level. Zhang said the "Beijing conference" will not only seek academic exchanges, but also promote international cooperation to fight against embezzlement and graft. "The problem of embezzlement has been internationalized," he said. "China is even more in need of such cooperation in the time of reform and opening to the world." Zhang said the motif of the conference will be "anti-graft and social stability and development." The international anti-graft conference is an international academic meeting for the exchange of experience in curbing and imposing punishment upon embezzlement, and research into methods for international cooperation. The conference is held every two years. Its participants are mainly government officials, judges, procurators, police chiefs, lawyers, experts and professors from around the world.
