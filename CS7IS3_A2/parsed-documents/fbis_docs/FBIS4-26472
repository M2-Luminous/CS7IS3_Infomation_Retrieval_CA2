The five principles, which were first proposed by China and were then initially advocated by China, India and Myanmar (the former Burma) have had great impact on China's diplomacy and international relations, said former Chinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua in a recent interview with XINHUA. In the interview, the veteran diplomat said that the five principles of peaceful co-existence, namely mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit and peaceful co-existence, were the result of a developing process. Back on the eve of the founding of New China, Huang recalled, late Chairman Mao Zedong had spelled out three principles -- equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect for territory and sovereignty -- as the basis for China to establish diplomatic links with foreign countries. Huang, foreign minister in the late 1970s and early 1980s, recalled that China proposed the addition of "non-interference in each other's internal affairs" as a new principle to the above three principles in a Sino-Soviet pact signed in February, 1950. At a meeting in Beijing with an Indian Government delegation in December, 1953, late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai put forward for the first time the five principles of peaceful co-existence, which met with warm response from India, Huang said. On June 28, 1954, China and India issued a joint statement in which the two countries affirmed that the five principles of peaceful co-existence should be the criterion guiding bilateral relations, Huang noted. "And that day was regarded as the birthday of the five principles," he said, adding that on the same month, these principles were also clearly stated in a Sino-Burmese statement. The five principles received warm support from newly-independent countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, Huang continued. The five principles had been accepted by more and more countries and international organizations after the Bandung Conference in April, 1954, in Indonesia, at which ten principles were drawn up on the basis of the five principles, Huang said. Fu Hao, former deputy foreign minister of China, said that the five principles played an important role in making New China's voice heard across the world when China was blocked and relatively isolated. Fu, a political counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in India in the 1950s, said that Sino-Indian relations improved quickly after the proclamation of the five principles, and "China fever" was seen in India as a result. The Indian people often mentioned the five principles when meeting with Chinese personnel. The then Indian ambassador to China, the second ambassador to this country, before leaving his post for home, asked Chairman Mao's signature as a memento. Mao obliged by writing two lines of ancient Chinese verse on a white paper cover of a fan: "A bosom friend afar brings the distance closer." Former Deputy Foreign Minister Han Nianlong said the five principles had undergone dozens of years of tests in a changing world. Time had shown that international relations could not be handled fairly and reasonably in the forms of big family, group politics, power sphere or world leader, Han said. He added that the five principles, emphasizing solving international conflicts through negotiations and talks on equal footings, are in keeping with the developing trend of the world. Wu Xueqian, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and former foreign minister, believed that the five principles are important in the international arena because they go beyond the limits by social system and ideology, and conform to the principles of sovereignty and equality specified in the United Nations charter. Wu added that the five principles are clearer and easier to understand than the UN Charter. On the current significance of the five principles, Liu Shuqing, president of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and former vice-foreign minister, said the five principles had always put a rein on the practices of hegemonism and power politics. Despite the end of the Cold War, Liu said, the phenomenon of unfair play is very common in world affairs, and peace and development are facing serious challenges. In recent years, a few powers, propagating "sovereignty is outmoded," and "human rights ahead of sovereignty," have tried to interfere in other countries' internal affairs, Liu said, which indicates that though the five principles have been accepted by the world, not all countries act accordingly. "At present many countries are very concerned with establishing a new international political and economic order," Liu said. "What kind of new order does the world need? it is clear that the new order cannot be just and reasonable and accepted by most countries unless it is based on the five principles of peaceful co-existence," he stressed.
