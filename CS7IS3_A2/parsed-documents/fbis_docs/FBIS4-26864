Announcing the shakeups in his Oval Office at the White House, Clinton named Ms. Alice Rivlin, deputy director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, to succeed Panetta, becoming the first woman to head the White House Office of Management and Budget. David Gergen, a White House senior adviser, would move to the U.S. State Department as a special adviser to both President Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. McLarty, Clinton's lifelong friend, has been widely criticized as "too nice" to be effective. Speaking from his Oval Office, Clinton said the shakeups were first suggested by McLarty who would remain a senior counselor to the President. Clinton said McLarty "has been and will continue to be most closest and most trusted personal adviser," taking greater responsibility in promoting the administration's agenda on capital hill. No one in Washington has a better understanding of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue (the White House and Congress) than Leon Panetta, Clinton said of his new chief of staff. In his brief remarks at the announcement, Panetta known as a deficit hawk signaled a wider shakeups, saying that "changes will be made in consultation with the President." David Gergen, a former Republican adviser who joined the White House staff a year ago to help deal with a spate of negative publicity, made clear, however, that he doesn't intend to remain long in the administration. Clinton made the changes as debate heated up on his health care proposal and as the dollar came under intense pressure on world currency markets, observers here said. The changes also come at a time when Clinton's approval ratings are declining. A recent poll said only 42 percent of Americans gave the President a positive rating, they noted.
