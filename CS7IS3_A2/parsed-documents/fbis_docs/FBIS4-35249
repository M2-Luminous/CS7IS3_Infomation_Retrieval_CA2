They are being kept hostage by an Afghan gun-runner Mullah Bockeri, reliable sources said here Monday. The attack coincided with the recent two-day visit of Federal Interior Minister General (Retd) Naseerullah Babar to Noshki, a north-western bordering town, 140 kilometres off here. The sources said that assault at Tazai Rabat (a sub-tehsil) in District Shahjoi of Zabul Province -- the stronghold of Mullah Salam Rocketi, has sofar been unsuccessful because Sulemankhail and Tarak tribesmen from the neighbouring Ghazni Province have dispatched reinforcements to repulse the Frontier Corps' (FC) offensive. Sources said that the heavy exchange of fire had been continuing for the last two days but there was no report of any casualty from either side. Mullah Salam is holding two Chinese engineers, five employees of Balochistan development Authority (BDA), Deputy Commissioner Ziarat, his driver and gunman as hostages for the last several months seeking ransom and return of his "two Stinger missiles" captured by the FC from his residence inside Pakistan in January last year. In retaliation Mullah Salam's armed men abducted 30 FC personnel including a major after exchange of fire and taken them to Zabul. The soldiers were released after payment of ransom and a promise for returning his Stinger missiles. Last month Salam released two BDA employees on the pursuance of a spiritual leader but had set conditions for release of other hostages. Sources said the FC's attack could provoke the Afghan gun-runner who might harm the hostages.
