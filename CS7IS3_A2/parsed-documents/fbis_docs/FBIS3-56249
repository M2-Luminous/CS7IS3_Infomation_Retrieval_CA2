The Jewish community said the Vilnius-based RESPUBLIKA newspaper uses every opportunity to slander Jews. The statement's authors said the way RESPUBLIKA treats the Jewish nation often resembles statements by the leader of the Russian liberal democrats, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. No specific examples are indicated in the letter, but the community said it is not the first time that shades of anti-Semitism appear in the Lithuanian press. RESPUBLIKA is the second biggest newspaper in Lithuania with a daily circulation of around 80,000.
