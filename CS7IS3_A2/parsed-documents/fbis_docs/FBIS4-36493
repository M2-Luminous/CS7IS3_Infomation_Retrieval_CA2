Vivekanand] [Text] Amman--The Jordanian economy performed well in the first five months of 1994 and could be expected to register a growth between five and six percent during the year, Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) Governor Muhammad al-Nabulsi said Tuesday. Briefing the local media in an informal meeting at the CBJ, the governor also said the Kingdom had to adopt more rationalisation and belt-tightening measures with a view to gaining optimum benefit from the utilisation of resources. Dr. al-Nabulsi cited as examples the amount the government spends on higher education with little direct returns and the indirect subsidies offered to consumers in the water and energy sector and said revenue collection should also be improved. Exports improved by 20 percent and imports showed a 15 percent decline in the first quarter of this year when compared with the corresponding period in 1993, but the trend could change during the rest of the year, Dr. al-Nabulsi said. He expected inflation to remain under five percent. Some sectors of the economy did show stagnation, but other sectors performed better than expected to make up for the shortfall and project an overall growth, he said. The nature of investments is in "the right direction" and expatriate remittances have also improved, the CBJ governor said. Jordan hopes to open debt rescheduling talks with the Paris Club of creditor governments later this month on repayments maturing until the date of an agreement, he said, adding that the amount covered would be in the region of $420 million including principle and interest. The Kingdom would also be seeking to reschedule dues to the Paris Club maturing in another 18 months--until the end of 1995. He estimated that the Kingdom would have to pay around $400 million for streamlining the expected agreement with Paris Club. Jordan has scored impressive success by implementing the economic restructuring and recovery programme agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but there are shortcomings in adopting corrective measures in the water and energy sector, Dr. al-Nabulsi said, noting that the water and electricity tariffs did not actually reflect the cost of production and distribution. Jordan is expected to receive $180 million in assistance from the IMF and World Bank in three years to help its balance of payments, and the Kingdom has already received the first tranche of $14 million, he said. However, the delays in implementing the corrective measures were also delaying further payments. "It is not simply a matter of consumption," he said. "We have to adopt major measures in the water and energy sectors in terms of realistic tariffs." In the banking sector, the CBJ was switching to "indirect controls" rather than direct measures such as ceilings on credit facilities and restrictions on the activities of commercial banks. The objective, Dr. al-Nabulsi said, is to influence the policies and decisions of commercial banks in a manner that would serve the economy and ensure the best utilisation of available resources. So far this year, commercial banks have remained within the indirect limitations of credit facilities that the CBJ is forced to adopt as recommended by the IMF. It was the first time in several years that the limits were respected and adhered to, avoiding problems for the authorities to regulate the situation. Developed countries use securities and bonds as a tool to control excess liquidity and inflation, Dr. al-Nabulsi pointed out, adding that Jordan adopted the certificates of deposit system eight months before it was supposed to have started it under the IMF programme. The relative slump in the Amman Financial Market (AFM) cannot be taken as an indicator of the economy's performance since individuals and institutions motivated by speculative interests are the main players in the bourse, Dr. al-Nabulsi noted, adding that the stock market cannot be seen as a productive sector contributing to national growth. The CBJ had no direct role to play in the AFM except perhaps controlling the involvement of commercial banks and financial institutions in portfolios. At the same time, Dr. al-Nabulsi noted that the decline at the AFM was around four to five percent since the beginning of the year and described it as insignificant compared with the 30 percent drop posted in the Tel Aviv exchange and the general recession in other stock markets around the world. The CBJ will continue to maintain restrictions on transfers in order to prevent capital flight, but does not plan any additional regulations, the governor said. Such regulations only apply to residents, he added. Jordan is prepared to face any eventuality resulting from possible negative economic and monetary measures adopted by the Palestinian self-rule authority, including the possible issuance of a Palestinian currency, he said. The logic in the situation is that any such measure will affect both Jordanians and Palestinians on both sides of the river, and, as such, it is unlikely that Jordan would face any serious problems, whether in terms of capital flight or even the possible dumping of the Jordanian dinar, Dr. al-Nabulsi said. "It is not a zero-sum game," where one will lose everything to the benefit of the other, he said, noting that a majority of the Palestinians in the occupied territories maintain their savings in the Jordanian dinar. Dr. al-Nabulsi noted that Jordanian commercial banks have started operating in the occupied lands after a 27-year hiatus and this offers the CBJ direct monitoring of the situation there. Commercial institutions may transfer Jordanian money to the occupied territories as economic development of the area picks up momentum, but the presence of the Jordanian banks is the best means for the CBJ to exercise its options to defend the Kingdom's monetary system, he added. In any event, "we are well prepared to deal with any eventuality," he said. The CBJ governor said between JD 350 and JD 400 million remain in circulation in he occupied territories. There are many solutions to the issue and the best is an integration of the Jordanian and Palestinian currencies as and when the Palestinians issue their own tender, Dr. al-Nabulsi said. In the meantime, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) has agreed that the self-rule authority in the occupied territories would use the dinar in all their internal official dealings, including salaries and taxes, he said.
