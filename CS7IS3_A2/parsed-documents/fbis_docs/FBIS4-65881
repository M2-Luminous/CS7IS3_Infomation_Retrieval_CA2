Were France to take such an initiative on its own, 77 percent of people would oppose it, according to a survey by the polling institute IFOP for publication in Wednesday's Globe-Hebdo magazine. In all, 29 percent of 974 people questioned in the telephone poll said they opposed French intervention even as part of a joint operation. If "the Europeans and Americans refused" to intervene in the conflict, 20 percent of those questioned said they would favour action by France alone. A "solidarity train" was meanwhile to leave Paris for Zagreb stacked with packages for refugee camps in former Yugoslavia, in an initiative by the French humanitarian association Europa/l'Odyssee, reports said. The Paris-Zagreb solidarity train, an idea backed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, will leave Paris on June 18 and make stops in Geneva and Milan before arriving in Zagreb the following day. During the journey, doctors, psychiatrists and humanitarian officials will debate the trauma of war and the "art of living in peace," organizers said.
