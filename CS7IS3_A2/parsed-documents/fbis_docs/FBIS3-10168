Facusse made the disclosure during a speech at the CCIT's ordinary assembly, during which he discussed the problems that manufacturing firms are facing. "Mistaken labor leaders are raising new flags of nationalism inspired and propelled by foreign currency. U.S. labor unions are financing campaigns to destabilize Honduras with results that should worry us all, especially Honduran workers," he said. Facusse said in light of the unions' destructive eagerness, no foreign company will establish itself in Honduras, and those already established here will move to other countries, thus causing us to lose 40,000 jobs. Facusse also said the price of the lempira in comparison to the dollar should fluctuate constantly, as do the European currencies and the Japanese yen. He expressed satisfaction over the decision by President Carlos Roberto Reina's government to officially devaluate the lempira, which, unofficially, remains at two to one. Facusse said the prices of European currencies and the yen "fluctuate constantly on the international market, and I see no reason why the lempira should not do the same; furthermore, this situation is having a tremendous effect on the country's imports, which have been continually subsidized and have complicated Honduras' balance of properties and services, thereby contributing to the continuous deterioration of the lempira." "We must export more but, unfortunately, we have not been doing this due to a number of circumstances. If the lempira is officially devaluated, which may happen, imports will concurrently decrease." Facusse said with implementation of the customs value factor (FVA), which is a fiscal mechanism, the currency has been undergoing continuous devaluations due to speculation. The FVA, he added, "has not been to our advantage; we have used it to promote imports, and the commercial deficit may reach approximately $450 million, which we are going to have to pay, and we lack the foreign currency to do so."
