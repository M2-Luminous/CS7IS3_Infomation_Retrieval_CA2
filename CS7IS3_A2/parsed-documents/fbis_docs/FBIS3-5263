As a result, a large number of Cambodian civilians have crossed the border into Thailand. The governor of Surin, Kopkun Thonglongya, spoke to the Public Relations Department correspondent: [Begin Kopkun recording] The fighting broke out at an early hour yesterday and continued until 1100. As a result, we had to suspend the opening of the border passes. What caused a big concern for us was the influx of about 2,000 refugees from Cambodia. Anyway, after the fighting died down, our military, police, and civilian officials, as well as territorial defense volunteers pushed the refugees back into Cambodia. None of them are still in Thailand. This fighting happens every month. There are exchanges of gunfire and our border villagers are used to it by now. What we feared was that the Cambodians who fled into Thailand might refuse to go back. We are also concerned about stray shells which might hit our people, their homes and property. If we can prevent the two things, then we have nothing to worry about since we have nothing to do with their fighting. [end recording]
