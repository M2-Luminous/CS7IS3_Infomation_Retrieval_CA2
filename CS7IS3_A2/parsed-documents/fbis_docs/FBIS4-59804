[passage omitted] The sacred time for hajj is upon us with its eternal resources for the Islamic ummah. Thanks be to God for this unending gift and this ever-vital spring, by the grace of which Muslims of the world can benefit and reap rewards according to their own efforts and wisdom. The extent and variety of the interests and issues which the divine hand, with its knowledge and wisdom, has fitted into the duty of hajj is of a magnitude which cannot be found in any other Islamic precept, ranging from spiritual presence and thought and the self- discovery of the Islamic individual in finding himself alone with God, and the cleansing of the heart from the dirt of sin and negligence, to the sense felt by the individual who finds himself among a crowd and the sense of unity felt by each Muslim with the entire Islamic ummah, and the sense of strength arising from the greatness of the gathering together of Muslims and to the effort made by every individual to attain a cure from spiritual wounds and diseases, that is, from sins, to curiosity and the will to understand and heal the profound scars and pains affecting the body of the ummah, to fellow-feelings with all Muslim nations, that is, the members of that body, are all contained in the hajj and its various rites and rituals. The Koran describes the actions carried out during the hajj as rituals. This means that they are not merely individual actions aimed at fulfilling an individual duty; they are, rather, gestures intended to raise the level of insight and wisdom of the human beings who perform them. Underlying all these gestures is monotheism, that is, the rejection of all powers that, in some way, take possession of the bodies and souls of human beings and the establishment of the absolute rule of God over one's entire existence. In other words, the rule of an Islamic system and Islamic regulations over the individual and social lives of Muslims. Included in the Koranic verses referring to the hajj, the Koran calls on everyone to disavow the idols worshipped by the infidels: But shun the abomination of idols, and shun the word that is false. [preceding Koranic verse read in Arabic] These idols may in some instances refer to the idols which were placed around the Ka'ba; but, undoubtedly, today and at all times, they also refer to those powers that have unjustly taken charge of the lives of humanity and, today, refer clearest of all to the power of arrogance and the satanic power of the United States and the power of Western culture and the corruption and decadance which are inflicted on Islamic countries and nations. Of course, the pseudo-theologians affiliated to and in the pay of the governments-made-of-straw will insist that, no, those idols refer merely to Manat, Ellat, and Hubal, those very same idols that were crushed and annihilated under the foot of the victorious soldiers of the Great Prophet, peace be upon him and his scion, on the day when Mecca was captured. The intention of these monarchical-clergy is to empty the hajj of all political content to suit their own taste, ignorant of the fact that this very millions- strong gathering of Muslims that has come together from every corner of the world in one place at one time itself contains the richest political content. This is a display put on by the Islamic ummah in which all differences of race, language, geography, and history are set aside and in which everyone joins together to form a whole. In order to prevent Muslims from understanding the significance of this great unity and in order to prevent individuals from gaining a sense of collectivity, these pseudo-clergymen and their masters have used every kind of lie, deceit, and falsehood and will continue to do so in order to make life as difficult as possible for the people who call for unity and invite the pilgrims to disavow the ring leaders of infidelity. Islamic Iran wished to do nothing more than the minimum required by the hajj and that was to issue a call to unity to all Muslims, to invite all nations to learn the truth about one another and to ask people to express their hatred and revulsion of the ring leaders of infidelity and corruption. Anyone who stands against these valuable and lofty aims is speaking unjustly, regardless of what he says. As the Koran says: Shun the word that is false. The word that is false is the unjust statements made by those who speak ill of the Islamic Republic, because the Islamic Republic rejects the rule of the Zionist government over occupied Palestine and considers as valueless the compromises made with the usurpers by a few corrupt and isolated individuals. It condemns the master-like interventions of the United States in Arabic countries. It exposes the ugliness of the treachery of some Islamic leaders against their own Muslim nations for the pleasure of the United States and the Zionists. It calls on Muslims to recognize their own tremendous strength which no superpower can withstand today. It deems Islamic insight and the rules of Shari'ah as capable of ruling Islamic countries. It considers the imposed culture of the West, the manifestation of which lies in nakedness, drunkeness, and faithlessness, to be harmful for Islamic countries, and, in a word, insists on obedience to the Koran and Islam. Today, any Islamic country that states these things openly and adopts these same positions, that is, rejects usurper Israel, rejects the bullying interventions of the United States, rejects drunkeness, decadence, sexual corruption, and the mingling together of men and women, rejects the treachery of those who compromise with Israel, calls on Muslims to unite against and resist the superpowers, implements the rulings of Islam in government, the economy, politics, and so on, will be on the receiving end of exactly the same kind of propaganda which is spread throughout the world against Islamic Iran and exactly the kind of insults and falsehoods which are directed against the leaders of this country. And the news agencies of the arrogant powers and Zionism and the radios of the United States and Britain and their allies will speak in exactly the same insulting way, with exactly the same kind of nonsense, about them. This is what was meant by: the word that is false, which was put alongside and on the same level as infidelity by God. How amazing that preachers and rulers in some corners of the world imitate these anti-Islamic and religiously forbidden actions of the propagandists of the United States and the Zionists. Of course, the total submission to tyrannical rulers that, unfortunately, is the destiny of clergymen in some Islamic countries should not really be a source of amazement. Today, the hajj, God's great blessing, is before you. Every single Muslim and every member of the Islamic ummah must benefit from it and as has been commanded [passage omitted], benefit from it to the advantage of their world and their religion. Today, the religion of Muslims is threatened by the enemy's cultural onslaught and the spread of corruption, injustice, faithlessness, and decadance among Islamic societies; something that is happening on the initiative of anti-Islamic powers and with the help of their propaganda and media, and the world of Muslims is threatened by the ever-increasing hegemony of arrogance over the affairs of Islamic countries and by the ever-increasing pressure on and hostility against any government or group that wishes to direct the minds of people toward the true rule of Islam and toward the independence and strength of Muslim nations. And, of course, at the head of this all-embracing attack against Islam is the Great Satan, that is, the Government of the United States. Any clear-sighted eye can see the hand and will of that anti-Islamic government behind all the misfortunes which are inflicted on Islam and Muslims. In occupied Palestine, the main reason behind the strong- headedness and the boldness of the Zionists and the most important factor behind the compromise made by most Arab governments before the endless demands of Israel is the United States. Without the backing of the United States, the reactionary governments of the region, which are well known for their submissiveness to the United States, would not have turned into the defenders of the usurping government and into the supposed defenders of those Palestinians who are against compromise. And those who, according to their Islamic duties, must stand against Israel would not don the clothes of those who stand against the opponents of Israel. And, without the unconditional support of the United States, the usurping government would not have been able to bring about a great tragedy such as the massacre [in Hebron] at the noble shrine of Abraham, peace be upon him, and to avoid suffering all the consequences of such an action. A similar situation applies to the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The historical massacre of the people of Gorazde and Sarajevo by the Serbs, which can truly be seen as ranking among the most shameful deeds committed by humanity in our times, is a huge crime, the responsibility for which must be borne by the powers who dominate the world and, more than any other power, by the United States. If it were not for their interference and their policies, the Muslims of Bosnia would not have been deprived of receiving assistance in the form of weapons in the face of well-equipped and well-armed Serbs, and a defenceless and besieged nation would not have been sacrificed to blood thirsty, shameless and encouraged aggressors. What is painful is that the United States and NATO, after laying the groundwork in this heartless way for the massacre of Bosnian Muslims, after using the United Nations and its secretary general totally for their own ends, after displaying signs of their own pleasure at the killing of Muslims at the hands of the Serbs, and after several weeks passed since the savage attack of the aggressors against Muslim women, children, the old, and the young and the death of thousands of innocent people and the inflicting of suffering on such a scale on the people of the city of Gorazde, after all that to call a halt to the torture and describe that as humanitarianism, love of peace and neutrality. Is it the case that, when an executioner stops torturing a person after hours and days, he can claim to be humane and use as evidence of his humanity the fact that he has stopped torturing his victim? This apparently neutral, but in practice aggressive, stand against Muslims, is seen in the United states and its European collaborators, such as Britain, in every incident in which innocent Muslims constitute one side, and are subjected to their enemies' oppressive behavior and pressure. Among the examples are the sorrowful events of Kashmir and the intense suffering of the Muslims in Nagorno-Karabakh and Tajikistan. Wherever a government or a gathering chant slogans of Islam, and strive for the establishment of the rule of Islam, they become the inevitable targets of America's abuse, slander, ruthlessness, and malicious hostility. Clear examples have been shown toward the Sudanese Government, Algeria's Islamic movement, Lebanon's Hizballah, Hamas, Palestine's Islamic Jihad, Muslims of Egypt, and so on. In all these cases, the agents of global arrogance and above all the United States have been displaying fanatical behavior similar to that of tribal communities. The case of the United States' malicious hostilities, accompanied by wrath and injustice against Islamic Iran -- although in most cases ineffective thanks to the divine will and blessing -- is in itself a separate issue, of which many in the world are aware. Now, do the great Islamic ummah, its leaders and politicians, intellectuals and religious authorities have no responsibilities with regard to this tragic plight of Muslims throughout the world? Do these people, who on the basis of the words spoken by the great prophet of Islam, may God's blessing be upon him and his scion, who said: He who shows no interest in the affairs of Muslims is no Muslim [preceding Koranic verse in Arabic] -- know of an occasion more suitable than the hajj to the House of God and of a time more suitable than the days of the revelations for displaying this important obligation. It was indeed not without reason that the exalted prophet, may God's blessing be upon him and his scion, chose the hajj period for promulgating the disavowal of infidels, which is a totally political activity within the framework of the very first Islamic government's general policy. He proclaimed a divine and Koranic command: And an announcement from God and His apostle, to the people assembled on the day of that great pilgrimage. That God and His apostle, dissolve treaty obligations with the pagans. If then, you repent, it would be best for you, but if you turn away, know you that you cannot frustrate god. And proclaim a grievous penalty to those who reject faith. [preceding Koranic verse in Arabic] Indeed, the hajj is a religious duty during which and by way of which the most important political difficulties of the Islamic ummah can be resolved. For that reason, the hajj is a political-religious duty, the peculiarities of which have made this very apparent. Those who deny this and propagandize against it are in effect against the resolution of those difficulties. In brief, the hajj is a religious duty which concerns the ummah, the unity, the rule of Muslims, the improvement of the individual and the community, and in a nutshell, this world and the hereafter. Those who do not want to accept the political connotations of hajj, in effect want to keep Islam away from politics and separate religion from politics. The issue of separating religion from politics is that very point which the enemies of Islam have been raising for decades. Today, because a government based on the sacred religion of Islam has been set up in Iran, and the ever-increasing enthusiasm for the formation of Islamic governments has engulfed the entire Islamic world, the arrogants are raising that issue of separating religion from politics with more vigor and haste. Wherever they see the preparations for the realization of this aim of forming Islamic governments, they enter the scene with force and aggression to fight against it. The rule of Islam requires resistance to the intervention of the arrogants in Islamic countries. It also warrants the need to keep away those who are dependent on these powers, and the slaves of the satan of selfish desires and arrogance, from ruling these countries. It is therefore natural that arrogance and those who depend on it, and the satans and their followers should be angry about the rule of Islam. By the same token, those who believe in God and the Day of Judgement should welcome it and strive toward it. Now that a number of people from all over the world have had the fortune of perceiving [as heard] the period of revelations and the hajj to the House of God, I in all sincerity and modesty beseech the almighty to accept their pilgrimage and to endow them and the entire Muslim ummah with pilgrimage benefits. I make the following recommendations to the brothers and sisters: One: Seize this opportunity for self-making, repentance, and pleading to God and store spiritual assets to last you for the rest of your life. Two: Ask Almighty God to eliminate great obstacles along the path of the Muslims; and keep repeating this request again and again in every prayer and hymns. Three: Seize every opportunity to become acquainted with Muslims from other countries. Learn a lesson from the positive and negative points of their daily life. Non-Iranian Muslims should particularly hear the truth and circumstances of Islamic Iran from the mouths of their Iranian brothers, so that they discover for themselves whether the global propaganda against Iran is right or wrong. Today and always, they should strive to learn the instructions of the late imam, His Eminence Imam Khomeyni, may God bless his soul, on Muslim issues. They should become better and more closely familiar with that illustrious and pious personality of Islam's history. Four: All the accurate information and knowledge you have acquired on the situation of the Islamic ummah or about your own country, pass it on to the Muslims from other countries. Five: During conversations with your Muslim brothers, from every corner of the Islamic world, bear in mind the plight of the Islamic ummah and view the solidarity of the Islamic world. Take your thoughts and others' thoughts beyond the confinement of geographical borders, racial, ideological, factional, and other such divides. Think only of Islam and Muslims. Six: Keep reminding your conversation partners to think of the God-given might of more than one billion Muslims and dozens of Islamic countries with so much material and spiritual wealth and with a huge heritage of culture, civilization, faith, and ethics. Seven: Break the myth of the West's invincible might and particularly that of the United States, which global arrogance has always tried to magnify several times above reality and has tried to instill into the Muslims' minds. Remind yourselves and others that the Communist might, which on the surface seemed insurmountable, collapsed in our region and in front of this same generation's eyes. Nothing is left of that might now. The existing over-inflated powers, including the might of the United States, may be destroyed and annihilated just as easily. Eight: Keep reminding the religious ulema and intellectuals of the Muslim countries of their immense burden of responsibility. Nine: Remind the heads of Islamic states of their obligation to the Islamic ummah, which is to create unity among Muslims, to keep away from global powers, to incline and rely on their own nations, and to create healthy relations between the people and the rulers. Such a reminder by you is a duty in accordance with the Koranic verse which says: The imams of the Muslims need advising. [preceding verse in Arabic] Afterwards ask Almighty God to rectify this matter. Ten: Remember always that when we say the heads of state are responsible, it does not mean the individual members of a nation have no responsibility. Rather, they can play a decisive role in the realization of all these great goals. It is hoped that with divine help and kind considerations of the Imam of the Era, may our souls be sacrificed for him and may God hasten his lofty advent, the esteemed pilgrims' hajj rituals will be accepted by God. I beseech God to bestow his blessings and vast mercy on the entire Islamic ummah and every individual among the Muslims. May God's peace be on all pious slaves.
