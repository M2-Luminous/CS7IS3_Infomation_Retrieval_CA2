They blame him for losing the war in Abkhazia and the total inability to rule the country. The leaders of these parties also added that Eduard Shevardnadze should be divested of extraordinary powers delegated to him by the republic's parliament, which make him the sole ruler of the country and which, allegedly, hamper the opposition in participating in the "state's creative processes."
