The amendment, which was passed by a vote of 62-38 and will attach to the State Department authorization bill, is not legally-binding. In response, White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said President Bill Clinton has not decided on the embargo but "welcome the Senate's sentiment on that." "The President has made changing relations with Vietnam contingent on progress on MIA and POW (soldiers missing in action and prisoners of war) issues," she said. Myers said the criteria for better ties with Hanoi include return of remains, resolution of discrepancy cases and cooperation with Laos on solving the MIA issue. "Progress has been made but the overall issue is still under review," she said.
