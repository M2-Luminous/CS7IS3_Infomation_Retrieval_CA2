To prevent a major epidemic with tragic consequences, the potential disaster must be treated with the same urgency and priority as the recent earthquake in the state, he urged. Dr. Mersen was delivering the keynote address at the first international conference on HIV/AIDS infection, tuberculosis and respiratory diseases, organised by the National Medical Association for AIDS Control, the Environment Medical Association of India and the Indian Academy of Health Education. He noted that the HIV/AIDS pandemic was bringing along with it a great increase in tuberculosis and, by the WHO estimates, the number of new TB cases each year worldwide were said to rise from 7.5 million in 1990 (with 2.1 million in India) to 12 million in 2005, part of the rise being due to the HIV epidemic. Between 1990 and 1999, eight million people are expected to have developed TB as a consequence of their HIV infection and will go on to infect more people with TB than HIV. Dr. Mersen expressed alarm as Asia following the path of Africa where the annual number of reported TB cases had almost tripled in the last five years. He said that an estimated one billion people in Asia were latently infected with tubercle bacilli. Already in India, more than 11 percent of reported TB patients in Manipur were HIV positive and at Bombay's JJ Hospital, HIV prevalence had risen from 2 percent in 1989 to 11 percent this year. Sixty percent of AIDS patients in the country had TB. To combat this dual infection, the prevention of HIV infection and the strengthening of TB control programmes, accelerating efforts to interrupt TB transmission by the curative treatment of TB cases had preventive therapy to stop HIV-infected people from developing TB are suggested by Dr. Mersen. He said that HIV infection could be prevented by taking into account the roots of transmission, namely contaminated needles when injecting drugs, inflected blood transfusion and unsafe sex practices. He advocated the widespread use of condoms and better prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) WHO estimates that the number of HIV infections in South and South-east Asia rose from 1.5 million to 2.5 million this past year and more than two in five of those infected were women. In India the estimated number of HIV infections has risen by 60 percent over the past year to around 1.6 million. Only a small number of Asians infected with HIV so far, around 75,000, had gone on to develop AIDS, said Dr. Mersen. He cautioned that the recent surge in the number of infections would be followed by a dramatic rise in AIDS cases in the next five years. By the year 2000, as many as 500,000 Asians are expected to develop AIDS annually. Sex education in schools was crucial, Dr. Mersen said. STD's must not only be treated at STD clinics which spell out stigmatisation to the patient but at every health centre. Clients of prostitutes need to be educated. For the treatment of STD's WHO recommends a simplified approach which does not require laboratory facilities. A mere physical examination and history-taking were sufficient, he said. Model treatment charge and training courses by WHO were being developed to help governments ensure widespread application of this simplified approach. Dr. S.P. Tripathi, director of the Indian Council of Medical Research, said all programmes for the control of TB and HIV were likely to be vitiated with the combined impact of these diseases. He feared the spread of multi-drug resistant strains in the country. Mr. Paban Singh Ghatowar, Union deputy minister of health and family welfare, who was the chief guest, admitted that in view of the alarming trends, HIV infection was now regarded as a development problem in India. Dr. S.R. Sallunkhe, additional director, health services, government of Maharashtra, said that of the 184,000 people screened in the state, 70 out of 1,000 were found HIV positive and 200 of the 238 cases in Maharashtra were from Bombay. The total number of AIDS cases in the country was a little over 500.
