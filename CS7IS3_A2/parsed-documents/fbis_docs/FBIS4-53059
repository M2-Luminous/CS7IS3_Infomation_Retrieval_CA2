The plan is in line with UN policy which stipulates that "preventive diplomacy" would be the international organization's new role in dealing with post-Cold War regional conflicts. Specifically, MOFA plans to promote a policy through which it hopes to prevent expansion of ethnic conflicts in the Balkan region by helping to bring about political stability in countries in the region. In order to do this, MOFA plans to actively provide aid to such countries as Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM], which has declared independence from the former Yugoslavia, and its neighbor, Albania, both of which lie near the areas of conflict in that region. Moreover, as MOFA places heavy emphasis on the roles of nongovernmental organizations (NGO), which have set up regional networks, it now plans to set up a "civilian support office" within the ministry. The office will have general supervision over NGO's which are engaged in activities overseas. As for "preventive diplomacy," the idea was taken up in a report which UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali made to the United Nations in 1992, entitled "Agenda for Peace." The idea has since been clearly incorporated in UN activities. At last year's General Assembly session, the United Nations adopted a resolution which approved conducting peacekeeping operations (PKO) for preventive purposes. It has become increasingly acknowledged that "it is becoming a global trend to recognize the importance of preventive diplomacy through which conflicts can be prevented beforehand by detecting indications of such conflicts well in advance, or through which on-going conflicts can be kept from spreading or developing into full-scale war" (as stated by a MOFA source). Moreover, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, upon his inauguration, said he plans to consider "preventive diplomacy" as part of "active diplomacy" which Japan will now pursue. According to MOFA, approximately 100 million yen was extended as subsidies to NGO's in fiscal year 1989. Since then, the government's subsidies have increased very sharply. For example, 440 million yen was allocated in fiscal year 1993, and 540 million yen has been allocated in the fiscal year 1994 draft budget. In addition, NGO's, for their part, have begun to be actively involved in preventive diplomacy. For example, an NGO called the "International Dispute Prevention Research Organization" is scheduled to be established on 19 May with the assistance of the UN University. This organization will focus its activities on preventive diplomacy.
