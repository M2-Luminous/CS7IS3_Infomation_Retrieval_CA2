ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to require that manufacturers, importers, and distributors report promptly to FDA any corrections or removals of a device undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) caused by the device which may present a risk to health. Manufacturers, distributors, and importers would not have to report actions taken to improve the performance or quality of a device which are not intended to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or remedy a violation of the act caused by the device. Nor would manufacturers, distributors, and importers have to report actions defined as routine servicing. FDA believes that the proposed reporting requirements are necessary to protect the public health by assuring that the agency has current and complete information regarding those actions taken to eliminate risk to health caused by devices. Reports of such actions will improve the agency's ability to evaluate device-related problems and to take prompt action against potentially dangerous devices. FDA is directed to implement this new authority by regulation under certain provisions of the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (the SMDA). DATES: Written comments by June 21, 1994. The agency proposes that any final rule that may issue based on this proposal become effective 30 days after the date of publication of the final rule. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857.

Samalik, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (HFZ&hyph;300), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301&hyph;594&hyph;4595. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Statutory Authority and Legislative History The current regulatory framework for medical devices is the result of four statutes: (1) The act (21 U.S.C. 321&hyph;394), (2) the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (Pub. L. 94&hyph;295) (the 1976 amendments), (3) the SMDA (Pub. L. 101&hyph;629), and (4) the Medical Device Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;300) (the 1992 amendments). The act prohibited the marketing of adulterated or misbranded devices. The 1976 amendments amended the act with new authority expressly designed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. The 1976 amendments gave FDA, for the first time, premarket controls over medical devices (e.g., classification, premarket notification, and premarket approval). Additionally, the 1976 amendments strengthened the act's postmarket controls relating to medical devices, giving FDA the authority to require patient notification; repair, replacement, or refund; reporting and recordkeeping; current good manufacturing practices (CGMP's); and restrictions on the distribution of certain devices. The SMDA, by streamlining in some places and augmenting authority in others, refines the premarket and postmarket controls relating to medical devices added to the act by the 1976 amendments. Among the provisions of the SMDA that augment postmarket controls is the reports and records of corrections and removals requirement of section 519(f) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360i(f)). Section 519(f) of the act directs FDA to promulgate regulations requiring reporting and recordkeeping of correction and removal actions taken by device manufacturers, distributors, and importers. Under section 519(f)(1) of the act, device manufacturers, distributors, and importers are to report promptly to FDA any correction or removal of a device undertaken: (1) To reduce a risk to health posed by the device; or (2) to remedy a violation of the act caused by a device which may present a risk to health. Section 519(f)(1) of the act also requires manufacturers, distributors, and importers to keep records of those corrections and removals that are not required to be reported to FDA. Section 519(f)(2) of the act provides that no report of a correction or removal action under section 519(f)(1) of the act may be required if a report of the correction or removal action is required and has been submitted to FDA under section 519(a) of the act. Section 519(f)(3) of the act states that the terms ``correction'' and ``removal'' do not include routine servicing. Section 519(f) of the act was enacted because Congress was concerned that device manufacturers, distributors, and importers were carrying out product corrections or removals without notifying FDA, or not notifying the agency in a timely fashion. (H. Rept. 808, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 29 (1990); S. Rept. 513, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 23 (1990)). Industry's failure to report corrections and removals, particularly those undertaken to reduce risks associated with the use of a device, Congress explained, ``denies the agency the opportunity to fulfill its public health responsibilities by evaluating device-related problems and the adequacy of corrective actions,'' (S. Rept. 513, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 23 (1990)), and ``has seriously interfered with the FDA's ability to take prompt action against potentially dangerous devices,'' (H. Rept. 808, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 29 (1990)).
