The move, announced perhaps significantly on 27th December, when most European business was closed down, must come as a bitter blow to Eutelsat and its ambitions for Hot Bird Plus. As hinted at exclusively in Interspace last month, the mode involves one of Eutelsat's biggest and more progressive members backing its main rival. The sums of money involved are not likely to be small; it is expected that the Bundespost will take more than 10 percent of SES's equity during the first quarter of this year. (However, it is not expected that it will have more than 10 percent of the voting rights.) SES will be expanding its equity base to accommodate the move and it looks as if the additional funding will be used as part of the financing for Astra 1f, a direct competitor to the digital Hot Bird Plus. Moreover, the joint venture between SES and the Bundespost is likely to be set up in the first quarter of 1994 and will be used as a "development" arm to support manufacturers and broadcasters. However, it is understood that Eutelsat's senior management are still looking at the implications of the Bundespost's planned investment and that there is a view at Eutelsat that it is not greatly significant for the future of the organisation. It is not the first time that such a move has happened; BT [British Telecom] during the late 1980s backed both SES and Eutelsat although no equity investment in SES was involved. It is believed that the Bundespost (currently the fourth largest user of Eutelsat) will continue to "support" the organisation. The SES move is seen as evidence that the Bundespost will not finance a second generation DFS Copernicus or TV-SAT replacement. The Bundespost is also understood to be firmly behind the digital Hot Bird Plus project but the final decision of award of this contract (and hence its financing) is not due to be made until March of this year. Nevertheless, the Bundespost is under financial pressure and it may yet become unwilling to finance a major part of the Astra system as well as Hot Bird Plus and Eutelsat III systems. The organisation will be faced with a massive investment in the next few years to convert its low capacity analogue cable networks to digital. This could cost between $3 billion and $10 billion. It is also believed that these cable operations are currently losing money heavily; some reports suggest as much as 500 million a year. An open question now is whether the Bundespost intends to "pool" its current satellite capacity (three DFS Copernicus FSS spacecraft and one TV-SAT BSS satellite) with that of SES, offering the latter the possibility of capacity for non-broadcast services. SES has been looking for some time at entering the telecommunications marketplace.
