FR941202-2-00090 FR941202-2-00063 It is intended that the composition, relative weights and manner of calculation for both Indexes will remain constant. It is conceivable, however, that market developments may eventually necessitate changes in the weighting, composition or calculation methodology of an Index. Such developments could include, among other things, changing liquidity conditions or the discontinuation of existing contracts, the emergence of new contracts on relevant commodities, or major progress in substitution technology that renders obsolete industrial processes that make use of a certain commodity. Decisions relating to changes in index weighting, composition or calculation methodology will be determined on the basis of advice from a neutral business committee, the JPMCI Policy Committee. This committee is composed of senior employees in the commodities and research areas of J.P. Morgan as well as independent industry and academic experts. Commodity Group personnel of J.P. Morgan are restricted to an advisory, non-voting membership on the JPMCI Policy Committee. The issuer will immediately notify the Exchange and vendors of financial information that report the Index values in the event that there is a change in the relative weightings, calculation methodology or composition. Prices utilized in the Indexes will be based on New York Mercantile Exchange (``NYMEX'') prices for platinum and energy related commodities; Commodity Exchange (``Comex'') prices for other precious metals (Comex is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NYMEX); and London Metal Exchange (``LME'') prices for base metals. These prices are widely reported by vendors of financial information and the press. Index values will be calculated at least once each trading day by the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer and disseminated to vendors of financial information by the issuer. 6 Members of the JPMCI Policy Committee and employees of the calculation agent who are involved in the calculation of, or data collection for, any of the commodities underlying the notes or the aggregate value of the commodity index underlying the notes will be expressly prohibited from trading the notes. The calculation agent will adopt and maintain such reasonable and appropriate procedures as to ensure that the calculation agent, its agents, affiliates and employees, do not take advantage of or communicate to any other person any knowledge concerning changes in the value of the notes or commodities underlying the note before such information is made publicly available. 6 See Amendment No. 1. The Amex is able to obtain market surveillance information, including customer identity information, with respect to transactions occurring on the LME pursuant to its information sharing arrangements with the Securities and Futures Authority through the Intermarket Surveillance Group. The Exchange also is able to obtain market surveillance information, including customer identity information, with respect to transactions occurring on NYMEX and Comex pursuant to its information sharing agreement with NYMEX. The notes will provide for payment at maturity of not less than 75% of the offering price and the Exchange will require that only accounts approved for options trading under Amex Rule 921 shall be permitted to engage in the purchase and/or sale of such notes. In addition, the Amex will require recommendations in the notes to comply with the suitability standards set forth in Rule 923. Additionally, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership prior to trading such notes providing guidance with regard to member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability recommendations) when handling transactions in such notes and highlighting the special risks and characteristics thereof. Specifically, the Exchange will provide an Information Circular regarding the proposed commodity linked notes that substantially incorporates the suitability language contained in Rule 923. 7 7 Telephone Conversation between William Floyd-Jones, Jr., Assistant General Counsel, Legal & Regulatory Policy Division, Amex, to Stephen Youhn, Derivative Products Regulation, SEC, on November 23, 1994. The notes will be subject to the equity margin and trading rules of the Exchange. 2. Statutory Basis The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers and dealers. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The Exchange believes the proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants or Others The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.
