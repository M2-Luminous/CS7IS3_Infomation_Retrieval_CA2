The case is fundamental as it is the first time in this country that an HIV-infected person has been sentenced for endangering someone through just one sexual episode without a condom. In August, Eastern Superior Court upheld a sentence handed down in Copenhagen Municipal Court in which a 35-year-old HIV-infected Haitian was sentenced to a year and a half in jail for having unprotected intercourse with 23 different women. In both convictions the HIV-infected person was sentenced for failing to disclose their HIV status and thus violating Paragraph 252 of the Penal Code concerning endangering the lives and health of others through gross wantonness or inconsiderateness. In determining the penalty in the three-month jail sentence, consideration was given to the woman's situation and the fact that the 32-year-old had not been infected with HIV. The woman immediately appealed the sentence to superior court.
