FBIS3-19480 "drweu052__a94026" FBIS-WEU-94-052-A Document Type:Daily Report 17 Mar 1994 ANNEX Germany Siemens Reports Good Business Abroad AU1703113094 Hamburg DPA in German 0924 GMT 17 Mar 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1703113094 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] Hannover (DPA) -- The communications sectors of Siemens AG (Munich) are achieving 55 percent of the total turnover in business with other countries. This was stated by Erwin Hardt, a member of the Siemens board of directors, in a talk to correspondents at the CeBit '94 fair in Hannover on Wednesday evening [16 March]. New business continues to be weak in Germany. In total, turnover in the 1993-94 business year amounted to 13.3 (13.5) billion German marks [DM]. The special economic development because of the new laender, which provided strong stimuli for growth, is over. However, the strong business abroad -- above all, Southeast Asia provides dynamic stimuli -- cannot yet compensate for the weak domestic demand. Siemens is attentively watching the extremely fast developments of telecommunications, Hans Bauer, member of the central board of governors of Siemens AG, noted. New market conditions are developing because of progressive liberalization and the pressure of international competition is rising. Price also becomes a competitive factor that determines everything. The annual price cuts of up to 20 percent can be compensated only with larger shares in the world market. As a result of the concentration process in the communications industry, it is to be expected that only four or five world market companies with their own system development will be left. Smaller companies, on the other hand, still have good opportunities on the market as flexible suppliers of special equipment. According to Werner Schmuecking, member of the Siemens Private Communications Systems (PN) sector board of directors, the Siemens subsidiary Rolm in the United States is experiencing a particularly successful development within the framework of the strong increase on the international markets. In new business, it has achieved a growth of 11 percent calculated on a dollar basis. PN received orders in 1992-93 worth DM6 billion and had a turnover of DM6.3 billion. In Germany, PN wants to strongly expand the business with analogous and digital cordless telephones. "This year we want to market 1 million cordless telephones," Schmuecking said.
