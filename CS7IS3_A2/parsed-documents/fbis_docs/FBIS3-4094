These companies have begun to place orders for goods from the outside world and to sign contracts with foreign firms. Some companies, however, do not understand the provisions formulated by this Ministry on shipping marks for imports and on the numbers for import contracts, and they have not submitted the required applications to the relevant department of this Ministry for shipping-mark codes. This situation has brought about many difficulties in the work of customs, commercial inspection, and transportation departments, and also has seriously hindered the prompt transportation of goods, to the extent that some cargoes have been piled up at ports and in warehouses for a long time. As their owners cannot be found, the cargoes cannot be dispatched, and work has been made very difficult. In light of this situation and in order to prevent the incorrect shipping marks on imported cargoes from affecting forwarding work, this Ministry reiterates that both the shipping marks on imports and their contract numbers must be printed strictly according to our provisions, and that various import companies and cargo-receiving departments must submit applications to this Ministry for codes allowing them to run import businesses and place orders, as well as codes for the persons to receive imported cargoes. Various local governments are requested to inspect the import companies under their jurisdiction, and if they discover companies that have not applied to this Ministry for shipping-mark codes, please urge them to do so. Please see the annex to this circular for the provisions on printing shipping marks and contract numbers on imported cargoes. Annex: Provisions for printing contract numbers and shipping marks on imported cargoes. [Signed] Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade 16 September 1985 Annex Method for Arranging Numbers of Import Contracts and Shipping Marks When signing contracts with foreign firms, companies that operate import businesses should arrange contract numbers and shipping marks according to these provisions: I. Component parts of the number of an import contract and its shipping mark. According to prevailing international practice; considering our country's actual experience over the years in handling imports and placing orders for goods; and based on the principle of making things simple, easy, and convenient to check and find; the following six parts are adopted -- depicted in English characters and Arabic numerals -- to form contract numbers and shipping marks. 1. Number for the year in which an order for goods is placed: Contracts signed in 1985 will be represented by "85," and other years will follow the same rule. 2. Code for a company running import business and placing orders for goods: The import business companies having permission to directly place orders for goods from the outside world and to sign contracts with foreign firms will be given codes exclusively by this Ministry for running import business and placing goods orders. These codes generally will consist of three English characters. 3. Code for a unit placing orders for goods (that is, the consignee who receives imported cargoes): The Ministry will arrange and issue codes to the consignees of imported cargoes within the units that place orders for goods. These codes generally consist of three English characters. 4. Numerals representing commodity categories: Two or three Arabic numerals will be used to represent the categories of imported commodities. For details, see the List of Numerals Representing Categories of Commodities. 5. Codes for cargo-supplying countries: Two English characters are used to represent each of the countries and regions that have already established diplomatic relations and have trade interactions with our country. See the list of codes for cargo-supplying countries and regions formulated by this Ministry on 25 August 1989 [date as published]. 6. Serial number of contract: This will be decided by the companies that sign contracts on imports and place orders for goods, so as to distinguish different contracts. II. Structure in which the codes of an import contract and shipping mark are organized. 1. For any contract signed with any country or region, the codes should be arranged horizontally, and the positions are as follows: The first position is the code for the year in which the order for goods is placed. The second position is for the code of the company running the import business and placing the order for goods. The third position is for the code of the cargoes' consignee. The fourth position is for a punctuation code; various specialized foreign trade corporations and their branches use a "-" [hyphen] code, other companies use a "/" [slash] code. The fifth position is for the commodity category code. The sixth position is for the code for the contract serial number. The seventh position is for the code of the cargo-supply country. 2. Structure for organization of the shipping mark. The shipping mark is organized into two lines, with the upper line representing the serial number of the import contract, and the lower line representing the English name of the port of destination of the cargoes as specified by the contract. For example, in 1985 (code is 85), a certain industrial and trading company (suppose the code name for it to run import business and place orders for goods is AA), is entrusted by a certain order- placing department (suppose the code for the consignee of the imported cargo is BB), to sign a contract which is numbered 003 (the serial number of the contract is 003), with Britain (code name is CE) to order some marine equipment (code is 382), which will be shipped to the port of Shanghai in China (English name is Shanghai China) [preceding two words printed in English]. In this case, the code of the contract should be: 85AABB/382003CE. The shipping mark should be: 85AABB/382003CE. SHANGHAI CHINA [preceding two words printed in English]. III. Points for Attention 1. To import cargo from any country or region -- regardless of whether the cargo is carried to a port of our country by sea, land, or air transport; mail; or a combination of various forms of transport -- when an order for goods is placed with the outside world, it is necessary to strictly observe the provisions on the arrangement of the contract code and shipping mark. 2. When conducting import business negotiations with visiting foreign trade delegations and businessmen in various trading companies, at the Guangzhou Trade Fair, or on any other occasion, and when the commercial organizations, trade delegations, or purchasing teams sent abroad by our country negotiate import business with foreign businessmen and sign agreements and contracts with them, the contract codes and shipping marks must be made clear, according to the provisions. 3. When various import companies negotiate business with foreign businessmen, they should make the following issues clear to the other party, the consignor: 1) When copying loading lists, rail and air waybills, bills of lading, and various kinds of commercial bills, completely correct and corresponding shipping marks and contract numbers must be written down. 2) Regarding the packaging of goods, on two sides of every packing case, nonfading pigment must be used to paint a complete shipping mark, which must be clear, noticeable, and not blurred.
