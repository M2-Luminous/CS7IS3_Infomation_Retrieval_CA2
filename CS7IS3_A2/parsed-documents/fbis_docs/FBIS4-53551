Protection Force (Unprofor), Foreign Ministry officials said. Akashi told Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa in a 10-minute telephone conversation he thinks it natural that there are criticisms against him, but that he wants to continue making his utmost efforts without being too sensitive about them, the officials said. He also said he wants to value the neutrality of the U.N. in pursuing his job. Akashi, who is currently in Zagreb, denied there are differences of opinions within the Unprofor and described it as a monolith, the officials said. Kakizawa told Akashi that Japan highly values his work despite criticism from European countries and the United States, and his neutral stance despite conflicting interests among warring parties in Bosnia, they said. He also said Japan plans to send a delegation to a U.N.- sponsored international meeting on reconstruction of Sarajevo, to be held next Tuesday and Wednesday in Vienna. Japan will look into possible cooperation. The foreign minister was quoted as saying it is difficult for Japan to send personnel to Unprofor at present, but that the government wants to consider it on a mid- to long-term perspective. Akashi said he still wants Japan to join the Unprofor-led peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia and called on the nation to consider it from a long-term perspective. Akashi also called for Japanese support for Macedonia, saying that maintaining neutrality and independence of Macedonia and Albania are important, the officials said.
