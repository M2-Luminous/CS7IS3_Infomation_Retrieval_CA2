"Once the nuclear problem is settled, we will have serious discussions about bilateral economic cooperation programs," Kim said in an interview with the SEGYE TIMES marking the fifth anniversary of the paper's founding. The President said the two sides may jointly participate in economic projects as part of bilateral cooperation. "The administration also plans to allow South Korean businessmen to visit North Korea and participate in development projects in the Najin and Sonbong areas in the North," he said. On the domestic political front, President Kim said individual ability will be the most important yardstick in nominating the ruling party's candidates for the 1995 local elections and the 1996 parliamentary elections. "The scheduled implementation of full-fledged local autonomy (next year) and the need for winning a national competitive edge require legislators to play a new role," he said. The President, who also heads the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), said that his party will nominate as candidates for next year's gubernatorial and mayoral elections those who can deal with the changes in the role and functions of local governments in the age of local autonomy and internationalization. Kim said that foreign language education is important in raising the nation's internationalization standard.
