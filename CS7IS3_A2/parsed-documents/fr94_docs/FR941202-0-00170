FR941202-0-00170 FR941202-0-00016 The Service found that the following species, which commenters requested be included in the approved list, could not be added to the approved list of captive-bred species because they did not meet the criteria for approval in ยง15.31(a) and wild-caught birds are in international trade: Lineolated or barred parakeet ( Bolborhynchus lineola ), and Spectacled parrotlet ( Forpus conspicillatus ). The Service found that the following bird species, which commenters requested be included in the approved list, could not be added to the approved list of captive-bred species because there was insufficient information to determine that all specimens in trade were captive-bred: Black goshawk ( Accipiter melanoleucus ), Black-cheeked lovebird ( Agapornis nigrigenis ), Black-collared lovebird ( Agapornis swinderniana ), Abyssinian lovebird ( Agapornis taranta ), Buffon's macaw ( Ara ambigua ), Blue-throated [Caninde] macaw ( Ara glaucogularis ), Illiger's macaw ( Ara maracana ), Mountain parakeet ( Bolborhynchus aurifrons ), Blue-eyed cockatoo ( Cacatua ophthalmica ), Slender-billed conure ( Enicognathus leptorhynchus ), Yellow-faced parrotlet ( Forpus xanthops ), Sclater's parrotlet ( Forpus sclateri ), Red-cheeked parrot ( Geoffroyus geoffroyi ), Musk lorikeet ( Glossopsitta concinna ), Purple-crowned lorikeet ( Glossopsitta porphyrocephala ), Little lorikeet ( Glossopsitta pusilla ), Philippine hanging parrot ( Loriculus philippensis ), Purple-capped lory ( Lorius domicellus ), Black-capped lory ( Lorius lory ), Tepui parrotlet ( Nannopsittaca panychlora ), Orange-bellied parakeet ( Neophema chrysogaster ), Rock parakeet ( Neophema petrophila ), White-bellied caique ( Pionites leucogaster ), Coral-billed pionus ( Pionus sordidus ), Plum-crowned pionus ( Pionus tumultuosus ), Ruppell's parrot ( Poicephalus rueppellii ), Paradise parrot ( Psephotus pulcherrimus ), which is probably extinct in the wild, Pesquet's parrot ( Psittrichas fulgidus ), Malabar parakeet ( Psittacula columboides ), Blaze-winged conure ( Pyrrhura devillei ), Fiery-shouldered conure ( Pyrrhura egregria ), Sulphur-winged conure ( Pyrrhura hoffmanni ), Pearly conure ( Pyrrhura perlata ), Crimson-bellied conure ( Pyrrhura rhodogaster ), Black-capped conure ( Pyrrhura rupicola ), all 7 species of Touit parrotlets, Varied lorikeet ( Trichoglossus versicolor ), and Blue-crowned lory ( Vini australis ). For the above species, there are either no records or very few records of any specimens in trade. The Service was therefore not able to make the determination required by the statute that the above species are regularly bred in captivity and that the importation of specimens of the species is not detrimental to the species survival in the wild. The Service recognizes that with increased captive breeding efforts for these species, they may be able to meet criteria for approval in ยง15.31 in the future. Birds of Prey That Cannot Be Added to the Approved List The Service found that the following bird of prey species could not be added to the approved list of captive-bred species because they did not meet the criteria for approval in ยง15.31(a), and that wild-caught birds are in trade: Black kite ( Milvus migrans ), and European eagle owl ( Bubo bubo ).
