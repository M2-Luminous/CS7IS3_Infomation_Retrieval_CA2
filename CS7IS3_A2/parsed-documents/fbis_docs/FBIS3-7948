At the same time, you said that Czech-Polish relations are of absolute priority for us. Can you explain why they are more important for us than, for example, relations with Slovakia or Germany? [Klaus] I certainly did not say that they are more important than relations with Germany or Slovakia. I think that it was necessary to use this visit to dispel certain doubts which continue to exist on the Polish side. They have lasted for four years. If you remember, there was an occasion when we did not open small-scale border contacts. On another occasion, we did not want to solve the questions (?anew). We almost forgot that. And there was something else for the third time. At the moment there have been complications as regards our weak attitude toward the Western countries regarding entry to NATO and the Partnership for Peace. Part of the Polish press continues to create the impression that we want to do something against Poland or without Poland and so on. So I am glad that this visit has taken place and I was quite conscious in uttering those welcoming sentences, but it certainly did not mean putting these relations above Slovakia or something like that. [Weissova] Nevertheless, the mass media often criticize our government for the relations which it has with its neighbors, for example, as far as the countries of Visegrad are concerned, they blame the Czech Republic for not wanting to progress in a coordinated way, for wanting to be isolated. The kernel of discord between us and Austria is Temelin. Relations with Germany are complicated by the Sudeten German question and criticism of our government appears in the mass media regarding its foreign policy toward neighbors. Do you agree that this policy does not take sufficient consideration of tactics concerning these sensitive questions? [Klaus] I certainly do not agree with it. If we had no neighbors we would have no problems with neighbors. [passage omitted] I simply cannot agree that our policies are irrational, inconsistent, and badly thought out. This is not true, and I cannot imagine what kind of policies we should conduct for them to be better. Should we go for the Austrian blocking of Temelin? Would it be better foreign policy? [passage omitted] The fact that we are being criticized by a small fraction of the German press, in my view, is evidence that we are doing things correctly. [Weissova] Prime Minister, NATO planes have interfered in Bosnia. What do you think about this resolute step? Can this demonstration of NATO determination contribute toward ending the protracted conflict or, on the contrary, worsen it? [Weissova] I do not like to pass absolute judgements because, as I have understood up to now, or at least up to this morning as we are talking, it was not clear at all what kind of planes they were, which sides were involved, and what was behind it. We know very well that in this strange war there are a lot of strange activities by individuals going on which are not completely synchronized and coordinated with the others. [passage omitted] [Weissova] Events in Hebron on Friday, where a Jewish settler, a doctor, shot dozens of praying people, shook the world by its scale and manner. You were recently in Israel and met its top representatives. You saw the complicated problems there: Do you think that this action could jeopardize or make it impossible to bring peace to the area? [Klaus] I am worried. I am really worried that this is a huge blow to all peace talks. What really makes me concerned is my feeling that a massacre on this scale could not be the work of one individual, however mad he was. It had to be prepared, there had to be some sort of logic and support behind it. This is why I am worried that this was not an isolated deed committed by someone who deals with problems of the world in this mad way. And this is what bothers me. It would indicate that something similar can happen again and this is really bad. I have seen the swift reactions of Israel in its obvious counter- gesture of releasing thousands of Palestinian captives in an attempt to rectify this dreadful deed. I have seen this problem, the internal political conflicts in the Israeli parliament. I saw there at the same table representatives of a group that would never negotiate with Palestinians opposite a group which wants the negotiations. I am afraid that what happened has added complications to a problem which is already difficult. [Weissova] My last question is about coupon privatization in the Czech Republic. The completion date for the preparatory round of the second wave has been finally set. [passage omitted] Why was this preliminary round so long? Was it necessary? [Klaus] [passage omitted] All enterprises which are to enter the second wave of coupon privatization must have their annual accounts settled. This takes time and it could not be done any quicker. If this took place three months earlier or later and the annual balancing did not come into it, it could have been done faster.
