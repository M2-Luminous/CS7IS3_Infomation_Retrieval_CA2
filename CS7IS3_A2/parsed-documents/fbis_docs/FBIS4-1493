General Viljoen said in Lydenburg that he was not criticizing the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] because this commission had been entrusted with an impossible task stemming from wrong decisions. [Begin recording] [Viljoen] I am not sure what was going on here, but the number of votes, the additional ballot papers that had to be printed has been Greek to me. I cannot understand why such a situation prevails, and to me this does not make sense. I think the situation has to be looked into very seriously. [Correspondent Pieter Theron] Gen. Viljoen visited several polling stations in the eastern and northern Transvaal. It was clear that most people in these regions had already voted yesterday. The voting in some places took place very peacefully; no problems were experienced, although ballot papers at some voting stations were lacking. The Freedom Front contends that in view of numerous logistic and administrative problems which cropped up during the election period, a leaders' summit should be held immediately after the elections were completed. It will determine whether the election had been free and fair. [end recording]
