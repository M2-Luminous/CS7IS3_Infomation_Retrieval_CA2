FBIS4-33228 "drlat107_r_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-107 Daily Report 25 May 1994 Peru General Denies Drug Trafficking Charges General Denies Drug Trafficking Charges PY0306032494 Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 25 May 94 p 19 PY0306032494 Lima LA REPUBLICA Spanish BFN [Text] According to a reliable judicial source, General Jaime Rios Arayco said, in his testimony before Judge Gloria Arteaga Lucas: "I am only a scapegoat. The real protectors of `Vaticano' are other people, and some of them were rewarded with appointments abroad." Gen. Rios admitted, however, that Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera ["Vaticano"] virtually fed the troops deployed in his area of operations by giving them money and other donations. In his testimony Gen. Rios said: "At that time, we did not know he was a drug trafficker. Everyone knew him as a prosperous businessman, some kind of generous patron." Gen. Rios and the other officers accused of covering up drug trafficking and allowing corruption are being held on Punta Lobos Island, Pucusana, in charge of Air Force personnel. Gen. Frank Tweddle Granda, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for drug trafficking, was also held there from 1980 to 1981. According to the accusations, Gen. Jaime Rios Arayco and the other officers did not take any measures during their stay on the Huallaga Front to repress the criminal activities of Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, "Vaticano," and his gang. On the contrary, they had friendly contact with him and received "donations" on several occasions. It is even said that Gen. Rios personally prevented the capture of some of "Vaticano's" agents, and reprimanded the policemen who carried out antidrug operations against his consent and authorization. In this regard, Gen. Rios told Judge Gloria Arteaga that the accusations are not true, and that he has become "a scapegoat" to hide the real protectors of drug trafficking, some of whom "have been rewarded with appointments abroad." Apparently Rios was referring to Gen. Eduardo Bellido Mora, brother-in-law of Army Commander General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza Rios. According to various reports, including the comments of Major Evaristo Castillo Aste, Bellido Mora has been mentioned as one of the "protectors" of Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera. Bellido is currently the Peruvian military attache in Israel. It was learned from judicial sources that the other officers who were also accused with Gen. Rios Arayco have basically agreed with their chief on the Huallaga Front that Demetrio Chavez virtually fed the Army Command, donating money to feed the troops deployed in that zone to fight drug trafficking and terrorism. But according to their instructions, they were not aware Chavez was a drug trafficker. Regarding this case, it was learned yesterday that the judge of the 42d Criminal Court will ask the president of the Lima Superior Court to add the accusations under investigation in the 47th Criminal Court to the one he, Judge Alzamora, has been investigating for months against the main suspect, Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, "Vaticano." A judicial spokesman said the combination of the cases would be appropriate as they deal with the same charges against "Vaticano," for the sake of economy in the legal process, and because events of the same nature, and against the same people, cannot be separated. It was reported by judicial sources that Judge Gloria Arteaga has scheduled for next week new testimony by Gen. Rios Arayco and the other officers.
