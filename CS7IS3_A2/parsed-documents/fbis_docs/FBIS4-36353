Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik has learned that the political echelons were notified of this by the State Department. Our correspondent further learned that, in the meantime, peace talks coordinator Dennis Ross and his aides continue delivering secret messages between the leaders of Israel and Syria in an attempt to reach agreements and establish a better basis for the success of the U.S. secretary of state's visit to our region. At the same time, Israeli sources denied the reports from Jordan regarding an arrangement that was allegedly reached on a withdrawal from the Golan. The sources said that the road to an agreement with Syria is still long. They believe that the report from Amman was designed to justify the Jordanian decision to resume the peace negotiations with Israel. Minister Yosi Sarid said today that it can be assumed that the negotiations with Syria will resume in the near future, and it may be that the next round of talks will be more promising than the preceding ones. Mr. Sarid made the remarks during a tour of the Golan, and our correspondent Moti Eden heard him there.
