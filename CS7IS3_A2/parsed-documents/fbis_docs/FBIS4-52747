The step is designed to prevent Japan from invoking a discriminatory curb on textile imports from China, a protective measure allowed under the Multifiber Agreement (MFA), the source at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said. The source said Beijing sent MITI a letter stating it supported the voluntary textile export cap. The letter was sent when Hiroshi Kumagai, chief cabinet secretary, was a MITI chief. The MFA, which took effect in 1974, is intended to protect Japan and other Western industrial countries, major textile importers, from possible damage to their domestic textile industries due to massive textile exports by China and other developing nations. The recently concluded Uruguay Round accord on global trade calls for a phased removal of managed trade practices, such as voluntary export restraints. In line with the global trade policy, Tokyo announced earlier this year that it will scrap a voluntary curb on U.S.-bound car exports starting this year.
