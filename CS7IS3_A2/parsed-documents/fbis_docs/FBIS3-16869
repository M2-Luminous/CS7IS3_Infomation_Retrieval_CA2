The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic told an ITAR-TASS correspondent by telephone today that the republic's authorities had expressed condolences to the families of those who died and to the Iranian people. A state commission to investigate the cause of the air crash has been set up. According to reports from other Karabakh sources, local experts do not rule out the possibility that the Iranian plane could have been shot down by the Azerbaijani side. In their opinion, information about the radio intercept, which the Karabakh side bears witness to, as does the fact that at the site where the military plane came down near the village of Noragyukh in Askerasnkiy [Askeran] Rayon, there are fragments of five surface-to-air class missiles launched over the past 18 months from anti-aircraft missile systems in the Azerbaijani towns of Mingechaur and TerTer. However, Stepanakert is refraining from making any official statements until the commission has given its findings. One possible motive is said to be that the cause of the crash of the military helicopter carrying several Azerbaijani leaders in November 1991 in Nagorno-Karabakh has still not been established. The Azerbaijani side placed the blame on Stepanakert then without any proof, but the matter has still not been cleared up.
