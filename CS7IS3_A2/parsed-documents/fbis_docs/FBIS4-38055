Our army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe notes that in the wake of the commission's criticism, the IDF will soon issue orders and clarifications concerning the use of gunfire against settlers and violations of law and order in the territories by Jews. The Cave of the Patriarchs will open only when all the security arrangements are in place and the complete separation of Jews and Arabs is assured. The IDF will maintain a guard force at the cave and bar armed worshipers from the site. IDF sources stress that Army elements had cautioned already last year that the law was not being enforced against settlers and had requested police reinforcements at the site. IDF elements stress that procedures for cooperation between the army and the police are of vital importance at this time.
