FBIS4-8318 "dreeu071__a94007" FBIS-EEU-94-071-A Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic SDL Spokesman on NATO's `Dangerous Game' SDL Spokesman on NATO's `Dangerous Game' AU1204191494 Prague CTK in English 1650 GMT 12 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1204191494 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, April (CTK) -- The NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions on Sunday and Monday are a dangerous game, foreign policy spokesman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL) Zdenek Masopust said at a party press conference today. NATO was looking for a new identity and was not yet able to take into account that in the post-communist world Russia plays an important role, he said. He emphasized that Russia should not be humiliated for fear of "feeding nationalist extremism" in the country. NATO fighters attacked Bosnian Serb positions on Monday afternoon in an attempt to prevent a Serb advance on the Bosnian town of Gorazde, a UN designated "safe haven". The strike came less than 24 hours after a Sunday strike against Bosnian Serbian positions. Russia strongly protested against both attacks, as it did against the NATO ultimatum to the Serbs besieging Sarajevo. At the same conference SDL deputy Vladimir Rezac pointed out possible conflicts between the post-1989 Land Law and its amendments and the decrees of post-war Czechoslovak President Eduard Benes. He said it is often overlooked that the Benes decrees were ratified by the Czechoslovak parliament in 1946, making them constitutional. Hence the return of land formerly belonging to "German Nazis" living in Czechoslovakia who were deprived of their land by the Benes decrees might be illegal, he said. Rezac referred in particular to the case of Karl Des Fours Walderode, who was granted Czech citizenship again last year. Walderode was a member of Konrad Henlein's Sudeten German Party, adopted German citizenship in 1939 and joined the Wehrmacht.
