The first major event was the Sino-U.S. summit, e.g. the meeting between Jiang Zemin and Clinton in Seattle, United States, the first such meeting in five years; the second being the joint communique issued by the Chinese and French Governments on the resumption of the traditional friendly relationship between the two sides; the third major event, which occurred a little bit earlier, was German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's leading a 200-member delegation to China. The three astounding major events came on the heels of each other. International media is of the view that there will be a global China craze. Economy is the foundation of politics. Diplomacy is like a piece of mirror which reflects a nation's interests. The brilliant achievements that the mainland has scored over the past 15 years of reform and opening up shows the world that in addition to recognizing China as a political power, they should not ignore China's economic vitality and potentials. If major Western powers want to shake off recession and develop their economies, they cannot afford to neglect the thriving land of China. The attraction of China's economy has forced some Western nations to change their policy: from a policy that tried to isolate and impose sanctions on China to a policy that seeks detente, cooperation, and friendly exchange with China. While Western economies failed to stage a comeback last year, Asian economies thrived and enjoyed an economic growth rate of 7 percent. In particular, Mainland China topped the world's growth rate at 13 percent. At the same time, Mainland China has become a country that has attracted the most foreign capital. On 1 January this year, and with the rising of the red sun, five new sets of tax law were simultaneously put into force. Following that, reform on the foreign exchange was carried out. Various reform measures and laws and regulations in the areas of finance, taxation, foreign trade, and enterprises will be introduced this year. Unlike in the past, reform measures, along with other supplementary reform measures, will be comprehensively carried out this year, thus forming a systematic project. This shows that following an accumulation of 11 years of experience, the policy of reform and opening up has entered a mature stage. With the heralding in of 1994, the mainland will provide an improved and ideal environment for foreigners who come to the mainland for economic and trade cooperation. The economic and trade exchanges between Taiwan and the mainland, due to rapid development over the years, have become the most active part of all exchanges between the two sides of the strait. As of last year, the number of companies and enterprises that Taiwan businessmen established on the mainland reached some 15,000, with a promised investment amount of over $13 billion and an actual investment amount of over $6 billion, thus exceeding the combined investment amount of previous years and catapulting Taiwan into second place in the number of foreign-funded enterprises. The cross-strait trade amount has exceeded $12 billion. Amid the surging tide of economy and trade, Taiwan authorities did lift some restrictions and make some relaxations. However, the cross-strait economic and trade relationship is still unable to cross a hurdle. Over the years, economic exchanges between the two sides, due to different attitudes, have always tended to be active on the one side and passive on the other. Obstacles abound in the course of progress. On the island, the authorities have always dragged their feet and the private circles have always prodded the authorities to advance; the authorities are unable to keep up with the pace of private circles. At a time when the mainland's economic situation is progressing by leaps and bounds and is attracting a large infusion of capital from the world, businessmen and well- informed people realize the pressing situation and strongly call on the Taiwan authorities to change their present mainland policy. Recently, articles published in several big and influential Taiwan newspapers pointed out that at a time when the world's economic structure is undergoing a realignment, the mainland occupies a pivotal position. Japan and the United States have already unveiled their new China policies. Taiwan should follow suit. Some economic officials also suggested this to the authorities, noting that Taiwan, after World War II, knew how to seize the opportunity presented in world stability and created its economic development. This time, if Taiwan is able to seize the opportunity of the mainland's reform, it will enable Taiwan to carry out a smooth readjustment of its industrial structure. Some scholars even bluntly pointed out that if Taiwan sets self-imposed limitations because of political factors and lets foreign countries get a headstart, Taiwan will lose a great chance for investment, cooperation, and development. Taiwan would also be helping its own business rivals. There is a saying: making an erroneous step, you will lag behind others for 100 years. Faced with such a situation, how should the Taiwan authorities act? It will help nothing if they just sigh and live in regret. Opportunity, once missed, will not come back. The most practical thing for the authorities to do is to resolutely lift the restrictions on the three direct links, so as to bring about a breakthrough development of the cross-strait relationship in the new year.
