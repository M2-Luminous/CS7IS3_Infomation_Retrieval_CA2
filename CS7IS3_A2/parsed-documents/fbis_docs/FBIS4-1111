News from the front sent to us by Calixte Mugabo says commanders of the government forces continue to send soldiers to their deaths at Rebero Hill in Kigali, where 100 soldiers, including their commanders, have been killed. At Jari Hill, also in Kigali, around 100 also have been killed. In Rwamagana in eastern Rwanda, which is in the hands of the RPF, a colonel who was commanding the government forces was injured. The question now is why soldiers continue to die protecting the clique of killers. They should see the truth and rather fight the killers who are determined to exterminate the whole country. Let us return to war news from the Kigali area. Our colleague Calixte Mugabo informs us that currently the RPF controls the communes of Gikoro, Gikomero and Bicumbi. In areas where government forces are withdrawing, they are leaving behind many heavy weapons.
