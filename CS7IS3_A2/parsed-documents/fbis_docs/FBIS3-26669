Speaking at a news conference, Kozyrev said that Russia is taking a vigilant attitude toward the position of aid-raiding Bosnia-Herzegovina because such a policy would distract the international efforts for a political solution. The minister stressed that NATO's action should be brought into U.N. peacekeeping plan. According to Kozyrev, U.N. Security Council will hold a meeting on Monday [14 February] to determine NATO's tasks and duties in Bosnia. NATO's ultimatum to Bosnian warring factions should be approved as a resolution of the Security Council which will allow some countries or regional organizations to have a hand in ending the Bosnian war, the minister added.
