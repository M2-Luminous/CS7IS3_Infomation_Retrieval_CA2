Yevgenyev: "Different Poles of Reform"] [Text] To judge by operational information from the State Committee for Statistics May has been a record month in terms of the decline in industrial production. In terms of physical volume it declined 6.5 percent compared with April and 28 percent compared with May last year. As a whole over the first five months of this year 25.9 percent less output was produced than for the same period last year. Of course a part was played by the fact that there was less working time in May than in April ("we were taking time off and enjoying ourselves"). Nonetheless we cannot fail to draw attention to the increasing stoppages of enterprises, mainly, as the State Committee for Statistics notes, because of the impossibility of selling their output. The volume of production declined most in the sectors of the investment complex and nonfood consumer goods. Thus, while the fuel and energy complex showed a decline of 12 percent and the food industry a decline of 22 percent, the pulp and paper industry's production declined 32-34 percent, the chemical and petrochemical industry declined 35 percent, light industry 41 percent, and machine building 45 percent. Of 406 of the most important types of output taken into account in operational returns, the production of 20 articles increased compared with January through May last year while the production of 381 declined. Capital construction continues to be reduced. Over the five months 25-30 percent fewer investments were channeled into the republic's economy and 40 percent fewer were channeled into the production sphere than a year ago. The commissioning of housing has declined 6 percent. As for agriculture, as of 30 May agricultural enterprises had sown 50.6 million hectares to spring crops as against 53.2 million last year. It is true that spring grain crops have been sown on 34 million hectares, which is 2 percent more than a year ago. A motley picture characterizes livestock raising. As a whole the production of meat and milk has declined 8-10 percent. But on private farms it has actually increased while at agricultural enterprises it has declined 15-16 percent. In foreign trade exports rose 9 percent and imports declined 28 percent, which ensures Russia a reliable positive balance. But little is changing in the structure of exports. Gas (20 percent), crude oil (19.5 percent), petroleum products (7 percent), and ferrous metals (10 percent) continue to predominate in it while machinery and equipment account for a miserly share (33 percent). Essentially it is the trade balance of a developing country. But we must realize that substantial changes here are possible only as a result of profound transformations in the entire economy. In recent months inflation has been markedly checked. Compared with December 1993 consumer prices have increased just 72 percent. Average wages have increased 5 percent compared with april (prices have increased 7 percent) totalling 180,000 rubles [R]. The highest wages are for workers in the fuel industry (R420,000), electricity (R381,000), and the credit and insurance sphere (R366,000). Real disposable monetary incomes (incomes left after counting essential payments corrected against the consumer prices index) increased 11 percent over the past year.
