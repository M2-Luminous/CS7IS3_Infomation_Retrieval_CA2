Only First World countries are exempt from this report because the United States surely lacks moral authority and reasons to pass judgment on them. Undoubtedly, no one feels comfortable with such reports; they constitute U.S. Government interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign countries. Moreover, their use is not always restricted to moral sanctions. Sometimes they become the basis for economic restrictions and other kinds of pressures that indirectly undermine universal principles of noninterference. In sum, they are detestable documents. Unfortunately, however, these reports have been shown to be effective against the evils they attack. In Paraguay's case, it must be noted that, more than any other, these reports helped weaken the image of Alfredo Stroessner's dictatorship. It is also worthwhile to mention that when the U.S. State Department reports exposed to the world the infamous human rights situation under the repression we were subjected to, the tyrant was forced to yield while defense mechanisms against him were strengthened. At the time, we appreciated these reports, and in an indirect manner, we even helped draft them by supplying reliable information. Consequently, for ethical reasons it is impossible for us to reject the U.S. Government practice of issuing reports on Paraguay's domestic situation. Moreover, it must be stressed that these reports were never biased regarding Paraguay's situation. They are limited to revealing the information obtained from reliable sources. The only objection to the latest report that was issued is that although the human rights violation cases mentioned are possibly all true and the comments on the justice system's faults are true, the overall human rights situation in Paraguay is far from being what it was more than five years ago. To be coherent with the aforementioned reasons, we must accept the criticisms and charges made in these foreign reports. For our international image, however, it would be useful if these reports made comparisons showing a foreign reader how much progress Paraguay has achieved in this regard, and that our political regime is much closer to the ideals of civilization than during the dictatorship we were able to defeat. In its next report, the U.S. State Department should be careful to continue noting the errors that have been made and the faults affecting our institutions because, although it may annoy us, it compels us to correct them. But it also would be encouraging for these reports to point out the progress that has been achieved since the enforcement of the libertarian process. This would give a real picture of the situation and reduce the risks of hurting any feelings.
