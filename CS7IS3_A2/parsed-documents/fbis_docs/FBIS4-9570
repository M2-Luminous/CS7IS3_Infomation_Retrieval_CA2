Exclusive Residences of Croatia's `New Ruling Class' Although the "most attractive land" in the northern part of Zagreb costs as much as 4,500 German marks [DM] per square meter and building permits alone cost as much as DM200,000, businessmen and politicians are "rushing" to buy them and are building more and more expensive villas and even castles. The Zagreb weekly GLOBUS on 18 March reports in an article entitled "Northern Zagreb: Forbidden City of Croatia's New Ruling Class" that Zagreb's elite housing zones are in Prekrizje, Pantovcek, Zelengaj, Cmrok, Tuskanac, and Salata. According to the weekly, Mario Pleic, who claims to be working in state security, is building a residence worth DM4,000,000 in Pantovcek, without a valid permit. The family of the automobile transporter Vuckovic, in Gornje Prekrizje No. 55, bought one of the most beautiful villas in the northern part of the city, with a luxurious swimming pool. In Zelengaj, Stjepan Pecevski, deputy minister of internal affairs, became the owner of a 93-square-meter residence, and Milan Brezak, a "high official" in the Interior Ministry, and Perica Juric, one of the founders of the ruling Croatian Democratic Community (HDZ) and an assembly representative, each bought a 112-square-meter residence. GLOBUS lists numerous other politicians and businessmen who have purchased luxurious properties in northern Zagreb and mentions a new "interesting" construction that has "sprouted up" in Prekrizje: a "real castle with towers and arches" whose owner remains unknown. Rijeka Shipyard Sells Ship to Private Purchaser A Rijeka resident of Herzegovinian origin, Jure Kutle, until recently an oil-tanker captain, has purchased a ship, the Sv. Antun Padovanski (St. Anthony of Padua), from the 3 Maj Shipyard in Rijeka for $45 million, becoming the biggest private shipowner in Croatia. In an interview he gave while "surrounded by bodyguards" that was published in the 18 March issue of GLOBUS, Kutle states that the ship will most probably be sailing under the Liberian flag because Croatian taxes are too high. He told GLOBUS that he is also in the process of founding the Kutle Line shipping company. He worked as an oil-tanker captain for 30 years, GLOBUS reports, and, "thanks to lucrative investments," he has "enough money to buy several ships." Zagreb Construction Firm Taking Over Split Partner The Zagreb firm Montmontaza, which specializes in the construction and equipping of petroleum and petrochemical processing plants and petroleum terminals and pipelines, recently bought 25 percent of the shares of the largest Split construction company, Lavcevic, for DM11,800,000, according to the 13 April Split daily SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. Montmontaza Director Ivica Nuic told the daily that Montmontaza had previously purchased 12.7 percent of Lavcevic's shares from pension funds and a further 8 to 10 percent from small shareholders. An agreement has been made for the purchase of another 4.3 percent of shares from the Split bank, so that Montmontaza has become the majority shareholder in Lavcevic. Nuic says that his company bought the Lavcevic shares "to protect its interests," since the two firms are working together on a long-term project in Kazakhstan valued at $43 million. Montmontaza will try to buy all the remaining Lavcevic shares except the two blocks that are not for sale: the 6.2 percent that belongs to the Republic of Croatia and the 7.3 percent reserved for owner restitution. Record Share Sale by Privatization Fund At a 7 April public auction conducted by the Croatian Privatization Fund at the Zagreb stock exchange, 25,479 shares of two enterprises were sold for a total of approximately DM2,548,000, or 9.35 billion Croatian dinars. The value of the transactions represents a one-day record for this year. The 8 April issue of SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reports that the bulk of the trading consisted of the "Kapital Trade" brokerage firm's purchase of 25,421 shares of stock in the Split confectioner "Bobis" for DM2,542,000. The remainder was accounted for by the "Investco" company's acquisition of 58 shares of the "Croatia Auto" firm of Zagreb for DM5,800. Thus, total trade in 14 regular auctions conducted by the Croatian Privatization Fund this year has amounted to about DM6.8 million, which represents about 49,000 shares in 27 enterprises, the daily says.
