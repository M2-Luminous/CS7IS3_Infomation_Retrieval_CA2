As asserted by some authoritative observers, China will continue to be in a process of rapid growth. There is massive potential in its domestic market, which has provided a vast field for industrial development. By and large, various countries in the world look favorably on the economic trend in China, so that the country will continue to be the world's largest market attracting foreign capital, both at present and for a considerable time to come. Three Major Signs of Economic Direction Referring to opportunities, Chinese Premier Li Peng pointed out: The new year will be a momentous one in which China's economy will continue to maintain good development momentum. It also will be a crucial year in which the reform to establish a socialist market economy structure will be pushed forward. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has concretized and systematized the objectives and principles of this huge reform project, and has sketched out the basic framework of a Chinese-style market economy, which has become an overall tentative plan with a strong guiding and manipulative character, with a view to comprehensively pushing forward the omnidirectional reform for transforming government functions, optimizing macroeconomic regulation and control, revitalizing a microscopic economy, and expediting the building of a legal system. The senior CPC leaders hold that reform and opening up over the past two years have been focused on Deng Xiaoping's remarks during his south China tour, the establishment of the socialist market economy structure defined at the 14th CPC National Congress, and the decision on the "50 measures" adopted at the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee, all of which have organically formed the "three major signposts of China's economic direction" in this century, thus effecting a historic transition from a planned economy structure to a market economy structure. Readjustment of Interests To Stabilize General Situation Deng Xiaoping said: Reform is also a revolution; it certainly will change the unreasonable patterns of interest inherent in the old structure or formed in the course of structural transformation, and inevitably will encounter certain difficulties or obstructions, including the readjustment of interests between the central and local governments, the preferential policies and investment restrictions among different industries, the income readjustment and changes among different social strata, and so on. As reform will make a giant stride in the new year in which the number of reform measures to be introduced will be the greatest for the last 15 years, and will involve various areas -- including the state, enterprises, and individuals, as well as various trades and professions -- it will make up an organic body incorporating various major links of reform. Hence, it is necessary to push forward the reform in a positive, planned, comprehensive, and coordinated way in order to bring about an early formation of the new structure. Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC, described this as "being of vital importance so that efforts should be made to strive for a sure victory." He also pointed out the necessity of handling the relationship among reform, development, and stability with particular caution. While persisting in taking the economic construction as a central task, it is necessary to persist in achieving economic development and social stability in a mutually complementary and unified way. He stressed that economic development is the last word [jing ji fa zhan shi ying dao li 4842 3444 4099 1455 2508 4289 6670 3810]. Only by seizing the favorable opportunities can we deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, expedite development, and solidify the political situation of stability and unity. In turn, political stability in society will vigorously ensure the smooth advance of economic construction, reform, and opening up. He held that the maintenance of political stability is an appropriate compenent of the subject of concentrating our energy on economic construction, and these two aspects must supplement each other. He reminded members of the leading bodies to keep a sober mind and to be adept at discovering and at resolving in a timely fashion those new problems cropping up in the course of advance, and hose tendentious problems in particular. He stressed the necessity of carefully guiding and displaying the initiative of cadres and masses, paying attention to coordinating relations among various parties, and mobilizing all positive factors to create favorable conditions for the healthy development of the national economy. Explorations Should Be Made To Avoid Great Ups and Downs Over the past 15 years of reform and opening up, China's economy has experienced several ups and downs, which have aroused attention in various quarters. Is this instability a transitional phenomenon of the structural transformation or is it a cyclical phenomenon of the market economy? The Development Research Center of the State Council, a major think tank in China, has listed it as one of the five major subjects for economic research in the 1990's. Sun Shangqing, director of the center, said: It was not sufficiently scientific to think in the past that there was no economic cyclicity under public ownership. The center has begun research on what special features the development cycles will have, and how we should base ourselves on these special features so as to reduce the extent of the fluctuations brought on by these cycles in the course of moving from a planned economy to a market economy, and even after the establishment of the market economy. It is hoped that the exploration into this law will help China avoid great ups and downs in its economy. Along with the increasing impact of market prices on industrial and agricultural production, peasants have called for reducing various inappropriate burdens imposed by local governments, as they are the people most liable to be affected by the shifts in market supply and demand. When their income sags, they leave their villages and give up farming in order to engage in trade, a process that has led to the ever-increasing number of transients in the cities. Now and then, there are cases of "lodging petitions" by groups of peasants who have found it difficult to sell their products; who have been deceived by people selling forged pesticides, fertilizers, or seeds; or who have complaints about the high cost of farm implements. In this regard, the CPC has adopted a series of measures to increase agricultural investment, eliminate the phenomenon of "IOU notes" in the purchase of agricultural and sideline products, and so on. Xiao Yang, who took up the post of Sichuan provincial governor in 1993, claimed that the handling of peasants coming to town to "seek justice" was one of his principal jobs. Workers' Position Remains Unchanged In the course of transforming enterprise operational mechanisms, owing to such public opinions as "now is an era of scientists and entrepreneurs," which emerged at one time, and to the fact that the rights and interests of staff and workers in foreign-invested enterprises very often were unprotected, workers felt that their position as "masters of the country" had declined. According to a survey of more than 300 foreign-invested enterprises in Guangdong, most of the staff and workers put in 10 to 12 hours per day, with some working for 14 hours or even as long as 28 hours in succession. In a considerable number of enterprises, labor protection was poor, with the air seriously polluted with poisonous gas and dust in excess of standards. Among the 400 staff and workers at a foreign- invested enterprise in Xiamen, Fujian, nearly one-tenth had a part or all of their fingers cut off owing to industrial accidents. In some localities, disputes between employers and employees arising from such phenomena as withholding employees' wages, beating or scolding them, sacking them at will, molesting women workers, and so on, were very serious in both domestically funded and foreign- invested enterprises. A CPC leader pointed out: In the course of reform, opening up, and the establishment of a socialist market economy structure, all aspects -- including the socialist system, the nature of the state, the status of the working class as a leading class, and the position of workers as masters of the country -- remain unchanged. The masters-of-the-country status of staff and workers in state-owned enterprises, as well as in foreign-invested, privately owned, and town and township enterprises, also remains unchanged. Jiang Zemin particularly pointed out: Trade union organizations should be set up in all foreign-invested enterprises so as to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the workers. The Four Factors Determining the Success or Failure of Reform Recently, quite a few institutions of information on scientific research, as well as specialists, and academics, made assessments and analyses of China's situation of reform and openness, as well as its economic trends. Their relatively unanimous views are that China will continue to maintain a double-digit economic growth rate in the future on the grounds that -- given the somewhat intensified macroeconomic regulation and control -- development in the energy, communications, and essential raw and semifinished materials industries has been accelerated, the growth of real estate and tertiary industry has picked up again. They believe that the scope of investment will remain comparatively large, which will contribute to the development of economic production in various fields. In the industrial structural readjustment, certainly, the excessively high rate will decline to a certain extent. One important point is: Whether or not the good momentum in changing tracks will be maintained in the new year under circumstances of the extensive introduction and implementation of various reform plans will depend on the following four factors: 1. Efforts are made to avoid great ups and downs in economic construction. These include stabilizing agriculture, reducing the impact of price reform on the economic sphere, guarding against fresh inflation brought about by relaxed investment, and so on. Jiang Zemin pointed out: There should be new ideas for economic development. It is necessary to really shift to the path of taking the enhancement of economic results as a central task, and to refrain from continuously following the beaten track of extensive operation characterized by blind pursuit of output value and expansion of investment scope. Serious attention should be paid to structural readjustment, technological transformation, the development of products, scientific and technological work, and management in these areas. In short, stress should be placed on the quantity, as well as the quality, of economic growth. 2. Stability is maintained in social and political life, and efforts are made to improve the condition of social security. Owing to uneven regional economic development, the income gaps between various social strata will be further widened in the reform years. In some minority regions, in particular, and in areas where public order has worsened or the economy has lagged behind, conflicts between cadres and the masses, among nationalities, and among religious factions, as well as the improper handling of certain problems by the government, may bring about some sudden events or incidents that will lead to serious consequences. As far as the general situation is concerned, thanks to the popular support given to the reform line for the market economy, the CPC has solidified its ruling position and confidence, so that the senior policy makers all think it impossible for a large, overall disturbance to break out. Some of the serious problems at present are poor public order -- with the number of serious cases remaining high -- and the ugly phenomena still existing in society. The CPC has taken firm control of improving the case-handling system on one hand, and is intensifying the police forces and adopting measures for the comprehensive management of social security on the other, so as to severely crack down on various kinds of criminal activities. Ideologically, it has further intensified its leadership over ideological, cultural, and propaganda work in a bid to prevent the outbreak of new turbulence and the emergence of destabilizing factors. Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Will Be Strengthened 3. The authority of the central government is in place, and a coordinated relationship between the central and local authorities is being maintained, while macroeconomic regulation and control are being intensified and improved. When the CPC hierarchy put into effect various reform measures at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, in November, and at the national economic work meeting in December, it emphatically pointed out, time and again, that as the economy developed at a faster pace, there always would emerge some unbalanced phenomena in various areas. Hence, it was necessary to intensify macroeconomic regulation and control and to make readjustments in good time. Both Jiang Zemin and Li Peng repeatedly affirmed the achievements scored by the regulation and control measures adopted in the second half of 1993. In their opinion, the correct practice of macroeconomic regulation and control has been an indispensable condition for the rapid growth, so economic, legal, and necessary administrative means should be applied still more properly to ensure healthy economic development in the future. As the CPC has intended to establish a market economic mechanism for fair competition, it is certain that the previous preferential policies will fade out deliberately. By using the means of macroeconomic regulation and control, the CPC will be able to check various acts taken by various departments and localities to "jump the gun" [tou bu 0262 2975] in disregard of the overall interests. A more important point is that the intensification of macroeconomic regulation and control is conducive not only to making an overall arrangement, and to maintaining the unity of the state and the authority of the central administrative orders, but also to pushing forward the reform plan as a whole. Measures Will Be Taken To Guard Against "Leftist" Deviation 4. The resurgence of "leftist" deviation should be prevented, and the set policies of reform and opening up should be guaranteed so that they will not be changed after Deng Xiaoping's death. Since the 14th party congress, the CPC has put into practice measures to guarantee for 100 years the steadfast adherence to Deng's line, precisely through the party's political line, organizational line, and policymaking structure. In the activities to mark the centenary of Mao Zedong's birth, the CPC also took pains to lead the masses onto the track of studying Deng Xiaoping's theory and of pushing forward reform and opening up. At present, owing to the great intensity and extensive range of the reform, the CPC has not lowered its vigilance against the possible risks that may occur. Recently, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce promulgated new regulations on collecting consumption taxes, which triggered a new round of price rises in some areas. Spurred on by various rumors spreading among the masses, ordinary people demonstrated a "panic buying" mentality. The CPC authorities immediately called on all localities to take measures to stabilize the public will. On the one hand, the Beijing authorities repeatedly announced through the media that no plan to raise prices would be introduced in the near future. On the other hand, they called on relevant departments to adopt measures to limit the prices of retail goods so as to maintain order in the markets. The Development of Shanghai Is a Microcosm There is an element essential to the success or failure of reform as a whole: Whether or not the openness and development in Shanghai will make major headway. Deng Xiaoping maintained: "It is a momentous measure to take hold of Shanghai. Shanghai is our trump card, and it is a short cut to boost the economy in Shanghai.... In the past, Shanghai was a financial center, a place where money was freely convertible. In the future, we should make it like this again. If China wishes to gain an international position in the financial arena, we must rely on Shanghai in the first place." It can be stated that after two or three years of large-scale development and construction, Shanghai has become a dragon head of reform and opening up in the Chang Jiang valley, and even in the entire country. The most important measures for the forward position of reform have been experimented here, and the development of Pudong has made headway, with a substantial influx of various types of foreign funds. Shanghai's reforms in foreign exchange, the securities market, the futures market, and banking have begun to take shape. Deng Xiaoping particularly stressed: "The banking industry is very important, as it is the core of the modern economy. If financial work -- like a pawn in a chess game -- is well played and invigorated, the whole game will be invigorated." Today, there are scores of foreign-invested and joint-venture banks and finance companies in Shanghai, and there are Chinese-funded banks too. Shanghai has taken a crucial step to revive the old dream of an oriental financial center. Since the beginning of the 1990's, a total of 12 bonded zones have been set up in China's coastal areas. These are Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao, Zhangjiagang, Waigaoqiao, Ningbo, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Futian and Shatoujiao in Shenzhen, and Haikou. Among them, the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone in Pudong, Shanghai, set up earliest of all and entirely closed, was the largest, covering an area of 10 square km. One after another, a great many world-class companies have opened offices here. Of the 500 enterprises that have commenced business here, 446 are foreign-invested enterprises. A number of experts hold that the bonded zones in Shanghai's Waigaoqiao and Xiamen's Xiangyu boast many conditions favorable to the construction of free ports, which will serve as excellent channels for converging with the international market once China reenters GATT. Moreover, economist Ju Chongwei proposed that in a bid to build Shanghai into an international financial and trade center, it is necessary to follow the model of Hong Kong in exporting capital, technology, management, and service, and to construct the Chang Jiang valley and southern area of China into a fifth "little dragon." He viewed with disfavor the practices of absorbing purely foreign capital so as to make only Pudong prosperous, and of developing purely local industries, as such practices cannot turn Shanghai into a modern cosmopolis. It is certain that the economic development and the establishment of a new structure in Shanghai will become a microcosm of the development trend of reform and opening up in China.
