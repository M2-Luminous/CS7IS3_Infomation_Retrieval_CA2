FBIS4-403 "drafr069_c_94002" FBIS-AFR-94-069 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Zulu King Says Talks at `End of Road' Zulu King Says Talks at `End of Road' MB0804181994 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1752 GMT 8 Apr 94 MB0804181994 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Skukuza April 8 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini told State President F W de Klerk he would "walk the extra mile" in an attempt to seek a solution to the violence in kwaZulu/Natal, but negotiations had "reached the end of the road". The ruler of the region's eight million Zulus was addressing Mr de Klerk, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] Leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and African National Congress President Nelson Mandela during their summit meeting at Skukuza in the Kruger National Park on Friday [8 April]. The king accused Mr de Klerk of ignoring the "hideous and despicable crime" when eight IFP members were shot dead and at least four injured on March 28 outside the Shell House headquarters of the African National Congress in Plein Street, Johannesburg. Referring to a reported agreement between ANC leader Nelson Mandela and the police, in which the police agreed not to enter Shell House on condition that weapons inside the building were handed over to them, the king said: "You saw them being ambushed, attacked and massacred... yet your police did not enter Shell House to arrest the perpetrators and to secure incriminating evidence." King Goodwill said it was clear that meetings he had held with Mr de Klerk had not been "fruitful" and "we have reached the end of the road which we together opened on January 17, 1994". He said it was obvious that the only way in which Zulus would restore their kingdom was "through our own efforts as Zulus and as freedom fighters". Mr de Klerk was still defending a unitary state which gave no recognition for the separateness of the Zulu kingdom and nation, he said. The Zulu nation had endeavoured to seek a peaceful and negotiated solution, but any possible freedom in the territory had been abolished by the "invasion" of the SADF [South African Defense Force] and SA Police to enforce the state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal. "I came (to the summit) because I felt it is my obligation to walk the extra mile in an effort to seek a solution to our problems. "However, I feel that you, Mr President, and I have discussed all that there is to discuss and that the time for discussion has somehow run its course. I always feel that deeds speak louder than words," the king said. He said the restoration of the kingdom of kwaZulu had to be resolved before an election was held in South Africa. "I am not sure how we can make progress and in which direction. I know that I am not prepared to go over again matters which you and I have discussed at great length," he said. The Zulu king said the key to successful negotiations was whether the other leaders were prepared to listen to Zulu aspirations, or whether, "like those who conquered us, you think you must trample with your feet on those just aspirations of my nation".
