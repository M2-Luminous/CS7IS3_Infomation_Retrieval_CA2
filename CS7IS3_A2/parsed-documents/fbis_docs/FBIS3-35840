Do you not fear that this will give rise to a feeling of isolation in Russia? [Brazauskas] I thought of that, and while expressing this wish I clearly underlined that our approach was in no way an act of hostility or enmity toward Russia -- especially since the Partnership for Peace program allows anyone to participate who wants to. This possibility is valid for Russia and for all the other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. It is a peace program which aims to establish peace by any means possible. It is a concrete formula of collaboration that is not restricted to statements in favor of peace, but which offers concrete collaboration with a view to building up this peace. Those who think, on the other hand, in terms of blocs, of hostility, of creating dissent, are those who are expressing relics of the Cold War. [Lefevre] Have you not gotten the impression that Moscow was vetoing the membership of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in NATO? [Brazauskas] To veto something you must first be entitled to do so. Moscow has certainly expressed clear opinions on this matter, but I think that this partnership program is going to continue developing, that a growing number of countries are going to join it, and that even Moscow will come around to it little by little -- especially since the partnership program is in no way an offensive system. Indeed, it is a system of exchange, of consultation, of common learning, and of jointly perfecting a number of mechanisms that must work on behalf of peace. Kozyrev: Rhetoric that Harms Relations Between Countries [Lefevre] Do you think that the United States will one day give Lithuania and the Baltic countries the full security guarantee of the North Atlantic Treaty, and by when? [Brazauskas] It would be incredibly thoughtless of me to suggest confirmation of this or any dates. All I can say is that this partnership and consultation mechanism will develop and will mature on its own. [Lefevre] What do you think of the recent rhetoric of Russian Minister Kozyrev, who called the Baltic countries areas of special interest for Russia? [Brazauskas] This kind of abstract rhetoric never contributes anything. All it does is create confusion and damage relations between countries. We are a sovereign, independent country and a member of the United Nations and the Council of Europe. We also hope to enter the European Union. What does this kind of rhetoric mean? What gives them the right to make it and what might its scope be? We signed agreements with Russia on a whole series of problems. Take, for example, the withdrawal of the Russian Army, which has now left Lithuanian territory, or the matter of ethnic minorities. We have a Russian minority, the vast majority of which, took Lithuanian citizenship when it was given the opportunity to do so. Of course there are still some major problems to be resolved and we are continuing the negotiations with the hope that we can resolve them one by one. Naturally, there is the matter of the territory of Kalingrad, which is part of Russia, but which is cut off from it. We understand that Russia has interests there and we are continuing the negotiations with the Russians with regard to this territory. As for Mr. Kozyrev's rhetoric, he did not say what interests they were. If there are Russian interests in Lithuania, they must be defined and we will carry out negotiations on them like we are doing with the other issues. Whether it is a big or a small country, we must all live according to the same legal rules and apply them in all circumstances. [Lefevre] After the December elections in Russia, and the recomposition of the Moscow Government, should we expect a tougher line in Russian foreign policy? [Brazauskas] I do not think so. Anyway, relations between countries are never a constant. They change; there are ups and downs. [Lefevre] The Estonian prime minister recently wrote that the Russians must not be treated like spoiled children by sheltering them from blame. Otherwise they will grow up into arrogant and tyrannical adults. Do you share this point of view? [Brazauskas] It is for similar reasons that I say that the legal rules and their application must be the same for all the countries, whether it is Lithuania, the United States, Luxembourg, or Russia. [Lefevre] In view of recent developments in Russia, do you think that it needs less shock and more therapy, as Mr. Strobe Talbott said? [Brazauskas] The therapy is still needed. I think that the negotiations between the countries and the way of fixing their relations via these negotiations are actually therapeutic acts. I do not believe in shock therapy or in therapeutic shocks, neither in international relations nor in the domestic policy of a country. Belarus: Something To Do with the Extradition of Communists [Lefevre] How do you interpret the dismissal of Belarus President Shushkevich by a communist dominated parliament? [Brazauskas] Every country has its own problems. The situation in Belarus took a long time to come to fruition. This also has something to do with the agreement concluded between Belarus and Lithuania, which led to the extradition of the leaders of the Lithuanian Communist Party, who are now accused of serious crimes and being tried. We have a legal cooperation treaty with Belarus and, in accordance with this treaty, we have handed over a number of Belarus citizens who were killers and we have asked for the extradition on criminal charges of Mr. Burokevicius, who was the first secretary of the Communist Party faithful to Moscow as well as Mr. Jermalavicius, who was the party ideologue (these two officials, who were hostile to Lithuanian independence, are considered by Vilnius to be responsible for confrontations during which Soviet troops killed 14 people near the radio and television building in January 1991 -- LE SOIR editor's note). We are entitled to demand that these criminals be handed over to us and that is what was done. The Belarus Parliament expressed a different opinion and contested the extradition. Nevertheless, as a neighboring state, we intend to continue maintaining good relations with Belarus. [Lefevre] Does this mean we are witnessing a sort of pro-communist revanchism in Belarus? [Brazauskas] No. I would not use those terms. However, political relations in Parliament are indeed different in our country. Europe: Our Wish Is Obvious [Lefevre] How do you assess the welcome which the European Union has given to Lithuania? [Brazauskas] We were welcomed very well indeed. Our wish is obvious. We want to draw closer to the European Union as fast as possible. [Lefevre] Are you satisfied following the talks you recently had with [European Commission President] Jacques Delors? [Brazauskas] For the moment we are demanding to join the European Union so it is hard for us to ask questions. We can only express our wishes.
