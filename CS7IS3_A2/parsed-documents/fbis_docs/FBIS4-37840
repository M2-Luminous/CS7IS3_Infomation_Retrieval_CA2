He said the talks had originally been planned for Monday but were put back "for technical reasons." Negotiators would not meet in Egypt, as suggested on Thursday by Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, but the talks "will be in the occupied territories," he said, although the place had not yet been announced. Sha'th said he would meet with Dani Rothschild, head of the Israeli military administration, instead of General Amnon Shahaq who led the Israeli delegation at previous autonomy talks. "Shahaq is not any more the head of the Israeli delegation," he said, although there was no official army confirmation of the move. He said the two delegations would first discuss the agenda for negotiations. They would then talk about the release of prisoners, extending Palestinian self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and completing matters which remained unresolved before the May 4 autonomy accord was signed. Certain issues such as the exact size of the self-rule enclave of Jericho were put to one side so the signing ceremony could go ahead in Cairo, launching autonomy in the West Bank town and the Gaza Strip.
