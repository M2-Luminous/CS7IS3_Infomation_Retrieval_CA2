As Kebich emphasized, "a reliable, firm, and equal union with Russia is the goal of the policy I pursue." In his words, "the first nine points of a treaty "on the unification of the monetary systems of Belarus and Russia" have already taken effect. [quotation marks as received] "The abolition of custom duties alone has dropped the prices of Belarussian TV sets and fridges by 15-20 percent. This means that these goods will be increasingly pervading the Russian and other markets, and profits and state revenues will go up," he said. Custom-free bilateral trade has brought the tariffs on fuel from Russia down as of 1 June. As Kebich disclosed at a meeting with Minsk tube builders recently, "one tonne of oil purchased in Russia will cost much less than the $85 the Republic pays for it today." In his words, "the price of Russian fuel will be formed thus: The world price minus a 40 percent custom duty." IF Note: The Russian-Belarusian Monetary Integration Agreement provided for such a trade status as of 1 May. However, it has actually been in effect only since 1 June. According to a poll by Eridan, a republican center for political studies, Kebich's popularity as a candidate to the presidential office has doubled in the last six weeks. He tops the list of officially registered contestants with 372,000 signatures in his support. (Down at the bottom is ex-speaker Stanislav Shushkevich with 123,000 signatures, and the leader of the Agrarian Party Aleksndr Dubko with 117,000 signatures -- IF). The popularity of other candidates, among them the former leader of the Interim Parliamentary Anticorruption Commission Aleksandr Lukashenko, the Communist Party's Secretary Vasiliy Novikov, and Dubko has risen since April from two to four percent while Shushkevich's rating has shrunk from nearly 10 down to seven percent and that of the Popular Front's leader Zenon Poznyak has dwindled from 5 to 4 percent. Nearly 60 percent of respondents favour monetary integration with Russia, and more than 77 percent would welcome a fiscal union with Russia.
