President Vaclav Havel told journalists that they would deal later in greater detail with concrete political questions, such as the former Yugoslavia or relationship to Russia. "This was only the beginning, not the climax of the meeting. We will carry on our discussions," Havel said. He stressed the meeting did not mean that "we are colluding against any one else or that we think we are better." The meeting is only to express the closeness of cultural traditions and history. The meeting has brought together the presidents of Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia. German President Richard von Weizsacker said that Germany wanted to help bring the region closer to Western Europe. Slovenian President Milan Kucan said that if it appeared that integration into Europe was an illusion, it was necessary to be striving for it on the Central European level at least. Polish President Lech Walesa submitted the idea of "United Nations of Europe". Pointing to the very differing levels of individual countries, he proposed to make out a list of the conditions of integration and to mark the conditions which individual countries had already fulfilled. He came out in favor of "seeking unity while specificities are preserved." Hungarian President Arpad Goncz pointed out that regional and pan-European integration were complementary. He described future Europe as "a large region" whose parts are at various levels of development. Austrian President Thomas Klestil said the purpose of the Litomysl meeting was to promote trust among the participating states which would contribute to "Central Europe becoming a zone of greater stability and security than thus far." He said the term of security was a "comprehensive" one and mentioned fears of nuclear energy. Klestil said that nuclear energy and particularly Austria's disagreement with the construction of the nuclear power plant at Temelin, south Bohemia, would be discussed "bilaterally." He confirmed that Austria, if it becomes a member of the European Union, would support other Central European countries' effort to enter the Union. The need to successfully solve the problem of ethnic minorities in Central Europe was pointed out by Slovak President Michal Kovac. He said conditions to eliminate this burden from Slovak-Hungarian relations would be better in the wake of the internal political changes carried out in Slovakia in March. Kovac said this would help Slovakia join the European Union. Havel said he strongly supported all integration processes, irrespective of how they may be called. He stressed that the present offered the first ever chance "for all [in Europe] to live in peace and security." Goncz said he had invited the presidents to a similar meeting in Hungary next year.
