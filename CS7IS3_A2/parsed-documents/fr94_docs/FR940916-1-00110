FR940916-1-00110 FR940916-1-00016 Alternately, the railroad may utilize more highly skilled and experienced mechanical forces to perform the test, yielding an important increment of increased quality with respect to detection of brake system problems (including those that have not yet led to any diminution of train braking effectiveness). Choice of this option must also be accompanied by use of mechanical personnel to perform a more thorough inspection for other defects under the Freight Car Safety Standards (49 CFR 215.13(b)). In exchange for the greater investment in inspection effort, and in recognition that this effort is more likely to be fully effective in ensuring the safety of the movement against both existing and incipient problems, the railroad would be allowed to move the train for greater distances without an additional train braking system test. Additional requirements would apply, as discussed below. Freight trains would be allowed to operate distances of up to 1,500 miles between train brake system tests if the operating railroad complied with the conditions given in paragraph (b) of this section. An important proposed performance requirement to earn the right to operate trains 1,500 miles or more between tests is a low power brake system defect ratio on trains inspected by FRA immediately after they have been declared ready for departure by the railroad. This power brake defect ratio will be calculated by FRA on a quarterly basis as defined in ยง232.5 (e.g., January 1 to March 31; April 1 to June 30; etc.). The power brake defect ratio for a particular railroad will be calculated by dividing the total number of cars found to have power brake defects, as defined in ยง232.5, by the total number of cars inspected. FRA estimates that it will take no more than 30 days from the end of any quarter for FRA to assemble and calculate these defect ratios. Consequently, any limitation on a railroad's ability to operate trains for extended distances, due to a high defect ratio in a quarter, will not begin until 30 days after the completion of any quarter and will continue until 30 days after the completion of a quarter in which the railroad has a defect ratio below the prescribed limit. FRA intends that any restriction on a railroad's ability to operate trains for extended distances only continue until that railroad can establish a quarterly defect ratio that falls below the prescribed limit. For example, the defect ratios for the quarter ending on March 31 will not be available until April 30, and thus, any restriction on train movement, due to a high defect ratio for that quarter, will begin on April 30 and will only apply until July 30 (30 days after the completion of the quarter ending June 30), if the railroad improves its defect ratio so that it falls below the prescribed limit during the quarter ending June 30. FRA recognizes the difficulty of drafting enforceable performance-based standards and realizes that there may be problems connected with this proposed standard which are not immediately discernable. Consequently, FRA requests comments or advice from interested parties regarding the implementation or enforcement of this proposed requirement. The 1992 power brake defect ratios for five major railroads are contained in Graph 1 below. BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;06&hyph;P E:GRAPHICSEP16SE94.000 BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;06&hyph;C Other extremely important proposed conditions are that the Class 1 brake test must be performed by a qualified mechanical or electronic brake system inspector and that a pre-departure freight car safety inspection in accordance with ยง215.13(b) must be performed by inspectors meeting the qualifications contained in ยง215.11. As the distance a train is allowed to travel increases, the mechanical condition of the equipment is a key factor in ensuring the proper and safe operation of the train brake system throughout the entire trip. FRA would also require that a record of all brake tests performed on the train be available to the crew, that frequent spot checks of Class 1 tests are conducted by a qualified supervisor, and that the railroad have a quality single car test program in place. Furthermore, trains traveling up to 1,500 miles might add only one block of previously tested cars. The purpose of all these requirements is to ensure that trains being allowed to operate longer distances are part of proven safety-conscious operation and are in the best condition possible, from a safety standpoint, prior to departure from their originating terminals.
