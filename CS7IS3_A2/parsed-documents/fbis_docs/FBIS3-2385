In Shanghai, China's largest economic center, it is now common for both staff and workers to get their jobs through competition. According to the latest statistics, more than 1.6 million employees, accounting for 97.53 percent of the total, at state enterprises in Shanghai, are working under labor contracts in different forms. A municipal government official in charge of the reform said that Shanghai began the reform of its labor employment system in 1992. Altogether 1,118 enterprises, accounting for 82.94 percent of the total, are participating in the reform. "Getting jobs through competition has given both enterprises and employees more opportunities to choose each other," the official noted. The transactional volume of Shanghai's Farm Machinery Company and the Machinery and Electrical Appliance Import and Export Company has been expanded by linking income to output. The Shanghai No. 2 Iron and Steel Plant has drawn up a plan to train its employees technically and widen their general knowledge. Since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, the Chinese Government had carried out the "iron rice bowl" system -- a term signifying commitment to secure employment and the guarantee that the state would provide at least the basic necessities for everyone. The reform of the labor system in Shanghai, China's leading industrial center, has cut 5.18 percent of the workforce from the state-owned sector. A survey shows that many of these people wanted to try the market economy. After leaving his former post, Zhang Miaoguo, a worker at a large state enterprise in the Minhang District of suburban Shanghai, found a job as a cleaner at the social service department under the Shanghai Fuyu Quanye Development Company. Although his job is dirtier than his former one, he earns more than before. After giving up her "iron rice bowl" post, Ye Aguo, a 47-year-old female worker is serving as a casual laborer in the neighborhood and earns more than 300 yuan per month. She is satisfied with her present work. According to the municipal labor department, Shanghai will focus on improving the social security setup to pave the way for a more flexible labor market.
