From 14 to 21 June, Zhu Rongji and officials in charge of relevant State Council departments traveling with him heard briefings on the economic work of Jilin and Liaoning Provinces. Accompanied by He Zhukang, secretary of the Jilin Provincial CPC Committee; Jilin Governor Gao Yan; Gu Jinchi, secretary of the Liaoning Provincial CPC Committee; and acting Liaoning Governor Wen Shizhen, they visited markets for farm produce, granaries, and grain production households; held forums on reforming the distribution system for agricultural means of production; inspected factories; and held informal discussions with the leaders of some state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. Zhu Rongji fully affirmed the achievements of Jilin and Liaoning Provinces in economic work. He said: Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and thanks to careful arrangements by the provincial party committees and governments, the economic situation in both provinces is favorable as several key reforms are functioning normally, agricultural production has generated notable results, bumper grain harvests are within reach, diverse operations and village and town enterprises are developing rapidly, industrial production is increasing steadily, and markets are replete with commodities. The situation will get even better if people work hard together. Zhu Rongji noted: Reform of the grain purchase and marketing system has proceeded smoothly in the two provinces where grain market prices are basically stable, peasants are quite satisfied and are even more enthusiastic about growing grain, and urban residents are understanding and supportive. The situation in the two provinces fully attests to the fact that the policy decisions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council are correct. Grain prices are at the core of the party's rural policy, as well as an important economic lever with which to inspire peasants' enthusiasm. Now that peasants' enthusiasm has been kindled, we must keep the prices of fertilizer and other agricultural means of production stable, and make every effort to bring those prices down, so that peasants will genuinely gain tangible benefits. This will boost agricultural development to a new high. After we have developed agricultural production, increased peasants' incomes, and expanded purchasing power in rural areas, industrial goods will find wide demand and the national economy will develop on a solid basis. Therefore, we should not underestimate the profound and far-reaching effects of the current reform of the grain purchase and marketing system, as well as the current price reform. The main purpose of Zhu Rongji's recent inspection, investigative, and fact-finding trip was to find a way to reform the distribution system for agricultural means of production and to bring under effective control price increases for chemical fertilizer and other agricultural means of production. During his visits with peasant families and informal discussions with cadres at all levels and peasants, he stated: Chemical fertilizer prices have risen sharply since the beginning of this year because of the acute imbalance between supply and demand, price increases for raw and semifinished materials, and the untimely supply of chemical fertilizer. The main reasons, however, are the existence of many intermediate links in the distribution chain, market disorder, the race among some production enterprises and operating units for higher prices to seek profits in violation of state provisions, and poor supervision and management by competent departments. He noted: To keep chemical fertilizer prices stable and consolidate gains in reforming the grain purchase and marketing system, we should, first of all, balance total supply and demand. At present, we should go all-out to produce quality chemical fertilizer, improve product quality, ensure the delivery and distribution of imported chemical fertilizer, and increase supplies to meet peasants' demand. Second, we should reform the distribution system for agricultural means of production. The state should control the supply of most agricultural means of production, allow supply and marketing cooperatives to serve as the main channel through which such materials are distributed, strictly enforce government-set prices, and ensure supplies in rural areas. Departments engaged in the supply and management of agricultural means of production should reduce intermediate links in the distribution chain, streamline their organizations and personnel, improve management and administration, and reduce circulating costs. We should unify the basic prices of and operating charges for chemical fertilizer and other major agricultural means of production, and permit seasonal price differentials caused by regional and seasonal factors. Third, we should earnestly improve market administration and restore order in the distribution field. All units must operate strictly in accordance with state provisions; those who disrupt the market, drive up prices, and seek staggering profits in violation of relevant provisions must be investigated and dealt with resolutely. The State Council will further study the issue of reforming the distribution system for agricultural means of production, and intensify efforts to draw up documents to be relayed to subordinate units for implementation. Zhu Rongji added: There are signs of opportunistic price increases for meats, poultry, eggs, and vegetable oil in a few areas, and they merit attention. Corn market prices have not risen, nor have feed prices. The price increases for meats, poultry, and eggs are not compatible with the laws of the market, because these goods are in ample supply. State-run commercial departments should organize supplies, sell off stockpiles, and roll back prices. Meanwhile, industrial, commercial, and commodity price departments should send inspection teams to the grass roots to stop indiscriminate price increases. This is also an important means of consolidating the gains in reforming the grain purchase and marketing system. Speaking of the troubles currently plaguing some state-owned enterprises, Zhu Rongji said: On the whole, state-owned enterprises are taking a turn for the better. To overcome the troubles currently plaguing some enterprises, we must correctly analyze the causes of the troubles and develop clear ideas for running state- owned enterprises effectively. First, we should persistently separate government and enterprise functions so that the government will help enterprises strengthen leadership bodies, create a good macroeconomic environment for enterprises, and oversee the way enterprises implement state principles and policies. Second, enterprises should change their operating mechanisms, improve their "internal functions," readjust product mix in accordance with market demand, and improve product quality and their own reputation. Third, we should stress investment returns, upgrade enterprises technologically, and avoid launching new projects recklessly. Accompanying Zhu Rongji during his inspection trip were Yao Zhenyan, Xu Youfang, Sheng Huaren, Luo Zhiling, Yang Changji, Hong Hu, Xiang Huicheng, and Chen Yuan, who are comrades in charge of relevant State Council departments.
