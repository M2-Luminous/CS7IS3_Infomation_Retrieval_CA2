Mr Nathan, director of the Cape-Town based Centre for Conflict Resolution, said a number of arguments had been presented in recent weeks for maintaining or increasing the defence budget. The argument that it was necessary to maintain a credible defence capability was correct as a general principle, but its application depended on circumstances. South Africa was over-armed in the regional context as none of the Southern Africa Development Community states was capable of posing a military threat. There was no foreseeable military threat from outside the region. "The potential in fact exists for a high level of political, diplomatic and security co-operation in the post-apartheid southern Africa," he said. "Disarmament in South Africa would facilitate disarmament throughout the subcontinent, releasing resources for development and potentially leading to greater internal stability." In South Africa the greatest threats to citizens' security were non-military problems such as poverty, unemployment and a lack of adequate social services. "The bottom line is that money spent on defence could otherwise have been used for development programmes and welfare services," Mr Nathan said. To argue that South Africa's foreign policy, particularly in southern Africa, would depend heavily on a military role was dangerously close to South Africa's regional policy under apartheid and would undermine regional confidence. To claims that the defence budget, at 2.6 per cent of gross national product, was not high by international standards, Mr Nathan said the United Nations and World Bank considered two per cent an acceptable figure for developing countries. "This benchmark should be regarded as a general guideline rather than a fixed rule," he said. "It may in fact be too high in the case of South Africa since current defence spending is several times greater than total military expenditure in the rest of the region." Noting that in 1992/93 Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa] had made R110 million [rand] from domestic and foreign sales and received a state subsidy of R10 million, he said it was "untenable" to say ethical considerations should play no part in the arms trade. Weapons were not a neutral commodity and it was not "overly pious" to ask whether South Africa wanted to boost its economy through killings in other countries. The defence establishment could not seek to maintain a large budget on the grounds of international instability and simultaneously contribute to that instability through arms exports. Mr Nathan said South Africa had to establish clear foreign and national security policies and conduct a transparent investigation of its arms industry before it could make rational decisions about the defence budget. It required a clear policy on arms exports and a way of overseeing whatever criteria were laid down. Ways to cut the defence budget should also be investigated. All of these objectives should be open to public debate, he said.
