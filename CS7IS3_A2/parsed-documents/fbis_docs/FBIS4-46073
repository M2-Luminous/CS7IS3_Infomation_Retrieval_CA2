Yi's remarks mean that of the total 8,100 fuel rods at the reactor, about 1,000 have been replaced. Speaking at a National Assembly Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee meeting, Yi said the initial report from an IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) inspection team indicated that there is no significant problem with respect to the storage and future gauging of selected fuel bars from the reactor. "The IAEA will have full-fledged negotiations with North Korea over this matter beginning Tuesday," Yi said. Earlier in the day at a breakfast meeting hosted by the Korean Newspaper Editors Association, Yi said his recent remarks that "the South-North denuclearization declaration will be made void and null if North Korea were found to have even a half nuclear weapon" was the expression of his view directed indirectly toward the United States. Yi made the remarks when asked by Democratic Party Rep. Namkung Chin what was his view of a recent statement of U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry, in which Perry spoke as if his country would connive at one or two nuclear weapons in the possession of North Korea.
