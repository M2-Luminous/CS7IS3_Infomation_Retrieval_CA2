Pharmaceutical firms and their products must pass evaluations by a national committee called State Pharmaceutical Authentication Committee (SPAC). The policy urges medicine enterprises to update their techniques and facilities to keep up with the world development trend. This will improve the quality of medicines and protect public health, said Zhang Wenkang, vice-minister of Public Health and also director of SPAC. The administration has received many reports of fake and substandard medicines in recent years, as well as deaths caused by bogus products, said Liu Yonggang, former deputy director of State Pharmaceutical Administration and a member of SPAC. Some pharmaceutical factories have not reached State requirements on production management. That severely hinders product quality improvement. SPAC will inspect pharmaceutical enterprises in line with international principles of "Good Manufactory Practice for Drugs (GMP)." GMP is common practice in many advanced countries. It stipulates production facilities, techniques and sanitation and also product quality inspections. And all the medicines must be certificated by the committee in accord with the State Pharmaceutical Law.
