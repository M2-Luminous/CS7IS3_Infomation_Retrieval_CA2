At the meeting held in North Korea's Unification House, the South asked the North to drop four demands made at the previous four meetings and to respond to Seoul's proposal on an exchange of special envoys. Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae, who led the South Korean delegation to the meeting, warned that if North Korea insisted on its "unreasonable demands," it would be accused of "erecting a barrier to a special envoy exchange." Stressing that the envoy exchange is a pressing issue that cannot be put aside, he said he expects North and South Korea will jointly work for reconciliation, cooperation and co-prosperity by realizing an exchange of special envoys. But chief North Korean delegate Pak Yong-su, reiterating the four demands, offered a counterproposal calling for two additional items, including maintenance of national self-reliance, in the agenda for discussion by the special envoys. He also proposed that the South Korean envoy visit Pyongyang first for three nights and four days and that the preparatory period for the visit be 15 days. North Korea's four demands include suspension of the joint South Korea-U.S. military exercise "Team Spirit," withdrawal of President Kim Yong-sam's remarks on North Korea's nuclear program and scrapping of the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea.
