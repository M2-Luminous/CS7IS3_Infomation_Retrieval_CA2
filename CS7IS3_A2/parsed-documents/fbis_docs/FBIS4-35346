These positions raise questions regarding the hidden intentions and reasons of those who adopted them. The UN Security Council member states have announced that they back and support the Yemeni unity. This stand was based on the fact that the world community as a whole has recognized the Republic of Yemen as a single political entity. However, very regrettably, we began to hear whispers, and smell something strange, that defy the legal and historical facts regarding the formation of the Republic of Yemen from certain countries despite their recognition of it. Yemen is not like other countries that have racial, religious, and ethnic problems. Paradoxically enough, we hear at this stage some people trying to compare the Syrian-Egyptian unity to the Yemeni unity. Here, we do not have to list the excuses and proof of the invalidity of such thinking. All Arabs know very well the difference between Yemen's unity and the Syrian-Egyptian unity. But as much as we are concerned for our unity, we the Yemenis are looking forward to the achievement of the comprehensive Arab unity. On the other hand, the Yemeni unity, which is supposed to form the cornerstone for a regional and, consequently, an Arab unity should win the support of every Arab everywhere. Thanks be to God, the brothers in most of the Arab states and the Asian and African Muslim states, as well as our friends in Europe, America, and Asia--chief of which are the UN Security Council permanent member states-- support the Yemeni unity and constitutional legitimacy, which exemplifies the effectiveness of democracy and political pluralism. Based on the above, we can say that the rebels who are pursued by the constitutional legitimacy, the authority of the Yemeni unity, are mere gangsters who violated the national unanimity. The forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy have the right to mete out to them the punishment stipulated by the Constitution and the state laws. This is a right of sovereignty and no one has an excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of the Republic of Yemen since what is going on is an internal matter. The position of the UN Security Council permanent member states was fair and dominant and it should be followed by other countries. It is wrong to think otherwise. It is also wrong to view the Yemeni affair as an Arab or world affair. We say this despite our appreciation of the concern over stability in our country displayed by our brothers and friends. It should be known to those who present themselves as sympathizers with the Yemeni people's causes and affairs that those who do not respect or appreciate these people's unity are mistaken and are taking risks in matters that run counter to the Arab League Charter, the UN Charter, and the international law. The Republic of Yemen, which the entire world community, without exception, had recognized, is a united political entity with no religious, ethnic, or religious problems, and with no problems that can infringe on its unity or sovereignty. The current conflict is between the state authorities, represented by the constitutional legitimacy, and the rebel forces of treachery and secession. Our Yemeni people, who are united in religion, language, values, traditions, and direction are able to foil all schemes regardless of their source. God will grant us victory over the gang of apostasy and secession, who rebelled against the constitutional legitimacy and the enemies of the Yemeni people and their freedom, dignity, and progress.
