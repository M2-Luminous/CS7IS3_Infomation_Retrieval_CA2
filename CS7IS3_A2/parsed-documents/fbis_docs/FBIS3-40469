Churning out F15 fighters and ground-to-air Patriot missiles for the Defense Agency, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries rarely had to worry about revenue sources or economic downturns. Not only were fixed profits guaranteed, the company also knew that it would receive a host of new contracts every time the Defense Agency's budget rose. But Japan's largest comprehensive heavy-machinery manufacturer has found out the hard way that all good things must come to an end. With the Cold War over, this behemoth corporation, one of the symbols of Japanese industrial prowess, is facing similar problems to those besetting arms contractors in the U.S. and Russia. For the last three years, annual sales of ¥2.3-2.4 trillion ($20-21 billion) have been flat while annual net profits have gradually fallen -- to an estimated ¥70 billion in fiscal 1993 through March this year. To reverse the fall, Mitsubishi Heavy's military manufacturing sectors are under the gun to find new non-defense revenue sources. Given the recession, that's a tough order to fill. The company's recipe: cut costs, promote competition within the firm, start research on new private-sector products and inculcate a sense of urgency in complacent arms-manufacturing employees. The results so far: mixed. ``We've got to use our brains harder to expand new business opportunities,'' company President Kentaro Aikawa told managers last September during a visit to Mitsubishi Heavy's two principal arms-manufacturing centers in Nagoya, which rely on Defense Agency contracts for 70-80% of all orders. The Defense Agency's fiscal 1994 budget, set to be determined later this month, is likely to be flat. With the endorsement of Aikawa, known within the company as ``Mr. Cost-down,'' a new deputy chief, Shiro Goda, was appointed at the company's guided-propulsion-systems center to shake up the staff. ``Goda's appointment was designed to equip the center for survival in the private sector by infusing traditional technical skills with a new commercial awareness,'' explained a senior official. The goal is to develop high-quality products such as commercial airplanes at competitive prices, a new concept at a center used to having almost unlimited funds with which to build ships and planes at taxpayers' expense. As one of his first acts, Goda reduced the center's nine divisions to six and slimmed down its 45 sections to 38, giving impetus to the decision-making process and to the commercialization of new products. ``I was surprised to find that most of the 2,000 staff who work here at the Nagoya center are really quiet,'' said Goda. ``They are not challenging, not aggressive; they are more like government officials.'' Indeed, according to analysts, many Mitsubishi Heavy executives view themselves as quasi-government officials, so closely is the company tied to the government teat. As a whole, about half of the company's orders come from the central and local governments or from semi-governmental institutions such as public utilities. About half of its ¥120 billion annual research and development budget is also derived from governmental institutions. Mitsubishi Heavy's corporate slogan -- ``To walk with the nation'' -- also reflects the close ties. Divisional Changes The company's electronics division reflects the new emphasis on private-sector business. The division was long operated as an R&D division but was transformed a year ago into a marketing and sales division. All 300 engineers in the division are expected to work as sales engineers, responding to customers' demands and requests. This fiscal year, the division expects to receive some ¥5 billion worth of orders. While that's only a fraction of total annual sales, division General Manager Kenzo Noguchi said he's happy that the division is gradually combining the three functions of research, production and sales. For one of the company's core divisions, shipbuilding, the transition has been rougher. Twenty years ago, the division accounted for half the value of all company orders. By last year, that had fallen to less than 18% of orders, with little hope for improvement in the near future. In contrast, the company's power-systems division, which makes power plants, has gradually increased its sales, profits and corporate influence by promoting intense internal competition between factories. The company's past three presidents, including Aikawa, all belonged at one time to this division, which last year generated 27% of total sales. Among contracts the power-systems division won last year were for a ¥60 billion integrated electric-power generating plant in Syria, a ¥20 billion coal-fired power plant in Chile and contracts for thermal power stations in the Philippines and Saudi Arabia. Much of the credit for the power-systems division's profitability goes to Yotaro Iida, now the company's chairman. ``Mitsubishi Heavy can survive even if the yen surges to 100 to the dollar,'' Iida said recently. The secret of the division's competitiveness lies in management's decision to allow related sections and factories to compete with each other for outside orders, explained Tomozuchi Kawamura, the division's general manager. ``Such tough in-house competition has enabled the division to grow stronger and more powerful on the international bidding scene,'' he said. For Mitsubishi Heavy, the quality of technology is less a problem than how to apply it to new products. Worldwide, the company's reputation for developing excellent products dates to the late 19th century when the firm's predecessor made most of Japan's fleet. As the core of the heavy industry division of the prewar Mitsubishi zaibatsu, the company was a leading munitions maker until its dissolution in 1950. It regrouped in its current form in 1964. Among the company's latest technological accomplishments is the Yamato 1, the world's first ship to use superconducting magneto-hydrodynamic direct drives. In June 1992, the vessel successfully completed a test voyage in Kobe Bay. ``The key to R&D is the ability to go beyond the problem barrier,'' said Hiroshi Sakai, chief engineer at the company's Kobe Shipyard. Risks as Challenges For Kuniichi Kanda, project manager on the FSX, the next-generation fighter being developed by Japan and the U.S., the greatest task is keeping development costs down. Kanda, who works at the company's Nagoya aerospace systems factory, said he has managed to do this in part by using data from tests already carried out on similar fighters already in existence. ``Without such savings, development costs would have been three times as high as they are now,'' Kanda said. To President Aikawa, knowledge of what it takes to succeed in technical fields is what's needed to succeed in business as well. ``The ability to see risks as challenges is what stops the technical manager from being a mere administrator,'' said Aikawa. He said he hoped that completion this spring of a new R&D center in Yokohama would enable different kinds of engineers from different divisions to brainstorm and to come up with new ideas from basic research that can be commercialized. The center will absorb 2,600 engineers from different divisions, a large percentage of the company's R&D staff. About 10% of the company's more than 45,000 employees are assigned to R&D activities.
