The ambassador heard from the journalists that his government had fled from the capital, Kigali. Earlier, the ambassador denied that there is an anti-Belgian campaign in Kigali. Francoise Walminck, was that only a rumor? [Ngarukiyintwali] "It is a rumor. I believe that, for Latin scholars, it would be necessary to find the etymology of the word in order to know what it means." [Walminck] For weeks, Radio Mille Collines, a radio station close to the authorities, has been broadcasting anti-Belgian propaganda messages. [Ngarukiyintwali] "And it is true that yesterday, I was summoned to the Foreign Ministry by Minister Claes's chef de cabinet. We spoke about various issues concerning the relations between Belgium and Rwanda." [Walminck] But, for the ambassador: [Ngarukiyintwali] "This anti-Belgian campaign in Rwanda does not exist." [Walminck] Worse, the Rwandan Government is accusing the UN Mission in Rwanda and the UN soldiers of not exercising proper control at the airport when the attack on the presidential plane took place, and, even worse, of giving technical support to the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] rebels and of playing an active role during the RPF operations against the Rwandan Army.
