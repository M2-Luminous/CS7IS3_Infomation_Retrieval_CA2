As a result of sustained heavy rainfalls, record water levels have been reported on the Xijiang River in the Pearl River Valley in south China and the Xiangjiang River in central Hunan, causing major economic damage and loss of a few lives. Reports from Hunan Province said that 40 counties and 5.3 million people there have been affected by floods. A total of 400,000 ha [hectares] of crops were afflicted. Chen warned that special attention has to be paid to the Pearl River Delta, where a fast-growing economy may suffer huge losses should floods hit. The conference decided to send working groups to Guangdong and Guangxi. The groups will be composed of officials from the Ministries of Water Resources, Construction and Civil Affairs, and the State Economic and Trade Commission, as well as from the headquarters of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army, to help coordinate local flood control efforts.
