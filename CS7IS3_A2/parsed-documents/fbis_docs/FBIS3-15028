Udaltsov told BNS Estonia "is long since familiar with Russia's official position" on troop withdrawal, which does not accept Aug. 31 as the final, mutually agreed upon deadline for the pullout of its armed forces from Estonia. "It is unclear why (Estonia) attempts to build this position up as a news item," the Russian diplomat said. "If the Estonian side is seeking a pretext to break off the talks, Estonians should admit they see no point in continuing the negotiations." [passage omitted] Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar said at a press conference today that, if Russia officially announces it will change the troop withdrawal deadline, Estonia will break off the talks. "The pullout of Russian troops from Estonia has slowed down since the beginning of the year," the premier noted. "If Russia had continued the withdrawal at the same pace as in past years, the troops would have left Estonia in the first months of this year."
