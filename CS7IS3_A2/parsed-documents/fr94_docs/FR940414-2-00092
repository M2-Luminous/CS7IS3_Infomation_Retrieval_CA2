FR940414-2-00092 FR940414-2-00066 The REIT Index will be reviewed approximately on a monthly basis by the CBOE staff. The CBOE may change the composition of the REIT Index at any time to reflect conditions in REIT markets. At present, all twenty-five REITs represented in the index invest a preponderance of their assets (in most cases, at least 75 percent) in real property. If a REIT that is included as a component stock becomes unrepresentative of REIT markets, the stock will be removed from the index. Whenever removal is necessary, every effort will be made to replace the removed stock with a stock that is suitably representative. In such circumstances, the CBOE will take into account the capitalization, liquidity, volatility, and name recognition of the proposed replacement stock. The CBOE most likely will maintain twenty-five stocks in the index at all times. Absent prior approval by the Commission, the CBOE will not increase to more then thirty-three nor reduce to fewer than seventeen the number of stocks in the REIT Index, nor will it make any change in the composition of the index that would cause less than ninety percent of the REIT Index, by weight, to be composed of stocks that are eligible for listing as equity options under CBOE Rule 5.3. The Exchange proposes to base trading in options on the REIT Index on the full value of the index. The Exchange may list long-term index option series (``LEAPS''), as provided in CBOE Rule 24.9. The Exchange also may provide for the listing of reduced-value LEAPS, the underlying value of which will be calculated at one-tenth the REIT Index value. The current and closing index value of any such reduced-value LEAPS, after the initial computation, will be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth. Strike price intervals will be no less than $5.00 for every series of REIT Index options, except that reduced-value LEAPS will have stock price intervals that are no less than $2.50. REIT Index options will have European-style exercise and will be ``A.M.-settled index options'' within the meaning of the rules in Chapter XXIV, including CBOE Rule 24.9, which is being amended to refer specifically to REIT Index options. The proposed options will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month. Thus, the last day for trading in an expiring series will be the second business day (ordinarily a Thursday) preceding the expiration date. As modified in this proposed rule change, the Rules in Chapter XXIV will be applicable to REIT Index options. The REIT Index will be deemed to be ``narrow-based'' for purposes of the position limit requirements of CBOE Rule 24.4A. Ten reduced-value options will equal one full-value contract for position limit purposes. The CBOE has the necessary systems capacity to support new series of options that would result from the introduction of REIT Index options. The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general, and furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to enable the listing and trading of REIT Index options subject to just and equitable principles of trade and is structured to protect investors and the public interest. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding, or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or (B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC.
