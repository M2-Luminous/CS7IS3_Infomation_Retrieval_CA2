Specialists think that it is merely a tenth of the total number of infected people. The Russian Federal Scientific and Methodological Center to combat AIDs is the main body dealing with the problem. Vadim Pokrovskiy, its head, said that there was no radical method of treatment for AIDS thus far. Prevention is, therefore, the only option here. However, it is mainly the costs of treatment that are being met so far. Thus, for instance, the 130 AIDS patients at the clinic in Sokolinyye Gory are served by personnel numbering 340 specialists. Enormous resources are being spent to find out who is infected, but there are only three people from the center to combat AIDS that work in the area of prevention. This 20th century plague has claimed 105 lives in Russia to date.
