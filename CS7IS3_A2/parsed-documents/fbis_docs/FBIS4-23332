The issue concerning the return of former members of military units is developing into a local and international embarrassment for Namibia after the Committee on Defense and Security of the Frontline States advised in Windhoek in April that the soldiers should be allowed to return to their country of birth. Namibia was also present at the conference and not only made proposals concerning the return of Namibians from South Africa, but also suggested that former soldiers who left Zimbabwe after independence should be allowed to return to their country. In the latest initiative concerning the fate of approximately 12,000 Namibians in South Africa, the king of the Hereros, Mr. Kuaima Riruako, addressed the issue in a letter to President Sam Nujoma and also sent a copy of the letter to Mr. Mandela. Mr. Riruako emphasized that the soldiers and their families -- mainly former members of Koevoet [crowbar; former police counterinsurgency unit] and the territorial forces -- left the country at that stage because they could not depend on the protection of the government. "The Namibian Government's hesitation, even refusal, to allow these Namibians to return to the country of their birth is a flagrant violation of their constitutional rights. These former soldiers are Namibians by birth or are descendants of Namibians and include more than a hundred Hereros and their families. Since these people fled from Namibia it can be deduced that at that stage they could not hope for any protection from government. What makes things worse is that the constitution determines that no person, as a citizen through birth or those of Namibian descent, may be denied citizenship. This clearly indicates that Namibians can come and go as they please. In light of this constitutional right, the Herero king is calling on President Sam Nujoma to honor his oath, that is, to protect the constitution at all times. Mr. Nujoma should also respect the rights of Namibians who want to return to their country and he should ensure that they be allowed to return home without any further delay," according to Mr. Riruako's letter to the two heads of state.
