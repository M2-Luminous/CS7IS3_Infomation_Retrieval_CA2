On 27 May 1994 at the roundtable meeting of Cambodian leaders in Pyongyang under the lofty chairmanship of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, His Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan, on behalf of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK], suggested that the meeting discuss and agree upon a minimal policy program to be used as a political basis for national reconciliation. In this spirit H.E. Khieu Samphan said in parts seven and nine of his address: To achieve genuine national reconciliation and to rally national forces in accordance with the will of our nation and people, all of us should compromise and make mutual concessions. This is the issue to be discussed now and later on. As His Majesty the King has repeatedly stated: How should the PDK be included into a national government and into a national army, which includes all Cambodian sides? Furthermore, in a situation in which there is a national government and a national army including all Cambodian sides, how should the PDK hand over zones under its control to the national government and merge its troops with the national army? To solve these problems, we should set up a minimal policy program that all of us agree upon in order to establish a national government and a national army that includes all sides. We should have such a minimal policy program so that all of us can stand on a concrete basis of consensus while we are working on national reconciliation and also later when the national government and the national army start doing their work. II. The PDK holds that there should be a minimal policy program agreed upon and set up by all parties to be used as a necessary basis on which all national forces can rally and cooperate. Without a minimal policy program agreed upon and accepted by everyone as a basis for all, all sides will continue in their respective political directions, which are different or even contradictory. This way, national reconciliation cannot be achieved. Experiences from ancient and modern history, at home and abroad, have clearly testified to this. Even experiences following the September 1993 election are already clear enough. III. It is obvious that this minimal policy program should be set up in accordance with the essence and spirit of the joint communique of the roundtable meeting in Pyongyang on 28 May 1994, part two, which says: The roundtable meeting unanimously agreed on its constant loyalty to, support and defense of a unified Cambodia without partition of territory, without secession, and with its territorial integrity, with the land and maritime borders and waters that the international community recognized and respected between 1963 and 1969, and with respect for Cambodia's ideals of peace, solidarity, national union, independence, and progress. The essence of articles 2 and 52 of the Constitution is also clear. Article 2 says: The territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia can in no way be violated within its borders as set out in 1:100,000 maps made between 1933 and 1953, and which were internationally recognized between 1963 and 1969. Article 52 says: The Royal Government of Cambodia pledges to defend the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia and to implement a policy of national reconciliation to defend national union and preserve the nation's good traditions and customs. The Royal Government of Cambodia shall defend its legitimacy and ensure public order and security. The state gives priority to the living standards and well being of its citizens. The essence of the king's address on 31 October 1993 is clear. The magic medicine to cure our Cambodia's serious sickness is nothing else but national reconciliation, national union, an awakening, and the resolution of all nationalists to achieve the sacred national union, the way our nation did in the Angkor era, and more recently during the royal crusade for Cambodia's full independence in 1952-1953. The aspiration of the entire Cambodian nation and people is national reconciliation and peace. This is the political essence that should be taken into account in setting up a minimal policy program. IV. How the details of the minimal policy program should be worked out is up to all sides to discuss. This minimal policy program, once agreed upon by everyone, must be strictly observed by all Cambodian sides. Foreigners too have to abide by this minimal policy program. As H.E. Khieu Samphan has pointed out in his address at the 27 May 1994 roundtable talks, for decades the succession of problems affecting Cambodia were not created by Cambodians. These problems were the result of direct foreign interference and aggression. People are aware of the disastrous consequences. Although these are the roots of the Cambodian problem, as long as Cambodians do their best they will be able to solve the problem. Such action is a response to the request and profound aspiration of the entire Cambodian nation and people, who want to see unity among all national forces -- forces that are genuinely reconciled and united without any political discrimination whatsoever. V. The PDK proposal for all Cambodians sides to agree with one another on a minimal policy program in line with the above spirit reflects the PDK's responsible spirit and its sincere desire to achieve genuine and lasting national reconciliation in accordance with the profound aspiration of our nation and people so that we have peace and live normally and have a chance to quickly rebuild Cambodia. The PDK is striving to work to achieve national reconciliation so that there are enough national forces working together to continue solve the nation's problems, both large and small. This is in order for our Cambodia to gradually move toward peace, independence, national union, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. The PDK has no other objectives than these.
