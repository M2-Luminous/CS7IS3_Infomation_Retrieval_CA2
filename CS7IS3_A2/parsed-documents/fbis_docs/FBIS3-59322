Regarding the situation of China's human rights, particularly that in citizens' political rights and the legal protection for human rights, the white paper "Human Rights in China" published by the Information Office of the State Council in October 1991 has already described these quite well. However, after realistically examining the situation in China and using the experience of other countries for reference, we cannot but point out that there are many problems that we need to solve and plenty of rooms for improvement in protecting human rights. One of the problems is that the constitution has no provision to guarantee citizens' rights to enjoy freedoms that they should enjoy, while the other problem is that some of the rights have been incorporated into the constitution, but there are no laws enacted to guarantee such rights. Therefore, there is no firm guarantee. In addition, a situation prevails where "laws are not observed and their enforcement is not strict," so that some legal rights are only in name. We would like to analyze the existing problems in the protection of human rights as follows: Freedom of Person Is Deprived and Restricted 1. On Freedom of Person. China's current constitution stipulates that the freedom of person of citizens is inviolable and that unlawful deprivation or restriction of citizens' freedom of person by detention or other means is prohibited. Article 2 of the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China Governing Arrest and Detention" stipulates that no citizens "may be arrested except by the decision of a people's court or with the sanction of a people's procuratorate." However, public security organs actually often arrest citizens in disguised form by using the "shelter and investigation" provisions. Legally, China has never promulgated any provision on "shelter and investigation." Re-education through labor is regarded as an administrative penalty. In essence it deprives and restricts personal freedom of those who receive such re-education. The provision for "living at home under surveillance" is a coercive measure specified in the "Criminal Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China." It stipulates that "surveillance of one's home is to be carried out by the local public security station or by the people's commune or the defendant's unit entrusted with the task." This kind of coercive measure serves to limit the sphere of activities of the defendant and place him or her under surveillance, but it does not completely restrict his freedom of person. Nevertheless, the defendant is often brought to another location by the public security organ and detained in a disguised form, and his personal freedom is completely deprived and restricted. In addition, Article 92 of the "Criminal Procedure Law" of China stipulates: "The period for holding a defendant in custody during investigation may not exceed two months. Where the circumstances of a case are complex and the case cannot be concluded before the expiration of the period, the period may be extended by one month with the approval of the people's procuratorate at the next level up." However, this period actually often exceeds the period prescribed by the law. Sometimes, it even lasts as long as several years. In addition, China has for many years implemented the policy of "seeking employment at the place of reform", which has actually prevented prisoners from becoming completely free after finishing their term of reform through labor. All this runs counter to the laws which guarantee citizens' freedom of person. "Freedom of Thought" No Longer Available 2. On Freedom of Thought. The "Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," which had played the role of the interim constitution when the People's Republic of China was first founded, also had a provision on freedom of thought. Article 5 of the program said: "People of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedoms of thought, speech, the press, assembly, association, correspondence, person, residence, change of residence, religious belief, procession and demonstration." However, after the 1954 Constitution, freedom of thought is no longer available. There is only freedom of belief. This means religious belief, not any belief in any discipline or thought. The 1982 Constitution, the current one, follows this practice. It has similar wording in its Preamble. Also, it adds that "Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people of all nationalities will continue to adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship and follow the socialist road... and turn China into a socialist country with a high level of culture and democracy." Some of China's jurists have stated with certainty that "the four cardinal principles have been incorporated into the Constitution." "The Preamble of the Constitution is legally binding," they added. Whether or not this kind of practice of compelling people to legally accept the ideology runs counter to the principle of freedom of thought is something that we have to give thought to. 3. On Freedoms of Speech, of the Press, and of Participation in Fine Arts and Literary and Art Activities. All the versions of China's Constitution stipulate that citizens enjoy the freedom of speech. However, Article 51 of the current Constitution stipulates that "The exercise by citizens of the People's Republic of China of their freedoms and rights may not infringe upon the interests of the state, of society and of the collective, or upon the lawful freedoms and rights of other citizens." Due to the fact that as of now, there is no law of the press or law of publication which explicitly describes the scope of speech that is prohibited, and that Article 102 of the Criminal Law on crimes of carrying out counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement is quite vague, citizens' words can be considered as "those infringing upon the interests of the state, of society and of the collective," and their freedoms of speech and of the press can be restricted or deprived at any time. Mass media such as newspapers and magazines have always been regarded as the "party's mouthpiece," and the ban on newspapers and magazines run by people has not been lifted. It is difficult for political thought and speeches that differ from those of the ruling party and the government to get published, while writers of literary or academic works under criticism often have no chance to defend themselves. All the information in newspapers, journals, and radio and television materials are carefully scrutinized. Books and journals from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas are strictly checked or sealed off when they go through the import procedure. Citizens' rights to know things (also called the right to understanding things) is restricted to a great extent. People often have to rely on the study of news reports which "are exported for domestic circulation" to understand the true situation in China. No Law of Association Even At Present 4. On Freedom of Association. All versions of China's Constitution have stipulated that citizens enjoy freedom of association. However, there is no law of association even at present. The State Council had only promulgated the "Regulations for the Registration and Control of Mass Organizations." "Association" in the Constitution means mass organizations, excluding any political party or any organization of a political nature. There is no "Law of Political Parties" in China. Laws have never stipulated whether or not it is legal to form other new political parties. Actually the formation of any new political party is prohibited. The "Regulations for the Registration and Control of Mass Organizations" stipulate that in forming a mass organization, citizens must register it with the department of civil affairs with approval. This provision places nearly all mass organizations under the control of the government. Leading members of such mass organizations are usually party or government officials or are appointed by the party or government leadership. Such mass organizations invariably become "official" or "semi-official." Let us take the All-China Writers' Association as an example. Although many members of the association are displeased with the leadership of the association, they have no rights to form another association. Workers' activities to form a liberal trade union are also strictly forbidden in view of the lesson drawn from the Poland Solidarity Trade Union. 5. On Freedoms of Residence and Change of Residence. China's first "1954" Constitution had a provision in this connection, but such provision was deleted in the next three versions of the Constitution. China imposes strict restriction on shifting rural population to the urban areas. Rural residents are treated quite differently as compared with their counterparts in the urban areas. Freedom to leave and enter the country should be citizens' inherent rights, but such freedom is severely restricted in China. 6. On Freedom of Strike. The 1954 Constitution had no provision on freedom of strike, but the 1975 and 1978 versions of the Constitution had a provision in this connection. In his "Report on the Revision of the Constitution" made in January 1975, Zhang Chunqiao said that "in accordance with Chairman Mao's proposal," the specification that citizens enjoy freedom to strike has been added to the Constitution. However, such freedom was once again deleted in the 1982 Constitution. A legalist who participated in drafting the Constitution at that time reasoned that "Workers are masters of the nation, and workers' interests are in accord with those of the state. A strike would only infringe upon the interests of the workers and the state and undermine the national economy. In addition, a strike often affects social order and make things difficult for the people to work and live." This is another example of asking the people to sacrifice their due rights for the interests of the state, of society and of the collective. However, tremendous changes had already taken place in the country at that time. The number of private and foreign-funded enterprises already accounted for a considerably larger percentage of the total number of enterprises. Even if the aforementioned statement was reasonable at that time, it does not make sense now. Need To "Presume That the Defendant Is Innocent" 7. On the Principle That "the Defendant Is Presumed Innocent." Prior to 1959, many jurists in China advocated the principle that the defendant should be presumed innocent. However, during the anti-rightist struggle such principle was branded as a bourgeois theory which "is conducive to the defendant." Many people received criticisms were thus classified as "rightists." The official view is that in investigating and trying cases, China's judicial organs adhere to the principle of "taking facts as the basis and law as the criterion." "They presume that criminal suspects are neither guilty nor innocent, and judgement should be passed on the basis of objective facts and in accordance with the law." As a matter of fact, the principle of seeking truth from facts cannot replace the presumption that the defendant is innocent, because the crux of the problem is that what kind of legal status the defendant has before the facts are ascertained and a sentence is passed by the court. Here is a good example. On 31 March 1993, the FAZHI RIBAO carried an article: "Work in Handling the Aftermath of a Senior Middle School Girl Student's Suicide Case in Zhuozhou City Is Still in Deadlock After Five Months," and sponsored a discussion forum on this incident. What happened was that a 15 year old girl student, under a situation of having no concrete evidence against her, was subject to coercive interrogations several times a night. She was instructed to rummage through her bookcases and boxes and to expose the contents. Afterwards, she committed suicide. However, the school administration drew the conclusion that "There is no evidence to prove her larceny. Nor can we deny her larceny." This incident completely substantiates the correctness and the necessity of the principle of presuming the defendant as innocent in protecting human rights. No One Supervises Enforcement of the Constitution 8. On Supervising the Enforcement of the Constitution. The current constitution in China stipulates that the National People's Congress and its standing committee are responsible for overseeing the enforcement of the Constitution. No particular organization is assigned to perform the job of enforcement. In essence, no one is supervising the enforcement of the Constitution, because one of the important supervisory tasks is to determine whether or not all laws and regulations are in accord with the Constitution. Apparently, the National People's Congress and its standing committee cannot carry out the work of examining all the laws that they have passed. Due to the lack of a particular organization assigned to oversee the enforcement of the Constitution, citizens are unable to take legal proceedings against state organs and their leadership for violations of the Constitution. Are China's laws and regulations for the protection of citizens' rights as well as rules for the implementation of such laws and regulations in complete accord with the guidelines and the provisions of the Constitution? People are gravely concerned over this question. Therefore, it is necessary to set up an authoritative organization to insure that laws and regulations are in accord with the Constitution. In short, on the one hand, China has scored remarkable achievements in strengthening socialist democracy and the legal system, and in protecting citizens' freedoms, and rights and interests, since the convocation of the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, while on the other hand, there are inadequacies, even serious inadequacies. In order to make improvements in this respect, we must continue to reform our political structure, further develop socialist democracy, and improve the socialist legal system. To work hard to improve China's situation in human rights is not only indispensable in building a democratic, civilized and prosperous modern nation, but also essential in making valuable contributions to promoting progress for the whole mankind.
