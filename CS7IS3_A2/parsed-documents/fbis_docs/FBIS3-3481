They are Mr. Cheng Kejie, chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region; Mr. Lei Ning, vice chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region; Mr. Hong Puzhou, chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional Planning Commission; and Mr. Shui Liguo, mayor of Beihai City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. [Unidentified correspondent] I am a reporter with the China Chinese Language Broadcasting Company. My question is: Guangxi is the most convenient passageway linking China's southwest region with Southeast Asia. The CPC Central Committee proposed in 1992 that efforts should be made to give full play to Guangxi's role as a passageway for linking China with the outside world. Focusing on construction with this aim in mind, Guangxi has strengthened the construction of infrastructural facilities and basic industries in the past two years. How is this work progressing and what difficulties are being encountered? [Cheng] In its Document No. Four issued in 1992, the CPC Central Committee explicitly stipulated that efforts will be made to build Guangxi's coastal areas into a most convenient passageway for China's southwest region. [passage omitted] We have been concentrating on construction in these areas -- transport, energy, and communications. In the transportation area, we are now building or expanding five airports; building five new railroads; and two superhighways. The first one is a 139-km four-lane superhighway from Liuzhou to Guilin; the second one is a six-lane superhighway from Nanning to Qinzhou, Fangcheng, and Beihai. We realize that there is insufficient electric power in Guangxi to better serve China's southwest region and also to serve Guangxi's economic development. Therefore, we are now stepping up the construction of hydroelectric and thermal power stations, the combined capacity of which will come to around 8.2 million kilowatts. When these facilities are completed, we believe they will create better conditions for opening up the southwest region and Guangxi to the outside world and for their economic development. [Unidentified correspondent] I am a reporter with the Asian Television of Hong Kong. Many criminal cases in Hong Kong involved firearms which were smuggled from Mainland China to Hong Kong, and Guangxi is one of sources from which firearms are smuggled into Hong Kong. May I ask what has the regional government done to check the outflow of firearms? [Lei] Guangxi shares a 1,020-km land border with neighboring countries and has a 1,595-km coastline. Some criminals have taken advantage of the long border and coastline to engage in firearms smuggling and drug trafficking. The autonomous regional government and its law-enforcing departments have always adopted strict measures to crack down on these illegal activities. To strengthen the fight against these activities so as to give the criminal elements no opening to exploit, last year we increased our police force by more 700 people, who were especially assigned to crack down on firearms smuggling and drug trafficking. Through our struggle last year, we seized more than a 100 kilograms of heroin, over 800 kg of opium, and about 300 firearms. The arrested criminals have been handled according to law.

According to statistics, the amount of investment, the number of foreign-funded enterprises, and the amount of foreign exchange earned through exports have increased considerably in Guangxi in the past two years. Where did most of the foreign investment come from? What industries have these investments have channeled into? What are the prospects of these investment projects for earning foreign exchange? [Lei] [passage omitted] In 1992 Guangxi's foreign trade came to $1.108 billion, up 33 percent over 1991. In 1993 its foreign trade volume was $1.325 billion, up 19.6 percent over 1992. At the end of 1991, there were only 559 "san zi" enterprises [joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and wholly owned enterprises] in Guangxi. In that year, only $63 million worth of foreign capital was used, but by the end of 1992 there were 1,870 "san zi" enterprises, and $246 million worth of foreign capital was used. By the end of 1993, there were 4,368 "san zi" enterprises in Guangxi, and $1 billion worth of foreign capital was used that year. Guangxi has moved from 12th place to eighth among the 12 provinces and cities in the coastal areas in using foreign capital. First, investment has been expanding to different fields. Originally, most investments were used in real estate and the service industries. In the past two years, investments have expanded to infrastructural facilities, basic industries, agricultural development, and the transformation of old enterprises. Second, investments have expanded to other areas. In the past, investments were mainly concentrated in coastal cities. Now, investments have spread to the hinterland and some hilly areas. For example, in Bose Prefecture 25 "san zi" enterprises were approved 1993, with a combined investment of $5 million. [passage omitted] Third, the number of countries and regions making investments has increased. By the end of 1993, there were 44 countries and regions investing in Guangxi. The main investors were from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. The ratio of investments from Hong Kong and Macao in Guangxi is roughly 25 percent; the ratio of Taiwan's investments in Guangxi was 11 percent in 1993. Fourth, there are many investment projects by big consortia. Last year, there were over 70 investment projects, each with an investment of over $10 million. In 1992, there were only four such projects. In exports, "san zi" enterprises are a force that should not be underestimated. Their exports now account for about one-eight of Guangxi's total exports. [Unidentified Vietnamese correspondent in Mandarin] I am a reporter with VNA. First, in the past few years, especially since the normalization of relations between the two countries, what progress has been made in Guangxi's ties with Vietnam? Second, what are the prospects for development between Guangxi and Vietnam? [Cheng] Since China and Vietnam normalized their relations in November 1991, significant progress has been made in economic and friendly contacts between the two countries. The development in this area has been healthy, and it has brought benefits to the people of the two countries. [passage omitted] Take trade as an example. According to the situation in border trade in the past few years, such trade is mutually complementary. We have built several economic projects in Vietnam. These projects require that both sides continue cooperation on a mutually beneficial basis. [Unidentified correspondent] I am a reporter with the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY. Recently, many experts from international economic circles have predicted that an international metropolis will emerge in Southeast Asia and the Beibu Wan [gulf] area. It has been learned that Guangxi's Beihai city has drawn up some plans in this connection. Would Mayor Shuai please brief us about the plans? [Shuai] Beihai city has eight major resources. Its fresh water, land, port construction, and tourism resources are especially good. In short, with these resources a large port for commerce with foreign countries can be built. In addition, it has a huge potential of becoming a large metropolis. [passage omitted] [Chinese-American correspondent in Mandarin] I am Zhou Youkang, a reporter with the Voice of America. I have a question concerning investment: Mr. Chairman, you have just mentioned that investments in Guangxi were mainly from Taiwan and Hong Kong. What about the United States? In your opinion, what can the United States do to contribute to Guangxi's economic development? How do you promote trade between Guangxi and the United States? [Lei] In fact, apart from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, the next biggest investor is the United States. The biggest wholly owned enterprise, the [Tule] Company I have just mentioned, has invested $40 million in leasing 60,000 mu of land in [Hepu] for agricultural development. The company will import fine seed strains from the United States and will assume responsibilities for seeds, processing, and marketing. In fact, our economic cooperative relations with the United States are also significant. Due to the lack of time, we cannot go into detail one by one. [Shuai] The doors of Beihai city are open. We welcome the United States to quickly enter its markets. Don't be late. [Moderator] That's the end of the news conference. Thank you.
