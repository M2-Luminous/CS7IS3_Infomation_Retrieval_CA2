Wu Yi, who is on a three-day visit to India at the invitation of the Indian Commerce Ministry, will attend the fifth meeting of the Sino-Indian Joint Team for Economic and Trade Affairs which is taking place in a few hours. The two sides "will discuss matters of common interest relating to economic, trade and technological cooperation between the two countries," she said at the airport. The joint team was set up after late Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi visited China in 1988 to promote bilateral trade between the two countries. The two countries will sign the minutes of talks and the protocol on trade for 1994-95 at the conclusion of the one-day meeting of the joint team. During her stay here, she will meet Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, Minister of State for Steel S.M. Dev, Minister of State for Coal A. Panja as well as Minister of State for Petroleum Captain S. Sharma. Traveling with her is a 11-member team of businessmen from Chinese trading corporations dealing with silk, livestock, mineral products and metallurgy. The Chinese chief executives will interact directly with their Indian counterparts to look for more opportunities of business and cooperation. Bilateral trade between India and China totaled 670 million U.S. dollars last year with a surplus of 157 million dollars in favor of India. China imports large quantities of iron ore, steel, hides and skins from India and exports silk to it annually.
