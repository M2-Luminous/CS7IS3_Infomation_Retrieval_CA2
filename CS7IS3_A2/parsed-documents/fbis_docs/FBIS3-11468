At a joint press conference attended by ARSA and Iberia executives, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo said that the Spanish airline has made a 500 million dollar capital injection of which 100 million will go to reserves and the remaining 400 million towards settling accrued debts. The Argentine government in turn will hang on to 15 percent of the share packet of which 10 percent has been assigned to the employee shareholding programme. The government will also authorize ARSA and any other airline that operates in Argentina to run its own aircraft servicing facilities and will restrict the availability of non-regular flights. There will be no restriction on the number of flights on domestic routes. ARSA will continue as a national flag carrier, a condition which the government has undertaken to defend should any protests arise from countries with which it has bilateral aerocommercial agreements and who object that Iberia owns more than 49 percent of ARSA. At the same time the government is able to maintain its rights to veto even though its shareholding could sink below the five percent stipulated in the privatization process. ARSA however no longer has the power to veto route management decisions or the investment plan. After three years and four months of intrigue and failed discussions, yesterday's deal ironically takes the whole privatization process back to its first stage. The new share distribution is exactly the same as the original distribution made when ARSA was first privatized. [passage omitted]
