FBIS3-28469 "dreas025_h_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-025 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Feb 1994 SOUTHEAST ASIA Brunei, Malaysia & Singapore MOUs on Economic Cooperation Signed With Manila BK0702122194 Kuala Lumpur NEW STRAITS TIMES in English 4 Feb 94 p 2 BK0702122194 Kuala Lumpur NEW STRAITS TIMES Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Manila, Thurs. -- Economic cooperation between Malaysia and the Philippines entered more concrete terms today with the signing of nine memorandums of understanding (MOUs) involving the respective private sectors. While representatives from the various companies worked on the details of the projects involved, officials from the two governments sat down to finalise details of an investment guarantee agreement (IGA), which may be signed in the next few days. Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and President Fidel Ramos witnessed the signing ceremonies at the Malacanang Palace, the latter's official residence, here this afternoon. Dr. Mahathir, who arrived here this afternoon for a four-day visit, the first by a Malaysian prime minister since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1964, hailed the signing of the agreements as "the start of a new phase in our relations." "I think we have made very good progress," he told a joint news conference after the signings. Asked if more investments from Malaysia could be expected, he replied: "Yes." The nine MOUs could lead to deals worth billions of ringgit. Apart from injecting much-needed capital into the growing Philippine economy, which rose by 2.3 percent last year compared with one per cent in 1992, the deals are also in line with Malaysia's policy to boost reverse investment. The MOUs, signed behind closed doors, are for a hotel project on Samal Island in Mindanao; partial acquisition of the Associated Bank; highway and mass transit systems construction and the implementation of a RM [Malaysian ringgit] 50-million waterwork project; water treatment for Clark Base; gaming houses; production of refrigerators, the construction of Metro Manila waterworks sewerage system; and a U.S. $72-million power plant. The nine MOUs were signed between Johan Holdings Bhd. [Limited]/George Kent and Metropolitan Cebu Water District; Johan Holdings Bhd./George Kent and Bases Conversion Development Authority Berjaya Topgroup (HK) Ltd. and Team Asia Corp Inc.; Berjaya/Wy Sdn. Bhd. [Private Limited] and Fun Characters Inc.; Ekran Bhd. and the Philippine Department of Tourism/Philippine Tourism Authority; Ekran Bhd. and Associated Bank; Renong Bhd./Mara and Public Estates Authority; and Datuk Eugene Campos and Louis Cosan. The signing of the MOUs reflects the determination of both countries to step up investment and bilateral trade after ties had been held back for so long by the Philippine Government's claim over Sabah. Malaysia's investment in the Philippines has been unpredictable. On an uptrend during the 1980s, investments dipped after 1989 and in 1992, no new capital from Malaysia flowed into the Philippines. Last year some 193 million pesos (RM16.3 million) in Malaysian investments went into power generation plants, poultry breeding, and electronic manufacturing projects in the republic. MBf Asia Capital Corp. and MCA Power Corp., together with a third Canadian partner, entered into a deal for a U.S. $2 billion (RM5.5 billion) power plant irrigation and flood control system. Hong Leong Engineering and Sarte Teodore and Associates clinched a deal on the manufacturing of computer software in the Philippines for export. Al-Bakara Malaysia also took a slice of the pie in a deal with a group, led by Mindanao's Mastura family to rehabilitate the state- owned Amanah Bank, now privatised.
