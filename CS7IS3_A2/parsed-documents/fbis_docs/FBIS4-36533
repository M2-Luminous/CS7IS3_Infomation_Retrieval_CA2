Mr. Peres, upon the completion of the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, would it be correct to say that we are at a crossroads in the political process? How should we proceed and what path should we take? [Peres] I would only like to remind you that about nine or 10 months ago nobody believed that the Gaza-Jericho matter would become a reality so quickly. After we reached the Oslo accord it was stated that the accord would be very difficult to implement in the area. We now have an agreement which was implemented in the area. So far -- God willing, as they say -- matters are working better than what we thought. [Ganor] Where do we stand? [Peres] We should continue now. We have four arenas: the Palestinian one--we should decide how to proceed on it; the Jordanian; the Syrian; and the entire Middle East. I know I have not mentioned Lebanon, but this is because I believe Lebanon can be discussed in the Syrian context only. [Nisan] Mr. Peres, has the performance of the Palestinian Authority met the expectations from it so far? [Peres] There were various expectations, but the majority thought it would not work at all. Yesterday I saw people who went through Jericho and said they simply could not believe their eyes. The police were there and order prevailed, and the same applies in Gaza. In my opinion, the main problem is an economic one. If the laborers from the territories are prepared to come here for work and knives are used for cutting bread rather than stabbing people, the situation in Gaza and Jericho can change at once. [Ganor] This is in line with the World Bank demand that Israel lift the closure and enable the laborers to come to Israel for work, thus alleviating the economic distress. The question is whether you will recommend to the government that the closure be lifted. [Peres] The closure is being lifted gradually and carefully. After all, the closure is not an Israeli caprice. This is a measure aimed at preventing the murder of people by laborers, including those who have worked at the same work place for years. If we realize that the opening of all gates to work does not involve danger, they will certainly be opened wide. [Nisan] Mr. Peres, you noted the economic problem. The donor countries which pledged funds to the Palestinian Authority are not funneling them. The question is what role Israel plays here. Will Israel be willing to extend general and financial aid to this authority? [Peres] Not only will Israel will be willing to do so, but it is doing so already. In fact, we paid about 20,000 wages in May in Gaza, and reference is not only to Civil Administration workers, but also to other work places, in order to relieve the distress caused by unemployment. This month we supplied medication for another three months. Licenses were issued to more than 10,000 laborers to come work in Israel. If all the other countries somewhat advance the implementation of their cash commitments, Israel will do the same. [Nisan] Is Israel exercising its influence and moral power to get the European countries and international bodies to aid the Palestinian Authority? [Peres] Absolutely. Participating in the discussions by the donor countries are the director general of the Foreign Ministry together with the person in charge of the territories. We will surely tell the donor countries what the practical needs are, and why it is important to act quickly and not leave a vacuum which can definitely endanger the implementation of the accord. [Ganor] Mr. Peres, at a Labor faction meeting this week you warned that if the momentum in the negotiations with the Palestinians does not continue, the intifadah may erupt anew. When do you intend to start the negotiations on early empowerment for the Palestinians in Judaea and Samaria? [Peres] I think all parties want to rest a little, particularly from unnecessary speeches. Look, there were two processes here. There was a practical process of introducing basic changes on the ground, and a verbal process which angered the entire world. We need the clouds of verbosity to disperse so that the change in the area can be observed, at which time I believe we will be able to resume the negotiations with the Palestinians. [Ganor] The clouds of verbosity come from the other party: 'Arafat's statements, for instance. [Peres] Yes. He simply may not be aware of all the facts or, alternatively, he made totally unnecessary remarks. In Johannesburg he said, for example: Look, I am hesitant about signing. I hesitated because I was not prepared to sign before I received a letter on the Jerusalem issue. In Cairo he was not given any letter on the Jerusalem issue. Our denial was true and genuine. No negotiations over this took place in Cairo. We did not know then that he was referring to Holst's letter. Holst's letter was written much earlier. Cairo was not necessary for that. [Ganor] However, for all practical purposes, Mr. Peres, you are already starting the Jerusalem segment of our program. What is the attitude of Israeli officials in Jerusalem toward the Palestinian declarations that East Jerusalem will ultimately become the capital of the Palestinian state? [Peres] We regard this as mere dreaming, not reality. Look, we cannot forbid people to dream, we cannot stop people from talking. However, in my opinion -- and we have also told the Palestinians this -- we are very adamant about our position. Jerusalem will not be redivided. It will not be a Berlin. We shall establish neither barriers nor walls there. A city can only be the capital of one country. One cannot have two capitals in one city because that would mean a division of Jerusalem. It is the historical capital of Israel and Israel's capital today. We added that we have no intention of harming the Palestinian residents of Jerusalem or their existing institutions. In summation, I would say that in the political sense, the issue of Jerusalem is closed and it will remain the united capital of Israel, whereas from the religious aspect it will remain an open, spiritual center for the three monotheistic religions. [Ganor] What should the Palestinians watching our program understand from your reply? [Peres] That everything is open from the religious aspect. We will respect every sentiment, every prayer, and every religious need. We will not sacrifice Jerusalem to radical political plans. One should recall that throughout all of history, Jerusalem was never an Arab capital and one should also recall that the Jewish people never had any other capital but Jerusalem. [Ganor] Mr. Peres, which steps does the Israeli Government intend to take in order to maintain the current status quo in East Jerusalem and prevent it from being undermined by the other side? [Peres] We have made ourselves very clear. The Palestinian Authority must handle autonomy-related affairs from Jericho. We will not countenance any transfer of institutions from Jericho to Jerusalem. This violates the agreement and the nature of Jerusalem. [Ganor] Are we talking about legislative steps, orders, or limitations on some people who are members of the Palestinian Authority in order to prevent them from establishing representations in Jerusalem? [Peres] If people uphold the law, then no other laws will be necessary. The existing laws are sufficient. First, we expect them to uphold the existing laws. For example, there is no room for Palestinian police in East Jerusalem. There is only one police force, one army, and one government. Educational, religious, and medical institutions, on the other hand, could definitely be permitted. [Ganor] But these were not the institutions the government was referring to when it said it would enact legislation to prevent any changes to the status quo in East Jerusalem. [Peres] We are now looking into the issue. If the status quo has been broken, which is apparently the case here and there, we will examine whether these breaches can be rectified through existing laws or whether additional legislation is called for. The issue is still not clear. It may very well be that any deviations from the law may be rectified through the use of existing legislation and no new laws are necessary. [Ganor] Mr. Peres, the issue of Jerusalem, at least according to the reports, was the main bone of contention. Two days before the signing of the Oslo agreement, 'Arafat almost refused to sign. [Peres] One day before, yes. [Ganor] A day before. What happened? How was 'Arafat persuaded that he could concede on the issue of Jerusalem? [Peres] Look, from the very beginning we said that we were offering the Gaza Strip plus Jericho. This, in order to establish the administrative institutions of the Palestinian autonomy in Jericho. We said that on no account would we ever agree to the establishment of these institutions in Jerusalem. On that dramatic night in Stockholm when we were constantly on the telephone with Tunisia, I explained very forcefully to them that it was either Jericho or no agreement. That was their choice. On the other hand, we stated what I am saying now as well. All the existing insitutions in Jerusalem will be preserved. We have no intention of harming people or institutions. We do not wish to offend their dignity or sensitivities either. I made a clear promise to that effect. [Ganor] Does raising the Jerusalem issue at this stage not expedite the discussion of the permanent arrangement? [Peres] No, not at all. Whoever proposes discussing the permanent arrangement now is actually perpetualizing the conflict. Let us say we start discussions on the permanent arrangement and they raise the issue of Jerusalem. I cannot see where an agreement can provide a solution with regard to the issue of Jerusalem, certainly not today. If you want to highlight the fact that we cannot reach agreement then this is possible. But what is the point? I would like to say that today the problem is more one of relations than borders. Some people think that if we demarcate borders then relations will improve. I think that if we establish a new relationship then we will be able to demarcate the future borders. Let us take the example of Hebron. There are 120,000 Arabs and 500 Jews in Hebron. Would this be a problem if relations were good? In Ma'alot Tarshiha there are both Jewish and Arab communities. Is there any problem there? Are there any problems in Yafo or in Haifa? Arabs and Jews can therefore live together when they have a different relationship. What we all should be doing now is improving relations so that neither side is afraid of the other. Therefore, we should also watch what we are saying. Today, people want barriers and barbed wire fences. That is no way to live or to maintain peace. We need understandings and we need to prove that human beings can live together even if they belong to different peoples. [Ganor] Mr. Peres, with regard to your letter to the Norwegian foreign minister, some people say that the very fact that a letter was sent to the PLO grants the PLO a position of patronage and preeminence in East Jerusalem at the expense of other Islamic and Christian elements. [Peres] First, the PLO is not mentioned in my letter. The word PLO is not mentioned. That is the reason I wrote it to the late Norwegian Foreign Minister Holst and not to 'Arafat, although the contents of the letter are not secret and can be made known to everyone. This is to demonstrate that the Jerusalem issue had not been decided, let us say, in favor of 'Arafat. Nothing of the sort was decided. We know that the Jordanians are sensitive about the Waqf. We will not take any religious authorities from Jordan and give them to another party. We have no intention of changing the status quo to the benefit or the detriment of anybody. We will neither intervene nor meddle in inter-Arab relations. [Ganor] In order to end the chapter on Jerusalem, which will certainly be discussed further in the future, let me ask you if the Israeli Government will accede to Yasir 'Arafat's request to visit Jerusalem if he indeed submits such a request? [Peres] Leave something for a future interview. Why should we answer all the questions now? No such request has been submitted and I therefore cannot give you an answer. [Ganor] But in principle? [Peres] We will discuss the matter in principle when it is put to the test. [Ganor] With your permission sir, let us move on to Jordan, the second topic of discussion we posited at the beginning of our program. Can the understandings reached during this week's talks in Washington between Jordan and Israel be viewed as an opening toward the reaching of a peace treaty between the two countries? [Peres] Definitely. I think that significant progress has been made although obstacles can still be raised. After all, any child can see the necessity of peace with Jordan. The possibility of reaching this peace is also evident. One does not need a telescope to see this as well as the fact that the time has come and that both the Jordanians and the Israelis will greatly benefit from peace. The entire Syrian-African Rift -- and I keep on saying this -- between Lake Tiberias and Elat, instead of being a wasteland of hatred and separation can become a fertile valley supplying jobs to thousands of workers from both sides of the Jordan River, both Jordanians and Israelis. We can attract hundreds of millions of dollars in investments for water desalination plants, tourism ventures, agriculture. There are extraordinary plans and companies are interested in investing. I heard the Jordanian information minister say that Jordan would not miss the train. We feared that the Syrians were holding them back. If the Syrians do not hold them back then there are no hindrances to Jordanian-Israeli relations. I keep on saying this. We told the Jordanians that we can discuss borders and water issues if they are serious about peace. If they seriously intend to reach peace then the time has come to do what is necessary for the benefit of both peoples and peace. [Ganor] Mr. Peres, in light of your remarks and in light of the agreements and understandings reached with the Jordanians this week at the committees and economic talks, do you expect Jordan and Israel to sign a peace treaty in the coming year? [Peres] I do not want to commit myself to dates. I do not expect anything; I merely act. I cannot tell you what will happen. Things do not happen by themselves. As a representative of the Israeli public and a cabinet minister, I can state that we have to act continuously and resolutely to release the citizens of both Jordan and Israel from this artificial state of war. There is no need or foundation for this. It is a total waste of time. The sooner we achieve it, the greater service we will have done our peoples, and it is a pity that things have been put off for so long. [Ganor] If not peace, do you anticipate at least a normalization in relations with Jordan in the near future? [Peres] The difference between normal relations and peace is not great. Peace means normalization. What else is normalization? But you know, I am a practical man and we must welcome everything that promotes peace. [Ganor] What is behind Amman's dramatic change over the last week? Was it a green light from Damascus? [Peres] I cannot tell you. I was not at the meeting between President al-Asad and King Husayn. They may also have concluded that progress is possible and each party should act independently. One must also take into account the implementation of the agreement with the PLO on the Gaza Strip and Jericho. There is also something that I have been saying all the time: we are a three-sided triangle. No side should act against the others. It is better that we work together as a triangle, at least in the economic sense. On numerous occasions I proposed that we cooperate together on economic issues in a Benelux-style arrangement, that is, economic cooperation between three countries. Politically, we should act as two separate entities: a Palestinian-Jordanian entity and an Israeli entity. [Ganor] But Jordan rejected your idea to host an international economic conference in Amman? [Peres] Jordan says that it rejected the proposed date, not the idea itself. Now Jordan has announced that it has adopted my conference proposal but at a later date. The Jordanians claimed that if the conference was held before progress in the negotiations then the world would get the impression that Jordan could be bought with a conference. Some kind of payoff. I do not subscribe to this view. I think that this conference was not held with the intention of buying off anyone but rather to build things. I think that such a conference would have facilitated, not held up, the negotiations. [Ganor] Would it not compete with the conference that you and King Hassan last Friday agreed to hold in Morocco? [Peres] Yes, it is now understood that the second international conference--if such a conference is indeed held in Jordan--will take place at the beginning of 1995. The conference in Morocco is scheduled for the end of October or the beginning of November. After a year, or nine months, it can be continued in Jordan. [Ganor] Still, Saudi Arabia is creating obstacles to the entire issue of lifting the anti-Israel boycott. [Peres] Saudi Arabia is beginning to be problematic. We still remember how Saudi Ambassador to the United States Bandar arrived in New York to meet with Jews, to tell them that Saudi Arabia is peace-oriented, that if settlements cease and the Palestinians are recognized, then certain things will follow. To my great regret, a delay occurred in, say, Saudi support for peace. At the meeting of the working group in Qatar recently, on arms control -- on supervising the level of armament and on disarmament -- the Saudis were totally negative. [Ganor] Did Israel or the United States chastise the Saudis about this? [Peres] What do you mean by chastising? We say this to the Americans too. The Saudis may be angry at the Gulf emirates which do not abide by the Arab Peninsula's discipline and the like, but it is very difficult for us to decipher Saudi Arabia's conduct. Saudi Arabia needs to decide whether it wants or opposes peace. If it opposes peace, we will reach our conclusions. It is not us who threatens Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia knows precisely who threatens it. In general, many Arab countries know that if there is any threat, it emanates from Teheran, not from Jerusalem. If Saudi Arabia wants chaos in the Middle East, of continued wars, of a continued arms race, it can surely conduct a negative policy, but it is about time it decides where it is heading. [Ganor] Mr. Peres, what do you learn from the Syrian position about its readiness to break the deadlock on the Israeli-Syrian track? Is there a change in the Syrian position on the eve of Warren Christopher's possible arrival in the region this month? [Peres] I would not say that a breakthrough has been achieved yet. Look, if Syria truly wants a normalization of relations, it should start with normalization in contacts. Again, desiring high-level meetings, of heads of state or ministers, is not an Israeli caprice. The point is that our people are very skeptical about what Syria truly wants. Nobody doubts that Syria wants the Golan Heights back, but is Syria truly prepared to go for acceptable security arrangements? Is Syria truly prepared to give peace without tricks, without additions or deletions? There is a doubt here, and it is incumbent on the Syrian leaders to appear publicly and openly in the negotiations with us so as to reach results. Let me tell you, the negotiations we held with the PLO were very difficult. They were difficult both for them and for us. Take that night in Cairo, for example: The Israeli delegation -- the prime minister, the foreign minister, army people, and others -- was convened in one room; the 'Arafat-led PLO delegation sat in a second room; and President Mubarak, 'Amr Musa, Warren Christopher and his aides, sat in a third room. It was possible then to move from one room to another and smooth things out, surmount obstacles, and come up with creative solutions at moments of crisis, and it was that night which enabled the negotiations to emerge from their infancy and assume adulthood. It is impossible to conduct negotiations by exchanging formal opinions constantly. After all, formally speaking, we do not have an agreement: We and they want different things, so how are the differences bridged? They are first bridged through meetings and negotiations by those who are allowed to put up the bridge. In my opinion then, there are two types of discussions. There is a discussion on contents, and there is a discussion on method [last word in English]. It is the method at least which should be changed. If one wants a normalization in relations, one needs a normalization in contacts, in negotiations. [Ganor] Over the past two weeks, since the secretary of State's visit to the region, was there a short circuit between Jerusalem and Damascus, or has Washington engaged in contacts through diplomatic channels in an attempt to build the bridge you are discussing? [Peres] I believe that Washington constantly tries to establish a bridgehead, on the Syrian side as well as on ours, and I think it is this which decides the date of Christopher's visits to the region. In other words, he wants to come when he has enough cement in his hand to start building some bridgehead. [Ganor] Does he have cement in his hand then? [Peres] Not enough, in my opinion. [Ganor] Have U.S. proposals been conveyed to both sides over the last two weeks? [Peres] No, I do not think so. Nor do I think the Americans want to act this way. They are very cautious. They do not want to appear as people who impose their opinion on others. [Ganor] Do you expect the United States to increase its involvement, perhaps in the future, if no solution is found on the Syrian-Israeli track? [Peres] I believe in the sincerity and seriousness of the United States. I really believe that just like Israel it seeks a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Therefore, Washington will not cease its efforts. The frequency of these contacts and of the shuttle diplomacy also depend on the reactions of both sides. [Ganor] Are the gaps between the positions of both sides still large? [Peres] There is still a gap between the positions of both sides in all three domains. [Ganor] Nevertheless, the Jordanian prime minister was this week quoted as saying that Syria and Israel had reached an understanding in principle and the only things left open were the period over which the withdrawal would stretch and the abrogation of the Golan Law. You know Dr. al-Majali. Are you prepared to comment on this? [Peres] Look, it is apparently easier for every prime minister to be optimistic with regard to other countries. Let us concentrate on the Jordanian track in the negotiations with Jordan and on Syria with the Syrians. [Ganor] What can we expect from the secretary of State's impending visit? [Peres] The continuation of the attempts to lay a bridgehead between the two parties. [Ganor] You do not like predicting dates, but you always said that the window of opportunity was either closing or opening. Can we expect a breakthrough in the negotiations with Syria in 1994? [Peres] I said that the window of opportunity was about to close with regard to the dates. I never gave dates for windows to open. Let me explain what I mean by this. Elections are scheduled to be held in Israel in November 1996. One can assume that the country will be in an uproar one year ahead of that, primaries and arguments, and the Norwegian Law [reference to a law stipulating that cabinet ministers lose their Knesset seats in order to permit their faction to increase its size]. We are already in the middle of 1994, with the grace of God. Politically speaking, we have one year or 15 months to operate at the most. Everyone can see that and that is the window of opportunity that is closing. The possibility to take political action without running smack into pre-election turmoil. Now, I believe that within that period it is possible, but I cannot promise that it will happen, to move on to a second stage in the negotiations with the Palestinians and make significant progress in the negotiations with Jordan, which are crucial in my view. If there is a breakthrough with Syria, I will be very pleased. [Ganor] Let us end our program on this optimistic note. Thank you for being with us, Mr. Foreign Minister.
