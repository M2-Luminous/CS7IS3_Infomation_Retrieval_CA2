The most important thing now is "to live in the spirit of common solidarity", Kohl said today at the opening of the new offices of a German research center in Heidelberg. Then one will have the strength, "to successfully get through the second great beginning for the second great stage of our republic." The chancellor reiterated that spring brings with it a "new upswing in Germany." Order books are filling up again. Kohl pointed out that economic research institutes are expecting growth of 1.5 percent in Germany this year and show the carping critics that they are wrong. The chancellor urged progress instead of stalling with regard to structural changes in the interest of Germany's future as a business and investment location. "A rethink instead of a redistribution" is necessary.
