Is that correct? [Radetskyy] I believe that some lies have been added to the truth. Tell me, what was wrong with Ukraine's desire to share its experience of forming national armed forces with other states, given the fact that our Republic was the first to set out upon that path? Or what harm could be done by my statement regarding building our relations on a bilateral basis? This would be the most acceptable solution for us. Besides, I do not rule out the possibility of resolving several problems within the CIS framework. Some politicians have attempted to reproach me. Thus, I would ask you to publish the text of my Ashgabat speech in your newspaper. [passage omitted] [Chernomorskiy] Television reports have repeatedly emphasized that a number of important issues were resolved in the course of your meeting with Russian Defense Minister Grachev, and that there was no confrontation between you two. What did you discuss? [Radetskyy] I used to study with Pavel Grachev at the General Staff Academy, where he was in his senior year. When I met him in Ashgabat I was afraid that the "elder brother syndrome" might have an impact on our relations. However, Grachev was very polite, both to me and my motherland. That determined the atmosphere of the negotiations. We discussed military-technical issues. If Russia does not receive Ukrainian subassemblies it will not be able to produce certain arms. At the same time, Ukrainian defense industries will face work stoppages without Russian parts. We also reached an agreement on another important issue. The point is that a number of Ukrainian military educational institutions offer training not available in Russia. At the same time, there is no need for us to open new departments or institutes provided we can train our specialists in the neighboring state. An agreement was also reached regarding a balanced approach to nuclear issues and the dispute over the Black Sea Fleet. [Chernomorskiy] Our newspaper has been receiving a lot of letters from mothers of soldiers drafted in spring 1992. Were it not for the Supreme Council decree prolonging their term of service, those soldiers would have returned home by now. [Radetskyy] I will be happy to reassure mothers with your newspaper's assistance. I want to point out that this is a temporary measure. On the one hand, we are reducing our Armed Forces now and that will alleviate the demand for manpower. Secondly, I believe that our lawmakers will review the categories of draftees excused from active service. I also hope that the number of young people dodging the draft will substantially decrease.
