Emergency Situations Ministry and Defense Ministry vs State Duma Committee"] [Text] The State Duma is continuing its discussion of a draft federal law, approved in the first reading, "On the Procedure of Providing Military and Civilian Personnel of the Russian Federation for Participation in Operations to Maintain or Restore International Peace and Security and in Other Types of Peacekeeping Activities," prepared by the State Duma defense committee. Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian Federation deputy defense minister, who spoke at the hearings, thus outlined the situation that had taken shape in the wake of Russia's having carried out its peacekeeping obligations to the United Nations and the nearest neighbors. Since October 1973, Soviet, and later, Russian observers participated in peacekeeping operations under UN auspices in Egypt, Israel, Syria, Lebanon, in the Iran-Iraq border area, Western Sahara, Cambodia, Mozambique, ex-Yugoslavia and, besides, along the Armenia-Azerbaijan border and in Abkhazia. Mr. Kondratyev reminded his audience that had Russia not taken in summer 1992 "resolute measures in hot spots of the `near abroad,'" without waiting for a legislative base to be prepared, the flame of war could have spread to the territory of Russia. At that time the Defense Ministry formed, within the framework of the Russian Armed Forces, nine battalions of Russian military men and sent them to South Ossetia, Georgia, and the Dniester Region. A little earlier -- in April 1992 -- a Russian battalion, which was later reinforced, was sent to Yugoslavia under the UN flag. In Tajikistan there is the 201st Motorized Rifle Division with reinforcement assets as part of the CIS peacekeeping forces, and more than 16,500 Russian servicemen are based on the territories of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. Proceeding from the situation that had taken shape, two motorized rifle divisions were detached from armed forces personnel, whose servicemen are being trained in accordance with a particular program specially designed for peacekeeping. After such a thorough instruction of the scenario, the Defense Ministry representatives passed over to the main part of his address, which is still causing dispute among the deputies. Let me set the record straight right away by saying that the text of the draft federal law etches in stone the spontaneously established norm under which peacekeeping operations are conducted by the Defense Ministry. These functions are entrusted to Russian Armed Forces line units. A spokesman for the Duma Defense Committee spoke in favor of maintaining this position, believing that a reassignment of the peacekeeping troops and detaching them from armed forces personnel would call for the creation of one more Russian army. The state budget has no money to support such a decision. Here is what General Kondratyev said in this connection. "Among the Defense Ministry leadership there is worry about distracting regular troops for the performance of missions unrelated to their direct purpose. The personnel are charged with police functions untypical for them. One should also take account of the fact that the presence of Russian Armed Forces units in conflict zones has a negative affect on the growing anti-army sentiment among the local population. The use of a regular army produces a negative reaction and gives cause for systematic accusations of Russia's having an imperial policy." Mr. Kondratyev remarked that these sort of functions should not be performed by line units but by specially formed, trained, and appropriately equipped military contingents, that is, by "peacekeeping forces of Russia." The Defense Ministry spokesman promised to turn over completely the special training bases set up for the already mentioned two separate peacekeeping divisions in the charge of the new separate peacekeeping organization. The reason for such a demonstrative debarring of the Defense Ministry from peacekeeping functions is simple. There is a proposal from the Ministry of Emergency Situations to the Defense Ministry on the transfer of the peacemaking functions and the peacekeeping subunits to the Ministry of Emergency Situations. The Defense Ministry, in the person of Colonel General Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff, agreed with this proposal. Neither did this Emergency Situations Ministry proposal raise any objections from many deputies. For example, Mr. Popov of the Agrarian faction elaborated an entire conception on the need to transfer the peacekeeping functions. Its essence is this: Under Articles 77 and 78 of the current Constitution, the Armed Forces can be put into action only owing to a threat of aggression against Russia. But interethnic conflicts, which call upon Russia to show firmness and toughness, do not belong to such situations. As a rule, the Russian Federation president imposed a state of emergency in zones of interethnic feuding, and Emergency Situations Ministry representatives were the first to start to settle the conflicts -- but after they proved to be unmanageable, military subunits were brought in. Thus the State Duma Defense Committee members' fears at the Emergency Situations Ministry's little specific experience appear far-fetched. Mr. Popov believes that the peacekeeping contingent ought to be formed on a voluntary basis (this view is backed by the "Women of Russia" faction and the majority of deputies of the other factions), organized on different principles and wear a uniform distinct from that of the Armed Forces. Mr. Popov recalled that in the United States this type of activity is in the charge of the National Guard, which is not part of the U.S. Armed Forces. In the deputy's view, the main distinction of the army from a peacekeeping contingent is that the latter has no enemy image in carrying out of operations -- its functions are distinctly of a humanitarian nature. The Duma's second hearings of the draft law and its approval by the Federal Assembly are still ahead. Time will tell if the clear contradiction between the main agents covered by the law and its drafters will be removed or not. What causes amazement, however, is the very fact that whereas the Duma Defense Committee has talked about taking into consideration the Defense Ministry and the Russian Foreign Ministry amendments (the latter in its turn recommended to the committee to pay attention to expert assessments of the Defense Ministry), it has not reflected these amendments in any way in the draft law.
