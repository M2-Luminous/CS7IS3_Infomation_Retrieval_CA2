Due to the quantum confinement effect, semiconducting nanoparticles produce a series of new phenomena,[.sup]1,2[/] among which the materials with ultra-fast optical nonlinear response have been particularly noticed. It is predicted that these semiconducting materials will be the basic optoelectronic materials of the future. The study of the opto-absorption and -relaxation properties of nanoscale crystals will help us further understand the mechanism of nonlinear optical response. When the size of a semiconducting nanocrystal is as small as the Bohr radius a[.sup]B[/] of its own phase, a series of changes of electronic state and optical property can be observed. These phenomena are observed in the semiconducting nanocrystal systems of CdS, CuCl, CdSe, PbS.[.sup]3,4[/] The ratio of the nanocrystal radius R to its Bohr radius a[.sup]B[/] can be used as the general guideline to determine the influence of the quantum confinement effect on the electronic state:[.sup]5[/] When R/a[.sup]B[/] << 1, the nanoparticles are in the strong quantum confinement zone, and their energy levels of electrons and holes are clearly separated; however, when R/a[.sup]B[/] > > 1, the nanocrystal is in the exciton confinement zone where the excitons act as quasi-particles whose translation kinetic energy's degree of freedom is confined within the three-dimensional space; as a result the exciton energy increase is limited. Currently, only CuCl nanocrystals are being researched as an exciton-confinement-zone material, and they are also good model materials for the study of excitonic molecule properties. This paper presents the preparation of cuprous oxide (Cu[.sup]2[/]O) nanocrystals and discussion of their optical properties, as well as a discussion of results based on the model of exciton responses to the quantum confinement effect. 1. Experiment The Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystals are made by the oxidation-reduction method in a micro-emulsive liquid. The process flow diagram is as follows: The Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystals made by this method are all coated with sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (DBS) molecules, and form a transparent sol with toluene. The crystal sizes can vary within the limit of 5-10.0 nm as determined by the initial value of [CuAc[.sup]2[/]]/[DBS]. The transmission electron microscope and the low-angle X-ray scattering experiments show that the spread of the Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystal dimensions is very narrow. About 93 percent of the crystal dimensions have the median radius, and the rest are distributed within the 10 percent of the median radius. The radius distribution of the nanocrystals is thus well suited for the study of optical properties. The room-temperature photoluminescence and excitation spectra of the Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystal sol series are measured with a Hitachi F-4000 fluorescence spectrometer. 2. Results and Discussions The visible-ultraviolet absorption spectra of Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystal (9.0 nm) organic sol starts at 650 nm. The absorption rate gradually increases toward the high-frequency region, but there is no clear indication of structural absorption characteristics. This implies that the phenomenon is influenced by two factors: one is the temperature and solvent effects; and the other is the size effect. Because the dimensions of the nanocrystal are far greater than the Bohr radius a[.sup]B[/] (0.7 nm) of its own phase, the increase of the exciton energy is not obvious, and the energy separation induced by the confinement effect is very minor. Figure 1 shows the photoluminescence spectra of the Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystals. The excitation luminescences are (1) 330 nm, (2) 400 nm, (3) 440 nm, (4) 460 nm, (5) 510 nm, and (6) 532 nm. Five luminescence bands are visible in the neighborhood of 400 nm, 475 nm, 505 nm, 540 nm and 565 nm. The last four bands correspond to the existing four luminescence bands in the exciton systems, namely, indigo, blue, green, and yellow.[.sup]6[/] The energy changes in the exciton confinement zone are comparatively small. The luminescences are undoubtedly fluorescence resonance emissions. In addition, the luminescence at 400 nm indicates the presence of energy jumps between bands within the Cu[.sup]2[/]O crystal. The emission luminescence has not been reported in the past, but its absorption structure was reported long ago.[.sup]7[/] The emission from the bottom of the conduction band in the exciton confinement zone possibly originates from the bound excitons formed at the bottom of the band; however, further proof is needed. As to the luminescence phenomenon of solids at high energy level (or energy band), it is rarely seen in solid-state phases and many other nanocrystals. However, in our research we have observed that the phenomenon of increasing high energy-level radiation jumps not only takes place in the aforementioned Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystals, but could also occur in the coated CdS and PbS nanocrystals. It is quite likely that in the high energy-level neighborhoods of the quantum confinement and dielectric confinement zones, stable bound excitons are formed, and consequently, they reduce the non-radiation jumping probability of the electrons or holes due to vibrations or impurities; thus, they enhance the radiation jumping. The phenomenon deserves further probing, because it has direct bearing on the enhancement of the system's nonlinear optical phenomena. Figure 2 shows the excitation spectra of Cu[.sup]2[/]O nanocrystal (0.9 nm) emission at (a) 600 nm and (b) 580 nm. They are equivalent to the exciton wavelength absorption structure.[.sup]8[/] Figure 2 shows the exciton jumps in the indigo, blue, green, and yellow series are all mutually related,[.sup]6[/] and have an obvious relationship with the jump at about 380 nm. There is a corresponding spectral region of each individual series, and occasionally these spectral regions overlap. The relatively low vibrator absorption intensities of the yellow and green exciton series are caused by the dipole forbiddenness of the jump.[.sup]9[/] Photoluminescence Spectrum of Cu2O Nanocrystal (9.9 nm) Sol Figure 2. Excitation Spectrum of Cu[.sup]2[/]Nanocrystal (9.0 nm) Sol Another interesting phenomenon in the excitation spectra is that the dipoles allow the indigo and blue exciton series having the multi-peak structures of jumps. Such structures are caused by the quantization of the exciton energy which in turn is due to the spatial quantum confinement effect.[.sup]10[/] Hanamura[.sup]2[/] has suggested a simplified mode. He assumes the exciton to be a quasi-particle situated in a semiconducting nanosphere; when R/a[.sup]B[/] > > 1, the exciton energy (l = m = 0) that allows jumps is expressed as E[.sup]n[/] = E[.sub]0[/] - E[.sup]b[/][.sup]ex[/] + n[.sup]2[/]E[.sup]c[/], (1) where E[.sup]c[/] is the quantum confinement energy (h[.sup]2[/]�[.sup]2[/]/2 M R[.sup]2[/]) and E[.sup]b[/][.sup]ex[/] is the exciton bonding energy which varies with exciton's principal quantum number. The quantization of excitons follows the equation E[.sup]b[/][.sup]ex[/] = E[.sup]x[/]/n[.sup]2[/], where E[.sub]x[/] is the effective exciton Rydberg energy (�e[.sup]4[/]/2h[.sup]2[/]_e_[.sup]2[/][.sup]0[/]), M = m[.sup]e[/] + m[.sub]h[/], � = m[.sup]e[/]m[.sub]h[/]/m[.sub]e[/] + m[.sub]h[/], and hence the equation E[.sup]n[/] = E[.sub]0[/] - E[.sup]x[/]/n[.sup]2[/] + n[.sup]2[/]E[.sup]c[/] (2) is used to describe the different exciton jumps with different principal quantum numbers in the same series. Our test results as shown in Figure 2 and Table 1 have proved the validity of Equation (2). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

When n � 2, the blue shift of the jump is relatively significant. In this case, exciton jumps of different principal quantum numbers split away from one another, while the nanocrystal optical nonlinear response produces mesoscopic strengthening.[.sup]2[/] This phenomenon will benefit our study of mutual reactions among the excitons within the exciton confinement zone, such as the super-radiation phenomenon.[.sup]1),11[/] Thorough research on the above phenomenon would be very worthwhile.
