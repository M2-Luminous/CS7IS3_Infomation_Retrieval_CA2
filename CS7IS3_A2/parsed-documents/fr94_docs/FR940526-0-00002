ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final rule to abolish the Oscoda-Alpena, Michigan, Federal Wage System wage area for pay-setting purposes. The host activity for the Oscoda-Alpena wage area survey, Wurtsmith Air Force Base, closed at the end of June 1993. No other activity in the Oscoda-Alpena wage area had the capability to conduct the local wage survey scheduled to begin in the wage area in August 1993. This regulation redefines all counties presently included in the Oscoda-Alpena, Michigan, wage area to the area of application of the Northwestern Michigan wage area. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark Allen, (202) 606&hyph;2848. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 7, 1993, OPM published an interim rule (58 FR 64365) to abolish the Oscoda-Alpena, Michigan, wage area for pay-setting purposes and reassign its constituent counties to the Northwestern Michigan wage area as areas of application. The interim rule provided a 30-day period for public comment. OPM received no comments during the comment period. Therefore, the interim rule is being adopted as a final rule. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they affect only Federal agencies and employees.
