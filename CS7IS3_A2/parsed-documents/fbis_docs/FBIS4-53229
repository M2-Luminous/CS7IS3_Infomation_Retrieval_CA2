This is not a mere euphemism to describe an era when economic war has replaced the cold war; This describes the urgent situation in which ROK defense-industry companies have no choice but to make changes on their own. Pungsan virtually led the ROK defense industry, and its main business was manufacturing. However, domestic demand for artillery shells plummeted, and as a result, the company faced a serious management crisis. Consequently, it is drastically curtailing its facilities for producing defense-industry materials. It is also cutting its work force for the defense industry by 800 a year. The company is making coins in the United States by using knowhow gained from manufacturing copper artillery shells. Past Special Privileges Are Now a Form of Bondage Approximately 80 defense-industry companies, including Pungsan, are now facing difficulties in management primarily because domestic demand for conventional weapons has almost been met. The domestic defense-industry companies are now operated at close to 40 percent of capacity. Similarities between defense-industry companies and ordinary companies end when it comes to their difficulties in management. Defense-industry companies cannot freely close their shops. This is due to the legacy of a special government policy for the defense-industry companies. If a defense-industry company facing serious management difficulties wants to dismantle facilities used exclusively for the defense industry, it must obtain approval from the government under the Special Law for Fostering the Defense Industry. This law was promulgated in 1973 and has made it possible for the government to give various forms of assistance to defense-industry companies. This special treatment has turned into a form of bondage. Of course, even if defense-industry companies freely dismantle defense-related facilities and relocate workers to other areas, the government has no effective means to punish those companies. In fact, since the mid-1980's many defense-industry companies have dismantled defense-related facilities in disregard of the law. Companies that manufacture firearms, shells, mobile equipment, and other weapons and small and medium-size companies have a strong tendency to dismantle defense-related facilities. Even big companies that were over 20 percent defense industry-related have reduced defense activities to less than 10 percent. The president of a defense-industry subsidiary of a big business group says: "General sentiment in this industry is that the defense industry is a shortcut to ruin." "Almost All Defense-Industry Companies Will Disappear in Three to Four Years" Under these circumstances, Paek Yong-hun, chairman of the Defense Industry Association and director of the Korea Industrial Development Institute, says: "Almost all companies that manufacture basic military weapons will disappear in three to four years. Is it all right for defense-industry companies to disappear like this?" It is not its share in the ROK economy that makes the defense industry important. Even though exact statistics are not available, the net sales of the defense industry were close to 28 trillion won in 1990. The most serious problem of our defense industry is that even though various countries of the world are curtailing this "industry of death," we are not in a position to do so. This is why the government cannot do anything about this industry. Representatives of the defense industry who attended the 15 April "high-level policy meeting to foster the defense industry" asked the government to make some sort of decision with regard to the defense industry. What would happen if defense industrial companies that produce basic weapons were to disappear from our country? The government would lose not only the capability of supplying basic weapons in an emergency, but also not be able to procure the sources for the spare parts necessary in manufacturing basic weapons. This will then result in reducing the country's self-defense capability. The defense industry has an aspect which cannot be judged from a viewpoint of mere economic logic just like at the time when we began to develop this industry 25 years ago. Another aspect of the defense industry is that unlike other industries, this industry has no room to grow. In other words, today, when heavy and chemical industries, which were once deemed failures have returned to the stage of success, only the defense industry is in a state of decline. This is because there is not gateway out. In other words, the defense industry can not grow like other industries because it lacks export activities. The United States Has Been Stingy in Transferring High Technology to the ROK Exports in the defense industry were actually blocked by restrictions imposed by the United States. The National Defense Ministry has not officially made public the balance of payments in the defense industry sector. However, it has been learned that the defense industry sector accumulated debts of over $2 billion in the nineties. In the eighties, the deficit amounted only to $1 billion. The defense industry's domestic demand has been met, and exports have been blocked. Such being the situation, the future of our defense industry is very dark and gloomy. The "Report on Military Cooperation and Competition Between the United States and Allied Countries For 1992" of the U.S. Congress' Military Technology Evaluation Committee which was conveyed to the National Defense Minitry via the American Embassy in Seoul, indicates the following in connection with the ROK defense industry: "The ROK's basic purpose is to maintain the present defense industry and to achieve complete self-reliance in weapon production capability. "However, it will be difficult to achieve this by the next century." While this report properly reveals the vulnerability of the ROK defense industry, it foresees that the ROK defense industry will be completely self-reliant in weapons production capability by the next century, and this is too optimistic a view of the future of the ROK defense industry. Admittedly, the domestic defense industry has made equally rapid progress as the other industries. The ROK has become the only country which has become self-reliant in the production of basic weapons in the short period of less than 10 years. It is not too much to say that the ROK's success in the defense industry sector was realized from its "tactic of relying on" the United States. The ROK began to rapidly develop the defense industry by receiving grant-type military aid, loans from foreign military sales [FMS], and military technology materials [TDP] from the United States as early as in the fifties. In particular, data on U.S. military technology provided by the United States since 1971 has been the main source for the ROK to attain U.S. military technology. Data for over 1,000 such cases of U.S. military technology was transferred from the United States to the ROK thus far, and this can be evaluated as having greatly contributed to the development and production of as many as 200 different types of weapons in our country. This data has greatly contributed to developing Korean-type arms such as Korean-type armored vehicles and Korean-type tanks in particular. Besides the technological aspect, the ROK defense industry's dependence on the United States is great. Among other things, over 70 percent of the weapons the ROK purchases from abroad are of U.S. origin. Moreover, the ROK defense industry has been producing the weapons of U.S. origin through technological licence agreement or has been producing them jointly with the United States since the seventies. Since it began producing M16 rifles through a licence agreement in 1971, the ROK defense industry has produced M60 light machine-guns and various kinds of communications equipment through licensing agreements. This led to our attainment of complete local production of this type of the weaponry. In the 1980's, the ROK began the off-set program [as published] with the United States and has since then actively pushed ahead with joint production. The defense industry, which has jointly produced some basic weaponry, has been making considerable progress in the area of aircraft production. The defense industry has produced F-5E/F fighter-bombers and 500MD helicopters jointly with the United States, and is jointly producing F-16's at present. The problem in our cooperation with the United States in defense industry is that our dependence on the United States has become too great. This problem has become even more burdensome since the 1980's when the U.S. Government and the U.S. defense industry began to regard the ROK defense industry as a competitor. There has been discord between the ROK and the United States over U.S. restriction of ROK weapons exports, transfer of advanced military technology, opening up of the defense industry market, and compromise trade [cholchung kyoyok]. For instance, the United States, while providing the ROK with military technology data, has been stingy in providing data for relatively advanced technology, such as in aviation and marine and submarine guided weapons systems. Up to 1990, not more than 10 technological transfers were made in these areas. Moreover, the ROK Government has requested that the United States conduct joint research and development or joint production for key technology transfer of defense industry, but little progress has been made so far. In the latter half of the 1980's, the ROK submitted a request for U.S. technology related to laser and guided weapons and detection of submarines and sound, which the United States rejected. No doubt, it would be most desirable if the ROK could develop advanced weapons and technology on its own. However, reality is not that simple. For instance, key technologies designated by the Defense Institute [as published] as high precision weapons that need to be procured by the 2000's, were already being used in the United States in the latter half of the eighties. In view of the level of ROK science and technology and its capability of acquiring funds for research and development, independent development is not easy. Hwang Tong-chun, policy development officer of the Defense Research Institute, said that in this respect, the ROK-U.S. defense industrial cooperation will be an important factor that will determine the fate of the local defense industry. How much necessary technology the ROK can obtain with the present research and development system is another important factor connected with the future of the defense industry. Unlike other industries, the National Defense and Science Institute, a state policy research institute, has a monopoly on the defense industry's research and development. This institute's annual budget is estimated to be about 200 billion won, of which about 60 percent is allocated to defense industry businesses for development and production. Whether this monopolistic system in research and development is appropriate in view of the trend of the defense industry which is attaching increasing importance to technology that can be used both for civilian and military purposes is subject to controversy. A considerable number of experts assert that a considerable number of the 800 projects which the institute is charged with should be transferred to civilian businesses, but the institute refused to comment on this assertion. Judgment Based on Economic Theory Is Hardly Workable The perspective on the defense industry has changed drastically from the seventies to the eighties. During the former, the defense industry was seen from a perspective of national survival rather than economic theory. This was the logic former President Pak Chong-hui upheld in cultivating defense industry. Former President Chon Tu-hwan, however, asserted that economic logic be applied to the defense industry as well, following the advice of economic aides and ministers whom he favored. Depending on the weight placed on either of the two assertions, the defense industrial experts can be divided into two groups--one favoring local development and production, and the other favoring overseas purchase. The former's assertion is that in order to cultivate the local defense industry, we should produce weapons locally through our own research and development. On the other hand, the latter's assertion is that we should not hesitate to purchase weapons from abroad if we are unable to have relative superiority in local development. At one time, the two differing approaches were referred to as the "Taejon faction view" and the "Hongnung faction view" according to the organizations they belonged. Taejon was home to the National Defense and Science Institute (ADD) [as published], while Hongnung was home to the Korea Institute of Defense Administration (KIDA). The two organizations have been feuding since the early eighties when researchers of the National Defense and Science Institute were dismissed en masse according to former President Chon Tu-hwan's instructions. This difference in view is considered to persist today. According to defense experts, whichever view assumes greater weight, a view for the nineties needs to be formed, as the lack of principle in the defense industry will result in the collapse of this important industy, which, in turn, could result in a fatal defect in the ROK's self-defense capabilities. An even more difficult point is that conclusions regarding the defense industry should not come from the working level officials of the Defense Ministry. An Pyong-kil, second assistant defense minister, said, "The Defense Ministry's coordination ability regarding defense industry policy is limited," and added, "The problem of defense industry should be reviewed from an entirely different perspective starting from scratch."
