FR940711-0-00083 FR940711-0-00027 47 CFR Parts 80 and 87 [PR Docket No. 93&hyph;143; FCC 94&hyph;170] Registration of 406 MHz Radiobeacons in the Marine Services and Aviation Services AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission will require registration of 406.025 MHz radiobeacons with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United States Department of Commerce (NOAA). This action is in response to a request from the United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard). The registration of 406.025 MHz radiobeacons aid search and rescue personnel. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Shaffer, (202) 632&hyph;7197, Private Radio Bureau. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a summary of the Commission's Report and Order FCC 94&hyph;170, adopted June 13, 1994, and released July 6. The full text of this Report and Order is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center, Room 230, 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC. The complete text may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, telephone (202) 857&hyph;3800. Summary of Report and Order 1. The United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard) filed a petition (RM&hyph;8008), Public Notice No. 1894, requesting that the Commission amend Part 80 of the Rules, 47 CFR Part 80, to require registration of emergency position indicating radiobeacons (EPIRBs) operating on the frequency 406.025 MHz with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additionally, in the Report and Order in PR Docket No. 92&hyph;125 (58 FR 30126, 5/26/93), the Commission stated that it would address separately the issue of mandatory registration of emergency locator transmitters (ELTs) operating on the frequency 406.025 MHz in the Aviation Services. 2. Beacon registration is essential to realize the full benefit of the 406 MHz satellite system. The Air Force, Coast Guard, NOAA and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) agree that having access to registration information along with the improved location accuracy of the 406 MHz system can result in a reduction of the time needed to complete a SAR operation. NOAA and NASA estimate that registration will save on average 6 hours per mission. Further, NOAA states that its experience with voluntary registration of 406 EPIRBs shows that when 406 EPIRBs are registered in its database the Coast Guard has been able to avoid unnecessarily using SAR resources by screening false distress signals through telephone calls to registered owners. Typical mission costs of launching a single helicopter to locate and investigate a distress signal are approximately $4,000. The potential savings to the Federal government and SAR forces are substantial with no additional cost or burden to manufacturers and little burden to beacon users. The beacon user would be required to mail to NOAA the pre-paid, pre-addressed post card that the manufacturers currently provide requesting registration information. In view of the strong support, and because beacon registration can provide valuable distress information to SAR personnel concerning the type and size of the aircraft/vessel as well as prevent launching potentially dangerous missions on false distress signals, we will require that 406 MHz ELTs and 406 MHz EPIRBs be registered in NOAA's database. 3. We certify that the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 does not apply to this rule making proceeding because if the proposed rule amendments are promulgated, there will not be a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities, as defined by Section 601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The change proposed herein will have a beneficial effect on the marine and aviation community by enhancing information available to SAR personnel for use in distress situations and will not have a significant economic impact on any entity. The Secretary shall send a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rule Making, including the certification, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with paragraph 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
