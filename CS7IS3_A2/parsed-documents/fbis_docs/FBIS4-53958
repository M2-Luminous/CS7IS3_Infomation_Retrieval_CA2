(JR West) stock in fiscal 1994, officials said Monday [23 May]. The corporation is entrusted with liquidating a huge amount of debts accumulated by the defunct Japanese National Railways (JNR), which was privatized and split into seven passenger and cargo transport firms. Following the formal recommendation by the advisory council early next month, the corporation will start preparations for the listing of JR West stock in February next year, the officials said. The Transport Ministry and the corporation planned to list stock of both JR West and Central Japan Railway Co. (JR Tokai) in fiscal 1994. The council stressed the need to promote stock sales for JR companies by taking into account the stock market environment in order to liquidate long-term debts held by the corporation. The council put priority on the sale of JR West stock over JR Tokai in view of stiff competition faced by the company on the rail transport market. The council also recommended sales of an additional portion of 1.5 million shares of East Japan Railway Co. (JR East) held by the corporation. JR East was listed on the market last year.
