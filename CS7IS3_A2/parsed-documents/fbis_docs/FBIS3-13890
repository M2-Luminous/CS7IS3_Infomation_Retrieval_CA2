Today's session will be held at the Kenyan Foreign Ministry, while subsequent sessions will be held at a different venue which has not yet been announced. The delegation of the Sudanese Government will be headed by Mr. Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah, chairman of the Transitional National Assembly, and also includes Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj Muhammad, the official spokesman for the government delegation; Dr. Nafi Ali Nafi, Agnes Lokudu, Angelo Beda, Dr. 'Abd al-Rahman Ibrahim, Mathiang Malwal, Musa Sid Ahmad, Peter Charliman, and 'Abd al-Raziq al-Fadl, as well as Sudan's ambassadors to Kenya, Addis Ababa, and Uganda. For the rebels, the delegation of Garang's faction will be headed by Salva Kiir Mayar Dit, Yusuf Kuwah, Philip Lomoding, Stephen Wani, Justin Yaak, and others. The delegation of the United Faction will be headed by (Richard Mola) and its members comprise (Dhol Ashwal), Arok Thuon Arok, John Luk Jok, Dr. Peter Adhok, and others. The radio correspondent in Nairobi says that the most positive indicators pointing to the success of these negotiations is the presence of the leaders of the two rebel factions, Garang and Machar, at the opening session. This has never happened before at any of the earlier rounds of talks. Their presence indicates confidence in the negotiations. Moreover, Kenya's President Moi, in his speech to the opening session, stressed the need for these negotiations to succeed so that Africa could demonstrate to the whole world its capacity to solve its problems by itself. The current negotiations will have as their starting point the point at which the two sides arrived at in the earlier rounds at Addis Ababa, Nairobi, Abuja One and Two. It is worth noting that the Sudanese delegation led by Mr. Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah is fully mandated to sign the agreement to be reached.
