The F-15I jet fighter is another model of the F-15E, which McDonnell Douglas builds especially for Israel. Many consider the F-15E the most advanced fighter in the world today. Ben-'Ami said purchasing the F-15I fighters will improve the "qualitative superiority" of the Israeli Air Force. Rabin's decision has put an end to the fierce two-year competition between McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed, with McDonnell Douglas Company eventually winning the $2 billion contract. According to the contract, the jet fighters will be delivered to Israel by the end of 1997.
