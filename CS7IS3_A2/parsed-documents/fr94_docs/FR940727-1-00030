FR940727-1-00030 FR940727-1-00014 For the purposes of this proposal ``electric lamp'' also referred to as ``lamp'' is defined as the bulb or tube portion of a lighting device specifically designed to produce radiant energy, most often in the ultraviolet, visible, and infra-red regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Examples of common electric lamps include but are not limited to, incandescent, fluorescent, high intensity discharge, and neon lamps. Also, a ``mercury-containing lamp'' is defined as an electric lamp in which mercury is purposely introduced by the manufacturer for the operation of the lamp. The Agency requests comment on whether the definitions of ``lamp'' and ``mercury-containing lamp'' are technically correct and on whether they accurately define the appropriate universe of items. B. Energy-Efficient Lighting Programs Today's proposal, which would reduce management requirements for lamps, is expected to support the efforts of many existing and planned energy conservation programs, which encourage the installation of energy efficient lighting. Energy efficient lighting consumes less electricity, reducing the generation of pollution from power plants. However, replacing energy inefficient lighting systems with energy efficient lighting systems requires the use and eventual disposal of fluorescent and high intensity discharge (HID) lamps, which contain mercury. Requiring the disposal of lamp wastes as hazardous waste, under full Subtitle C regulations, may discourage participation in energy efficient lighting programs. The Agency anticipates that either of the proposed actions will encourage participation in energy-efficient lighting programs, and will therefore promote the energy-efficiency and the environmental benefits derived from that program. If energy-efficient lighting were used wherever it is profitable, the nation's demand for electricity could be cut by more than 10 percent. This would result in reductions of estimated annual carbon dioxide emissions of 202 million metric tons (4 percent of the national total), reductions of annual sulfur dioxide emissions of 1.3 million metric tons (7 percent of the national total), and reductions of annual nitrogen oxide emissions of 600,000 metric tons (4 percent of the national total). (U.S. EPA, 1992b) In 1991, EPA initiated a voluntary energy conservation program called ``Green Lights'' to encourage pollution prevention through energy efficient lighting. Lighting accounts for 20&hyph;25 percent of electricity used annually in the U.S. Lighting for industry, businesses, offices, and warehouses represents 80&hyph;90 percent of total lighting electricity use. Available technologies in energy efficient lighting can reduce lighting electricity demand by over 50 percent, enabling power plants to generate less electricity and burn less fuel. It also reduces other types of pollution resulting from mining and transporting power plant fuels and disposing of power plant wastes (U.S. EPA, 1992b). In addition, electric utilities, when burning fossil fuels, emit mercury at a rate of 0.0428 mg/kWh sold, on a national average. Full implementation of Green Lights is estimated to reduce the emission by 9.7 Mg of mercury by the year 2000 (U.S. EPA, 1992b). Further, the energy-efficient fluorescent lamps, used by Green Lights and other energy conservation programs, contain less mercury than energy-inefficient fluorescent lamps. A goal of Green Lights is to encourage the widespread use of efficient lighting technologies to reduce air pollution from coal combustion. Energy-efficient lighting technologies provide excellent investment opportunities. A typical lighting upgrade yields an internal rate of return of 20&hyph;30 percent and a payback of 3&hyph;4 years.
