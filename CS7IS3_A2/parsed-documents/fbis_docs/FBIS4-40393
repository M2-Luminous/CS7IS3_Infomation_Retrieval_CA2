Before meeting Boris Yeltsin, Kaadyr-ool Bichelday, chairman of the Tuva Republic's parliament, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that the local authorities and population expect understanding of the region's special character to be shown during the visit. The leaders are counting on the president helping to solve the republic's transport problems. "If life in Tuva used to be dependent on vehicle wheels, then that has now changed to steamship propellers, since the use of wheels would mean doubling the costs of cargo transportation," Kaadyr-ool Bicheldey said. Bicheldey sees Yeltsin's visit to the republic as a continuation of the policy of passing control over both the economy and politics from the state to the regions. Here, the parliamentary chairman described the existing contradictions between the constitutions of Russia and Tuva as "a matter to be agreed upon."
