Bakhritdinov, head of the environmental laboratory of the department of geography of the Uzbek Academy of Sciences, and E. Chembarisov, head of the laboratory of hydrochemistry of the Institute of Water Problems: "The Desert Is Diminishing, and We Are the Losers"] [Text] The desert zone of Central Asia, including the territory of Uzbekistan, has enormous reserves which at present are far from being fully utilized. What the desert zone encompasses can be clarified by this simple calculation: of the 44.9 million hectares of territory in Uzbekistan the area of irrigated lands is about 4.2 million, while pastures used in agricultural production account for 22 million hectares. Desert pasturelands account for 82 percent of the total balance of agricultural lands in Uzbekistan. In recent years more than 9.2 million sheep have been kept on them, including 5.1 million karakul sheep, as well as more than 823,000 goats and several thousand camels. In addition to receiving karakul lamb hides pasture sheep herding in the desert produces tens of thousands of tons of meat and wool each year. The enormous role of this sector in the republic economy is perfectly obvious. In recent decades the anthropogenic impact on desert zones has been increasingly felt. This is reflected first of all in the water arteries of the arid territories. As an analysis that was made indicates, the primary rivers of the desert--the Amudarya, Zarafshan, and Kashkadarya--are contaminated to one degree or another. Phenols, petroleum products, pesticides, and other elements have been detected in river waters. Contamination of water around the large cities has increased especially in connection with the discharges of industrial enterprises. In the large cities ecology problems are linked primarily with the growing concentration of production. Contamination of the natural environment of rural settlements is somewhat different. As a rule there are no large industrial enterprises in the towns and villages, the density of housing construction is three-five times less, transportation arteries are less dense, and there is lower overall saturation with motor vehicles. But the ecological situation around towns and villages has also been worsening in recent times. The impact of the city on the environment is manifested in development of nearby land for suburban gardens, recreation zones, trunk transportation routes, and the like. But it is seen particularly in pollution from industrial discharges into the atmosphere and streams. The greatest anthropogenic stress falls on the most heavily settle--but small in land area--Chimbayskiy Rayon in Karakalpakia and the Khorezm region. So intensive development of the desert pasture territory of Uzbekistan intensified the anthropogenic stress on the desert ecosystems of our republic. We need to determine the precise data on the location and chemical composition of underground waters, the efficiency of methods of opening up underground waters by drilling wells, transporting water with pumping pipelines and in tankers, the use of small desalinization units to supply water to the population, improving techniques of freshening mineralized springs with atmospheric precipitation, and ways to raise water using electrical drive operating on wind and solar energy. It is essential for regeneration of the desert pasture zone to compile a long-range prognosis of the intensification of desertification under the anthropogenic influence, broken down by physico-geographic regions. And the approach to further development of land resources within geosystems should be differentiated here and city planning policies must be straightened out with due regard for how favorable the ecological situation is and the degree of anthropogenic stress on their territories. Therefore it is especially important and fundamental--both for its ecological and its economic significance--to put on the agenda of the upcoming session of the Supreme Soviet discussion of amendments and additions to certain legislative enactments of the Republic of Uzbekistan in connection with adoption of the Law on Environmental Protection and the Law on Specially Protected Natural Areas.
