A list of additional references for the Application Profile is contained in section 5, References, of the specifications. 7. Objectives. The objectives of the Application Profile for the GILS are to: _Enable users to identify, locate, and access or acquire publicly available Federal information resources, including electronic information resources. _Provide a uniform approach to providing information locator services to the public. _Enable every agency to establish standards-based network-accessible locator records. 8. Applicability. a. This standard is recommended for use by Federal agencies in the development and establishment of information locators, i.e., information resources that identify other information resources, describe the information available in those resources, and provide assistance in how to obtain the information. b. This standard is required for use by Federal agencies in those information locators that are established and maintained as part of the Government Information Locator System (GILS) pursuant to the requirements of OMB Bulletin 94&hyph; XXXX and other applicable, law, regulation, and policy. c. The GILS Core requirements of this standard apply to those GILS locator records which: _Describe information resources maintained by the Federal government; _Comply with the defined GILS Core Elements; _Are mutually accessible through interconnected electronic network facilities without charge to the direct user; and _Are designated by the agency to be part of the Federal government GILS Core, pursuant to OMB Bulletin 94&hyph; XXXX . 9. Specifications. The Application Profile for the Government Information Locator System, (affixed). 10. Implementation. The implementation of this standard involves three areas of consideration: development and acquisition of GILS implementations, validation, and interpretations of the standard. 10.1␣Development and Acquisition of GILS Implementations. This standard is effective XXXXXX (6 months after approval by the Secretary of Commerce). 10.2␣Validation. Validation of GILS implementations is not required at this time. Testing for conformance to this standard is at the discretion of the agency. Agencies may select the tests to be administered and the testing organizations that administer the tests. 10.3␣Interpretation of this standard. Resolution of questions regarding this standard will be provided by NIST. Questions concerning the content and specifications should be addressed to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, Attn: FIPS for GILS Interpretation, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Telephone: (301) 975&hyph;2833. 11. Waivers. Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a senior official designated pursuant to Section 3506(b) of Title 44, U.S. Code. Waivers shall be granted only when: a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal computer system, or b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by governmentwide savings.
