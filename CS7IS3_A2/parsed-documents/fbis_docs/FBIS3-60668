This momentous occasion of commissioning Pakistan's first locally manufactured locomotive is indeed an historic milestone in railways' industrial capacity as well as the country's history.

The establishment of a locomotive factory here will give a boost to the area and to the Frontier Province. The Risalpur Locomotive Factory is a tribute to the resilience of the workers of Pakistan Railways. This factory speaks volumes of the talents, the skills, the capability of all those who worked day and night in the respective positions in the Railways workshop.

We have worked together in the field of economy as well as in the sphere of science and technology. The inauguration today of this locomotive factory and the launching of the first locomotive built is a testimony of our growing ties in the fields of science, technology, and economy. Japan and Pakistan share similar views in the field of foreign policy. Both countries seek to build a world where there is a limitation and reduction of strategic weapons. We share the same concern about nuclear proliferation, about human rights, and narcotics control.
