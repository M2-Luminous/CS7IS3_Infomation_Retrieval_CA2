Rasim Delic on Monday confirmed that the Muslim side was preparing an offensive on the Serbs in the area of Brcko, a town in the northern part of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Gen. Delic, who toured together with Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic Muslim units on the front south of Brcko, said that `the Brcko front was the key to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,' according to Muslim-held Radio Sarajevo. Gen. Delic confirmed that preparations were under way for a Muslim offensive at Brcko on the corridor which links the western and eastern parts of the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.), and set out, `we have nothing to wait for, and we will launch a decisive reckoning with Serb forces for the [word indistinct] of Bosnia-Herzegovina in that section of the front.' Gen. Delic said in a meeting with the local Muslim commanders that `the Bosnia-Herzegovina (Muslim) presidency and government will do everything for preparations for the offensive to be completed successfully.' R.S. military sources have more than once in the past several days said that the Muslim side is preparing a large-scale offensive operation in the Brkco region with a view to cutting off the corridor. The same sources said that, as part of the preparations, Muslim military authorities first carried out massive mobilization in Sarajevo and then pulled out over 10,000 troops from the city and sent them across Mount Igman to central and northern Bosnia. However, foreign media have been accusing the Serbs of massing troops around Brcko, and the U.S. Government is considering initiating an emergency action in the U.N. Security Council for the adoption of a resolution on intervention of NATO forces in case of armed conflicts between Serbs and Muslims in the Brcko region, which would be a further instance of the U.N. siding with the Muslims. Commander of the U.S. military base in Frankfurt, Gen. Rolanger arrived in Sarajevo on Monday and met with Muslim Presidency member Ejup Ganic, Radio Sarajevo said and set out that no details of the talks had been disclosed.
