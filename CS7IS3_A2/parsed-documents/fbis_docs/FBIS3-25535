At a meeting held in Kaparabyong and chaired by President Museveni, the Karamojong, through their representative, Mr. Philip Ichumal, who is also the Resistance Council [RC] Three chairman for Namalu, expressed their gratitude to the pacification committee which is sensitizing them on how to live peacefully and harmoniously with their neighbors. Mr. Ichumal assured the president that the Karamojong will ensure that all guns are handed over to the vigilante force in Moroto within two weeks. He said that they will also go and tell their fellow Karamojong, in other areas never to come with guns to the neighboring districts. Mr. Ichumal also appealed to the government to facilitate the pacification committee with transport so that it can coordinate interaction easily between the Karamojong and their Teso neighbors at all levels of the community so that there is permanent peace in the region. He said that constant contact is necessary to help iron out hostilities. He also expressed confidence that education is necessary to help Karamojong to change their behavior. He asked the government and the Teso people to forgive the Karamojong for the wrongs committed to the neighboring communities. President Museveni, in his remarks, stressed the need to have the program supported by Karamojong as well as all other people in their neighboring districts to help the government alleviate the suffering of the people in the region. The president also urged Ugandans to support the formation of the vigilance group in Karamoja because they are already doing a good job in the phasing out of illegal guns in Karamoja. He therefore urged all Karamojong with illegal guns to join the vigilance force, which is like LDUs [local defense units] in other areas, adding that government will consider some incentives for the vigilantes. Mr. Museveni also said that he is ready to visit Karamojong Kraal leaders who, he said, need to be educated on how to keep cows cost-effectively and get earnings from their herds. President Museveni addressed a public rally at Kaparabyong County headquarters, where he commended the people of Teso for rejecting insurgency. He said that this will help government to tackle the problem of illegal guns still in Karamojong hands. He said that the government will ensure that the Karamojong become law-abiding citizens.
