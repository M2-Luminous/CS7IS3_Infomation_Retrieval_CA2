Meanwhile, we are going to enhance the reform of state-owned enterprises and give full play to the superiority of our role as a major agricultural province, and foreign businessmen are welcome to invest in Hunan's infrastructure construction. Wang Maolin said: Owing to the introduction of some reform measures and the effect of investment, in the first two months of this year, the rate of commodity price rises in Hunan was quite high, greater than the national average. Therefore, Hunan Province has taken a series of regulatory measures and made use of the advantage of having a plentiful supply of goods and materials on hand to rapidly put large numbers of commodities on the market, particularly such necessities of people's lives as rice, vegetables, and meat. Meanwhile, price ceilings are set on farm and sideline products and the trend of rapid and excessive price rises is brought under control in a very short time. In April, prices rises in Hunan were lower than the national average level. Regarding the controlled target of inflation this year, Wang Maolin said: With the introduction of grain price reform in June, commodity prices may be much affected, but we are very confident of keeping the inflation rate below 15 percent. Talking about this year's reform tasks, Wang Maolin said: This year, Hunan Province will lay stress on coordinating with reform measures introduced by the central authorities to guarantee implementation of the measures. Meanwhile, we will enhance reform of state-owned enterprises. We will resolutely urge enterprises not running well for a long time to declare bankruptcy, encourage enterprises achieving good benefit to merge with enterprises with unreasonable product structures, and take measures, such as auctioning off some enterprises and letting state-owned enterprises be run by the private sector, to improve enterprise economic benefits and reduce deficits. Wang Maolin said: Hunan is a major agricultural province with the output of paddy rice and live pigs ranking first in our country. Hunan has made great contributions to our country, but our villages are not as well-off as they should be, mainly because processing work has failed to keep up with development. As long as we can make enough efforts in the depth and quality of processing and packing, and give wide publicity to the products, Hunan's agriculture will be able to advance to a new stage. Wang Maolin specially pointed out that as a major agricultural province, Hunan's products should have a considerable market share in Hong Kong. He said that foreign businesses are welcome to invest in Hunan, particularly in infrastructure construction. He continued: The Hunan section of the Beijing-Zhuhai Expressway is 570 kilometers in length. At present, apart from support pledged by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, we are trying to raise funds from various channels, and domestic and overseas businesses are welcome to invest in this "golden road." Talking about the construction in the energy sector, Wang Maolin said: Hong Kong's China Light and Power Company is talking with us about joint-venture construction of a thermal power plant in Changde. The China Light and Power Company will own 40 percent of the stock. At present, both sides have signed a letter of intent on cooperation.
