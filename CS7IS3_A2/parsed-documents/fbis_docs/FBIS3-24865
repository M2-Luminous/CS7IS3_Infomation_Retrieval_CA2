The cease-fire was agreed only on Sunday [30 January] to end months of clashes following the disputed elections last year. But the government apparently tried to take advantage and clear the railway line to the coast. The opposition objected and launched an attack on a train. There were deaths and a lot of injuries. From Brazzaville, Antoine Mouyambala telexed this report. [read by announcer] Two people were killed yesterday and another 30 injured when an opposition group attacked a train, carrying a team of workmen sent to reopen the railway line from Brazzaville to the coast. Traffic on the line had been disrupted for the past two months by opposition supporters, and the attack took place whilst the train was standing in a small station at Goma Tsetse in the opposition stronghold region of Pool, 50 km from Brazzaville. One of the dead was a senior official from the state railway company, and many of the wounded were soldiers who had been escorting the train. The victims were taken to Brazzaville yesterday afternoon, where an emergency meeting is expected to take place today between government and opposition supporters to discuss ways to bring the rising tide of violence in the country to an end. Despite yesterday's train attack, a spokesman for the pro-government presidential movement said that there would be no reversal of their cease-fire declaration made on Sunday.
