FR940728-1-00006 FR940728-1-00002 The second condition is marked by economic dislocation, where the loss, removal, or closing of a major source or sources of employment in the most recent 3-year period has caused an increase of 2 percentage points or more in the area's unemployment rate compared with the period immediately before the dislocation. REA wishes to assist rural communities where the loss of a major employer(s) has caused an increase of 2 percentage points or more in the area's unemployment rate in the most recent 3-year period, including areas which have experienced military base closings due to U.S. Department of Defense budget cuts. REA also wishes to assist rural communities where there has been an increase of 2 percentage points or more in the area's unemployment rate in the most recent 3-year period as a result of Federal regulatory restrictions, including logging curtailment due to environmental restrictions of the U.S. Forest Service. REA has proposed the 2-percent rise in unemployment threshold and the 3-year time span based on criteria as currently utilized by the U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration (EDA) in its designation of redevelopment areas (13 CFR 302.5). The third condition is a state of chronic or long-term economic deterioration, marked by severe unemployment and out-migration. REA wants to make rural development resources more accessible to communities which have experienced long-term economic decline; thus, it has consulted with the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) to determine the appropriate criteria for chronic or long-term economic deterioration. To receive special economic status under the third condition, applicants must document that local unemployment has been equal to or over 1.5 times the national average during 4 out of the most recent 5 years. The applicant, when calculating recent years' unemployment percentages, should compare county statistics with the national average unemployment for the corresponding year. For example, if the applicant provides unemployment statistics for 1989, calculations must compare the county's 1989 unemployment with the national average for 1989, and the 1990 county unemployment statistics with the National average for 1990, etc. REA believes that using unemployment statistics for 4 out of the 5 most recent years sufficiently documents a sustained or long-term unemployment problem. However, REA is aware that unemployment statistics alone do not provide a complete picture of the severity of economic deterioration. In areas where unemployed persons tend to migrate from, loss of population statistics are more accurate in determining long-term economic deterioration. Therefore, as an alternative to indicate special economic status, the applicant must show a 15% loss of population due to out-migration over the most recent 10-year decennial census. For example, borrowers applying during the year of the publication of this rule seeking special economic status under this condition would compare the 1980 Census to the 1990 Census in order to establish that a 15% loss of population has occurred. A threshold of 15% population loss over 10-year period is indicative of a local economic situation which is acutely severe. Further, by taking into consideration both unemployment and out-migration, as proposed in this rule, a reasonable percentage of rural areas suffering from conditions of severe economic stagnation will be eligible for special economic status. County and National unemployment statistics will be based on those of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Information showing the loss of population due to out-migration over the most recent 10-year decennial census will be based on the U.S. Bureau of the Census data. The fourth condition involves the designation of an area as a Rural Empowerment Zone or Rural Enterprise Community under the Empowerment Zone Program, the provisions of which were published at 59 FR 2686 (January 18, 1994) (to be codified at 7 CFR part 25) implementing Section 13301 of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;66, 26 U.S.C. 1391&hyph;1393. To coordinate rural development efforts with the Empowerment Zone Program, REA is proposing to give special economic status under the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program to those areas designated as Rural Empowerment Zones or Rural Enterprise Communities. This provision will parallel efforts of other agencies in the Department of Agriculture in the Empowerment Zone Program and serve to increase rural development opportunities in those areas so designated. As a result of this proposed rule, REA encourages its borrowers to bring REA rural economic development resources to bear upon communities afflicted with the above economic conditions, utilizing zero-interest loans and grants and revolving loan funds to secure needed community infrastructure and/or to stimulate local economic development. Finally, three changes are proposed to clarify the final rule which was published March 14, 1994, amending the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program. The final rule established procedures for administering grants and made several revisions with regard to eligible purposes for loan and grant funding. This proposed rule modifies the existing regulation in three areas as follows. First, this proposed rule reinstates the prohibition on funding community antenna television systems or facilities which was in effect prior to March 14, 1994, and eliminated by the March 14, 1994, final rule. In eliminating the prohibition, it was not REA's intent to fund projects solely for the purpose of establishing cable television entities to compete with existing cable television providers. Rather, the prohibition was lifted to allow REA flexibility to fund projects that provide a clear economic benefit to distressed rural areas, with an emphasis toward programming to provide specific educational and/or medical services. REA has received a number of inquiries regarding innovative proposals to transmit educational and medical programming in conjunction with wireless cable television services. For economically depressed areas with limited resources to maintain a system dedicated solely to educational and/or medical programming, a joint venture fully utilizing the transmitting capacity of community antenna television systems is a novel approach to providing needed distance educational and/or medical services, while providing economic development in areas without a cable television carrier. Accordingly, REA proposes through this proposed rule to revise ยง1703.20, Ineligible uses of zero-interest loans and grants, to reinstate the prohibition on funding community antenna television systems or facilities. However, ยง1703.17(d) of this proposed rule will provide the Administrator the discretion to fund community antenna television systems or facilities for select projects which meet all of the following criteria: (1) The proposed community antenna television system or facility is established in cooperation with a local educational and/or medical entity or entities to provide educational and/or medical programming which addresses specific needs of rural residents; (2) services to be provided by the proposed community antenna television systems or facilities are not available in the area to be served, or services are not being provided by the existing television programming carrier at an affordable cost to residents; and, (3) such community antenna systems or facilities will not present undue competition for existing television programming carriers in the area. The proposed rule requires the Borrower to clearly document the economic benefit to the proposed area to be served in accordance with the existing regulation, and meet the above three tests as provided in the proposed rule. Notwithstanding this, however, the Administrator will reserve the right to deny any application which proposes cable television and, in the Administrator's judgment, does not meet the three regulatory tests in the proposed rule.
