FR940907-2-00044 FR940907-2-00029 [FRL&hyph;5066&hyph;6] Public Meeting on the Draft National Waste Minimization Plan AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Announcement of meeting. SUMMARY: On May 18, 1993, EPA Administrator Carol Browner announced, with the release of the Draft Hazardous Waste Minimization and Combustion Strategy, that EPA was taking a leadership role in reducing the amount of hazardous waste produced in this country and strengthening federal controls governing hazardous waste incinerators, boilers, and industrial furnaces. As part of that Strategy, EPA developed and released a Draft RCRA Waste Minimization National Plan in May of 1994. EPA's goal is to finalize the Phase I portion of the Plan by November 1994. Phase I is the primary vehicle for promoting source reduction and, secondarily, environmentally sound recycling of waste streams containing persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic compounds, and particularly metals and/or halogens that are likely to be combusted in boilers and industrial furnaces or hazardous waste incinerators. Phase II of the Plan will focus beyond hazardous wastes managed in combustion units to promote source reduction and recycling for wastes managed by other practices. In order to gain early and substantive input on Phase I, EPA will hold a three-day focus group meeting September 20&hyph;22, 1994, with invited participants. Participants will include individuals from federal, state and local government, industry, public interest and environmental groups, technical assistance centers, and labor. EPA will convene separate Focus Group sessions on: (1) Prioritization of Wastes. Discussions will focus on the methodology that EPA has developed to prioritize waste minimization efforts associated with wastes that are combusted. A Federal Register Notice, 59FR 41442, dated August 12, 1994 announced the availability of a Draft Methodology Document and asked for comments on the draft by September 9, 1994. (2) Goals. Topics will include: development of a goal statement for minimizing hazardous wastes that are combusted, particularly when such reductions will lead to multi-media environmental benefits and will reduce persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic constituents; expediting continual improvement in seeking source reduction and environmentally sound recycling options at the top of the waste management hierarchy; and improving the recycling and management of wastes that cannot be reduced in a way that results in a net reduction of environmental loadings to all media. (3) Voluntary Programs and Incentives. Topics will include discussion of currently existing voluntary programs/incentives and how they either overlap with the goals of Phase I, or do not meet Phase I objectives; and options, both pro and con, of using existing programs/incentives versus new initiatives to get real reductions of wastes of concern. (4) Incorporating waste minimization in RCRA permits. Discussions will include the status of federal and state efforts to incorporate waste minimization into RCRA permits, inspections and enforcement actions. Comments will be invited regarding the pros and cons of these approaches. Members of the public are invited to attend the meeting as observers. Written comments will be accepted at the meeting. Additionally, there will be time allotted following participants discussions to take comments from observers. The Meeting will be held Tuesday, September 20 through Thursday, September 22 at the Holiday Inn Bethesda, 8120 Wisconsin Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland (301) 652&hyph;2000. Please contact the hotel directly for further information on the meeting facilities and lodging. For information on the meeting (e.g. the agenda and issues) or to request special needs services for observers such as sign language interpretation, contact Sandra Farrell at (703) 308&hyph;8402. An Executive Summary of the proceedings of the Focus Groups Meeting will be prepared and made publicly available following the Meeting. Dated: August 30, 1994. Elizabeth Cotsworth, Acting Director, Office of Solid Waste. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;22000 Filed 9&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
