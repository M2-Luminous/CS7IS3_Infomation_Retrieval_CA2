FYROM's participation in the program was announced by the EU Commission's legal department, but as Venizelos explained, the extension of the program to countries of the former Yugoslavia is decided by the EU Council of Ministers where agreement is necessary. FYROM participation in the program requires a special regulation as happened in the case of Croatia.
