First, in January it plans to establish a Rapid Prototyping Industry Association (tentative name) for dissemination, R&D, and fact-finding surveys. The association will be made up of rapid prototyping apparatus manufacturers such as D-MEC, a wholly owned company of Japan Synthetic Rubber, users such as the Mitsubishi group's CMET, and men of learning and experience. It will grapple with the raising the level of rapid prototyping (RP) in a four-year ¥800 million plan as part of the theme of ``Technology Development Work for Supporting Knowledge Concentration in Small-Medium Companies'' of the Small Business National Corporation to be newly established in fiscal year 1994. The purpose of MITI's support of the RP industry is to promote new businesses in materials process technology industries such as metal patterns. RP technology is a method of creating 3-dimensional (3D) forms layer by layer using CAD (computer-aided design) data and light-hardenable resin on which laser beams are shined. MITI sees RP technology as a basic technology for making things which can't be made using metal patterns. MITI hopes that it will tie in with the automation of design and will have broad applications in medicine and welfare, too. It wishes to support this technology as a new business for the metal pattern and casting industries in which small-medium companies predominate. However, since RP apparatus is expensive -- about ¥50 million per machine -- its use is limited to applications such as industrial working models and human periosteum. Accordingly, R&D themes include topics such as lowering costs of manufacturing apparatus, laser development, technology for application to casting machinery, and collaboration on CAD data. Participants in the Rapid Prototyping Industry Association will include manufacturers (such as Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding Co., Denken, and 3D Systems of the U.S.), and software companies, users, research institutions, and men of learning and experience involved with RP. The initial general meeting is to be held in January 1994. A cooperative association for promoting R&D will be set up in parallel with the Small Business National Corporation.
