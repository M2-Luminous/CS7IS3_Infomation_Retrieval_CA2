They agreed that by the second reading of the draft the State Duma Budget Committee will work out proposals on increasing allocations to the defense sphere, chiefly to hi-tech conversion production processes. Most of the deputies insist that these allocations be brought to 55 trillion rubles. "Such reserves exist and there's no need to increase the debit side of the budget," said Mr. Rybkin, informing the deputies of his meeting with the Russian president, which lasted more than an hour. He noted that allocations will also be raised to servicemen's social needs, education, science, and culture. According to Mr. Rybkin, the Russian president accepted the State Duma's amendments to the draft law on the Constitutional Court but refused to name the supposed candidacies to the justices' vacancies, since the choice has not yet been made from the numerous proposals. Mr. Rybkin said the Russian president backed his proposal to move the minieconomy agencies that have not yet left the former State Planning Committee building now occupied by the Duma to Lubyanskaya Square. There are many vacant premises there, noted he.
