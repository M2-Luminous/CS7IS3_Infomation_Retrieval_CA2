FR940907-1-00039 FR940907-1-00015 The security ratings encompassed by the Commission's policy were understood generally to be credit ratings. In the release announcing the policy, the Commission noted that the typical security rating at the time was ``an alphabetical designation which attempts to quantify the likelihood that an issuer will be able to comply with the terms of a particular obligation,'' 18 and cited one rating organization's designation as a ``current assessment of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation.'' 19 The release went on to state that a debt rating was ``an evaluation of the likelihood that an issuer will be able to make timely interest payments and will be able to repay principal,'' and a preferred stock rating was an ``assess[ment] of the relative security of dividend payments.'' 20 18 Securities Act Release No. 6336. 19 Id. 20 Id. In adopting a policy of voluntary ratings disclosure, the Commission noted that the state of affairs at the time did not show a ``pressing need'' for mandatory disclosure. 21 Underlying the Commission's action was an understanding that the market viewed debt securities and preferred stock with the same rating designation and comparable payment terms as fungible. 21 Id. The importance of security ratings continues today. Ratings influence a company's cost of capital. Investment bankers and issuers often solicit the rating organizations' views when developing new financial instruments or structuring financing transactions. Investors typically use ratings for various reasons such as establishing internal investment guidelines and considering alternative investments. Because of changes in the securities market the Commission has determined to reconsider its policy of voluntary ratings disclosure. B. Growth of Customized, Structured, and Derivative Securities Since adoption of the Commission's policy on security ratings, there has been a dramatic proliferation in the types of securities offered in the marketplace, with the development of a vast market for mortgage and asset backed securities and other highly structured or derivative financial instruments. The rights and obligations evidenced by these financial instruments typically differ significantly from the traditional fixed obligations, evidenced by corporate debt and preferred stock, to pay sums certain in the form of interest and principal or dividends at set intervals. Moreover, in addition to the change in the types of securities being rated, the scope and meaning of ratings themselves have become more variable. Disclosure concerning ratings, however, has remained largely static. 1. Evolution of Financial Instruments Unlike the traditional debt and preferred stock instruments upon which the 1981 policy was based, today many securities with the same rating are not viewed by the market as generic and fungible. An investor's investment return and the issuer's payment obligations evidenced by these instruments often are contingent on, and highly sensitive to, changes in the values of underlying assets, indices, interest rates and cash flows. Risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and other economic and market factors may be as important to an instrument's investment return as the issuer's creditworthiness. Because of these non-credit payment risks, there is substantially greater uncertainty relating to yield and total return than for traditional debt obligations of comparable credit rating. Moreover, the terms of these financial instruments are highly complex and frequently are individually tailored to specific investor demands. In short, today's instruments run along a spectrum from a fixed obligation to pay sums certain to a highly contingent residual interest in variable future cash flows. For example, structured notes offer an infinite variety of payment obligations and present substantial cash flow, market, and liquidity risks in addition to credit risk. 22 To illustrate, a structured note may promise a specified interest payment monthly for two years, but principal payable at maturity may be determined by reference to the number of days an interest index exceeds a benchmark rate, subject to a cap. If the index never exceeds the benchmark rate during the measurement period, by the instrument's terms, the investor receives the minimum principal amount (which often is less than face or stated value). Such note could be assigned a ``triple-a'' rating under a credit analysis if issued by a highly-capitalized, financially sound company. The credit rating would address the likelihood that the issuer will be able to pay any principal due, not the likelihood that the investor will receive any principal payment. 22 ``Structured notes are debt securities whose cash flow characteristics (coupon, redemption amount, or stated maturity) depend upon one or more indices or that have imbedded forwards or options. Such imbedded forwards and options in the structure of the notes allow underwriters to create an unlimited number of risk/reward profiles and to customize risk characteristics to fit an investor's desired risk exposure.'' Comptroller of the Currency, Administrator of National Banks, OCC Advisory Letter 94&hyph;2, Purchases of Structured Notes 1 (July 21, 1994). Likewise, from the relatively simple mortgage-backed obligations (single-class securities representing equal, undivided interests in a pool of mortgages) that were developed in the 1970s, mortgage-backed and asset-backed pooled securities have evolved through financial engineering into highly customized instruments with unlimited potential variations. While credit risk remains important to investors in mortgage-backed securities, additional investment considerations are introduced by uncertain principal prepayment speeds associated with the underlying interest rate sensitive assets. Simple mortgage-backed securities may include multiple senior-subordinated class structures, with the subordinated classes bearing a disproportionate share of the credit risk, but all classes sharing prepayment risk equally. With more complex, customized collateralized mortgage obligations (``CMOs''), the cash flows (i.e., the stream of payments on the underlying mortgage loans) are ``carved up'' into a multi-class bond structure so that the prepayment risk is disproportionately allocated to certain classes. Each class receives interest and/or principal payments based on the priorities in the payment structure. For example, a ``planned amortization class'' (``PAC'') is designed to produce more stable cash flows by redirecting prepayments on the underlying pooled assets to other classes called ``companion classes,'' which act as ``shock absorbers'' for the PAC with respect to prepayments. Both the PAC and the companion classes could be senior securities, and rank ``pari passu'' with respect to credit defaults on the underlying loans and both could be rated ``triple a,'' notwithstanding the disproportionate share of prepayment risk borne by the companion classes, a risk not addressed by a traditional credit rating.
