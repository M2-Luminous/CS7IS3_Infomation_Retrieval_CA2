General Miguel Angel Godinez, commander of the 7th Military Region, said the Mexican Army is closely following the contacts between Commissioner [for Peace and Reconciliation in Chiapas] Manuel Camacho Solis and the armed groups to find a peaceful solution to the problem. Godinez asserted that the so-called Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] cannot be called an "Army" because an army must be an institution and in each country there is only one. He criticized the fact that the armed groups cover their faces with ski masks, "they have no reason to cover up; no matter how covered up he may be, a soldier will not commit a crime, therefore, for us, (the EZLN members) are criminals and transgressors of the law." Godinez denied that Mexico is at war: "We do not recognize nor do we accept that the country is in a state of war, because we are fighting a group that has dedicated itself to committing armed crimes." He defined the Mexican Army position: "Our position is for legality, stability, peace, and work; and their's (of the EZLN) is for breaking the law." "In spite of the foregoing, we have not persecuted them in the jungle, even though we more or less know where they are, very close to Ocosingo, as we prefer that the government handle this problem politically," he said. The commander explained that in light of the cease-fire decreed by the president of the Republic "we remain in the outskirts of the cities, after having turned over the municipal palaces and the government offices to the corresponding authorities." "The instructions from President Carlos Salinas de Gortari are that the troops leave the cities so the inhabitants may recover their peace and return as soon as possible to their normal lives," he said. However, "we will remain quartered near the cities of Las Margaritas, Altamirano, Ocosingo, Oxchuc, and San Cristobal de Las Casas," he advised. When asked about the alleged human rights violations committed by the Army, Godinez challenged the accusers to name the places where they claim there have been "indiscriminate" bombings against the civilian population. In this respect, he encouraged all nongovernment organizations to refrain from criticizing and attacking the Mexican Army given the fact "the only thing the soldiers have done is to defend themselves from an aggression against them by a group that has clearly broken the law." With respect to those individuals who were supposedly beaten, the military officer disclosed that those persons arrested during the conflict were immediately handed over to agents of the federal and state Attorney General's Office in order to avoid any problems with any human rights organizations. "Therefore, we are quite concerned about such indiscriminate and inaccurate criticism of the Army and that we fired against individuals who were only carrying weapons made out of wood, yet no one condemns those who sent those persons as human shields," he lamented. "Now, it would seem that everything bad about these events has been caused by the Armed Forces." He immediately referred to the "alleged" death blow [tiro de gracia] found on some bodies after clashes against the rebel groups and explained that "when someone is in a trench, the head is the part of the body that sticks out and that's why helmets are worn." "Nowadays, any head wound caused by a bullet is being taken as a death blow," he pointed out. With respect to the amnesty law benefiting the armed groups, the military officer indicated the "it is another benefit which President Carlos Salinas de Gortari decided to implement in order to reestablish peace and legal order in the region." This "is evidence of the president's interest in finding and achieving solutions to this problem by every possible means and with the least possible cost of human lives." With respect to the EZLN strategy, the 7th Military Region commander believes that within this group there are individuals "who are professionals recruited to train other persons, they are up to date on guerrilla warfare, and have access to modern weapons." He explained that "there is another group that has received military training every weekend, every week, and every 15 days in communities near the jungle region." Another group includes "supporters responsible for supplying food and intelligence as well as handling radios," commander Godinez explained. Moreover, he explained, there is also another group opposed to these "outlaws" who are "fortunately a majority. This group's members were expelled from their communities for refusing to support criminal activities by donating food of money."
