Under the protocol provisions, only the developed countries are allowed to export CFCs. India, China and Brazil are among the developing countries which are in a position to export CFCs. Delivering his presidential address at the concluding session of the fifth meeting of the bureau of the parties to the Montreal protocol in Bangkok today, the minister of environment and forests, Mr Kamal Nath, said that this would help reduce the burden on the developing countries as well as on the multilateral fund. This would also help accelerating the process of phasing out of the ozone depleting substances. Mr Kamal Nath lays down his office as chairman of the bureau at the end of his one-year term today. Mr Kamal Nath said that the provisions of the protocol should be so amended that the early reduction of ODS did not become a disincentive. In fact, such efforts needed to be recognised and rewarded, rather than be allowed to become a punitive constraint in future. Expressing deep concern over the development of technology and its transfer, the minister suggested that the effort should be widened by roping into the process more scientific and technical institutions, particularly in the countries where the appropriate technologies were to be used. He pointed out that the denial of funds for research and technology development would amount to the protection of commercial interests of a few and not the environmental interests of all. Stressing the need of rigorous control over the demonstrable essential uses of halons, Mr Kamal Nath said that it must be borne in mind that many developing countries did not have access to the halon substitutes available to the developed countries. These realities must all receive due consideration, including when deciding upon the location of halon banks. The halon-producing developing countries should be involved in the development of halon banks, he said. Mr Kamal Nath cautioned that with the greater integration of the global economy and the on-going liberalisation process in several parts of the world, it should be ensured that ODS-using equipment that would become technologically obsolete, or the use of which was legally restricted, in the developed world was not dumped by unscrupulous elements onto projects in developing countries. Each country would have to evolve suitable mechanisms to ensure this. But simultaneously, while approving projects, the executive committee would also have to ensure that ODS-using equipment was suitably prevented from recirculation, he said. Reviewing with satisfaction the last one year's progress under his chairmanship, Mr Kamal Nath said a total of 122 countries had signed the protocol. The executive committee has so far approved 27 country programmes for phasing out ODS and sanctioned projects and activities worth a total of $200 million. India's country programme worth $2 billion was approved by the committee last week in Bangkok. The minister stressed the need for adequate and timely replenishment of the multilateral fund and requested that contributions to the full extent of the agreed target amount be made with a sense of urgency.
