Kremlin Has Lost Its Nerve Too Soon"] [Text] As of today, virtually everyone for whom NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program is meant has joined it. Except, so far, for Russia. I was told at the NATO head office that in principle that matter has already been resolved and that work is currently under way to draw up a corresponding document. If this is really so, Russia appears to be the first to have lost its nerve. It so happened that all Russia's former Warsaw Pact allies and some former Soviet Union republics marched to NATO barracks having joined the "Partnership for Peace" program. U.S. President Bill Clinton, NATO General Secretary Woerner, and others have been telling President Yeltsin courteously: The door is open for you, too, all you need is to enter. An alternative is isolation. The top Russian authorities have long hesitated. A situation has come about where either Russia accepts the "Partnership for Peace" program for fear of isolation in Europe, or NATO countries will change their tone and suggest that Russia itself define its place in the collective defense system. The first option prevailed. Everything could have turned out differently, however, were it not for someone's nerves. The thing is that in the NATO head office and in the capitals of the alliance's key members they had been bracing themselves for a turn or, maybe, an overture toward Moscow. For instance, Robert Hunter, U.S. ambassador to NATO, speaking at a special colloquium organized by the European Strategic Studies Center in Brussels on 25 February 1993 [as published], said bluntly: Relations between Russia and NATO should be a matter of special talks, which, to all appearances, may end up giving Russia a special status. Guillaume Parmantier, an authority strategic affairs, professor at the Political Studies Institute, and deputy director of the NATO information department, the other day made a detailed analysis of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, pointing out Russia's extraordinary role in its settlement. "We should not forget," Parmantier writes, "that Russia is a great power. Any attempt to keep it away from the efforts to ensure European security would be a great mistake... Giving this power any security guarantees would make no sense, and inviting it to join NATO would be absurd." These and other facts and evidence suggest that sentiments were gaining ground in NATO to offer Moscow something other than the "Partnership for Peace." They reasoned validly in NATO that it would not behoove Russia to join NATO on the same, albeit gentleman's, principles as Estonia and Albania. It is quite possible, however, that the principles will indeed differ from those on which the East Europeans and the Baltic states have joined it. But what is important is the end result -- what will happen after the probationary period expires for countries that have signed the "Partnership for Peace" program? Everything will proceed in a clear-cut military fashion: these countries will perfectly naturally become full-blown members of the North Atlantic Alliance. This is actually why the transition program was invented. It is then that Russia will face a new dilemma. If it stays in the capacity of a "Partnership for Peace" member, this means that Russia will find itself in isolation once again and will be subjected to discrimination by comparison with other East European countries that will have become full NATO members. If it follows their suit and agrees to full membership, then it will have to place its armed forces, military plans, and budget under the control and command of ...the United States. For under a long-standing tradition, the NATO commander in chief has always been and remains an American general.
