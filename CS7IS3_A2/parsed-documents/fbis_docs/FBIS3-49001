It is our tradition, as well as that of other peoples, to be closer to each other at the end of one year and the beginning of another and to think with greater hope and confidence of the new year that is approaching. May it be a better year and may our hopes come true. With these thoughts and feelings, I am addressing you with heartfelt wishes for health, happiness, peace, understanding, and for many happy returns. The year we are concluding has been neither simple nor easy. Maybe it has not brought the much-desired satisfactions to people's homes and hearts, it has stored up -- as we, in fact, expected -- too many difficulties. Surely, however, if we judge correctly and objectively, the year 1993 was a purposeful year that placed our hopes on a more stable foundation. This year of continuity in our political and social balance and stability also marked the beginning of our economic consolidation, a first and decisive step toward what we have to perform from now on. At the foreign level, the year 1993 marked Romania's recognition as a factor of stability in this part of the world that is still beset by anxiety, conflicts, and explosive situations with serious and incalculable consequences. This year marked the consecration of our integration into European structures and our association, on the basis of partnership, with international bodies and organizations. The merit of being in a completely different international position today and of benefiting from relations, which we have to honor with dedication and seriousness, belongs to all reasonable political and social forces in our country. Dear compatriots, I believe that all of us have reason to hope that the year to come will more evidently display the fruits of Romania's change for the better. First, I am truthfully thinking of those who have had and continue to have difficulties, families with numerous children or those who are without jobs -- young people, pensioners, and other segments, who, day in day out, have to make ends meet with their modest incomes. I want to grant them a tiny support and encouragement: They will be neither eschewed, nor forgotten. It is the duty of all of those invested with responsibilities in our society to pay attention -- along with economic recovery -- to measures for social protection in the year to come. I am addressing all those who, through great efforts, honest work, and practical initiatives -- the entrepreneurs and managers of economic units -- have reaped success. I want to congratulate them and to wish them new successes in the year to come. Their results are of great importance in the work of relaunching our economy. Their experience has to be encouraged and given general application. Not through profiteering and fiscal evasion will we build a modern economy, but through productive initiative and intensive, intelligent, and honest work. Dear compatriots, we are going through a period that is still difficult. It is a trying time for our nation but we must never forget that, during difficult and decisive times, the Romanian nation reaped success through unity, cohesion, courage, and intelligence, thus, each time, recovering through commendable proof of balance and stability. Instigation to hatred and disorder and disunity and intolerance have not been and are not favorable, but, on the contrary, they have played and can play into the hands of interests that are dangerous to our national destiny. Therefore, I want to appeal to the political and social forces, and to all our citizens to rally their efforts, capabilities, and energy, which our people do not lack, in order to build a modern and prosperous society. Let us abandon feuds and intolerance, as well as sterile confrontations and disputes. Let us seek, together, through dialogue, the points of understandings and eliminate those that disunite us. On the eve of the New Year, I would like to extend a warm message to our brethren across the Prut River -- to Ilie Ilascu and his friends, and to all Romanians everywhere. I want to express the hope that the year 1994 will guarantee for all of us a better life, that it will be a year of peace and understanding and of unity on the platform of national interests. In conclusion of his message, President Ion Iliescu wishes everyone a happy New Year and many happy returns.
