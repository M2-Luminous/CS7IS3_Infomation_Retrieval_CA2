The ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA newspaper features an interview with Sergey Volkov, D. Sc. (History), who says the following: "As for the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), it is highly improbable that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy (LDPR leader) will quarrel with the president if Boris Yeltsin treats respectfully his party. "He has always sided with Yeltsin at the most fateful moments: The dissolution of the old parliament and the approval of the new constitution... Yeltsin benefited most of all by the elections. Some people wanted to dump him and start the struggle for the presidential office, but it has become clear now that the country cannot do without him. He is the only mainstay." In the scholar's opinion, "Zhirinovskiy will never be a president, and the LDPR will never collect more than 30-40 per cent of votes, as communists will never return to power peacefully under their own name." "People increasingly evaluate politicians by their deeds rather than by their words," the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper notes. "The LDPR's success at the general elections is only the first stage of this party's downfall, as well as the downfall of many other politicians determining the fate of our country now. "Russia," the newspaper continues, "is a country of revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries. We have been living in the conditions of the struggle between these two parties for 150 years. The composition of these parties constantly changes, and they come to power in turns. They grappled in a bloody fight in Moscow's centre in 1993. "Neither side was wise enough and responsible to stop and even to retreat in order to prevent the country from going down the drain. Regrettably, the fight has not ended yet. Victors understand that they are not put in the dock. But they do not understand another thing: The camp of victors immediately divides into two factions of enemy friends. Russia has already experienced all this in the 20th century." The same newspaper carries an article by Aleksey Arbatov, D.Sc. (History), saying the following: "The grim truth is that the previous stage of reforms failed. Cosmetic patching-up and personnel reshuffling will not improve the present situation. "We should not `continue the course of reforms' but should radically review both ways of drafting the policy and the policy itself. "Only a law-governed state can carry out democratic reforms in the economy and policy. Not a single question of democratic construction can be settled by force. It only aggravates problems and yields diametrically opposite results." The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper runs an interview with Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. "I cannot approve reforms, especially when they are connected with a change of an economic management system and the entire system and when authorities do not keep the ailments of reforms under control," he says. "Policy disregarding people's interests is immoral. I'm also worried over a reverse movement from gained freedoms: from openness and democratic institutions which started functioning. "If anybody thinks that it is possible to gain stability and order by discarding democracy, he makes a great mistake. If we are to speak about firm order, it has been always based on the efficient operation of all arms of government and firm implementation of laws rather than on arbitrary rule," Gorbachev stresses. "I believe that Russia can restore its economic, political, constitutional, legal and spiritual wealth," former chairman of the Russian Constitutional Court writes in the PRAVDA newspaper. "All of us should think over where we go, whom we elect and whom we obey. We should overcome legal nihilism. We should think abot responsibility, above all, of statesmen and officials." The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper prints an interview with Metropolitan Gedeon who says: "As a believer I claim: Russia is the home of Holy Virgin. The mother of Jesus Christ cares for our homeland. But we turned away from her. `Freedom' was granted to us. "Well, we partook of this freedom -- immorality, crime, drug addiction and such shame when our Russian girls go to sell themselves to underdeveloped countries for a piece of bread or pie. Russia weeps with bloody tears and prays for stopping this disgrace of lawlessness. Merciful Holy Virgin makes such miracles and omens that we shall regain our consciousness earlier or later and shall come to our senses." The TRUD newspaper carries an article by chairman of the Interdepartmental Commission of the Russian Security Council on ecological security, dealing with the demographic situation in Russia. "According to the latest forecasts," he writes, "some stabilisation of birth-rate is expected in the country, mostly thanks to an increase in women of child-bearing age. "The demographic situation in Russia as a whole, that is the future of the nation, largely depends on whether the average family will withstand this difficult time. "If to speak honestly about the tragic statistics, the conclusion is quite definite: Russia is ill, and the state of its population's health already threatens the security of the country." Major-General Gennadiy Zaytsev, head of the Alfa group of the chief security department, describes the struggle against terrorists in the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper. "Guided by an analysis of the present situation, we can draw the conclusion that it is highly improbable that the level of terrorism will drop in the near future. On the contrary, we may encouter even its more audacious manifestations. "To prevent them, it is necessary to create a streamlined system of terrorism control at the state level. Besides, this work should be directed from a single centre. In that case, cooperation of various organisations participating in such measures could be more close and fruitful," Zaytsev stressed.
