The leaflet, entitled "New Great Decision: Strive for a Peace Agreement in Peru!", was sent to EXPRESO together with -- and this is what is amazing -- a "Directive" signed by Guzman. The directive, text of which we publish below, was drafted on 22 October 1993 and nobody knows how it got from Guzman's cell in the Callao Naval base to Stockholm. As can be seen in the "contents and grounds" of the "Directive", Guzman says that with him and the rest of the leadership in prison, the "revolution" is not possible and proposes to postpone it until the 21st Century. Directive: Contents and Grounds By thoroughly assessing our situation and prospects, we have come to the conclusion that the PCP [Peruvian Communist Party] must assume and strive for a New Great Decision and Definition. The following are the main grounds for this: 1. One phase of the revolution has ended. Here's to the next phase of the World Revolution! Each party and organization must clearly and deeply determine how it serves and will serve the RPM [World Proletarian Revolution]... Our Decision and Definition adjusts to our situation. 2. The bureaucratic path is gaining shape and becoming feasible! 3. The GP [Popular War] can only remain as it is, rather than develop and pose growing threats. Six indispensable conditions for victory are at stake: 1. Proletarian leadership; 2. Support of the masses; 3. Strategic centralization; 4. New type of army; 5. Extended war; and 6. Favorable international situation. (The first is the most important of the six conditions.) 4. The Leadership problem cannot be solved on a timely bases. 5. New Great Decision: "Strive for a Peace Agreement!" and a Great Definition: Second Congress. The first represents the grounds, and the second the guidelines. Aim for the 21st century as a decade. 6. Miracles will be possible as long as the masses and Party exist. This is the Directive. It should be firmly and resolutely implemented. 22 October 1993 Signed: President Gonzalo, leader of the PCP.
