It was my duty to talk about it," Slovak President Michal Kovac said in a Slovak television debate this evening. Kovac was rejecting accusations that he had damaged the interests of Slovakia with the speech he made in parliament last week which led the opposition to hold a vote of no confidence in Vladimir Meciar. The president also defended himself against Meciar's subsequent attacks on him, and also expressed himself in favor of achieving early elections by issuing the competence to dissolve parliament. Kovac said that in his speech on Friday, Meciar had "masterfully distorted" his warning against the threat of corruption, making it seem as if Kovac had been accusing the government of corruptibility. Kovac quoted from his Wednesday speech to make it clear that he had not made such a claim about the government. He also rejected the ex-premier's accusation that as chairman of the former Federal Assembly he had promised cooperation to Croatia in arms production and arms trading. He also denied that he had asked Meciar to officially recognize Taiwan for a reward of 500 million dollars. Kovac emphasized that he had only informed Meciar of this offer, because he was aware that accepting it could mean the discontinuation of contacts with China. Finally, Kovac said that he was not going to let the demonstrations outside his window get him down, and force him to resign.
