ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule requires that newly installed emergency locator transmitters (ELT's) on U.S.-registered aircraft be of an improved design that meets the requirements of a revised Technical Standard Order (TSO) or later TSO's issued for ELT's. This rule is prompted by unsatisfactory performance experienced with automatic ELT's manufactured under the original TSO. Further, it addresses certain safety recommendations made by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the search and rescue (SAR) community. The FAA is also adopting improved standards for survival ELT's. The rule is expected to have a dramatic effect on reducing activation failures and would increase the likelihood of locating airplanes after accidents. In addition, publication of this document coincides with notice of the FAA's withdrawal of manufacturing authority for ELT's produced under TSO&hyph;C91. EFFECTIVE DATE: This document is effective June 21, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In 1971, responding to a congressional mandate for rulemaking (Public Law 91&hyph;596), the FAA adopted amendments to parts 25, 29, 91, 121, and 135 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) to require the installation and use of ELT's that meet the requirements of TSO&hyph;C91. The amendments require that certain U.S.-registered civil airplanes be equipped with automatic ELT's. An automatic ELT is a crash-activated electronic signaling device used to facilitate search and rescue efforts in locating downed aircraft. The ELT's crash sensor is commonly called a G-switch (an actuation device that operates on acceleration forces measured in G's; one G denotes the acceleration of the earth's gravity). In most installations, the ELT is attached to the aircraft structure as far aft as practicable in the fuselage in such a manner that damage to the device will be minimized in the event of impact. Certain aircraft, such as turbojet-powered aircraft and aircraft engaged in scheduled air carrier operations, are excepted from this requirement because they are more readily located after an accident because they operate within the air traffic control system and their operators have filed instrument flight plans. For example, scheduled air carriers and turbojet-powered aircraft use the air traffic control system (ATC) and air carriers use instrument flight plans. This rule is applicable to those airplanes that are most difficult to locate after an accident. An ELT is particularly helpful in locating an airplane that is operated by a pilot who does not file a flight plan or operate within the air traffic control system. Survival ELT's are manually operated or automatically actuated upon contact with water. Survival ELT's are required ditching equipment for transport category airplanes and rotorcraft, as provided by the operating rules. They are also required emergency equipment for extended overwater operations on aircraft used in air carrier, air taxi, and commercial operations. Since the adoption of those amendments requiring installation of ELT's, there has been unsatisfactory field experience with the automatic ELT's. Accordingly, the FAA requested RTCA, Inc. (formerly the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics) to develop a revised technical standard that would address false alarms and improve the failure-to-activate rate for automatic ELT's. The RTCA project produced a minimum operational performance standard that is referenced in TSO&hyph;C91a, issued in April 1985. Installation of ELT's that meet this improved standard, however, is voluntary until compliance is required as specified in this amendment.
