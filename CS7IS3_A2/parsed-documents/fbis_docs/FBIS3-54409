Tomorrow our nation celebrates Republic Day. On this auspicious occasion, I have great pleasure in extending to you my warmest greetings and felicitations. Our Republic Day is a day of national resolve, a time to contemplate our position as a nation in relation to the world around us and to introspect upon our duties as individual citizens in enhancing and safeguarding the gains of freedom. As we enter the 45th year of our republic, each of us must realize and act upon the realization that increasingly the world of today will test our every sinew and faculty, virtue and ideals, every system and sector. More than ever before common sense and clean understanding of present realities enjoin that we must organize ourselves to stand on our own resources -- human, institutional, material and spiritual. Indeed, we shall have to strive ever harder unitedly and with self-reliance to go from strength to strength, howsoever difficult the task may be. For three centuries past, the history of the world has been determined by the relations between a few nations, even though they were involved in varying groups and in different periods in confrontation and war with one another. The waging of a valiant and principled struggle for equity and human dignity as in our country and other parts of the world was a crucially important trend in this context. In the present times and the future, the main features of the world's political economy will be molded by those nations which lead in science, technology and industrialization and occupy the commanding heights in global trade and commerce. Today the world is at relative peace, threat of confrontation having been dramatically lessened and instead the scope for friendship and mutual collaboration having been enlarged. The leading nations are well-poised to cooperate in fashioning the emerging world order. Powerful and far-reaching initiatives in this direction are under way. A new global balance is being adjusted as between the continents of America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. A framework of guarded globalization including elaborate regulatory parameters is under settlement. New regional and zonal groupings are also assuming shape. Prestigious international organizations are facilitating peaceful establishment of the new environment for nations and peoples around the globe. Friends! These developments impinge upon the lives of each of us as individuals and as citizens of one nation. Together, we must respond to the challenge and prove our mettle. Let us fully appreciate that within us we have the wherewithal to achieve positive dynamic transformation. Our nation has a tremendous wealth of talented and dedicated men and women comparable with and even superior to the best in the world. Our being wedded to democracy and having absorbed and gained fuller sensitivity to the concepts, processes and needs of democratic governance is an advantage of profound importance. We have built, gained experience in, and developed the institutional infrastructure and mechanisms of parliamentary democracy at the federal, state, district, taluka [revenue district] and village levels. We must impart greater qualitative and quantitative impetus to true democratic decentralization and augment political democracy with economic democracy. This would create the channels and scope for releasing and galvanizing the creativity and manifold genius of our vast human resources. Prudently husbanded, our remarkable range of biodiversity and mineral wealth, human talent, institutional structures and strategic location on the globe can spell rapid self-sustaining growth and development. At the heart of this endeavor, we must uphold clearly and fully our great national values. The dignity of every human being, individual freedom, rights and duties, equality and social justice, service and selflessness and resolute commitment to materialize these must inform our tasks. Let us heed the voice of our sages and saints and learn the lessons from our own history. Pluralism, oneness and equality are intrinsic elements of our heritage and comprise a source of national strengthen of enormous importance. For centuries, we have absorbed and reflected upon the truth of the oneness, of the inner doctrine and purpose of all religions. Let there now be full manifestation of this realization in our day-to-day actions in the social, political and economic areas of national life. Friends! We Indians have to comprehend that the world is fast entering a new chapter in its history in which the modern imperatives of patriotic duty have to be analyzed, grasped and fulfilled by each citizen in his or her sphere of existence and service. The kisan, the jawan and the mazdur [peasant, soldier, laborers], our artisans and entrepreneurs, scientists, engineers, teachers and doctors, writers, poets and artists, representatives of the people, the judiciary, the civil service, and the armed forces, and especially the women of India, all of us must ponder over and perform with utmost devotion our respective individual and collective duty. The father of our nation -- Mahatma Gandhi -- had said: I Quote: I want India to realize that she has a soul that can rise triumphantly above every physical combination of a whole world. Unquote. Our victory will be on the strength of our dedication to truth, nonviolence and unflinching constructive effort arousing the conscience of the world and the moral and ethical force of democracy in nations and peoples of the East and of the West. India seeks peace, friendship, and cooperation with all nations and peoples, especially our neighbors in the subcontinent and other countries in Asia with whom we have ties of kinship and culture. We are committed to the wellbeing of all humanity and performing a creative role in world affairs. Equally, we shall zealously guard our freedom and national sovereignty and integrity. The government and the people of India shall brook no interference in this respect. Friends! Let us strive to fulfill the dreams of those who gave their all for India's freedom and render service such that for generations hence our nation may regard us too as having done our duty well. Tomorrow, on our Republic Day when we unfurl the national tricolor, let us salute our flag of freedom and pledge ourselves to the glory of India and the good of all humankind. Jai Hind [Hail India].
