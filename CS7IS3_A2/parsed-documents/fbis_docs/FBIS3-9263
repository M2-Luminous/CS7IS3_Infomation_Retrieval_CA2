Speaking at a press conference in Belgrade, Draskovic compared o the agreement signed in Washington on March 18 on setting up a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and its subsequent confederation with Croatia with the Roosevelt-Stalin-Churchill verbal accord reached in Yalta fifty years ago. Draskovic, whose party is among the strongest opposition parties in both the federal and republican parliaments said he was against any kind of Yalta agreements and in favour of economic, cultural and some form of political reintegration of war-shattered former Yugoslavia. He said that Bosnian Serbs had the alternative to form some kind of federal ties with the Moslems and Croats, which would make Bosnia-Herzegovina a federation or an assymetrical federation of Serb, Croat and Moslem cantons. After Bosnian Moslems and Croats in early 1992 voted for Bosnia's secession from the former Yugoslav federation, Bosnian Serbs proclaimed their own republic in their ancestral lands in Bosnia- Herzegovina. Draskovic said the Serb cantons could enter into a confederation with Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) or join a Bosnian federation, in which case they would not have to cede so much of their territories. In the latter case, Yugoslavia could expect the lifting of international sanctions and the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) would establish trilateral ties with Croatia, the Serb cantons in Bosnia and with Yugoslavia. Moreover, he added, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia would then almost certainly form confederal ties with Yugoslavia. The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 in predominantly Serb-populated territories in Croatia in response to Croatia's violent secession from the former Yugoslav Federation. It was placed under U.N. control in March 1992.
