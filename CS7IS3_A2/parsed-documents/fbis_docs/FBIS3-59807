This use of terminiology suggests the fears and concerns engendered by the Islamic Movement (IM) in Israel. But the actual results in the Arab sector show that the IM actually got stronger. Its representatives climbed from 51 to 59, and the number of communities in which the movement has won representation rose from 14 to 16, including three mixed cities--Ramle, Lod, and 'Akko. In Rahat, the Beduin township in the Negev, the IM lost the council leadership; but in Kafr Kari, it won the top council spot. In Kafr Kana, the Islamic representative will rotate as head of the council for half a term. Generally, the public put its trust in IM representatives in those communities where the movement had already proven itself as an efficient and active municipal force. One of the movement's biggest achievements was getting residents involved in community functions by instilling the virture of "self-reliance." It replaced the old approach of dependency to an activistic approach that emphasized community members. In those communities where it has operated since 1989, the movement showed itself to be a well-organized and well-oiled mechanism. Its representatives operated in a pragmatic fashion, cooperating with various government agencies. So, after four years, the movement could boast the establishment of kindergardens, improved health service, more paved roads, new libraries, removal of alcohol, setting up drug clinics, lessening crime, and developing an independent basketball league and other sports activities. Nor did the IM operate only in the narrow municipal sense. It also demonstrated wide-ranging activities on a national scale, especially in the Committee of Arab Council Leaders. Shaykh Ra'id al-Salah, the mayor of Umm-al-Fahm, did not miss a meeting and initiated projects which he took the trouble to execute. At the same time, the IM undertook religious activities. Its municipal activities were carried out under "the Green Flag" (the color of Muhammad's banner) and the slogan: "Islam is the solution." The organization worked to deepen the religious cast of the Arab community by spreading the wearing of Islamic traditional clothing and the availability of religious literature. And the number of mosques in Israel grew dramatically from 80 in 1988 to 240 in 1993. Special effort was exerted in spreading the cultural-social message of the IM via educational institutions ranging from kindergardens to a college for religious law. Simultaneously, the IM led the battle to have properties of the Waqf (Islamic Religious Council) returned to Muslim control, succeeding where its opponents had failed over the years. It reawakened the religious conscience of the Muslims in Israel, tying the subject of the Waqf to the Muslim identity of Palestine. Since 1989, the IM projected support for the intifadah and its publications widely featured the activities of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], the Islamic force in the territories. The IM also sent food and clothing to Hamas and adopted 2,500 orphans from the territories. It led demonstrations protesting the expulsion last December of 415 Hamas activists, and demanded their return. In recent weeks, backers of Hamas have appeared prominently in the IM's weekly SAWT AL-HAQQ WAL-HURRIYAH (The Voice of Truth and Freedom), often appearing to be Hamas' mouthpiece. It has featured Khalid 'Amayun of Hebron, Fu'ad Shahin of Jenin, and Isma'il al-Jamal of Jericho. At the same time, the IM has strengthened its ties to Islamic forces in Egypt and elsewhere in the world. The 1993 municipal elections symbolize the coming of age, the political institutionalization, of the IM. It moved away from its earler image of an elite cadre that used only the purest of methods. Now it took off its gloves and got into the political arena with other political forces, forging political deals when needed. Also in the social sphere, the IM abandoned as illusory its original idea that it could form a new social context beyond the family and the clan group. Instead, it tried to work out some form of cooperation with these institutions, forming alliances with certain family clans in some localities. This was particularly true in Kafr Qasim where the clans were incorporated under the Islamic Alliance (al-Hilf al-Islami). It is important that the IM's leaders view their effors as successful and that they have long-term goals and much patience: al-Haqq, or divine justice and absolute truth, will win even if it takes years. And it is fair to say that the IM's future success will depend on several factors: - The IM will have to safeguard its own internal unity even as regional developments of other Islamic movements (in the territories, Egypt, North Africa, and Jordan) will have the impact on the IM in Israel. - The Arab community's ability to emerge from its post-Communist sense of crisis will be important. - The IM will continue to be measured by its record in the municipal sphere where other political forces have failed.
