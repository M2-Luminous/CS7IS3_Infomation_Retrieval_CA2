Even if it is merely symbolic, our troops are returning to our former lands. This time they are going there for a universal mission within the framework of international cooperation, as a peace force for the security of their brothers the Ottoman Empire was forced to leave behind. The Turks first set foot in the Balkans with an 18-month raid in 1321. The Ottoman conquest of the Balkans began when Suleyman Pasa crossed over to Rumelia. The United Christian Army tried to stop the Ottoman gains and to evict the Ottomans from the places they had taken. That Army was defeated by Turkish troops under the command of Sultan Murat I at the Kosovo Battle in 1389. After this Turkish victory, Serbia came under Ottoman rule. Despite all its efforts, Europe could not stop the Ottoman Empire from advancing. Sultan Yildirim Beyazit badly defeated a crusader army in Nikopol. After Sultan Mehmet II took Istanbul, the Ottoman conquests in the Balkans gained speed. In the end, the entire region became Turkish land. The Turkish advance in Europe stopped toward the end of the 17th century. With the Karlovac Treaty in 1699, the Ottoman Empire started to lose territories in the Balkans. Russia played the major role in these losses. These days, Russia, with Yeltsin, has become a place where big dreams are dreamt. Meanwhile, the West wants to see Moscow as a center of democracy following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin is implementing every reactionary attitude from Slav racism to exploiting the Orthodox Church for various advantages. He is destroying the Parliament with gunfire. He has the capability of obtaining an approval for the constitution he wants with coerced referendums. Yeltsin is turning towards the Balkans and the Caucasus. He is making use of every opportunity to have his say in the Middle East. Turkey is the one mostly concerned with Russia's expansionist desires and the danger which emerged with the Slav-Orthodox alliance. Turkey, which historically has suffered the most from Russia, should possess the military alliance, the political power, and the maneuvering capability to be able to prevent Moscow's expansionist moves. We also have a neighbor called Greece. Greece made antagonism toward Turkey part of its national identity. Athens is quick to support anybody who wants to harm Turkey. Athens is the devil's advocate in international forums where Turkey is being discussed. Greece is the one challenging Turkey by adding fuel to the fire where Cyprus is concerned and including it in its defense area. Greece is the one exploiting Turkey's southeast issue and embracing terrorism against Turkey. Greece is the one encouraging Serbian barbarism in the Balkans and undermining Ankara's peace efforts. Theodhoros Pangalos, Athens' European Union term president, criticized Europe's good relations with Turkey and made the following disrespectful statements: "The Turks are walking all over Europe with their blood-covered boots." Two powers emerged in the Balkans with the help our neighbors Athens and Moscow. On the one hand, Russia, Greece, and Serbia. On the other, Turkey, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Albania. Moscow placed its soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Turkey's request to send Turkish troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina was refused for a long time. Athens, especially, has done everything in its power to prevent Turkish troops from entering Bosnia-Herzegovina. But Athens did not have enough power. Turkey, with the support it has attained, can expand its successful initiatives in the Balkans by furthering relations in Macedonian and Albania. The Turkish soldier, who will arrive in Europe in the coming days, will have the opportunity to prove the importance of Turkey's presence in the Balkans as well as the significance of serving for peace in these lands where he has returned after all these years.
