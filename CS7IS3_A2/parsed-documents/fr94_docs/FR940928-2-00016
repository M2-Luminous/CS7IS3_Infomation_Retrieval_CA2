FR940928-2-00016 FR940928-2-00013 [Project No. 2347&hyph;001 Wisconsin] Wisconsin Power & Light Company; Notice of Availability of Final Environmental Assessment September 21, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380, the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for a subsequent license for the existing Janesville Central Hydroelectric Project, located on the Rock River in Rock County, Wisconsin, in the city of Janesville, and has prepared a final environmental assessment (EA) for the project. On April 25, 1994, staff issued and distributed to all parties a draft EA, and requested that comments on the draft EA be filed with the Commission within 30 days. Comments were filed by the city of Janesville and are addressed in the final EA. In the final EA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective or enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment. Copies of the final EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23916 Filed 9&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
