In Kuwait, he writes, President Saddam Husayn's challenge "represented everything that was unacceptable." Despite West Europe's past -- "and still present" -- tendency to capitulationism, in 1991 the United States, which was not "contaminated" by this virus, solved the problem in "exemplary military and political fashion," Sousa Tavares writes. Capitulationists, again upset when the United States decided to put an end to the Somali "reign of terror," "gloated" when U.S. and Pakistani peacekeepers lost their lives because their dire predictions were coming true, he continues. Now it is the turn of Bosnia, where after two years of "medieval barbarity and European cowardice" the United States and France forced the UN and NATO to act, according to Sousa Tavares. The same naysayers predicted that the ultimatum given to the Serbs would only "aggravate the situation," Sousa Tavares writes. In the end, Saddam Husayn was expelled from Kuwait and Iraq no longer is a threat to the world. Somali warlord Mohamed Aidid was contained and no Somalis are dying of hunger. Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic realized that his ethnic cleansing campaign would not be entirely tolerated and Sarajevo has not been shelled in recent weeks. The silence that those predicting disaster have kept over these facts proves the vacuity of their arguments, Sousa Tavares contends. Where diplomacy has failed and recourse to force may produce results, the international community should not hesitate to intervene. Whether it is termed the "right of humanitarian interference" or something else, "we must not resign ourselves to situations that are an insult to humanity," Sousa Tavares concludes.
