Generals Olusegun Obasanjo and Mohammadu Buhari charged Abacha with being the "biggest disciple, supporter, and principle beneficiary" of the "corrupt" former regime of General Ibrahim Babangida. By their silence, Nigerians were "accomplices" in the new military regime, the former heads of state added in an address Wednesday in the northern town of Kaduna. Government plans for a constitutional conference in the first half of the year were a "dangerous diversion," General Obasanjo said. Only a national conference, in which all elected representatives took part, would set Nigeria on a secure course for the future, he added. Obasanjo, president from 1976 to 1979, was one of the first military leaders in Africa to hand over power to a democratically elected head of state, President Shehu Shagari. In 1983, Shagari's regime, discredited by a series of political and economic scandals, was ousted by Buhari. President Abacha took power in August last year when he succeeded a short-lived civilian government which in turn had taken office after the eight-year regime of General Babangida. Babangida annulled the outcome of a long-awaited presidential poll last June which threatened to bring Moslem millionaire Moshood Abiola to power.
