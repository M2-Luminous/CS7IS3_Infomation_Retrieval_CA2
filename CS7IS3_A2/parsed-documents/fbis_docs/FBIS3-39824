They therefore want the pensioners to pay for the cost of unemployment. A major difference compared to us is that we want to maintain the law on the link between wages and benefits. If employment grows again, benefits and pensions can again follow wages. And if employment does not grow enough, we will, as has been the case for the last three years, employ other instruments to ensure that people on a minimum income -- and thus also pensioners -- can continue to keep in step with general trends in wages." "We have had a lot of crisis-like situations on this point. We have taken a lot of criticism for this. It was a big struggle every time in cabinet and it nearly tripped us up. In hindsight, I am very pleased that we did this. We do not just promise to do such things, we have shown that we actually do them." [NRC HANDELSBLAD] But the Central Plan Bureau forecasts that unemployment will grow so quickly the wage-benefit link will not be possible over the next four years. The CDA is simply drawing the consequences from this. [Woltgens] We have drawn up an election program in order to ensure that such forecasts are not proved correct. The CDA apparently does not believe in its own program which promises jobs but states in advance that unemployment will increase so much that people will not be able to count on benefits. Our aim is for employment to increase more than would be the case if policy remained unchanged. We hope to be creating 100,000 jobs a year as soon as possible. During the early years of this government we achieved this number at a time when economic growth which was lower than that forecast. Why can this not happen again ? [NRC HANDELSBAD] Are you not being too optimistic which means that soon -- just as previously with the Law on Labor Disability -- painful decisions will once again have to be taken ? [Woltgens] No political party -- including us -- is going to promise that purchasing power will remain the same. But you can say that you will spread job opportunities equally over all income groups. That is our point of departure, it is not that of the CDA. [NRC HANDELSBLAD] Your party leader, Kok, wants to take more from the middle and higher income groups in order to continue to fund pensions. Is that not the traditional response of the PvdA, placing the burden on the strongest shoulders, while at the same time attractiing middle income groups? [Woltgens] It is a very traditional reaction and one which must be maintained. But for the time being the crux of our approach to funding pensions is that the contributing base must be widened by increasing the number of people in employment. If we achieve this, the contribution can remain within the limits. We must remain the party of a fair deal. That is why we were founded. Where does this lead? To what we have tried over recent years, an evenly distributed growth in earnings. Not a leveling of earnings, as was formerly the aim, but no widening of the differences either. [NRC HANDELSBLAD] Your point of departure is always growing employment. Last Saturday in the NRC HANDELSBLAD your fellow party members -- Van der Zwan and Geelhied -- made a couple of recommendations in this connection, such as the formation of a national elite in order to convince the people of the need for a change. Do you agree with them? [Woltgens] Did you hear any concrete proposal from them? I understood that the elite would have the power to decide but what would this elite actually do? There is a certain menace in their words, but I don't see any practical proposals. I would like to know -- before we transfer power to this small group -- exactly what it is that they intend to do with it. [NRC HANDELSBLAD] Don't you take their analyses seriously? [Woltgens] I can understand the sense of urgency of Timmer, the head of Phillips, as his company must remain competitive with countries in East Asia, although one may wonder as to whether his tales of such a threat are not rather late. Japan has been present on the world stage since 1905. On the other hand, there is not going to be any international change, certainly not in the industrial pattern. We learned from the RSV [shipbuilding company that went bankrupt] affair that you cannot retain sectors which you must constantly subsidize. Market gardening cannot be kept alive with veiled subsidies in the form of lower gas prices. Not without reason some will move to regions where the sun provides free energy, to Morocco for example. I was therefore very surprised to hear Lubbers say this week in Bleiswijk that gas prices for market gardening could be reduced. Nobody can imagine that we can compete with wage costs in countries such as China. I was in China this year and noticed that the Chinese are in turn getting worried about competition from Vietnam. Between these two there is certainly a two-percent difference in labor costs for bicycle bells. We must concentrate on areas where we are in a better position, due to our location, training and experience. [NRC HANDELSBLAD] Does the desire for a new, common challenge appeal to you? [Woltgens] I am totally in favor of such a common goal but one which helps us return to full employment as quickly as possible. Everybody must concentrate on this. Our living standard, which was the focus of attention at last Saturday's meeting, and relative social equality are things to be proud of, although here and there we find the threat of dangerous ghetto situations developing. But the way in which we have organized our economy, the social cohesion and the limited number of strikes is just one of our comparative advantages. It is just eighteen months ago since people like Paul Kennedy and Lester Thurow offered up Europe as an example to the world economy. [NRC HANDELSBLAD] But since then our unemployment has increased, especially among lower income groups. [Woltgens] That is true, but since 1989 we have seen the significant phenomenon that unemployment among those most difficult to reintegrate, the long-term unemployed, decrease by 100,000. That is a quiet revolution. [NRC HANDELSBLAD] So it appears, but in fact the Netherlands has just included the long-term unemployed under the Law on Labor Disability figures. [Woltgens] That was true for the 1970s and 1980s, but not for recent years. The Law on Labor Disability system has changed so much that this is not so easy any more. [NRC HANDELSBLAD] The opinion polls do not indicate that the PvdA's message --- aimed at the lower income groups as is the case with the pension issue -- is getting across to the voter. [Woltgens] I am not in principle a great believer in opinion polls, which spares me from becoming annoyed, but I have the feeling that we have bottomed. And we still have a whole campaign before us.
