They occurred in the town of Machinta near the Liberia border and involved Tomas and Koniankes. It is not the first time the two groups are being at each other's throats and a lot of people are reported dead in the latest bloodshed. From Conakry, Foday Fofana telexed this report: A senior police officer told me this morning that he had received report that at least 30 people had already died in the ethnic clashes and many more had been wounded. He said that the situation in the town was explosive, but added that the area had been tense for the past six months and he had been expecting serious ethnic trouble in the town. The clashes have been between the Tomas and the Koniankes, who have been opposed to each other for a long time. The Koniankes had been mainly business people while the Tomas are mainly agriculturalists or civil servants. While the government had said that the clashes are not political, there is speculation that politics could be the cause. The Tomas are in the main supporters of President Lansana Conte, while the Koniankes are known to be supporters of the opposition leader, Alpha Conde. A senior government officer told me that the government is taking all necessary measures to maintain law and order in Machinta and its environment.
