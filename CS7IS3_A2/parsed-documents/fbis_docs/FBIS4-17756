True, this time the power workers switched off the knife switch because the communications industries have not been paying them, whom in turn the state has also not been paying. Our correspondent Vladimir Mishnev rang Anatoliy (Batyushkin), head of the Television and Radio Broadcasting Department of the Communications Ministry: [Begin recording] [Mishnev] Please tell us who must pay those bills. [(Batyushkin)] The communications enterprises. It has been decided to allocate funds for paying wages only to workers in communications enterprises for the first quarter. [Mishnev] It must be said that you do not have the money to pay the power workers. [(Batyushkin)] None at all. [Mishnev] And in such a situation what will happen now? [(Batyushkin)] Eventually there will be a natural withering away. [Mishnev] Please tell us whether the Finance Ministry is contemplating paying the arrears. [(Batyushkin)] The Finance Ministry says the following: Bring your broadcasting amount in accordance with the money that is being allocated under the budget. [Mishnev] So, the possibility is not ruled out that other transmitters will also be switched off? [(Batyushkin)] According to the results of work in the first quarter, the power workers should now have switched off virtually all TV and radio broadcasting. [Mishnev] Who is to decide whether the transmitters are to work? [(Batyushkin)] I believe only the government. [end recording] [Baburin] So that for the umpteenth time the prospect of reviving the old tradition of table-talk is beginning to loom before us. After all, following the radio receivers, TV sets could also be switched off. So, get ready to entertain one another by retelling Santa Barbara parts you have already watched, the others you might just not see.
