"We cannot stand to be defeated in a second opium war," Ma said, urging the government and people to help him fight the spread of drugs in Taiwan. In a meeting with 600 parolees at the Ministry of Justice, Ma warned that drug-related problems have become a serious menace to society in terms of economy and social order. Ma said in 1993 alone, 1,110 kilograms of heroin and 5,330 kilograms of amphetamine were seized by police. The record number of drug seizures has pushed the amount of heroin in government storehouses to more than 1,500 kilograms, he said. Among 150,000 criminals arrested last year, Ma said, nearly 50,000 were convicted of drug-related crimes. And there are now an estimated 100,000 drug users in Taiwan, up 70 percent over 1992 tallies, he noted. Of that number, he explained, the number of heroin addicts grew 130 percent over 1992 estimates, while the number of amphetamine addicts increased 54 percent. Ma criticized the government's lack of facilities for drug addicts, noting that there are only 150 beds for drug addicts in Taiwan hospitals. He also said the policy of imprisoning drug addicts is wrong, explaining that drug addicts should be treated as patients rather than criminals. The first opium war was sparked after a Ching dynasty (1644-1911) official destroyed more than 600 chests of Bengal opium imported into China by British merchants. The Ching lost the resulting three year war with Britian and was ordered to open five ports to foreign traders, pay 21 million yuan in indemnities to the British Government and allow the free import of opium. At the turn of the century, opium use was so widespread in China that seven of every 10 users of opium in the world were Chinese, Ma said.
