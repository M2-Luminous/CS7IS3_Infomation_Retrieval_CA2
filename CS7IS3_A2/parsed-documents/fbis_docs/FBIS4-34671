The candidate who headed the installation ceremony of the Consulting Board of the Mexican Foundation Cambio 21, Luis Donaldo Colosio, said that a political solution to the continuing conflict is the only answer. "The only road to peace is the political process." No progress, no true solution will be possible through violence. [quotation marks as published] Before approximately 50 councilmen assembled at the Museum of Mexico City, Zedillo said the political process is "the pluralistic, participative, and legitimate forum" to implement changes and to solve differences. Zedillo assured that democracy is the supreme value of the political process and that it is indispensable for Mexico's progress. "All economic progress, all social improvement can only last within a democratic framework." Zedillo noted that in the past years, electoral reforms have been fostered and that these reforms have allowed adaptation of legislation to society's requirements. He talked about the Senate's new configuration, the elimination of the clause of governalibilty in the Deputies Chamber, the "decisive presence" of citizens in the Federal Electoral Institute, as well as the establishment of ceilings for campaign spending. Nevertheless, he recognized that it is necessary to improve the system. "Democracy cannot be imposed by the government, by a political party, by an ideological current, or by a group. Above all, democracy cannot be imposed nor perfected by the use of violence or by appealing to measures outside the law or institutions." Zedillo emphasized that Mexico is a pluralistic society, expressed through a regime of parties with diverse visions, but, he added it is also a nation of laws and institutions. "Democracy is based on the enforcement of our state of law." The candidate added that Mexican democracy is strengthened by greater participation and the presence of its community and its organizations. "One of the challenges our party faces is to recognize and foster citizen participation, including those who say they are not active in any political party." "Political parties should encourage citizens and organizations to participate, however, citizens in turn should respect the multiparty activists and the functions the Constitution grants them as entities of public interest." Zedillo said it is necessary to progress toward the perfection of democracy through the internal strengthening of political organizations "to invigorate our electoral processes and to overcome abstentionism and skepticism." An important factor for democracy is dialogue." The conflict that emerged in Chiapas is a signal to the nation's conscience, Zedillo added. In Chiapas, we share in the responsibility to undertake serious social reforms to assure each family, each community, adequate living conditions and genuine opportunities for the well being of everyone." "It is our obligation to find a true and speedy resolution of economic and regional problems. We share in the desire for peace in Chiapas to be obtained quickly and with justice, based on a dialogue, understanding, and the best intentions of the parties involved in the conflict." "No true resolution will be possible through violence. A resolution will only be possible in a climate of peace, respect for the law, and constructive dialogue. This is why we reject the use of force. This is why we appeal that resolution to this conflict be sought through the political process, that the resolution to the Chiapas conflict be found through dialogue."
