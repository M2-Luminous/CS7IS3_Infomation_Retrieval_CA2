FR940916-2-00109 FR940916-2-00085 It is proposed that certain operative limitations as ESI, EOI, and system Fuels loans through the Money Pool be maintained. First, the aggregate amount of loans by ESI will never exceed an amount equal to the aggregate unused portion of credit then available under the ESI Loan Agreement and other credit arrangements hereafter entered into by ESI with Commission approval. Second, the aggregate amount of loans by EOI will never exceed an amount equal to the aggregate unused portion of credit then available under the EOI Loan Agreement and other credit arrangements hereafter entered into by EOI with Commission approval. Third, the aggregate amount of loans by SERI will never exceed the amount equal to the aggregate unused portion of credit then available to SERI under other credit arrangements hereafter entered into by SERI upon Commission approval with commercial banks or other entities. 1 1 See generally HCAR No. 24809 (Jan. 31, 1989), HCAR No. 25810 (Oct. 30, 1990), HCAR No. 25417 (Dec. 2, 1991), and HCAR No. 25909 (Oct. 15, 1993) (SERI-Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association credit agreement); HCAR No. 24957 (Sept. 27, 1989) and HCAR No. 25467 (Feb. 5, 1992) (System Fuels-Yasuda Trust & Banking Co. credit agreement); HCAR No. 26006 (March 16, 1994) (System Fuels-Entergy loan agreement). Some SERI credit arrangements require, in the absence of waivers, the Money Pool loans be subordinated indebtedness to the extent that, under certain circumstances_for example, a default under the credit arrangements_no remittance by SERI of principal or interest on Money Pool loans would be permitted until all obligations under such credit arrangements have been discharged. The System Fuels-Bank of America credit agreement requires that Money Pool loans be subordinated to the extent that, under certain circumstances_for example, a default under the credit agreement_no remittance by System Fuels, without the consent of Bank of America, of principal or interest on Money Pool loans would be permitted. ESI will invest funds not loaned to the Companies and will allocate the return on those investments to the Companies that provided the excess funds on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective interests in such funds. ESI proposes to invest the excess funds in securities permitted by Section 9(c) of the Act and Rule 40 thereunder. The Utilities and SERI, ESI, System Fuels, and EOI will be entitled to borrow an amount of the total funds available determined on the basis of an equal allocation of such funds among all Companies, except that where such an allocation would provide Companies funds in excess of their capital requirements, such excess will be available for loans allocated among the other Companies. To the extent that EOI, ESI, and System Fuels are permitted to borrow through the Money Pool, the funds available to EOI, ESI, and System Fuels will be allocated in the same manner. Companies that borrow will borrow pro rata from Companies that lend in the proportion that the total amount loaned by the Companies that lend bears to the total amount then loaned through the Money Pool. Loans from and investments through the Money Pool will be evidenced on the books of Companies that borrow from or invest in the Money Pool. Loans will be payable on demand, prepayable without premium, and will bear interest equal to the Daily Weighted Average Investment Rate. 2 However, if there are no excess Money Pool funds invested and thus no Weighted Average Investment Rate, then the loans will bear interest equal to the Daily Federal Funds Effective Rate quoted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 2 The Daily Weighted Average Investment Rate shall be the aggregate of the total interest payable on all investments in the Money Pool multiplied by 360 and then divided by the total amount invested in the Money Pool. It is believed that the cost of loans through the Money Pool will be less than the cost of external loans through banks and sales of commercial paper, and that the yield and terms available to Companies that invest in the Money Pool will be better than the yields otherwise available to the Companies, because there is no spread added to the cost of funds borrowed and because funds invested can be aggregated to command better terms. The Utilities and SERI might establish lines of credit with various local commercial banks (``Local Banks'') and with various non-local commercial banks (``Non-Local Banks'') on either an individual or a consolidated basis. The Utilities and SERI also propose to issue and see unsecured short-term notes payable within one year. The Utilities and SERI will select the interest rate for the notes from four options_(i) the prime commercial loan rate (``Prime Rate'') from time to tome in effect; (ii) the sum of specified offered rates for bank certificates of deposit and a margin not in excess of 2% per annum (``CD Rate''); (iii) the sum of specified rates offered for U.S. dollar deposits in the inter-bank euro-dollar market and a margin not in excess of 2% per annum (``LIBOR Rate''); and (iv) a negotiated rate not in excess of the Prime Rate (``Bid Rate''). The notes will, under certain circumstances and with the consent of the banks, be prepayable without premium (except in the case of the CD Rate or LIBOR Rate). The Utilities and SERI might agree to offer the banks a commitment fee not in excess of .025% per annum of the total unused portion of the lines of credit, to maintain balances in accounts with the Local Banks to yield the equivalent of .025%, or a combination of both.
