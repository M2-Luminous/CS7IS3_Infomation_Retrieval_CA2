By this act, the Greek side showed disrespect for the decision of the EC European Council at the Edinburgh Summit of 12 December 1992, according to which our country must be allowed a regular oil supply. Such unilateral and unacceptable measures applied by the Greek Government are of special concern because they are contrary to the UN Security Council resolution by which Macedonia and Greece are committed to overcome their differences through negotiations, with the mediation of the United Nations, and thus contribute to the promotion of peace and stability in the region. "The Republic of Macedonia had, and still has, a peaceful position regarding all events on the territory of former Yugoslavia, it is outside the war, and it has done its best to construct a democratic society and a market economy, to settle interethnic relations through dialogue and tolerance. As far as the dispute with Greece is concerned, it has demonstrated maximum flexibility and good will in solving the outstanding questions. This Macedonian attitude is known to the whole world. Macedonia succeeded in maintaining peace and stability in the country, thus becoming a factor of peace and stability in the region. "Therefore, at a time when the international community is involving great efforts for a peaceful and agreed solution of the most complicated problem, the stopping of the war in Bosnia included, it is a puzzle that Greece, a member of the United Nations, the CSCE, NATO, the European Council, and now current chairman of the European Union, undertakes such measures against our independent and peaceful country, contrary to International Law. The Greek Government is introducing them with the goal of applying economic, political, and other pressures against our country, using the fact that our country has no exit to the sea. "The Government of the Republic of Macedonia wishes to emphasize that great damage is being done to the lasting interests of the two countries and peoples, as well as to future mutual relations and cooperation, for which Greece is responsible. Contrary to that, Macedonia remains firm in its determination for good relations with all its neighbors, including its southern neighbor, and it is ready to resume the Macedonian-Greek dialogue. "The Government of the Republic of Macedonia will cautiously observe all the possible consequences of the Greek blockade, which has in no way been caused by the Macedonian side, and it will undertake all necessary measures and activities on the international plan in that regard."
