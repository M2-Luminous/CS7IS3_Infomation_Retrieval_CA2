Stanojevic: "In Favor of Full Equality"] [Excerpts] Vranje -- For those who are not so familiar with events in the extreme south of Serbia, the success of the coalition of two predominantly Albanian parties could be a surprise. The Party for Democratic Activity (PDD), and the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA), both based in Presevo, certainly made a wise move during the pre-election period by forming a coalition. In this way they prevented a further fragmentation of the Albanian electorate in the southern Serbian communes of Presevo, Bujanovac, and Medvedja, where these two parties are active. Having won almost 30,000 votes, this coalition has secured two seats in the future Serbian parliament. The candidates were Beljulj Jusufi and Tahir Dalipi. Who in fact are these two parties? The Party for Democratic Activity is headed by Riza Halimi, president of the Presevo commune. He was born in 1947 and graduated at the Scientific Mathematical Faculty. During the ideological and political purge of 1989 he was suspended from education. He later worked in the Dzevdet Doda Grammar School in Pristina. He had been a leading member of the party before he was elected president. The head of the Democratic Party of Albanians is Zecir Fazliu, biology teacher in the 15 May Grammar School in Presevo. He was born in the village of Zujnice in the Presevo commune in 1940. He left the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in 1969. He had been the director of the school in which he is now working, but was replaced before the end of his term of office. According to Halimi, the Party for Democratic Activity strives for a multi-party democratic system in which all citizens, as legal and political subjects, should be equal regardless of their nationality and confession, and in which the freedom and rights of people would be guaranteed by the Constitution and laws. [passage omitted] The program of the Democratic Party of Albanians promotes the full, true, and actual equality of Albanians in spheres of life where they live and work. At the same time, the party will work for the emancipation of women, the equality of man and women, the freedom of religion and worshiping, the promotion of one's own culture, national history, literature, folklore, and historical traditions.
