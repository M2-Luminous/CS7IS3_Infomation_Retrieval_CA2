On my own behalf, and in my capacity as the leader of the third party in the government coalition, I am pleased to thank His Majesty King Husayn for hosting this blessed gathering and this agreement. God willing, this will end the dispute and the crisis. It will enable all officials to return to their posts, so we can start working to implement this document and our government and parties' programs, so we can serve our country and free it from the economic and political crisis it is experiencing. We hope this gathering of ours will end the crisis and allow us to enter into a new age, the age of building, work, and cooperation, and loyalty to our dear homeland. Finally, I once again thank his majesty for hosting this agreement and for his efforts. God's blessings be upon you.
