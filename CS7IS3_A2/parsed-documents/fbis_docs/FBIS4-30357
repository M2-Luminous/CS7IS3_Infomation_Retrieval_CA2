The Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo) issued the appeal at a hastily held meeting of its five top officials. The Hosokawa cabinet, which resigned in April, comprised the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- of Japan], Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito (Clean Government Party], the Japan New Party, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), New Party Sakigake [Harbinger] and the now-defunct united Social Democratic Party. The SDP withdrew from the coalition in late April in protest at the formation of a parliamentary group by other coalition partners excluding the SDP, forcing Hata to form the first minority government in nearly four decades. Rengo is the main support base for both the SDP and the DSP. In the statement, Rengo urged Hata, SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, and if possible leaders of ruling coalition parties and the head of New Party Sakigake to hold a meeting to find a breakthrough to the political deadlock.
