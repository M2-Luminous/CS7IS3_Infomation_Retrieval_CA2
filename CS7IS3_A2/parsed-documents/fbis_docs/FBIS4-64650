He apparently had an important meeting with South Korea's defence minister in Germany, which stopped him attending the christening of the 30 billion pound project. His absence fuelled suspicion that his well-known scepticism about the Eurofighter remains undiminished. Certainly, his deputy, Mr Jorg Schoenbohm, waxed long about the responsibility of manufacturers to keep down the cost of the ambitious project, which aims to meet Europe's air defence needs for the next 20 years. Mr Schoenbohm was extremely cautious about committing Germany to the production phase of the aircraft. It was, he said, "a decision which requires very broad consensus and no decisions can be taken until after the (federal) elections" later this year. He added: "Eurofighter is not a monopoly supplier. Germany has other options." The Spanish minister, Mr Julian Garcia Vargas, also tempered his enthusiasm with warnings that "we must think very carefully before we spend every peseta". Perhaps Mr Ruhe simply stayed away to avoid the embarrassment of a grounded aircraft. It was a typically robust Lancashire spring day at British Aerospace's Warton airfield and officials grumbled all morning that wind might keep Europe's most expensive baby on the ground. But there was no need to worry. The aircraft took off on time and, after a number of passes over the field, came together with Tornado, Jaguar, Harrier and Hawk fighters in an impressive "diamond nine" close formation. All the tools of the marketing trade were there to help the Eurofighter on its way. In scenes which would have amazed the Spitfire's designers, straw boaters and smoke lasers and light shows filled the hangar. Some of the proud parents were unstinting in their praise. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, said that as well as developing technology and protecting jobs, Eurofighter would give pilots the confidence to tackle "any tasks we may ask them to undertake." The aircraft is intended to beat any fighter currently under design, apart from the U.S. F-22, which is much more expensive. At present, Europe has nothing decisively superior to the Russian Mig-20. The Italian minister, Mr Fabio Fabbri, was similarly enthusiastic, though all ministers shied away from revealing how many they would buy. Although political uncertainty continues, at least the technical capacity of the Eurofighter is becoming clear. The test pilots say it is a great success. While they continue with development work, they will have to hope that the politicians continue to agree.
