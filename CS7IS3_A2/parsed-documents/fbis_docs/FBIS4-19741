That is the only way the government's Asian trade concepts can be implemented. Until now, a stronger concentration of economic and political resources on Asia has never involved an increase in funds. As an introduction to the Asia-Pacific Conference of German Industry due to be held in Bangkok on 25-26 April, the seven working circles set up within APA have submitted a preliminary report on their work. On the subject of the "further development of foreign trade instruments," APA complains particularly about the case of China. Germany's foreign trade infrastructure vis-a-vis China, measured in terms of market potential and the ability to make use of it, leaves a lot to be desired, says APA. Despite their heavy commitment, German embassies and consulates are no longer able to offer proper services to enterprises involved in Chinese trade. Therefore, APA wants to see an expansion of the foreign trade structure in the PRC. As far as the other countries in this region are concerned, the foreign trade infrastructure in purely quantitative terms conforms more or less to requirements. However, APA notes a deficiency in cooperation between German diplomatic facilities on the one hand and foreign trade chambers and missions on the other. Cooperation between the federation and the laender in the foreign trade sphere also needs improvement. The Federation-Laender Committee obviously has only limited possibilities of effectively coordinating trade, says APA. Germany's politicians should be informed of foreign trade requirements more clearly and comprehensively. APA notes with interest that the Economics Ministry will be holding a hearing on the subject of German involvement in Asia-Pacific trade and that trade unions are also invited to it. APA wants to check whether the funds "that are generously available for East Europe but are not being utilized there" could be used for Asia-Pacific trade instead. There is also maneuvering space concerning development aid. According to APA circle dealing with "political support," this aid still offers opportunities to promote German business interests without neglecting development objectives. The training of work forces from the development countries is also considered expedient. APA also sees room for improvement in other areas of training. The personnel currently available for the Asia-Pacific region are either specialized in a specific country and language or they possess specific economic and technical qualifications. But what is required is a combination of both. Therefore APA wants to see enterprise personnel receive more practical training concerning all aspects of Asia, and a personnel policy that is geared more closely to this region. A data bank on existing educational possibilities, a list of criteria for Asia specialists, and a job placement service for this region are also desirable. To increase German involvement in Asia, APA wants to see additional "German Centers" erected in countries of key significance. These centers are an efficient way of providing the host country with a "clear and comprehensive picture of Germany's economic potential" and help German firms establish markets for their products. The Federal Government should, therefore, coordinate the establishment of such centers and provide the funds. A "Fund for the Development of German Centers Abroad" is also feasible. In addition, to promote German competitiveness in Asia, APA recommends the following: -- Harmonization of export control regulations concerning dual-use goods; -- Improvement of the Hermes mechanism; -- An investigation of the use of state consulting services in the acquisition of projects; -- Removal of competition barriers when financing exports within the framework of an OECD consensus; -- More national and international consortiums; -- More support for medium-sized industry; -- Faster European Union [EU] involvement in the development of the Asia-Pacific region. The APA circle responsible for matters concerning competition views Germany's duty presidency of the EU Council in the second half of 1994 as a good opportunity to present recommendations about harmonizing European regulations. APA has carried out a survey on business opportunities in selected countries (China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Thailand) to try and establish to what extent firms and investors are free to set up business there, what restrictions German firms might be exposed to, how these countries treat their own citizens who operate businesses, what kind of tariff and nontariff barriers there are to trade, and what kind of protection is offered to private property. The survey revealed that Japan, Taiwan, and Malaysia have the most liberal conditions. India, Indonesia, South Korea, and Thailand possess the greatest obstacles concerning access to their markets. APA wants to extend this survey to Vietnam and also include the sphere of taxation and finance. Information on access to all these markets should be available from the Association of German Industry and the East Asia Association. In addition, to make matters concerning the Asia-Pacific region clearer, the East Asia Association wants to publish informative literature on this region and organize a symposium in September entitled "Doing Business With Southeast Asia."
