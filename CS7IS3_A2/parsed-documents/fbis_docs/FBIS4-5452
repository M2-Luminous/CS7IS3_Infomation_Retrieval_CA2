He warned that relations between the two countries would deteriorate as in the past if his advice was not heeded. "I visited Laos this time through the Friendship Bridge. I would like the bridge to be the start of a new era of your performance and the new era of relations between Thailand and Laos," His Majesty told 200 Thais who were granted an audience before he left for Bangkok at the end of his two-day visit to Laos, his first foreign visit in almost 30 years. On their performance, His Majesty referred to the duty of all Thais to do their best to carry out their work as representatives of Thailand. This was his first remark on the bridge since he jointly presided over its formal opening with Laotian President Nouhak Phoumsavan on Friday. Most of the 200 Thais granted an audience by His Majesty were businessmen and industrialists. He told them their performance, which impresses Laotian officials and people, would enhance peace and security between the two countries. "If you do as suggested, you will be regarded as fulfilling your duty as a Thai," he said. "A detrimental performance will jeopardise peace and friendship between the two countries and will finally lead to a situation that you are unable to stay in this country," the King stressed. Good relations between the two peoples would pave the way for more Thais to visit Laos, he said. "Everybody here, regardless of your differences in background and objectives, must bear in mind a duty to promote friendship, to perform to impress Laotian officials and people and help Laos wherever needed," he said and cited his royally-sponsored projects which aim to improve the livelihood of Laotian people. "He called on Thai people in Laos to show to the world an example of living harmoniously and peacefully by the way they treat their Laotian counterparts. It will be an example to other regions which will be admired and which will bring about peace," he said. His Majesty ended his visit to Laos yesterday with the traditional Baisi well-wishing ceremony at Hokham, the presidential palace. Her Majesty the Queen and Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakkri Sirinthon and the Laotian president as well as Mrs. Bounma also attended the ceremony. The royal family later proceeded to Wattai Airport for their journey back to Bangkok. Earlier in the day, Their Majesties the King and Queen and the Princess visited Wat That Luang for a religious ceremony. They proceeded to a Royal orphanage sponsored by the Princess to donate sports equipment and educational materials. The royally sponsored orphanage is 67 kilometers north of Vientiane. It houses children orphaned by the war in Laos and also children from poor families. Princess Sirinthon sponsored this project since she first visited Laos in March 1990. She built a new dormitory with donations and used her own personal funds, about 350,000 baht, to build another dormitory, named Sirinthon Building.
