FR940202-2-00167 FR940202-2-00073 F. Section 103 HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 was published May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088) and became effective on June 12, 1991. That regulation, codified as 24 CFR part 4, applies to the funding competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement of the selection of successful applicants. HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815 (TDD/Voice). (This is not a toll-free number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well. However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed with persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Regional or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters counsel for the program to which the question pertains. G. Lobbying Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the Federal Register on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 22912). If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the rule. Any questions regarding the rule should be directed to the Director, Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815 (TDD/Voice). (This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office. H. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of Section 319 of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of federal contracts, grants or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that no federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.
