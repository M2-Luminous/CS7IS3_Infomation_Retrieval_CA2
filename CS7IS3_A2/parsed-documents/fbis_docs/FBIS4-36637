The source said: We are not surprised by such completely fabricated allegations and lies coming from 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ali al-Iryani, whose hostile positions toward the Kingdom have been known for a long time, and this is not the first time that al-Iryani has violated the truth. In fact, he has made similar statements and allusions several times in the past weeks. The source concluded his statement by saying: It is noteworthy that the picture conveyed to the custodian of the two holy mosques by Mr. Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the current mediator, from President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is completely different in spirit and substance from the statements of al-Iryani to whom, were it not for our eagerness to clarify facts about him for public opinion, we would not have given any importance.
