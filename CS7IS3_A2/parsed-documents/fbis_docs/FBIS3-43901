The decision was taken by the AVF on Tuesday, Dr Hartzenberg told a public meeting in Pretoria. Representatives of the Afrikaner volk [people] across the country would be invited to attend the occasion to sanction the body to plan and take decisions for the Afrikaner and to mandate it to "achieve our freedom before the April 27 elections", he said. Dr Hartzenberg said although the Freedom Alliance, the government and the African National Congress [ANC] would be meeting on Wednesday "we don't expect much to come from the talks". He added that it did not matter what they (the government and the ANC) decided, the Afrikaner was marching to freedom and self-determination. Dr Hartzenberg warned that the Afrikaner should not be forced to become the enemy of those who wanted to force an unjust dispensation on them. Accusing the media of trying to drive a wedge between him and AVF leader Constand Viljoen, Dr Hartzenberg said they had a "hearty" relationship. The implementation of the AVF's own transitional authority was proof that the Afrikaner was determinedly on the way to freedom and would not be ruled by the communist-dominated ANC, he said. Surveys showed the ANC would get most votes in seven of the nine provinces, which meant the Afrikaner would be dominated on central, provincial and local levels, he added. An Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] could still secure a peaceful solution "at this late hour" and amendments to the constitution could be made before the end of the month, Dr Hartzenberg said. A plebiscite could be held to determine who wanted to be included in the homeland. This could be completed in March so that elections could take place in the volkstaat while the rest of the people voted in the general elections, he said. In Pretoria, earmarked as the capital of the proposed volkstaat, more than half of the residents had indicated they wanted to be included in the volkstaat, he claimed. Dr Hartzenberg also called on the city's thousands of civil servants to make themselves available for the volkstaat because they had been "cheated" out of their job security and pensions by State President F W de Klerk. Pretoria City Council CP leader Paul Fouche called on supporters to a gathering at the downtown municipal offices on January 25 to protest against the new joint non-racial local government dispensation. Pamphlets would be distributed in Pretoria to call supporters to "drastic but non-violent" action to protest the 50/50 dispensation, he said.
