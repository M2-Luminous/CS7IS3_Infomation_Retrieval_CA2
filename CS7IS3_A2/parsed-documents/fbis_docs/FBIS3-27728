The House of Councillors started a full session at 10 AM, kicking off the Japanese parliament's 150-day term that ends June 29. The House of Representatives begins its full session at 2 PM. The regular Diet session will immediately go into recess, probably until February 8, to allow the coalition government to map out a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and the fiscal 1994 budget. Hosokawa, fresh from a tough but successful battle over political reform bills, will find his hands full with a long list of tasks, including a summit meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on February 11 and a new economic stimulus package worth about 15 trillion yen, official sources said. The pump-primer package will contain an income tax reduction of some 6 trillion yen, which will become part of the fiscal 1994 budget program starting April 1, the sources said. Hosokawa's policy address to both houses of the Diet will be delayed at least until late February, making it increasingly difficult for the Hosokawa cabinet to win parliamentary passage of the fiscal 1994 budget before the end of the current fiscal year March 31, the sources said. Under that pessimistic scenario, the sources said, Hosokawa has to fashion a provisional budget program to keep the government running, in addition to the current fiscal year's third supplementary budget to help lift the economy out of its worst postwar recession. At about the same time, his coalition government has to work with the primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to modify the political reform legislation which barely passed the Diet on Saturday, the final day of the extraordinary session, coalition lawmakers acknowledged. The controversial legislation calls for replacing the 511 multiseat constituencies for the powerful lower house with a combination of 300 single-seat electoral districts and 200 proportional representation seats. It also provides a single fund-raising organization for each politician to solicit donations from businesses and other groups. Backed by veteran back room strategist Ichiro Ozawa, Hosokawa managed to broker the political reform deal with LDP President Yohei Kono in what critics called a "dango" or big-rigging fashion. The Finance Ministry, under pressure at home and abroad to take more effective economic stimulus measures, will unveil its fiscal 1994 budget program and the government will formally decide on its fiscal 1994 budget around February 15 after some modifications, officials said. Additionally, the officials said, the Hosokawa government will submit to the Diet the current fiscal year's third supplementary budget program aimed at buoying the stagnant domestic economy.
