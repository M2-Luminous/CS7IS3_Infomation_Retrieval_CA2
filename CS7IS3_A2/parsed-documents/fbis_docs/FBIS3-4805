Hosokawa made the remark to reporters following a series of separate meetings with coalition party leaders to seek agreement on his plan to shake up the cabinet. The prime minister also hinted at pushing for the reshuffle even if coalition partners remain divided over the matter, saying "it is very difficult for all the coalition parties to see eye-to-eye (on the issue)." Hosokawa said a cabinet shake-up without receiving full consent from each of the coalition partners is "theoretically possible." The primary purpose of the cabinet reorganization is widely believed to be the replacement of Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, top governmental spokesman and chief of staff, who has been at odds with Hosokawa over several of the government's important policy themes. Takemura told Hosokawa in a meeting that a cabinet reshuffle could lead to the collapse of the coalition government, sources said. Takemura maintains he will not take another cabinet post if Hosokawa changes his cabinet, the sources said. The sources said the two men also have not seen eye-to-eye over the course of the seven-party coalition, with Hosokawa favoring closer ties with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito and Takemura against it. Among the seven coalition parties, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and the Sakigake (Harbinger) headed by Takemura are opposed to an early cabinet reshuffle, while Shinseito and Komeito are endorsing the premier's plan. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama asked Hosokawa to drop his intention for an early shake-up, saying he spoke of the need for the cabinet to be united to tackle economic issues and expressed his objection to Hosokawa's plan. Hosokawa explained he wanted to focus on pressing economic issues such as strained trade ties with the U.S. and economic deregulation and sought the SDP's cooperation, Murayama said. Murayama reiterated that the government must concentrate on passing the fiscal 1994 state budget as early as possible as a way to breathe life into the ailing Japanese economy. DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi also expressed his opposition to a hasty cabinet reshuffle at a meeting with Hosokawa. Ouchi told reporters he called on Hosokawa to discuss the fate of Takemura. Hosokawa also cited as a major reason for the plan growing complaints within the ruling coalition and from bureaucrats about Takemura's work as the top government spokesman and chief policy coordinator, said Ouchi who serves as health and welfare minister. Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata, meanwhile, told Hosokawa that the party will suport the scheme to reshape the cabinet. Hata, who serves as foreign minster and deputy prime minister, said he notified Hosokawa of his backing in a meeting at the premier's official residence. "Behind the premier's plan is his desire to run the cabinet more smoothly." We support that kind of notion," said Hata who heads the core party in the alliance along with Ichiro Ozawa, a chief coalition strategist.
