The country carried out a large-scale trial examination last year which covered more than 9,400 enterprises and about 825,000 administrations and institutions. Finance Minister Liu Zhongli told a national working conference that through squaring accounts, over nine billion yuan in state- owned assets were found to have been excluded from accounts of the enterprises, and 144 billion yuan from the books of governmental administrations. Liu said that besides presenting a rough understanding of the present status of state-owned assets and problems existing in management of the assets, last year's work has also helped define ownership of some state enterprises. About 1.77 billion yuan in state-owned assets which have long been diverted to collectively-owned enterprises have been sorted out. More than 24.7 billion yuan in enterprise investments in other trades have been rechecked or recovered. After the audit, Liu said, fixed assets in the 9,400-plus enterprises were revalued at 42 percent higher than before, showing a total revaluation volume of 180 billion yuan. He pledged that the examination of state-owned assets will continue this year. The coverage will still be limited to 10,000 enterprises. According to the finance minister, enterprises involved will include the 1,000 enterprises chosen to undertake the tests of a new supervision mechanism, and the 100 large and medium-sized state- owned enterprises chosen to establish a modern enterprise system. Some enterprises which will have their ownerships transferred and some key large and medium-sized state enterprises which need solid support will be also included.
