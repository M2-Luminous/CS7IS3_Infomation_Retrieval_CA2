President Frei thus responded to a journalist's question at the Valparaiso City Hall where he attended a meeting of regional officials and Regional Council members. He said: "President Clinton, his advisers, and I will meet for about one hour to discuss several issues. We will have lunch and participate in other activities." Frei said: "This is a short trip during which we will hold a working meeting. I believe it is very positive for Chile because we will be able to discuss all issues pertaining to bilateral ties." Frei noted that last March, when Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa met with the U.S. assistant secretary [not further identified], "we explained our position regarding bilateral ties with the United States. We have a vast agenda on all issues of interest to our two countries. This meeting will help to expand on these issues." Frei added: "For us and for Chile (this meeting) is an event of great satisfaction because we will be able to visualize our national agenda for the next few years and the summit summoned by President Clinton. We will be able to express our opinion, which to some extent means explaining our personal view of Chile and Latin America to the most powerful country on Earth. The fact that Chile and its president have been invited is extraordinarily positive. It speaks highly of Chile, of the political process, of the development our country has achieved at all levels -- at the economic, social and political level. We are very happy with this trip." Asked if the agenda includes Chile's joining NAFTA, Frei said: "NAFTA is one of the subjects we will discuss. It is on the agenda."
