Many Azerbaijanis say that "the republic's authorities are unable to withstand the tough pressure from the Russian generals and have been forced to agree in principle to the fulfillment of their demands." Azerbaijan today is the only CIS republic with no Russian troops on its territory, aside from the small number of specialists serving the Gabalinskaya radar station. The last Russian Army units peacefully and freely left Azerbaijan in early 1993. This event, which took place during the presidency of Abulfaz Elchibey, is regarded by his People's Front comrades in arms as one of their main achievements. How did they succeed in reaching agreement with Moscow? This is still a mystery to many people. At the same time most observers note some inconsistency on the part of the Russian leadership. Having completed the hasty redeployment of its troops from Azerbaijan to the North Caucasus a year ago, today Moscow is seeking opportunities to bring them back. "Officially Russia has made no such proposal to us," Gasan Gasanov, head of the republic's foreign policy department, told IZVESTIYA. President Heydar Aliyev was also categorical about this: "So long as I am head of Azerbaijan, there will be no foreign bases on the republic's territory." The situation with regard to peacemaking forces is rather different. Russia, so an informed source from the republic's Foreign Ministry told IZVESTIYA, is pressing for exclusively its own military subunits to take part in the process of settling the conflict in the mountain part of Karabakh under the auspices of international organizations. But Azerbaijan, displaying natural caution, is proposing that a mixed contingent of CSCE or UN peacemaking forces be stationed along the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani border. While politicians are seeking mutually acceptable solutions, opposition forces in the republic have intimated that they will not tolerate the return of Russian soldiers to Azerbaijan in any form. "The very fact that this issue has been raised is fraught with great danger to the republic's sovereignty and independence," the People's Front has stated. The "Musavat" party, headed by Isa Gambar, former speaker in the republic's parliament, holds a similar view. "Moreover," Etibar Mamedov, leader of the National Independence Party, the most influential opposition party, stressed in conversation with your IZVESTIYA correspondent, "I would not envy the republic leader who ventured to take the responsibility of turning Azerbaijan into a military test range for any foreign state. He would be bound to be held in general contempt."
