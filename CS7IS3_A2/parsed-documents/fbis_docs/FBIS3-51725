FBIS3-51725 "drlat016__a94009" FBIS-LAT-94-016-A Document Type:Daily Report 25 January 1994 ANNEX Belize Castro's Invitation to Collor `Dipleases' President Franco PY2201190794 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 22 Jan 94 p 16--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY2201190794 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Language: Portuguese Article Type:BFN [Article by Luiz Orlando Carneiro from Brasilia] [Text] Cuban President Fidel Castro's invitation to former Brazilian President Fernando Collor to spend a few days in Varadero, a Cuban sea resort, has displeased Brazilian President Itamar Franco and has taken Itamaraty [Brazilian Foreign Ministry] by surprise. It is possible that Franco will eliminate from his agenda a meeting with Cuban Vice President [title as published] Carlos Lage Davila, who will be officially visiting Brazil 2-7 February. Cuban Ambassador to Brazil Jorge Bolanos went to Itamaraty on 21 January and told Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim that Castro's invitation to Fernando Collor was strictly personal. According to Itamaraty spokesman Luiz Fernando Benedini, the meeting between Minister Amorim and the Cuban ambassador had been scheduled in advance. Benedini denied that the ambassador had been summoned for an explanation. The spokesman refused to comment on behalf of the minister on the possible displeasure that Castro's invitation to Brazil's former president, found guilty of malfeasance in office, may have caused. According to information on hand, the former president was supposed to go to Cuba as part of a business delegation together with his old friend, businessman Luiz Estevao. Collor was reportedly invited to stay at the official guest house in Varadero where his former wife Lilibeth Monteiro de Carvalho and his children Arnon Affonso and Joaquim Pedro have stayed in the past. The trip of the business delegation was postponed because the health of Luiz Estevao's father took a turn for the worse, but Collor confirmed that he plans to spend a few days in Cuba. Fidel Castro -- who still maintains a personal relationship with the former Brazilian president -- was unable to withdraw his earlier invitation. Vice President Carlos Lage's official visit to Brazil had been arranged some time ago. Lage's agenda includes meetings with President Franco, Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and Health Minister Henrique Santillo. [Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese on 21 January on page A6 carries a 200-word report noting that "on 22 January Collor will be boarding a plane for Cuba, the first leg of a 30-day vacation. Collor, who is traveling with his wife Rosane, will visit Cuba, then go to Paris and end up in the Cap Ferrat resort in France."]
