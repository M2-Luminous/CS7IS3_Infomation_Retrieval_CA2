He was the force behind many of Mr. Yeltsin's early economic reforms and is still a leading member of the Russian parliament. I started by asking him what signal he felt the amnesty was giving. [Gaydar] It's a very, very bad signal for the Russian public opinion. When people who had committed this type of activities were being free again for the activity, it is a very serious signs that the state is weak, that the criminals could proceed with this type of subversive activities. It is of course very bad signal for their supporters. I am almost sure that they will try to organize once again their provocation in Moscow during the spring, or the autumn of the year 94. [Snow] Where do you think that will lead? [Gaydar] I think that it will lead to the intensification of the social and political conflict, and I could not exclude the possibilities of a very drastic confrontation like we have seen, for instance, in October of the year 93, or in August of the year 91 in Moscow. [Snow] Therefore do you think that Mr. Yeltsin is responding correctly to what is happening? [Gaydar] Well, Mr. Yeltsin's possibilities under Constitution are limited. Parliament generally is in its own rights. This decision does not need the confirmation of the president, or upper chamber. But of course this solution is very, very serious threat to the stability of the country and I think that the president will take it in mind. [Snow] But then that means that the man that you were serving right up until five weeks ago is himself now in a very, very weak position. He has a parliament that is against him, that is allowing still more of his enemies out into free circulation, and the outlook for his own survival must not be good. [Gaydar] Well, of course, the position of the president are much stronger than they were for instance in September of the year 93. Now he has constitutional rights that clarifies very definitely his possibilities with dealings with internal policies. Except the amnesty, the rights of Duma to act without the agreement of the president are rather limited. Of course we are in a very difficult political situation, but if you compare for instance with the situation of September of the year 93, I would not agree with the fact that it's more difficult. [Snow] If that internal battle does express itself in civil war, how will the forces be arrayed? How do you see this awful conflict mapping out? [Gaydar] Well, to tell you truth, during my two-year political career, I never answered a question with an if included in it. [Snow] Nevertheless you've had to put your neck out a little today, by saying that you are so concerned about what happened yesterday that you do foresee serious conflict? [Gaydar] Well, I mean that the risk that internal political struggle in Russia will not be held in the limits of the existing democratic Constitution, from my point of view, seriously increased after the yesterday solution of the parliament. [Snow] And that leaves Mr. Yeltsin, and people like yourself who believe in reform on one side, and perhaps, Zhirinovskiy and those people who have been in jail teaming up together? [Gaydar] I couldn't exclude it absolutely. You have seen yesterday, the big parliamentary coalition which supported this solution. This coalition included the forces from Zhirinovskiy to the communists to the factions that previously were regarded as the centrists, and of course I could not exclude the possibilities that this will be the real line of the division in the political battles in Russia during the year 94-95. [Snow] What should the West's reaction be? Simply go on putting more money in where necessary, or should we be taking some other stance? [Gaydar] Well, first of all, let us understand very clearly that it is the Russian internal affairs. And the possibilities of the West to influence the events are rather limited. It is first of all our internal battle and we will have to fight it first of all ourselves.
