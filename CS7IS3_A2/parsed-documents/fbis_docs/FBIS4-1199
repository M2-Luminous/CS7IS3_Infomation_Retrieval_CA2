The IEC's media officer in Bloemfontein, Mr. Rob Hadley, said that requests for meetings with the Viljoenskroon town council yesterday and today had proved fruitless and that the IEC had consequently asked the defense force to patrol the streets of the town on Wednesday and Thursday. He said the watchtowers were the subject of an investigation into alleged acts of intimidation by the Viljoenskroon town council.
