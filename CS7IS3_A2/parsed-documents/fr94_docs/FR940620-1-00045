FR940620-1-00045 FR940620-1-00009 (c) Subsequent to contract award, to clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'', permits a contractor, under certain conditions, to make additional assertions of use, release, or disclosure restrictions. The prescription for the use of that clause and its alternate is at 227.403&hyph;6(a). 227.403&hyph;4 License rights. (a) Grant of license . The Government obtains rights in technical data, including a copyright license, under an irrevocable license granted or obtained for the Government by the contractor. The contractor or licensor retains all rights in the data not granted to the Government. For technical data that pertain to items, components, or processes, the scope of the license is generally determined by the source of funds used to develop the item, component, or process. When the technical data do not pertain to items, components, or processes, the scope of the license is determined by the source of funds used to create the data. (1) Technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes . Contractors or licensors may, with some exceptions (see 227.403&hyph;5(a)(2) and (a) (4) through (9)), restrict the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense (limited rights). They may not restrict the Government's rights in items, components, or processes developed exclusively at Government expense (unlimited rights) without the Government's approval. When an item, component, or process is developed with mixed funding, the Government may use, release, or disclose the data pertaining to such items, components, or processes within the Government without restriction but may release or disclose the data outside the Government only for Government purposes (government purpose rights). (2) Technical data that do not pertain to items, components, or processes . Technical data may be created during the performance of a contract for a conceptual design or similar effort that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components or processes. The Government generally obtains unlimited rights in such data when the data were created exclusively with Government funds, government purpose rights when the data were created with mixed funding, and limited rights when the data was created exclusively at private expense. (b) Source of funds determination . The determination of the source of development funds for technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes should be made at any practical sub-item or sub-component level or for any segregable portion of a process. Contractors may assert limited rights in a segregable sub-item, sub-component, or portion of a process which otherwise qualifies for limited rights under the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data.'' 227.403&hyph;5 Government rights. The standard license rights that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government purpose rights, or limited rights. Those rights are defined in the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013. In unusual situations, the standard rights may not satisfy the Government's needs or the Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in data in return for other consideration. In those cases, a special license may be negotiated. However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the Government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than the rights provided in the standard grant of license. The situations under which a particular grant of license applies are enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection. (a) Unlimited rights . The Government obtains unlimited rights in technical data that are_ (1) Data pertaining to an item, component, or process which has been or will be developed exclusively with Government funds;
