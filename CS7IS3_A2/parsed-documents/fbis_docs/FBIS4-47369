V. Osipova; UDC 528.27] [Abstract] Among the principal fundamental physical constants it is the Newton gravitational constant G which is least precisely determined. The other constants are known with an error not greater than 1 x 10[.sup]-6[/], but the most optimistic estimate of the error in determining G is 1 x 10[.sup]-4[/]. Despite the innumerable studies of G, there is still no explanation for the strong discrepancies between the results of multiple determinations of G even with repeated determinations by the same experimental method. In an attempt to introduce clarity into this problem, an analysis was made of the constraints on a theoretical model of representation of the relative motion of trial gravitationally interacting bodies on an artificial satellite which result in a low systematic error level and provide a possibility for refining the gravitational constant from measurements of the relative motion by two orders of magnitude. Constraints related to the neglecting in the theoretical model of relativistic corrections to the description of the Earth's gravity field, neglecting of the zonal harmonics of expansion of the Earth's gravitational potential beginning with a harmonic of some particular number and influence of lunar and solar tidal potentials are examined. The results clearly indicate that considerable discrepancies in the results of large series of G determinations in surface laboratory experiments may occur as a result of the inadequacy of the used theoretical model.
