[Ioseliani] Relatively normally. The main thing is that the world public and Russia are on our side. The fact that we are right in this matter is recognized by everyone. The Abkhazian side was constantly balking by clinging to unsubstantiated facts, as a result of which the negotiations were almost suspended. Judge for yourself: They submitted the most stupid conditions regarding the question of refugees -- that we take back only women, old men, children, and those men who did not take part in the fighting. In short, the Abkhazians conducted themselves in an uncertain manner, evidently realizing that their position was not right. Their fanaticism is the first sign of their lack of confidence. A fitting role was played by the UN, CSCE, and U.S. representatives who advised the Abkhazian side to behave more sensibly and not to pin their hopes on the world recognizing Abkhazia as a separate state from Georgia. In this way, the communique, which suited us and corresponded to the interests of Georgia, was signed. However, the Abkhazians called the methods ostensibly used to force them into signing this document "Beria-type methods." In answer to this, I told a joke, reminding them of the famous Abkhazian dramatist who, unfortunately, had not managed to write anything as he had been shot in 1937 by Lavrentiy Pavlovich [Beria]. [Nizharadze]However, the view is being expressed that the second round of talks in Geneva ended in complete failure for the Georgian side.... [Ioseliani] This is not how I view it. The talks were productive. The return of refugees to Gali rayon is to begin already on 10 February. This will be the first stage, following which refugees will return to the other rayons of Abkhazia. There will be complete disarmament and the withdrawal of all kinds of voluntary formations and individuals who went there to take part in the conflict, and so forth. I would advise those who think that we suffered a fiasco at the talks not to make such statements and draw such hasty conclusions. [Nizharadze]What can you say about Russia's position at the second round of the negotiations? [Ioseliani] That Russia undoubtedly feels its guilt and is trying in every way to make amends. Naturally, the Russians have got what they wanted: They will put on blue helmets and will fulfill the role of peacekeepers, not forgetting the fact that the peacekeeping forces are financed by the UN. [Nizharadze]During your absence, the decision was adopted to disarm the "Mkhedrioni." How did you react to this and is there any truth in the rumors that the "Mkhedrioni" intends to re-elect its commander? [Ioseliani] Let it disarm. If this proves beneficial and helps to improve the criminal situation in the republic, we are ready to obey and submit to this decision. The weapons will be kept in a safe place and, if it becomes necessary, we will again arm ourselves. Of course, it's a pity. The "Mkhedrioni" has been fighting for four years now; during this time, we have lost 632 fighters and about 1,000 have been wounded. Probably the time has now come for the police to take over; they have been taking cover somewhere and are now swaggering about and dictating to us how we should behave. This is the law of life. This is what happened to the famous English Prime Minister Churchill who was not re-elected after the war because, as they put it: The war is over. Why do we now need Churchill? As regards my re-election, I would be glad if this happened. However, these are rumors, as are the claims that I have headed off to Austria with a 24 year-old girl in tow.
