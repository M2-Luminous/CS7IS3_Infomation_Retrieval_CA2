The letter says: A ferocious offensive on Maglaj has been going on for days now. The situation is deteriorating by the hour due to the employment of the heavy artillery the Serb aggressor withdrew from around Sarajevo. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has done and is doing everything it possibly can to rescue the town and its residents. Our defenses are flagging due to the enemy's technical superiority. Thousands of civilians -- mostly women and children -- are facing a fresh massacre. We are demanding urgent action on the part of the United Nations to forestall genocide, President Izetbegovic's letter says.
