It says: "Sufficiently close contacts exist between Russia and the United States to raise any questions. As has been announced, the investigation into the Ames case was going on for 10 months. We suggest that this was sufficient time for us to be contacted directly and for them to share their anxieties with us before making them public. "We are opposed to the attempts by the special services to drag the political leadership into their mutual relations. The appropriate channels are there. And they can be fully brought into use. "The political consequences of this story give cause for concern. Our partnership has withstood a series of serious tests, the latest one arising from the crisis around Sarajevo. We shall cope with this misunderstanding, too. However there are circles in the United States, just as there are, incidentally, in Russia, who are not interested in friendship between the two major powers. They became noticeably active after the successful summit in Moscow, at which a solution was made to bring relations between Russia and the United States to the stage of mature strategic partnership. We reaffirm yet again that within the framework of this course it is possible to find an appropriate solution to this situation, too."
