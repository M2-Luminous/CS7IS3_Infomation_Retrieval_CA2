UDF President Mr. Justus Garoeb yesterday confirmed to DIE REPUBLIKEIN that he is personally in charge of the investigation and that "there will be trouble" if a UDF member turns out to be the source of the information. In a news release Mr. Garoeb also confirmed the UDF's involvement, as stated in the release, in the preliminary negotiations with opposition parties in the National Assembly concerning the formation of a new political coalition and the reaching of election agreements. He stated that the formation of a coalition and cooperation agreements is a normal occurrence in a democratic system and declared that the latest negotiations between opposition parties is nothing strange or exceptional. "We are, however, deeply concerned about the deliberate and untimely leakage of official documents to the press at this sensitive stage of negotiations on coalition. These actions are highly irresponsible." [passage omitted] He did not want to comment further on the establishment of the planned coalition since he did not have a mandate to release information to the media. According to him the launching committee on coalition, under the leadership of Mr. Che Ngaringombe, was responsible for ironing out "hitches" between participating parties and will report to the leaders of the various parties "as soon as possible". Some of the parties, such as the UDF, will discuss the issue with their respective Central Committees before any decision is taken on the planned coalition. According to him the "hitches" include, among other things, the usual administrative details between the various parties such as the proposed name and motto of such a coalition. Mr. Garoeb also did not want to comment on a list noting names and portfolios of the proposed coalition, which was released to DIE REPUBLIKEIN by sources in the launching committee. According to the document the coalition will be known as the Democratic Coalition of Parties with Mr. Garoeb as president, Mr. Moses Katjiuongua, of the NPF [National Patriotic Front], and Mr. Hans Diergaardt of the Rehoboth Free [Democratic Party], as vice presidents; Mr. Gerson Veii of SWANU [South-West Africa National Union], chairman, and Mr. Kephes Conradie of the FCN [Federal Convention for Namibia], secretary general. The members of the politburo are: Mr. Peter Kayser of the German Action, Mr. Allen Liebenberg, a Mrs. du Plessis, Mr. Oiva Angula, Mr. Hans Peters, Mr. Eric Biwa, and Mr. Gabriel Sisehe, all of the UDF.
