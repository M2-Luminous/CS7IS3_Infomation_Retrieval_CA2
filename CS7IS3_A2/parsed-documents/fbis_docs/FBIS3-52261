He has made it clear that these thefts led to sabotaging all roads and bridges of the area because of the lack of maintenance and the region changed into a scene of only the phenomena of sabotage, ruin and destruction. He made it clear that the Kurdish citizen was now holding comparison between the state of construction the region had been seeing for twenty years under the July 17 revolution and the state of devastation and destruction to which the region had been exposed in two years at the hands of the agents and mercenaries. Secretary-General of Works and Housing in the Autonomy Region called on the citizens there to shoulder their responsibility and to stand up to the agent groups that were trying to destroy the Iraqi Kurds gains.
