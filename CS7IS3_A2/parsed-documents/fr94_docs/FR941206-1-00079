FR941206-1-00079 FR941206-1-00007 F. Pollution Prevention Considerations The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 establishes the following environmental management hierarchy as national policy: 1. Pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source wherever feasible; 2. Pollution that cannot be prevented should be recycled in an environmentally safe manner wherever feasible; 3. Pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled should be treated in an environmentally safe manner wherever feasible; and 4. Disposal or other release into the environment should be employed only as a last resort and should be conducted in an environmentally safe manner. The Pollution Prevention Act considers ``source reduction'' a fundamental aspect of pollution prevention. Source reduction is any practice that reduces the amount of any hazardous substance entering the waste stream or otherwise released into the environment prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal. Practices such as recycling, energy recovery, treatment, and disposal are not considered pollution prevention measures under the Pollution Prevention Act. As noted above, however, recycling conducted in an environmentally safe manner is still desirable. The proposed rule not only encourages pollution prevention, but even requires certain pollution prevention measures. By expressing the proposed emission limit for finishing operations in terms of kg VHAP/kg solids (lb VHAP/lb solids), sources are encouraged to reduce the quantity of HAP through reformulation measures. Likewise, the emission limits for cleaning and gluing operations limit VOC or HAP content and sources will likely comply by using reformulated materials. The proposed rule allows sources to comply with emission limits through other means such as control devices, which would not be pollution prevention. The proposed work practices, however, ensure that pollution prevention measures will be implemented at all major sources using HAP for finishing, gluing, cleaning, or washoff operations. Source reduction of HAP from finishing operations is achieved by prohibiting the use of conventional air spray guns except in limited situations. As previously described, application equipment with a higher transfer efficiency than conventional air guns will result in lower air emissions and reduced solid waste. Training operators in proper application techniques, cleaning and washoff procedures, and waste management will reduce emissions from finishing, cleaning, gluing, and washoff operations. Source reduction of HAP from cleaning operations is achieved by prohibiting the use of solvent for spray booth cleaning except in limited situations. Finally, although it cannot be assumed that it will actually result in source reduction, the cleaning and washoff solvent accounting system may prompt facilities to eliminate inefficient uses of solvent. G. Selection of Compliance and Monitoring Requirements During the regulatory negotiation, the Committee discussed general compliance measures; e.g., that compliance would be achieved through recordkeeping and reporting, the frequency of reporting, and the averaging time for compliance for a source choosing to use an averaging approach to meet the finishing material emission limits. After the regulatory negotiation, the Agency included the general concepts agreed to by the Committee into a regulatory framework that would also fulfill the requirements of the amended Act. For a rule to be effective, an owner or operator of an affected source must demonstrate both initial and continuous compliance. The initial and continuous compliance measures included in the proposed rule account for situations in which either a control device or compliant finishing materials, adhesives, and cleaning materials are used. (See Table 5 for a summary of the proposed compliance and monitoring requirements.) In this industry, it is likely that the majority of sources will use compliant materials to comply with the proposed emission limits; control devices are likely to be used in limited situations.
