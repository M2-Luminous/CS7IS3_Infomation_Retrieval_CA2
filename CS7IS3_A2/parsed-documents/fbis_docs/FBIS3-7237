Following recent talks with U.S. and Chinese leaders, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa again pledged to ROK President Kim Yong-sam that, if the UN Security Council [UNSC] imposes sanctions against North Korea, Japan would take "responsible measures" as a member of the United Nations. Japan has never deeply engaged itself in security issues in East Asia like this. However, the United Nations may impose not only economic sanctions, but also further actions such as a sea blockade. In that case, Japan is likely to be thrown into a constitutional controversy over the nation's collective defense rights. The government has been expressing its hope that North Korea would accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) through diplomatic efforts. As Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said: "We hope North Korea will use sound judgment in line with the opinions of the international community." On the other hand, the Secretariat is studying definite measures for coping with the worst developments. A top Foreign Ministry official said "it is inappropriate to discuss our course of action at prsent," but it is believed the government is preparing phased measures to follow moderate sanctions of the United Nations. The Foreign Ministry feels the UNSC is unlikely to adopt full-fledged sanctions against North Korea immediately. Rather, the UNSC is expected to issue a statement urging North Korea to fully accept IAEA inspections as a first step. Policymakers in the government think: "The likeliest choice for the United Nations is multinational sanctions imposed on the step-by-step basis, which means strengthening sanctions one step at a time depending on developments." When the United Nations takes such a measure, possible options for Japan are: 1) a ban on remittances to North Korea; 2) a trade embargo; and 3) restrictions on travel to North Korea. It is systematically possible that Japan would ban remittances to North Korea; even in that case, however, those who want to send money to North Korea can still do so via third countries. Moreover, the government would have to control money taken out of Japan by Korean residents who travel to North Korea. The government can limit the amount of currency taken abroad by those travelers, or can tighten the issuance of re-entry visas, but these may become human right problems, and their effectiveness is questionable. Japan would face an even more difficult situation if the United Nations imposes full-fledged sanctions, such as a sea blockade against North Korea. If the United Nations requests the cooperation of the Self-Defense Forces or definite operations in such punitive actions, the conflict between constitutional restrictions and international demands would certainly create a furious controversy in Japan. The international community would criticize Japan if it hesitates in participating in UN decisions. In that case, the government would face a Catch-22. The coalition government has been neglecting improvement of its crisis management capability. The Foreign Ministry is afraid that "the coalition may not agree on anti-North Korea sanctions," and the issue can create friction within the coalition government. At the summit, Prime Minister Hosokawa hoped Japan-ROK-U.S. harmony and international pressures would result in concessions by North Korea. Probably, the remark reflects the Japanese Government's lack of determination.
