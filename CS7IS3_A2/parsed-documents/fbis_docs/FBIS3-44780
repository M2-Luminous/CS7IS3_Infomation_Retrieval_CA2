State Councillor Chen Junsheng informed a national working conference on the harnessing of the Huaihe River and Taihu Lake of this today, adding that the funds will be jointly raised by the central and local governments. Premier Li Peng stressed earlier today that all the money intended for the two projects must be guaranteed and local people's enthusiasm in joining in the construction be spurred, according to Chen. With a total population of 143 million and some 13 million ha of arable land, the Huaihe River valley and areas around Taihu Lake are major grain, cotton and vegetable oil producing regions. They generate one eighth of China's total agricultural and industrial output value. However, the regions are also prone to natural disasters. Experts say that serious flooding hits the areas every three to four years. In 1991, when the region was hit by the worst flooding for years, economic losses amounted to 48 billion yuan-worth. So far, 12 out of the 18 key water-conservancy projects in the Huaihe River valley have been started, with a total investment of 2.24 billion yuan. Seven out of ten similar key projects in the Taihu Lake area are under construction with investment totalling 1.3 billion yuan. Chen said that the projects in the Taihu Lake area are to be completed by 1995, and the projects in the Huaihe River valley are to be completed by the year 2000. In addition, the state councilor told the meeting that local governments in the areas concerned must coordinate with one another in the construction of the projects.
