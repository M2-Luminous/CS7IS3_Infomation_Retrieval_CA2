FBIS4-522 "drafr070_c_94061" FBIS-AFR-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 11 Apr South African Press Review for 11 Apr MB1104134294 MB1104134294 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR `Other Means' Needed To Secure kwaZulu Election Cooperation -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 11 April in a page-10 editorial says the summit at Skukuza between State President de Klerk, ANC President Mandela, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi on 8 April "was a total failure." Zwelithini and Buthelezi "were at least consistent: they reissued direct challenges to the electoral process." Nelson Mandela "was clearly angry, but he stopped short of spelling out what should be done to ensure that those in the kwaZulu region who wish to vote are able to do so, and those who wish to stay away are afforded the same freedom of individual choice. That, after all, is what the dispute is about (it is not about the IFP's participation, which is its own business), and President de Klerk's attempt to claim progress where there was non merely heightened the danger." Attempts to "woo" King Zwelithini "away from the IFP's hard-line stance finally failed, and other means to secure co-operation must now be sought. Either Buthelezi must give a genuine assurance that his administration will co-operate with the Independent Electoral Commission, or the Government and Transitional Executive Council will have to consider the grave option of taking responsibility for an area which is, after all, part and parcel of South Africa." BUSINESS DAY ANC, IFP Not Serious About Political Solution -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 11 April in its page-6 editorial says the four-leader summit at Skukuza on 8 April "did nothing to affirm that either the ANC or the Inkatha Freedom Party may seriously be seeking a political solution before the conflict settles into a brutal test of strength even uglier than that which has cost 20,000 lives over the past 10 years." The ANC made a "seemingly generous offer" to King Zwelithini regarding his status and powers. The proposal offers to Zulu royalty "an esteem and traditional powers compatible with the status of royalty in any modern democracy." However the ANC proposal is "marred" by the fact that it is "obviously a final, shallow and cynical attempt to divide the king and Buthelezi." BUSINESS DAY is "bemused" by the ANC's reluctance to make concessions. "After all, if Inkatha is so weak in terms of popular support that it can be `crushed', as most ANC strategists seem to believe, then the ANC would presumably win a regional poll." However, the election "must, and will go ahead," even if it "will not, of course, resolve the conflict." "At the same time, the election may clear the air a little. Inkatha's demand that the poll be postponed will no longer be an obstacle. And when he is stripped of the formal trappings of office, this may bring home to Buthelezi at last the futility of his boycott of the negotiating process." The election "is going ahead," and Buthelezi "warns that his supporters are more angry than ever before; he can probably expect the detention of the more militant of those supporters as security forces seek to protect lives and property." SOWETAN Failed Leaders' Summit Makes Bloodshed Unavoidable -- Referring to the "failed summit" in Skukuza on 8 April Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 11 April says: "State President F. W. de Klerk, ANC president Mr Nelson Mandela, IFP President Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini have left to a technical committee what they failed to do -- reach an accord on the future of the Zulu monarchy, free and fair elections in kwaZulu-Natal and an end to the bloodshed in the province." SOWETAN believes the IFP's "short-term tactic is to make the poll impossible in kwaZulu and the rest of Natal and in the long term use the Zulu royal house as leverage. Against this backdrop, more bloodshed is unavoidable and the options are limited. More troops will have to be poured into Natal to at least contain the violence. A possible revolt within the Ulundi laager by dissident IFP members and kwaZulu civil servants is the only factor likely to influence events before the elections. In the meantime, the country must brace itself for the worst."
