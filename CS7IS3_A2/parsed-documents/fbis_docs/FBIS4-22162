There are a great many problems that are distracting military people from their professional business. They are nevertheless trying not to lose their professionalism. Despite everything, combat and operational training is continuing in the forces and they are engaged in their studies and command post and operational exercises.... The letters to the editor are symptomatic: Again we are seeing letters form officers requesting that we more often publish articles on the problems in the training of the forces and on current trends in the development of operational art and tactics. In responding to these requests, we are publishing an article by Major-General of the Reserves Ivan Nikolayevich Vorobyev. He is a doctor of military sciences, a professor, and a meritorious scientist of the Russian Federation. He was born in Tambov Oblast in 1922. He served in the Soviet Army from 1940 until 1987. In the war, he commanded a platoon, a company, and a rifle battalion. He worked for a long time in the administration of the Ministry of Defense. He has a number of scientific works on the problems of operational art and tactics. Current Problems in Military Science In reading the second part of the title, someone will probably ask: Is it really necessary to subdivide tactics into various versions? He would say that tactics, as the art of waging war, must be "universal" and "comprehensive" and must guarantee the successful training and actions of the forces under all circumstances. Yes, that is what the theory teaches. But life, as we know, is richer. Examples? To bring the forces of the 40th Army that fought in Afghanistan up to strength, we were forced to train reinforcements in a special center. Despite the fact that the personnel selected for this were already sufficiently "broken in," it was simply necessary to retrain the people, because the "classical" tactics that they assimilated in the forces, military schools, and academies was not at all suitable for the conditions of Afghanistan. In that war, nothing happened as written in the textbooks. There was no clearly defined front and rear. The enemy could appear from anywhere and strike at any time. Under these conditions, our forces needed "nonstandard" tactics. Unfortunately, however, it was often worked out in the course of the battle. A no less typical example is that of the combat actions of the Americans in Vietnam. They fought there for 10 years and during all of that time they continually searched for tactical procedures that would meet the local conditions. The theater of war represented a unique "patchwork" in which the hot spots arose spontaneously in one place or another.... Unfortunately, it happened that essentially the experience of neither the Vietnam nor the Afghan nor other local wars was in demand by Soviet military art. It was considered random and untypical; thus for a long time was not used in the training of the forces. It is now time to correct this unfortunate mistake. There will likely be a place in the new field manuals for positions affecting the actions of the forces not only under the conditions of a large-scale war but also under the conditions of armed conflicts. By the way, this flows directly out of the demands of the new military doctrine of the Russian Federation, where it is noted that today there is an increasing danger of the rise of armed conflicts. So, taking this into account, what actions must the forces be prepared to undertake? Above all, as was already mentioned above, the conditions of warfare in armed conflicts are extremely varied. The means of action that were worked out for a "large" war cannot be mechanically transfered to this area. In addition, the opposing sides usually have a different level of military organization, training, and technical equipment. At the same time, this does not at all mean that one must be oriented toward "simplified" tactics. Precisely local wars gave an impulse to the development of many new and rather effective means of combat operations. During the time of the Korean War, for example, the tactic of "tunnel warfare" arose and was widely used, the tactic of air mobile operations came into being in Vietnam, and the tactic of remote combat developed in the Middle East (1967, 1979, and 1982). A special feature of local wars is that they usually become a range for the testing of new tactical concepts and kinds of military hardware. Thus, in Korea, they first used jet fighters, guided missiles of the "ship-to-air" class, helicopters, and new kinds of tanks. In Vietnam, they tested new jet bombers, supersonic fighters, artillery and missile systems, elements of the AVACS system, several kinds of aerial cluster bombs, including "Lazy Dog" bombs, the fragments (10,000) of which destroy a target over an area of 700 square meters, the "Snake Eye" bomb (weight 250 kg) equipped with an umbrella stabilizer, "Armalit" rifles that fire "tumbling" bullets, the "Vulcan" gun-machinegun with a rate of fire of 6,000-8,000 rounds per minute, "Strike" air-launched missiles, and antiaircraft missiles. In the wars in the Middle East, they first used combat helicopters with antitank guided missiles, "Merkava" tanks, new types of aircraft and helicopters, self-propelled artillery, tactical missiles, portable antiaircraft systems, and guided air-launched missiles. Especially intensive use was made of the means of radioelectronic warfare. The Americans carried out mass tests of combat equipment and arms during the war in the zone of the Persian Gulf: Systems of highly accurate weapons, "SLAM" and "ATAKMS" missiles, "Patriot" antiaircraft missiles, the heavy bomber GBU-15, and new models of the means of communication, radio-electronic warfare, and radio, radioengineering, and space reconnaissance. In analyzing the experience in local wars in the 1950's through the 1990's, it is important to note that maneuvering forms of combat prevailed in them over position forms. A long positional confrontation of the sides was noted only during the time of the war in Korea. In all other wars, if such a phenomenon occurred it was only for a short time and episodic. And the possible armed conflicts of the future will hardly be an exception to this rule. Such is the tendency in the development of military science: With the increase in the power and speed of weapons and in the maneuvering capability of the forces, there is an ever greater displacement from the arsenal of tactics of such companions of positional confrontation as penetration and the use of unbroken, trench, and deeply echeloned defense. Naturally, the application of rigid methods in the operations of the forces is receding into the past and the "geometry" of the battlefield is changing fundamentally in that it is becoming "nonlinear" and "multidimensional." Operations of forces under the conditions of an "expanded battlefield", (that is, in individual points of combat, in the absence of a clearly defined front line and direct contact of units with their neighbors and with the enemy), apparently will become new features of contemporary tactics that may be manifested especially clearly in local armed conflicts. For it is usually rather limited forces and systems that are involved in conflicts and their action is concentrated in time and space. It can be expected that the opposing side will not always strive to engage in "open" combat. More often he will prefer to avoid a direct clash with an enemy with superior numerical strength and will try to "slip away" from the strike. It must be assumed that under these conditions the basic operational methods will be surprise attacks like a "swarm of bees" against individual facilities, especially against unprotected command and control facilities, rear bases, truck convoys, guard posts and security detachments, checkpoints, and individual garrisons. It is possible that extensive use will be made of ambushes, the setting of traps, the mining of roads, and acts of terrorism. Nor can one rule out large-scale clashes that under same conditions may grow into large-scale operations. But it appears that most characteristic for conflicts will still be frequent episodic battles. Hence, the commanders and staffs will have to make use of other methods of work in the organization and carrying out of combat operations than those that are being used, let us say, in the penetration of a prepared defense. Those normative indicators that were developed in combat and training practice and set forth in the current field manuals are not applicable here. Most often the grouping of the "nonstandard" enemy will be quite heterogeneous. It may include the most diverse formations in terms of combat qualities. And it is impossible to assess them using generally accepted methods and operating with "averaged measures." Some units may be well armed and trained and their combat potential may conditionally be assigned the value of one. Others will be less well trained and will be more poorly equipped technically. Accordingly, the level of their combat capability will be lower. It is also rather difficult to assess the qualitative parameters of one's own forces. What are the criteria for defining the combat possibilities of units and subunits in the waging of counterguerrilla warfare? How much force and what systems are needed to counteract ambushes, to prevent acts of sabotage, to protect and defend communications, and to carry out reconnaissance and search operations? All of these are questions that are not easily answered. Many difficulties in making the decision to engage in combat will also arise because the commander does not by any means always see the real enemy before him. It will be very difficult to carry out reconnaissance, because the forces, as a rule, will be assigned an extensive zone of responsibility or combat operations. During the war in Afghanistan, for example, the divisions were assigned a zone of combat operations along a front of 400 to 600 km in a depth of 200 to 400 km, regiments were assigned a sector 100 to 150 km wide along the front and 50-80 km in depth, and for the battalion it was 30-40 km along the front in a depth of 15-20 km. It is understandable that it is possible to study such a large region and to investigate routes extending over several dozen or hundreds of kilomters only with the help of helicopters. But here is where new difficulties arise: How in this case can one specify the tasks of the units and subunits in the terrain, determine the regions of the artillery firing positions, the order for overcoming artificial obstacles, etc? The situation is also complicated by the fact that the means available to the forces for reconnaissance, command and control, and support as well as the weapons and in general the organizational personnel structure of the combined units are not at all adapted to such conditions. Here it is appropriate to remember the experience in Afghanistan, in particular the experience in the decentralized use of forces and weapons. There were practically no cases in which a division operated at full strength. And it was infrequent that they made use of the regiment. As a rule, they established an improvized detachment for the accomplishment of some particular combat task or other such as the destruction of a recognized base of the enemy, for example -- usually on the basis of a reinforced motorized rifle battalion. Its actions were supported by artillery, combat helicopters, and aviation. The Americans operated in an analogous manner in Vietnam. Thus, combat experience teaches: a unique "detachment" ("group") system of actions can become typical for armed conflicts. The combat strength of the established detachments may differ. The main thing here is to support their fire and tactical independence and capability of operating for a long time (two or three days) separately from the main forces of one's own troops and the rear base. It is expedient to form detachments under the principle of specific designation, for example it is necessary to have a reconnaissance and search detach to determine the combat strength and precise location of enemy groupings. It is advisable to have a raiding and assault detachment to carry out raiding and assault actions for the purpose of identifying and destroying a particular grouping of the enemy. Its basis is mobile (armored and motorized rifle) subunits strengthened with artillery and engineering subunits. To seal off important facilities at the disposition of the enemy, it is necessary to have blocking detachments that essentially include motorized rifle subunits. The support of the actions of reconnaissance-search, raiding-assault, and blocking detachments will require strike detachments established primarily on the basis of artillery subunits and subunits of combat helicopters. As experience shows, it is not advisable to assign a strictly limited zone of action to a detachment, especially a reconnaissance-search or raiding-assault detachment, for this will paralyze their maneuver. It is enough for them to determine the general direction of the actions and the objectives -- immediate, intermediate, and final. If the enemy grouping is determined insufficiently fully (and this may be the case very often), then it is expedient to practice "alternative" planning, that is, to determine not one but two and sometimes even three possible versions of the action. It is understandable that the method of "actions by detachments" can be quite effective only in the event of thorough organization and comprehensive support. Because it is by no means always possible to apply active-offensive forms of combat, the forces must be able to engage in delaying and stabilizing actions. That is, it will no longer be defense in its classic form. Delaying actions infer the establishment of mobile (air mobile) screens and migratory weapons positions and the setting up of ambushes and killing zones in the path of the enemy's advance. In the event of the lack of the necessary number of weapons, the most acceptable thing here may be the selective-restrictive method of effecting the enemy, the essence of which is the selection of the most important facilities in his grouping and concentration on the suppression of most of the weapons operating in the given sector. In covering open flanks for the purpose of counteracting the close and wide envelopments of the enemy, use can be made of the barrier-blocking method, which infers the establishment of fire barriers primarily on natural boundaries in combination with the remote mining of the terrain. Since combat operations under these conditions are developed on a broad front but artillery has a limited range of fire, combat helicopters play a greater role in the fire support of the forces. Use may also be made of mixed groups of aircraft and helicopters put together from reconnaissance and combat (strike) helicopters and ground attack aircraft. In short, again and again we have been convinced that there are no "easy" wars and that one must prepare the forces thoroughly for even what at first glance would seem to be an insignificant military conflict. Today the experience of local wars and military conflicts -- and about 200 of them have been unleashed in the world from 1945 through 1992 -- is especially valid for us, because, as was recently stated at one of the UN sessions, "the bell of every regional conflict tolls for all of us."
