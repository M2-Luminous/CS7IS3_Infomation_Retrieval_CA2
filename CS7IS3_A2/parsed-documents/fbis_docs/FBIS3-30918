The coalition has been pasted together." For Moczulski it is only a formal blurring of the conflict and the next one may take place as early as in four weeks' time. The KPN leader is of the opinion that none of the concrete matters have been resolved. It has not been explained, for example, what will be the government attitude towards privatization; whether it will be like that of Bogdan Pek, head of the ownership transformation commission, or that of Wieslaw Kaczmarek, minister for ownership transformations. The matter of the Ministry of Finance has not been resolved, Moczulski claims, except for agreeing that the ministerial post still belongs to the SLD [Democratic Left Alliance]. Moczulski asks, does it mean agreement for, for example, Mr Sekula [head of the Main Customs Office] becoming the minister? According to him the SLD has no suitable candidates for the post, perhaps with the exception of professor Jozef Kaleta who, as Moczulski said, has different economic views. Moczulski described the results of Tuesday's talks as an avoidance of important issues and an agreement that the existence of the coalition is in the interest of both sides.
