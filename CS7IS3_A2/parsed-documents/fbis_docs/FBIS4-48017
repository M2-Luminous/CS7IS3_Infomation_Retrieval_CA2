He stated this today in Bukoba, while meeting with commanders and servicemen from the Tanzania People's Defense Force [TPDF] at (Ramusenye) and Kaboya, following an expression of concern by the public. General Mboma told the servicemen they must strengthen their defenses to assuage the fears of those people living in areas bordering certain neighboring countries, some of whom had decided to move away from their home districts. He said that people must be confident, since the TPDF had the task of defending the Constitution, the country's borders, and its citizens. Regarding the Rusumo Bridge, he asked them to consolidate their defenses and to ensure that the bridge was not destroyed, as its destruction would be a disgrace to the TPDF.
