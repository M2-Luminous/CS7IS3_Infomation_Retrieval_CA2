Miguel Coimbra reports: [Coimbra] Portugal has had diplomatic relations with Israel since 1977, but it only opened an embassy in Tel Aviv two and a half years ago. Since then there have been successive high level visits and meetings between leaders of both countries. These meetings have resulted in excellent cooperation relations and in the development of a variety of activities -- entrepreneurial, scientific, and commercial. Israel has become in the last few years, OECD countries aside, Portugal's second trading partner, after Angola. The good relations are also demonstrated by the two direct weekly flights between Portugal and Israel and by an accord to abolish entry visas for citizens of the two countries. In addition to strengthening bilateral understanding, the two governments are at the moment working on the consolidation of cooperation on a trilateral level, including the PALOP's [Lusophone African countries], and on an international level with a focus on the Middle East peace process and on a new economic accord between Israel and the European Union.
