That sum is equivalent to 56 billion pesos and seems an astronomical amount for the two projects. If the Marines' presence in Colombia is not approved, the government would have to return the money. Right now there is only confusion, mystery, and absolute silence toward the media at the port in Malaga Bay. These vessels, aboard which the 122 U.S. Southern Command engineers, materials, and military trucks arrived, are the only words. Everything here has come from the United States. The U.S. flags flying on the vessels speak for themselves, because neither the gringos nor Colombian military are willing to explain anything on camera. They say the whole matter is being handled by the Defense Ministry. The "TV Today" newscast was able to contact the gringo team leader, who told us that Colombia should be proud to have this great assistance from his country. For them, this mission, during which a school and a health center are allegedly to be built in Juanchaco, is just a complementary training operation for the military engineers. This type of operation is almost like a generous donation for Colombia. But no one understands and no Colombian can conceive of how the United States can invest $700 million in something supposedly as simple as a small school and a health center. The troops have not been able to disembark because of the problems that have cropped up regarding their arrival. Their orders were to arrive at port, disembark, and move out immediately. The U.S. military says that if the Colombian Government's decision is delayed any longer, Colombia would simply have to return the $700 million and the U.S. troops would go back the way they came. In Juanchaco, meanwhile, the people do not seem to want the foreigners around, even though they say they are not Marines and that they are not invading Colombia; on the contrary, the soldiers say they want to offer our country great assistance.
