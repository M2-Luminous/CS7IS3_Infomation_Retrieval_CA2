The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet AGL, at Alta Vista Ranch Airport, Marfa, TX. The development of a VOR RWY 15 SIAP has made this proposal necessary. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for aircraft executing the VOR RWY 15 SIAP at Alta Vista Ranch Airport, Marfa, TX. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designated Class E airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference on 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air). The Proposed Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71 as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1.

The incorporation by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 of the Federal Aviation Administration Order 7400.9A, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, is amended as follows: Paragraph 6005␣Class E airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth * * * * * ASW TX E5 Marfa, Alta Vista Ranch Airport, TX [New] Marfa, Alta Vista Ranch Airport, TX (Lat. 30 ○08 ’54 ’ ’ N., Long. 103 ○53 ’35 ’ ’ W.)
