In an unofficial version released by the press, Salinas asked the CNDH president to establish contacts with the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) to attain the liberation of the soldier and politician, who was kidnapped by guerrillas in the early days of the conflict. According to the press, the government is trying to handle this affair discretely in order to ease the negotiation with the captors. EZLN Representatives had stated that they would subject the former governor to a summary trial for repressing the indigenous peoples and peasants of Chiapas during his regime. Castellanos was kidnapped from his San Joaquin Ranch in Las Margaritas Municipality, Chiapas State. The doctors of the Social Security Institute, who were set free in Guadalupe Tepeyac Municipality, have reported that General Castellanos was still alive and in a normal condition. According to a journalistic version, the EZLN has informed his relatives that they will subject the former governor's fate to a vote, whereas another version has reported the total silence of his captors and that the general was in the town of Maravillas Trinidad.
