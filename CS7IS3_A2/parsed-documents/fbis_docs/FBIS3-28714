In doing so, ASEAN do not realize the immense potential in cross-border investment. For far too long, member countries have been relying on investments outside ASEAN. This will only serve to make the region dependent on others. Besides this, it is not in line with efforts toward ASEAN economic integration. The fact is that member countries do not have to go far for investment. With regional trade expanding rapidly, there is much scope for greater intra-ASEAN investment as well. As Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr Mahathir Mohamed noted, investment by ASEAN investors in ASEAN had grown substantially over the years. However, the choice by ASEAN investors to place their money in the region does not come automatically. It is vital for member countries to provide a conducive climate for investment. This means that the investment climate must be ideal, with the necessary laws and policies in place. ASEAN countries have done well in providing the right environment for foreign investment. Still, with other regions also competing for investment, member countries must guard against complacency. Economies in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Africa are competing for foreign capital to create jobs and prosperity. Here, a key to cross-border investment is to complement one another's economic mood. This is exactly why the growth triangle concept has become very popular in the region. It is more effective for a few countries to get together to develop their respective regions bordering each other. Within a short period of time, the committees in charge of developing the growth triangle have swung into action. It is a matter of time before they start bearing fruit. The bottom line is that if their investment climate is ideal for ASEAN countries, they should also be conducive for investors from outside the region. Therefore, there is much scope for not only intra-ASEAN trade, but cross-border investments as well among member countries. The challenge is for the respective private sectors to tap into each other's potential. Rather than going for high-cost areas far away, ASEAN countries are among the most lucrative investment destinations. Areas that need to be looked into to ensure the flow of investments of proper infrastructure facilities. [sentence as heard] Efforts should be made to enhance skilled manpower in the region. This could encourage reverse investment by some of the more developed countries in neighboring ASEAN countries. All this would go a long way in boosting the region's quest for a single free market. When that is achieved, ASEAN would emerge as a cohesive force, much to the envy of others. At the same time, it would give the region a better bargaining power in international economic issues.
