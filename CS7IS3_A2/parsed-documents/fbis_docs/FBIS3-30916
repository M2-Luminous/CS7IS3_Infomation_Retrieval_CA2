Public opinion polls show that he is supported by approximately 90 percent of the electoral body. What is even more interesting is that, regardless of the fact that the Macedonian political scene is extremely turbulent and divided, Gligorov not only gets support from "his own," but is also strongly supported by the Albanian population and the voters of the nationalist Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity [VMRO-DPMNE], whose party is usually very critical of many of his moves and even accuses him of "national treason" for allegedly flirting with the idea of changing the name of the country, the flag, and so forth. However, it seems that ordinary people appreciate Gligorov's experienced -- perhaps even cunning or wise, if you like -- but extremely efficient way of solving problem after problem, many of which are labeled "to be or not to be," in the stirred-up situation in Macedonia and its neighborhood. Many say the fact that he built his authority on the other side of the famous Balkan populist leadership, having imposed some other qualities, did a world of good for Gligorov. One of those qualities -- bearing those who criticize him no hard feelings, as he probably considers it part of his job -- came to the surface when we were setting up this interview. We met him at the celebration of the most influential Macedonian weekly PULS, also famous for its ruthless depiction of the dark side of the Macedonian political scene, the weekly that often has no mercy for Gligorov himself. Asked why he attended the celebration of a newspaper that often criticizes and attacks him, he replied that, as we all know, the authorities are not immaculate, and the job of the media, among other things, is to remind the authorities of that. At the beginning of the interview, we "reminded" President Gligorov of the burning Macedonian problem --relations with Greece. Talks, Not Skirmish, With Greece [Obradovic] At the recently held session of the Greek Parliament, Papandreu has again said they would not recognize Macedonia under its name. Naturally and most importantly, European powers recognized Macedonia, but solving the problem of relations with Greece is important for stability of this region and for Greek- Macedonian relations. What do you think will be the final solution? [Gligorov] I think the most natural way would be to continue the talks we began under the auspices of the United Nations and Mr. Vance. We managed to make a few steps forward in those negotiations, but then they were interrupted by Greece for understandable reasons -- they went to the elections, which are now over. Now they have a new government and we must continue to negotiate. That is the only possible way. Everything else -- skirmishing, stipulating terms for the beginning of the negotiations -- should not be happening between two members of the United Nations, and would ultimately produce no results. Things will get better eventually. Differentiation Among the Macedonian Albanians [Obradovic] Albanian-Macedonian relations are evidently one of the most important internal problems of Macedonia. Those relations are burdened by many problems and things got worse after it was discovered that the Albanians had weapons. Is it possible control over those relations could be lost and that this would escalate into a conflict? [Gligorov] I do not expect that. What is happening in Albanian parties is something normal in a law-ordered, democratic country -- people are gradually being divided according to their views on some problems. The worst possible thing is when a nation, any nation, is homogenized around certain demands, especially if they become extremely nationalistic. That would lead to separation, not to mention the ghettoization of certain parts of the population. Some Albanians are undergoing a kind of political differentiation. Basically, I appreciate that, for it is actually a democratic process. It is another matter that third parties are becoming involved in the internal discussions in some Albanian parties. That is impermissible and bad, for that means interfering in our domestic problems. Otherwise, I view this process of differentiation as a will of a huge majority of people who want their Macedonia to become a state, i.e. of those people who consider it their homeland. On the other side, there are extremists who still dream of greater Albania. [Obradovic] You mentioned interference of a third side. I suppose you meant Albania. Do you intend to start negotiating with them and ask them not to do that? [Gligorov] We talk to them and I think it would be normal to continue doing that, as well as to establish internationally recognized norms of behavior that will strengthen and develop our cooperation. We had a good cooperation for a while, and we must overcome these events. Toward "Partnership for Peace" [Obradovic] Macedonia has welcomed President Clinton's initiative regarding the restructuring of NATO and the "Partnership for Peace" project. Are there any chances for Macedonia to become involved in that project? [Gligorov] We have already applied to participate in "Partnership for Peace" and, in my opinion, the only hindrance is that we are still not a member of the CSCE [Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe] because Greece objects to that. If we manage to overcome that, all members of the CSCE have, in principle, the right and the possibility to participate in that association. I think that Macedonia satisfies all conditions for becoming a member of "Partnership for Peace" association in every way. [Obradovic] Do you think one will be able to break the resistance of Greece soon? What condition have they set? [Gligorov] I cannot predict when, but I think it cannot be postponed simply because Greece is practically the only country that opposes our becoming a member of the CSCE. Therefore, on one hand, we will try to continue negotiating with Greece and, on the other, we will try to realize that goal within the CSCE. Life Wants an Agreement [Obradovic] Macedonia is, naturally, still not involved in the war, but it cannot ignore the events on the territory of former Yugoslavia. Can you comment on the latest agreement between Tudjman and Milosevic? [Gligorov] As a country that, first of all, strives toward peace, negotiations, tolerance, solving the global situation in the Balkans, and finding points of contact for future cooperation, we welcome every step in realizing those goals. It is difficult for me to comment on what lies behind this agreement and what could be its consequences. Some say it has something to do with the agreement made in Karadjordjevo, others that it is an interim agreement made in order to force the Muslims to sign the peace agreement under conditions arranged between the two sides. However, one must also consider huge interests in the normalization of relations between the two countries; the main traffic route was interrupted, and so were the oil pipeline and telephone communications, but one must go on living, one must find some points of contact to start taking practical steps in order to overcome the atmosphere of war. I think the agreement is a wide and complex matter and that it must be considered from different aspects. [Obradovic] Some say that Macedonia is yet to face certain problems regarding the fact that it must start restructuring its economy, and that social tensions will probably increase, and that it must realize an economic program that requires some sacrifice, etc. Can that further complicate the domestic situation in Macedonia? [Gligorov] In the present situation, when there are sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro, our road toward Europe in the north is getting narrower and narrower. Furthermore, considering the open problem with Greece, introducing daring reforms, market institutions, and making an agreement with the IMF and the World Bank for a stabilization program is a very brave and a risky undertaking. But, on the other hand, I think delaying it would complicate the situation. A Tough Nut To Crack [Gligorov] As other examples show, delaying reforms, deeper but inevitable changes, cannot buy time. There is just a temporary illusion that the situation is under control, but the right thing to do is to crack a tough nut, and it will be a very tough one indeed. In my opinion, there is no other way. I hope that the people of Macedonia -- considering what we went through, that we managed to maintain peace and tranquillity -- will understand this is a step we must make so that, when the war ends, in the process of normalization, we could use this advantage, the fact that we were not involved in the war, to develop and arrange relations with other Eastern-European countries and with our neighbors. That must be an additional stimulus for us to succeed in this undertaking. Favoring the Moderate Option [Obradovic] New elections are supposed to be organized in Macedonia this fall. Do you expect some extreme options, whether Macedonian or Albanian, to get stronger at those elections, which could lead to straining political relations and the situation in Macedonia? [Gligorov] This is a regular election year in Macedonia and the elections may be a burden to some extent. Passions are always intensified in the election year, demands are maximized, people do things that trigger emotional reactions, conflicts. We must count on all that. However, I think the experience we gathered in the past two or three years, as well as global events in these parts have taught us we should look for peaceful solutions for our future. The people saw that the politics of extreme options does not lead anywhere. And the fact that extreme nationalism did not win here helped us to stay out of the war; otherwise, we would also be in the maelstrom of war. Naturally, I think it is not impossible that passion will be stirred up again, but in view of what I have just said, I think people are now aware of certain things and that they will favor the moderate option. [Box, p 6] U.S. "Blue Helmets" -- a Warning [Obradovic] The forces of the United Nations are here in Macedonia. Is that a certain guarantee that there will be peace in Macedonia and what do you think about their role? [Gligorov] That is a relatively small contingent. As a military force, it does not bring any significant changes in relations in these parts. However, their presence is of enormous political and psychological significance. In the political sense, it demonstrates the interest of the international community in the situation in Macedonia. I think the international community has, on time, realized the geostrategic importance of Macedonia for the global stability of this part of the Balkans in particular, as a pivotal area for which, as you know, there have been many battles and wars in history. Therefore, the mission of peace-keeping forces has a dual role. One is to prevent -- therefore, those forces do not act after a conflict happens, they do not separate warring factions, but analyze the situation in order to predict possible conflicts and thus prevent them. In that sense, Macedonia is a very good example. The other role is that the presence of UN forces, especially of the contingent of U.S. soldiers, presents a kind of warning, a message to all who have a vested interest in Macedonia that, in case of conflicts or some events that would further complicate the situation with regard to the war raging in the north, it will simply not be accepted. [Box, p 7] Overcome Extreme Demands [Obradovic] Do you think that the rights of the Albanian minority in Macedonia have been protected in the right way or should some significant changes occur with regard to that? [Gligorov] Regarding the constitutional position of all minorities in Macedonia, I think their rights were rightfully established and protected. Many missions of the CSCE and other institutions came here to assess constitutional solutions. Among others, the well-known Badinter's Commission made up of Europe's top lawyers and presidents of constitutional courts, has also confirmed that those rights were protected. Much is yet to be accomplished in practice on both sides -- on one side, to transform that into everyday decisions that will in turn enable us to reduce tensions and, on the other, to eliminate some extreme demands that have not been fulfilled in any European country and that could only lead to increasing tensions. I think those demands are, first of all, a reflection of what is going on in republics of former Yugoslavia, i.e. in the Balkans, with regard to extremist nationalism and extreme demands that go far beyond what we are supposed to grant -- first of all, to strive toward building a civic state, then toward the European option, and then toward alleviating, opening up borders and barriers and thus enable free passage of people, creating new jobs, letting people decide where and how to live, in contrast to present desires of each of those countries to realize their own exclusively historic, national and some other pretensions, which can lead to escalation of those conflicts.
