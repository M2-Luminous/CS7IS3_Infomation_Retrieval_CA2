Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov told the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY that China carries great weight in Russia's foreign policy and the two countries enjoy the broadest prospect for cooperation. Panov, who is in charge of Asian and Pacific affairs, said that Russia has speeded up its efforts to develop a "wide partnership" with China in dealing with both bilateral and international relations following President Boris Yeltsin's historic visit to Beijing in December 1992. The Russian-Chinese relationship should be as normal as one between two neighbors, the deputy foreign minister said, adding that the two countries should cooperate for their mutual interests and for peace in the region and the world as a whole. He told the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY that Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will visit China at the end of January. U.S. President Bill Clinton's coming visit to Moscow and Kozyrev's trip to Beijing show that Russia is seeking a balanced diplomatic policy toward the East and West, he said. Panov also spoke highly of China's economic reforms, saying that its experiences, especially those obtained in the special economic zones, will be helpful to Russia. He said bilateral trade is mutually complementary and would grow steadily.
