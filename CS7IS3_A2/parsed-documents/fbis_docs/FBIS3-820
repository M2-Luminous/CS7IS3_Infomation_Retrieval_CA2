Earlier, President Lucas Mangope said his parliament would discuss participation in the April election today. However, the TEC said parliament would not meet today and that all cabinet members and MPs [Members of Parliament] were regarded as ordinary citizens without any access to state resources. The appointment of Mr. Job Makgoro of the South African Development Bank as co-administrator followed objections by several organizations to the appointment of Dr. Tjaart van der Walt as administrator. Meanwhile the TEC's management committee and the South African Government have given assurances that the salaries and pensions of civil servants, policemen and soldiers were safe.
