Financial rescue of the banks was referred to for a long time as one of the key moves, once inflation was shattered, in the approach to restructuring and restoring the entire Croatian economy to health, and it was also said that the success of the stabilization program would depend greatly on success in rescuing the banks. The first results were followed immediately by the first significant problems of the stabilization program. One of them was division of the banks into those which can provisionally be said to be operating normally and those which have problems with liquidity, and some even with insolvency. While liquidity is corrected with short-term solutions, the problem of insolvency is far more difficult, because this means that the value of debt exceeds the value of property, which is an altogether sufficient reason for the bank's bankruptcy. Because there is a reluctance to conduct bankruptcy proceedings of banks because of what is usually referred to as the domino effect, i.e., an excessively great influence on economic events because of connections between the banks and their customers, the effort is usually made to restore the bank to health, liquidity, and normal operation, which as a rule means paying its debts. Following an agreement in one of its meetings to undertake financial rescue, which is a major decision, the Croatian Government has taken specific steps. Back in January the National Bank of Croatia [NBH] sent its representatives, referred to in the press as commissars, to the Bank of Split, which is first on the list for financial rescue. The commissars are overseeing the operation of the Bank of Split, monitoring its liquidity, and sending in a report on this to the NBH; that in turn is to be the basis for defining precisely the situation in the bank, for prescribing the therapy, and, most interestingly, for fixing the amount of money the state must furnish to steer the bank toward normal operation. Liquidation as a Last Resort In addition to the Bank of Split, the Bank of Slavonia is also to be rescued in the first round, and after them come the Bank of Rijeka and the Bank of Istria, and, it is assumed, the Bank of Zupanja as well. The Government of the RH [Republic of Croatia] seems to have taken the problem of rescuing the banks quite seriously. Following the agreement, there will be regulations governing the conduct of the rescue, and soon the Law on Rescue of the Banks should be presented in public, and the government will form a professional body, the Agency for Rescue of the Banks, consisting of experts, most probably from the National Bank of Croatia and the finance ministry, who will conduct and monitor the rescue of the banks. The greatest attention, but also debate, will be aroused by the amount of money necessary to carry out the rescue of the banks. According to the first unofficial estimates, this will be some 200 million German marks [DM], and the final amount will be made public soon, because it will be planned in the new proposal of the state budget which the finance ministry is preparing for the March session of the Sabor [Croatian parliament]. This time, even representatives of the government have been very clear in statements that the rescue of the banks will be paid for by taxpayers, and that is why Dr. Zoran Jasic, finance minister, has declared: "We will stick firmly by the principle that whoever receives money from the state must also render an account to the state." This statement sounds good, but the question is how it will look in practice. Because government expenditure is a topic that is always interesting, at least to the public and taxpayers from whose pocket everything is financed, we can expect fierce debates over the budget, because the deputies in the last debate threatened that the budget would no longer squeeze through. The item of the outlay for rescue of the banks will certainly be "attacked" not only because of the amount, but also because of the situation in certain banks, which are to be rescued because of scandals that have befallen them and because of ties to politics. The Bank of Split will be called to account ahead of all the others. The war is given as the reason for the problematical business operation of these banks, and these are regional banks. The Bank of Split encountered problems because of TLM [Light Metal Factory] and certain other customers, the Bank of Slavonia follows agriculture, which has major problems, the Bank of Istria, has, as they say, paid the price of poor tourist seasons, and the Bank of Rijeka is closely tied to shipbuilding. To some extent, of course, all these reasons are justified, but it is certain that the experts will have bad business moves of the banks to investigate as well. Experts say that when the results are totaled and assessments made, the extreme measures will include even liquidation of the bank. There has been a great deal of debate about that problem up to now, because mainly the line was taken that it is almost impossible to liquidate a bank. Recently, that possibility is not being discounted, and it is usually said that it comes into account if the figures show that it is necessary. However, the banks and the economy are so intertwined, and in the specific case there is also a political connotation, so that the possibility of liquidation is almost precluded. And Personnel Changes In the banks that will be rescued there are differing estimates of how much money is needed, but they all say that they can hardly wait for the rescue to begin. Frane Mitrovic, director of the Bank of Split, has said in the press that customers owe the bank more than DM150 million. "The Bank of Split, according to our estimate, needs DM35 million so that we can do business normally. If TLM repaid us its debt of some DM40 million, everything would be fine," Mitrovic said. In the Bank of Slavonia they say that they have already begun rescue of the bank through rescue of customers. They have initiated several bankruptcies of delinquent customers and in this way cleared up certain uncollected claims, and some they have solved by buying shares from the firm with the money owed the bank. An internal reorganization of the bank has already been carried out, and the size of the labor force has been reduced. Although they do not want to make estimates of how much money is needed for the rescue, Ivo Markotic, the bank's director, says that they have DM177 million in outstanding loans which they have not collected and which they will not be able to collect. Markotic explains this situation in terms of problems in agriculture, where they have the most uncollected claims, because the government is not paying the rebate on interest in agriculture, they are not paying creditors, and the entire burden falls on the banks. The problem of the Bank of Rijeka is the illiquidity of shipbuilding, and the people in the bank say that $40-50 million would save them. They agree with the government that the customers should be rescued in order to restore the banks to health. An auditor, they say at the bank, has examined the bank's operation and seen that the assets are twice the basic capital, so that the bank is sound, and some of the experts concur in that. Aside from the measures mentioned, government officials have also announced possible personnel changes in the bank and appointment of commissars who will monitor the bank's business. This view was immediately attacked as such, but in the government department they are clear--because they are putting up the money, they want control over the bank's operation. Before that, it was reported, but never confirmed, that the reason for such decisions, but also the stricter measures of the NBH, was one bank on the list for rescue which received some of the money for rescue and immediately loaned it out to problematical customers. Whether it is specifically because of that or in order to head off events that might be similar, the NBH has reacted with a press release in which it said: "People seem to expect from the announced rescue of the banks that there will be abundant coverage even for unreasonable undertaking of problematical loans, that is, for losses and shortage of money resulting from a decision of the banks themselves, not from objective circumstances." A Crash Effort To Reduce the Debt The government is entering upon rescue of the banks cautiously, because it already has quite a bit of experience in intervention and aid to the banks. This can be seen with particular clarity in the example of old foreign exchange savings. The state took up as public debt about DM5 billion of old foreign exchange savings in order to take the burden off the banks and help them survive. When the government was late in paying the interest which the banks were supposed to pay to the depositors, the banks unhesitatingly called the government to account, viewing the problem of old foreign exchange savings as exclusively a problem of the government. The bankers never replied as to the basis for their feeling that they have been absolved of this problem, when it is well-known that when old foreign exchange savings were taken over, this also cleared up some of the poor assets and loans of the banks, for which no bill was ever presented to them. Even though the public debt has been reduced by DM4.2 billion because of the purchase of shares, housing loans, and the so-called manager credits, the present assessment is that this is too large a burden for the government, because the first installment comes due next year, and the government is barely able to pay interest on the old foreign exchange savings, and even then it is doing so late. That is why it was decided to undertake a great crash effort to reduce the public debt by allowing the purchase of enterprise stock with old foreign exchange savings, and this is now being done. There is an offer at the moment to sell more than DM1.2 billion of enterprise stock which individuals can buy with old foreign exchange savings. There is some question what will come of this, but it is clear that it is difficult to get cash for the stock of even the best firms, and the purchase with "paper," anathematized at one time, is now favored. Other problems are also arising here, because the banks have also become owners of about DM1 billion in enterprise stock in the transformation, and it is being asked ever more frequently why the banks are not selling enterprise stock in order to repair their liquidity and operation? Illiquidity, especially of the major banks like the Bank of Zagreb, could cause problems for the entire economy and the stabilization program, because in order to repair its liquidity, the bank has lowered the exchange rate of foreign currencies, thereby worsening the already difficult position of exporters. It is the large banks, the Bank of Zagreb and the Privredna Banka [Business Bank], that have the largest share in the equity of firms, and they are the only ones of the 43 registered banks in Croatia that are included among the 500 largest banks in the world. And Political Scandals Privredna Banka is covering 1.5 billion of Croatia's foreign debt, which amounts to 2.7 billion, and its customers are the largest giants in Croatia, its director is a member of the incumbent party and a parliamentary deputy, and the Bank of Zagreb has one-fourth of the savings deposits of individuals, and when all that is taken into account, it is clear that they dictate many things in economic policy. What is more, along with the Bank of Split, Privredna Banka has already been involved in scandals. According to the speculation and rumors in the corridor, Privredna Banka will reportedly be taking over Nama. All of this postpones solutions to some extent, because an essential precondition for success of the banking system is a defined ownership structure in which the state has no great share. The interlocking between the banks and enterprises operating at a loss and the quasi-ownership structure, which is the situation in the majority of banks established in the former system, distort views of the market and business operation, which means confidence in the banks, which is the foundation for successful banking, is constantly being put to the test. It was foreseen even earlier that certain banks would be rescued with large bond issues, i.e., a kind of swap (exchange) of the shares of large firms which are the customers, but also the owners, of the bank, for the shares of the banks under government guardianship, which would take care of what up to now has been the incestuous relations between the banks and their debtors, who were also their owners, and would finally establish a normal ownership relation in which the creditors would have the last word. Financial rescue of the banks can be carried out only by the government, but this ought to be done with a program, and if in that process the government is to increase its share in ownership of the banks, it should also divest itself of that by selling it, because the banks must be free of the government, but the central bank ought to have oversight over the business operation of the banks because of their importance.
