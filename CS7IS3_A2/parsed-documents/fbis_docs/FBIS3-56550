According to the preliminary figures of the Central Electoral Commission, the largest number of votes -- around 542,000 or approximately 38.5 percent -- went to Yuriy Meshkov, the candidate from the Republican Party of Crimea which belongs to the "Russia" electoral bloc. In second place, with about 17 percent, is Nikolay Bahrov, an independent candidate and chairman of the Supreme Soviet. These two will run in the second round of voting which will be held in two weeks' time -- on 30 January. None of the commentators expected such a success for Yuriy Meshkov. His rating in independent polls varied from 19 to 20 percent, in contrast to which the rating of Leonid Hrach, the Communist Party of Crimea candidate, reached 40 percent whereas in fact he was supported by just 12.5 percent of the voters. Meshkov, age 48, is a well-known political figure in Crimea. His mother is Ukrainian, his father is Russian. He graduated from Moscow University's Law Faculty. He worked as an investigator and a lawyer. He is a people's deputy and coordinator of the "Republic" deputies' group in the Crimean Supreme Soviet and a founder and chairman of the Republican Movement which later became the Republican Party of Crimea. The main planks of his election platform are as follows: Lifting the moratorium on the referendum on the status of Crimea, the law on which was adopted by the Crimean parliament on the initiative of and under pressure from Meshkov and his comrades. He believes that the positive results of the referendum and Crimea's acquisition of state independence will make it possible to restore the republic's union with Russia. Meshkov intends to restore Crimea to the ruble area, give the inhabitants of the republic the right to dual citizenship, preserve a free medical service and education, and lead the fight against crime mainly by stepping up the penalties for all offenses. Meshkov advocates Russian status for Sevastopol and abolition of the act of 1954 [which transferred Crimea to the Ukraine]. He believes that the Black Sea Fleet must belong to Russia. Meshkov is against giving the Crimean Tatars a quota of deputies' seats in the future parliament of the autonomous formation. Sergey Shuvaynikov, the Russian Party candidate supported by Zhirinovskiy, received 13.5 percent. The results of the first stage of the elections in Crimea will undoubtedly provide food for thought for many people, and not only in Ukraine. Should they be viewed as the Crimeans' desire for a radical change in Crimea's status and state allegiance? Or is this just a protest against the general crisis in society which spontaneously developed into a vote against the man in power who personifies Ukraine more than Crimea itself? Kiev, meanwhile, can use the differences in Crimean and Ukrainian law to declare the elections unlawful and annul the results.
