He called for strengthening our Army's revolutionized, modernized, and regularized construction; for the overall improvement of the Army's combat ability; and for the provision of a strong and forceful security guarantee for reform, opening up, and modernization. In his speech, Zhang Zhen first reflected on the world-renowned great achievements in reform, opening up, and modernization in our country since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. With vivid and meticulous facts and figures, he detailed the positive situation and vitality in which our country enjoys political stability, economic development, ethnic unity, and social progress. He thought that, regarding the great achievements in reform and opening up over the past 15 years, education and propaganda must be carried out properly, to further unify thinking, arouse fighting spirit, and enhance soldiers' morale. NPC deputy Zhang Zhen said that the most basic reason enabling our country to make the great achievements is because we have upheld the party's basic line and have followed the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Practice has proven that this is the correct road. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has integrated the basic principle of Marxism with China's actual conditions, has established the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and has led us to realize the second historical leap. Zhang Zhen also said: There will still be various difficulties on the road ahead, but I believe that, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and under the strong and forceful leadership of the CPC Central Committee which has Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and with the strength and experience that we have acquired in the course of reform and opening up for more than a decade, and by the common effort of the people throughout the country, we are fully confident that we can win a new victory in reform and construction. In discussing army building, NPC deputy Zhang Zhen happily said that, under the new situation of reform and opening up, the entire Army has vigorously strengthened ideological and political work, and the Army's party spirit building, clean government building, and spiritual civilization construction have scored good results. A great enthusiasm for military drilling has emerged throughout the Army, which has drilled hard for the ability to fight, and military exercises have witnessed a good situation which has rarely been seen in the past. In the area of logistics, comrades throughout the Army have developed the good tradition of building the Army diligently and economically; the logistics departments of various levels have worked hard to increase efficiency in the use of funds; and soldiers have enthusiastically engaged in agricultural and sideline productions, making new progress. The building of the national defense reserve strength has also scored marked results, and militia and reserve units have played an important role in building the economy and safeguarding social stability. After reflecting on the achievements in army building over the past year, Zhang Zhen said that this has fully indicated that our Army is firm politically, is resolute in listening to the party's words, and is completely trustworthy to the party and the people. Zhang Zhen stressed that strengthening national defense, resisting aggression, protecting the motherland, and safeguarding the peaceful environment in which people work is the sacred duty entrusted to our Army by the constitution. Under the new situation of reform and opening up, the PLA has an important duty in the areas of safeguarding the country's security and maintaining social stability. Only by building a strong Army which is under the absolute leadership of the party and is loyal to the country and people can we maintain our country's security and stability and ensure a smooth process in reform, opening up, and modernization. Zhang Zhen pointed out that, in order to properly build the Army, we must first seriously learn from Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and must use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as his idea of army building in the new period, to arm the minds of the officers and men throughout the Army. Only by so doing can we further enhance self-consciousness for implementing the party's basic line and maintain our Army's high degree of stability, centralism, and unity. Zhang Zhen also mentioned the need to expedite the process of forumulating national defense legislation and use legal means to strengthen national defense and army building. In this area, we must abide by the laws and regulations promulgated by the NPC and the government and must implement them resolutely. Finally, Zhang Zhen also discussed with the deputies the problems of vigorously enhancing the sense of national defense among the whole people, actively supporting economic development in the frontier regions inhabited by minority nationalities, and giving play to the role of the militia and reserve units in maintaining law and order and social stability.
