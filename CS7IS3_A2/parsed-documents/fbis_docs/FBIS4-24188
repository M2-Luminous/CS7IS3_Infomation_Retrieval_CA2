This is the oil workers union, Nupeng [National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers], who are demanding Abiola's release, and are threatening to go on strike. But the ruling council, led by General Sani Abacha, is refusing to recognize Abiola's claims to the presidency, based on the abortive election held last June. On the line, Dan Isaacs asked Nupeng's secretary general, Frank Ovie Kokori, how much support there is for the strike: [Begin recording] [Kokori] We have been able to go round the whole country and got the mandate of all the zonal councils of Nupeng saying that if Abiola is not released -- not only just being released -- that he should actualize his mandate, and that the present head of state, who is the leader the junta, should work out a program for handing over peacefully to Abiola within the next seven days. [Isaacs] So are you and the union threatening to do if the government does not accede to these demands within the seven days you talk about? [Kokori, laughing] Normally, as a trade union we only have one option: the last option, which is the historical role of trade unions all over the world, and that is resorting to industrial action. I mean, an industrial action that will be sustained by all means until the people on the other side will see reason with us in the country. [Isaacs] Why do you think the government should take your action seriously? After all, you have taken industrial action in the past and been forced to backtrack and give up. [Kokori] No, we never gave up. Nupeng never gave up, you know that, and what happened was that the present head of state called Nupeng at that time and assured Nupeng that the issue of June 12 would be revisited, but the whole thing became a fraud. The government deceived every person.... [Isaacs, interrupting] But in reality, you know that industrial action like this will (?last) a little while, and in the end the government will win because it has the power. [Kokori] Well, that is your own view as a pressman. I am laborist [as heard] and I have been in labor struggles for years. (?It is only) an industrial union that could paralyze the soul of the Nigerian economy. [Isaacs] So (?your main intention) is to bring the Nigerian economy to its knees? [Kokori] I don't know. You predict that, but we say the people themselves are not happy with....[pauses] A man who is given the mandate, he is now being used and he is now being tortured as the underdog, whereas people who never had the mandate are now enjoying or ruling the country under the barrel of the gun. It is unfair. I think you will agree with me. [Isaacs] And your industrial action will continue until the government says it will honor the June 12, or until it [words indistinct] the June 12 presidential election of last year? [Kokori] If the way you are going [words indistinct], and those of us who are speaking to you now, we don't even know what will happen to us tomorrow. So we are on a struggle, on a historic political struggle. So it is not a [word indistinct], you will agree with me. It is a serious struggle we are all in (?for). [end recording]
