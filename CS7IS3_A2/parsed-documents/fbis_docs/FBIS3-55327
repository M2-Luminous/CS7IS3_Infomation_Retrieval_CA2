Prior to 1917, the Kremlin served as the Moscow residence of Russian emperors. In the famous St. George Hall, the distinguished guest is to be greeted by President Boris Yeltsin. The palace's largest hall, it is the place for state receptions and meetings dedicated to the Russian military order of St. George the Victorious. The snow-white walled hall is richly decorated with stucco moulding. The walls bear bas-reliefs showing St. George hitting a dragon. Above the cornice, under the ceiling, there are statues symbolising Russian army victories in the 15-19th centuries. The marble plaques on the walls and pylons bear gold-lettered designations of military units that distinguished themselves in battles and the names of the holders of St. George, among them prominent Russian military and naval leaders: Suvorov, Kutuzov, Ushakov and Nakhimov. The greeting ceremony in the Kremlin will be immmediately followed by bilateral talks between the presidents of Russia and the U.S. In-between their talks, the two presidents are to take a stroll about the Kremlin grounds. It is not yet known what landmarks President Clinton will want to take in but he is sure to take interest in the cathedral square featuring Assumption, Annunciation and Archangel Cathedrals, the bell tower of Ivan the Great and other world-famed monuments of ancient Russian architecture. The Hall of Facets adjacent to the Grand Kremlin Palace is rightfully reckoned a national architecture monument. The majestic and spacious hall, decorated with wall painting dealing with biblical subjects, is intended for state ceremonies. Territorial councils used to sit and Russian military victories were celebrated in it in olden times. A state reception in honour of the U.S. President is to be given in the Hall of Facets.
