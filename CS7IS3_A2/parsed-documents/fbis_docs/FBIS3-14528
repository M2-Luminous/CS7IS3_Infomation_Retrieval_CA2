Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto held a news conference today, the last day of her visit, before her departure. During the news conference she spoke about the results of her visit to the country, as well as other regional and international issues. At the outset of the news conference, the Pakistani prime minister expressed her sincerest appreciation for His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, may God watch over him, and for the Omani people, for the warm welcome and hospitality she and her delegation were accorded during their visit to the country. "I'd like to start by expressing my appreciation to his majesty, the government, and the people of Oman, for giving us such a warm welcome during the visit to your country." The prime minister said that her visit to the country is of a special significance, because we, in Pakistan, attach special importance to our relations with the Sultanate, especially since the Sultanate and Pakistan are geographically close to each other, in addition to the fact that they have historical relations, she added. Regarding her talks with His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, Mrs. Bhutto said: "While I was here in Oman I had the opportunity of not only discussing the areas that there can be economic cooperation, but also hearing his majesty on the world situation and the regional situation." The prime minister said: My visit to the Sultanate was not only to discuss economic relations, but also to hear his majesty's views on the international situation in general, and the regional situation in particular. Mrs. Bhutto added that she had discussed with his majesty the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, and that she had briefed him on Pakistan's stand toward the issue, and on her country's call for reaching a peaceful settlement of this crisis through international means. The two sides also discussed the Afghan issue, the Yugoslav crisis, and the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Mrs. Bhutto said that his majesty briefed her on the situation in this region, that she felt that the visit was very useful to her, and that this visit will be followed by other visits on the ministerial level. Mrs. Bhutto invited his majesty to visit Pakistan where he will be received with the same warm welcome and hospitality from the Pakistani people.
