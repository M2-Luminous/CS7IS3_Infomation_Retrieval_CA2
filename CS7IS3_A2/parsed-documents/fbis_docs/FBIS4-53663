Noting that humanitarianism assumes the class nature in every respect, the article says: Bourgeois humanitarianism is the world outlook reflecting the demand and interests of the capitalist class. The unscientific and reactionary nature of the bourgeois humanitarianism lies in that it is based on a wrong viewpoint that regards social human beings as individual biological beings that exist, dominated by nature, adapting themselves to the circumstances according to the instinct of animals, by bringing the social human beings down to the level of wild animals. The reactionary nature of bourgeois humanitarianism is clearly manifested, first of all, in its deceptive preaching of "philanthropy" and "humanity." It is the universal law governing the capitalist society that the stronger swallows up the weaker. Humanity and philanthropy are unthinkable in the capitalist society where exploitation and oppression prevail. Love and sympathy cannot be expected between the present-day wage slave-owners who abandon themselves to pleasure by overdriving the workers and the wage slave workers who have everything trampled down under harsh oppression and exploitation. The reactionary nature is also concentrically revealed in hypocritical preaching of "human rights" and "freedom." In the capitalist society based on selfishness, the principle "human beings are wolves toward human beings" prevails in human relations. Therefore, the society is replete with falsity, hypocrisy, swindle, fraud, antagonism, jealousy, plot and enmity which are fundamentally contrary to humanity. The popular masses cannot enjoy genuine freedom and rights in that society where it is the universal phenomenon to antagonize each other and sacrifice others for one's own ease and pleasure. Genuine humanitarianism can never be actualized in the capitalist society where human conscience, justice and all other human things are ruthlessly violated by money. The falsity of "humanitarianism" advertized by the imperialists and the reactionaries is proved by the reality of capitalism. In the capitalist society where a handful of capitalist class monopolizes everything including the state power and means of production, the working people are excluded from the rights to the exercise of sovereignty and the socio-political activities. Worse still, they are denied the rights to working, food, clothing, housing, medical treatment and learning. The situation is pretty much the same in those countries where socialism has collapsed and capitalism revived. The collapse of socialism has brought to the people an inhumanitarian society, capitalism where exploitation, oppression and social inequalities prevail and the human nature is trampled underfoot, not a "humanitarian and democratic society." The humanitarian idea can never be realised in the capitalist society where class oppression and confrontation constitute the mainstay of social relations.
