After discussing the situation which has developed in relations between the newspaper and its founder, the former Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation, the meeting adopted the following decision: On 23 December 1993 B. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, signed Edict No. 2277 "On the Transformation and Reorganization of the Council of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation." Part four of Article 18 of the Russian Federation Law "On the Mass Media" says that "in the event of the abolition or reorganization of the founder -- an association of citizens, enterprise, institution, or state organ -- the founder's rights and duties shall pass in their entirety to the editorial office unless otherwise specified by the charter of the editorial office." The Interim Charter of the editorial office which is in force at the present moment makes no other provision. The meeting states that the former Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation, as founder of the newspaper, has not fulfilled its statutory obligations with regard to assisting the work of the editorial office and providing it with information at its disposal. On the contrary, the chief editor and journalists have been impeded in the performance of their professional duty by workers of the government apparatus. In particular, the decree on the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI editorial office, which would have enabled it to work normally, and the new editorial charter have been held up within that apparatus for a long time now. Attempts are being made to get rid of an editor who is proving unsuitable. Criticism of the government will not be accepted. It has reached the point where certain apparatus workers have stated that the newspaper is "antigovernment." On the other hand, while remaining formally a government publication, the newspaper was considerably restricted in its actions, and the image of being an obedient semi-official publication, albeit an unjust image, had an adverse effect on its standing. The meeting considers that by becoming an independent publication but preserving in full the newspaper's profile as an all-Russia daily which covers questions of Russia's state life first and foremost, keep readers informed about the actions of the authorities, and monitors them on society's behalf, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI will be able to perform its social role considerably more freely and professionally. On that basis the meeting of the journalists collective of the editorial office resolves: 1 That in connection with the reorganization of the founder of the newspaper and on the basis of part four of Article 18 of the Russian Federation Law "On the Mass Media," the newspaper's editorial office in the form of its journalists collective shall be considered the founder of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. 2. That the "Interim Charter of the Editorial Office of the RSFSR Council of Ministers weekly ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI," which has operated since February 1991, shall be considered inoperative. 3. That a new charter is to be adopted for the editorial office of the sociopolitical daily newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. 4. That the newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI is to be registered at the Ministry of the Press and Information (the Committee for the Press) with its editorial office as founder. 5. The Ministry of the Press and Information (the Committee for the Press) is to be asked to approve the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI editorial office Charter. 6. The decision of the journalists collective of 21 December 1993 on confidence in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI chief editor V.N. Kucher is to be confirmed. [signed] P. Shinkarenko, chairman of the meeting N.
