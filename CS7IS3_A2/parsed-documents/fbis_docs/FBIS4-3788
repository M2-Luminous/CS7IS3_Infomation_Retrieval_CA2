The spokesman said China's stand on the islands and their adjacent waters enjoys the international legal basis; and Vietnam, which had carried out a number of illegal oil and gas explorations there in recent years, has infringed on China's sovereignty. Wu Jianmin said Beijing has repeatedly stated its position to Hanoi. He said while bilateral ties in general have been developing steadily, China hopes negotiations on territorial disputes will make progress on basic principles already reached between the two sides.
