FR941117-0-00084 FR941117-0-00011 (7) DIST is the distance between the two locations, in kilometers. §22.159 Computation of average terrain elevation. Average terrain elevation must be calculated by computer using elevations from a 30 second point or better topographic data file. The file must be identified. If a 30 second point data file is used, the elevation data must be processed for intermediate points using interpolation techniques; otherwise, the nearest point may be used. In cases of dispute, average terrain elevation determinations can also be done manually, if the results differ significantly from the computer derived averages. (a) Radial average terrain elevation is calculated as the average of the elevation along a straight line path from 3 to 16 kilometers (2 and 10 miles) extending radially from the antenna site. If a portion of the radial path extends over foreign territory or water, such portion must not be included in the computation of average elevation unless the radial path again passes over United States land between 16 and 134 kilometers (10 and 83 miles) away from the station. At least 50 evenly spaced data points for each radial should be used in the computation. (b) Average terrain elevation is the average of the eight radial average terrain elevations (for the eight cardinal radials). (c) For locations in Dade and Broward Counties, Florida, the method prescribed above may be used or average terrain elevation may be assumed to be 3 meters (10 feet). §22.161 Application requirements for ASSB. Applications for base stations employing amplitude compandored single sideband modulation (ASSB) must contain the following information: (a) The application must describe fully the modulation characteristics, emission and occupied bandwidth, and specify the center frequency of the emission for each channel, carrier frequency, and pilot channels, if any. The emission must fall completely within a channel assignable for two-way operation in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, Rural Radiotelephone Service or Offshore Radiotelephone Service. (b) The application must contain interference studies between stations within an authorized bandwidth, whether FM-to-ASSB, ASSB-to-FM, or ASSB-to-ASSB in accordance with the following: For ASSB stations, the transmitter nearest to the protected station must be used. The effective radiated power in the direction of the protected station must be the sum of the peak effective radiated power of all transmitters in the group, in the direction of the protected station. The antenna center of radiation height above average terrain must be the highest antenna center of radiation height of any transmitter in the group in the direction of the protected station. The channel of the group is assumed to be the same as that of the protected station (co-channel), and studies must be made in accordance with §22.567. §22.163 Minor modifications to existing stations. Licensees may make modifications to existing stations without obtaining prior Commission approval provided: (a) Classification as minor . The modifications must be minor. Modifications to a station are minor if an application filed solely for the purpose of obtaining authorization for such modifications would not be classified as major in accordance with §22.123. (b) International coordination . The modifications are limited to those for which individual coordination of the channel assignment(s) with a foreign administration, under applicable international agreements and rules in this part, is not required. (c) Antenna structure clearance required . For any construction or alteration that would exceed the requirements of §17.7 of this chapter, licensees must notify the appropriate Regional Office of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA Form 7460&hyph;1) and file a request for antenna height clearance and obstruction marking and lighting specifications (FCC Form 854) with the FCC, PRB, Support Services Branch, Gettysburg, PA 17325. (d) Provision of information upon request . Licensees must supply administrative or technical information concerning the modified facilities upon request by the FCC. At the time modifications are made pursuant to this section, licensees must make a record of the pertinent technical and administrative information so that such information is readily available. See §22.303. (e) Notification required for modifications affecting CGSA . Licensees in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service must notify the FCC (FCC Form 489) of any modifications made under this section that cause a change in the Cellular Geographic Service Area boundary (including the removal of a transmitter or transmitters). The notification must include full size and reduced maps, and supporting engineering, as described in §22.953(a)(5) (i) through (iii). If the modification involves a contract service area boundary (SAB) extension (see §22.912), the notification must include a statement as to whether the five year build-out period for the system on the relevant channel block in the market into which the SAB extends has elapsed, and whether the SAB extends into any unserved area in that market. The notification must be mailed or delivered to the filing place (see §22.106) no later than 15 days after the modification is made. §22.165 Additional transmitters for existing systems. A licensee may operate additional transmitters at additional locations on the same channel or channel block as its existing system without obtaining prior Commission approval provided: (a) International coordination . The locations and/or technical parameters of the additional transmitters are such that individual coordination of the channel assignment(s) with a foreign administration, under applicable international agreements and rules in this part, is not required. (b) Antenna structure clearance required . For any construction or alteration that would exceed the requirements of §17.7 of this chapter, licensees must notify the appropriate Regional Office of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA Form 7460&hyph;1) and file a request for antenna height clearance and obstruction marking and lighting specifications (FCC Form 854) with the FCC, PRB, Support Services Branch, Gettysburg, PA 17325. (c) Environmental . The additional transmitters must not have a significant environmental effect as defined by §§1.1301 through 1.1319 of this chapter. (d) Paging and Radiotelephone Service . The provisions in this paragraph apply for stations in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service. (1) The service area and interfering contours of the additional transmitter(s) must be totally encompassed by the composite service area contour and predicted interfering contour, respectively, of the existing station on the same channel; except that this limitation does not apply to nationwide network paging stations or in-building radiation systems. (2) Additional transmitters in the 43 MHz frequency range operate under developmental authority, subject to the conditions set forth §22.411. (3) The additional transmitters must not operate on control channels in the 72&hyph;76 MHz, 470&hyph;512 MHz, 928 MHz, 932 MHz, 941 MHz or 959 MHz frequency ranges.
