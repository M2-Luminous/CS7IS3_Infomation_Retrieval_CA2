This retribution will be terrible, the inflammatory speaker in his olive-green "leisure suit" said to his circle of crypto-Teutons in front of a blazing bonfire, calling for "different" times. The "terrible visionary," neo-Nazi leader Gottfried Kuessel, 35, who has been imprisoned since 7 January 1992, was sentenced to the minimum term of 10 years imprisonment for neo-Nazi activities. Now the state prosecutor has appealed the verdict and is calling for a more severe sentence. In view of the letter-bomb attacks -- friends of Kuessel were arrested after the series of attacks -- officers of the state police searched cell West E 27 in the high-security wing of the Krems/Stein prison, the current address of the neo-Nazi leader. More than 500 letters were confiscated in the secret nighttime action on the instructions of the state prosecutor. This is the first interview Kuessel gave after the terrible series of bomb attacks. His lawyer, Dr. Otto Tuma, asked the would-be Teuton the questions on behalf of WIENER, making a verbatim record of Kuessel's answers. WIENER emphasizes that we do not identify ourselves with the statements of Gottfried Kuessel in the following interview. [Tuma] Mr. Kuessel, you are in the hospital wing of Stein prison. What is your health situation? [Kuessel] The gallstones that developed while I was in prison were not only not treated in the Vienna Landesgericht Prison, but completely wrongly diagnosed, which resulted in permanent bilious attacks since early 1993. As far as I can see, the problem has been solved now through an operation. [Tuma] You have been imprisoned for two years. Describe one day in Stein prison. [Kuessel] At the moment, I am in the high-security wing and do odd chores in the house. This means that between 0700 and 1500 I work in the house. The time after work and before I go to bed is generally dedicated to study, to work on my files, and to read and write letters. [Tuma] What are you reading at the moment? [Kuessel] Wisnewski/Landgreber/Sieker's The RAF Phantom, Eibl-Eibesfeldt's Man, the Risky Being, The Baghavadgita, and computer books. [Tuma] Are you still in contact with your friends, maybe through letters? Also with those in prison? [Kuessel] At the moment, that is to say for about one month, my correspondence has been interrupted for dubious reasons. I hardly receive any mail. I assume that the letters are deliberately withheld from me by some authorities. Moreover, in a search of my cell, all my letters, which had to pass through the censors anyway, were confiscated for dubious reasons; all that happened despite the fact that my contact with friends and acquaintances is limited largely to private and philosophical questions. [Tuma] You get regular letters from your friends in Germany. What are the contents of these letters? [Kuessel] As I said, these letters are exclusively of a private or philosophical nature. [Tuma] Which of your friends in Germany have not disappointed you, and which have? [Kuessel] I did not expect anything special from any of my acquaintances and friends, which is why nobody could disappoint me. Since a central organization has been a dream that was dreamt up mainly by the media, but also by the authorities, and is to be maintained at any cost and regardless of the truth, and is, thus, to be made a reality in public, I did not expect much from anyone. [Tuma] What was your first thought when you learned of the letter-bomb attacks? [Kuessel] That somebody is presently trying to work against the natural developments in the 1994 election year! [Tuma] Do you personally see any connection between your arrest and the letter bombs? [Kuessel] No, because I do not think that the people I know were able to carry out such attacks, and any protests would certainly have been held as early as September or October 1993. Apart from the immediate victims of the attacks, those who are affected are only national and politically "correct" groups. This should have been obvious to anybody who ever studied the theory of the issue of individual terror. The Austrian population understands such attacks only to a very limited degree and certainly does not support them. Therefore, I think the forces behind these letter bombs are interested in the defamation of the political opposition in Austria and want to act against political opponents even with the methods of a police state. The violent actions of the authorities against persons from rightist and national circles, and the request for even farther reaching legal possibilities, show clear parallels with the actions of the FRG authorities against the left in the 1970's. People with courage should try and consistently think through the question of who benefits from that. [Tuma] What would you personally tell Vienna Mayor Helmut Zilk, who was severely injured by a letter bomb? [Kuessel] Personal talks should remain personal, although the basic tenor is certainly that physical violence against political opponents, irrespective of where they come from and how they represent themselves, is unacceptable. [Tuma] How would you describe your current role and position in your so-called community of people? With the same convictions? [Kuessel] I am a political prisoner -- nothing else! [Tuma] What aspects, what political positions do you see in a different light now that you have been in prison for two years? [Kuessel] The suppression of those who think different politically has been stepped up, and we are further away than ever from implementing the principle, which at the beginning stood for development toward political freedom, and was defined by Rousseau: "I shall fight against your opinion as severely as I can, but I shall also fight for your right to articulate it." [Tuma] Did you make any mistakes? [Kuessel] In retrospect one is always wiser. With what I know today, I would certainly have reacted differently to certain things. However, considering the situation in which I was at the time, I hardly ever had any choice to act differently from the way I did. [Tuma] What do you think of people such as Franz Radl, both junior and senior, Peter Binder, Alexander Wolfert, and Gerhard Endres? (those persons were arrested after the series of letter-bomb attacks last year -- the editors) [Kuessel] I consider those whom I know to be politically minded people who would not carry out acts of terrorism! Most of those people you mentioned have been under public observation for some time and are aware of it. On the other hand, they are all intelligent enough to know it. Thus, I think I can rule out that even one of my friends has had anything to do with the letter bombs. [Tuma] Who are the "most promising" brains in your movement? Are they Bela Althans, Christian Worch, or Arnulf Priem? (Althans, Worch, and Priem are among the leaders of the German neo-Nazi scene -- WIENER editor's note) [Kuessel] Since there was and, as far as I know, there is no "movement," I think it is a waste of time to think about this question. Apart from those who you mentioned, there are enough other intelligent, interesting personalities in Europe, the names of whom are well-known and who can speak for themselves. [Tuma] The Russian nationalists were the clear winners of the parliamentary election. Does this circumstance have any influence on your or similar movements? [Kuessel] The developments in Russia are interesting from a geopolitical point of view, and I think it is advisable not to isolate the Liberal Democratic Party in terms of foreign policy, but to take the desire of so many Russian voters into consideration and conduct talks with the representatives of this party for the prosperous development of all peoples on the basis of political and economic independence. [Tuma] An indiscrete question: After such a long time in prison, what is the relationship with your girlfriend like? [Kuessel] You are right, this is an indiscrete question that I do not want to answer indiscreetly. What unites me and my fiancee is not a "relationship," or "affair," or "partnership," but love. This love has been strained by the unfortunate circumstances. Nevertheless, I trust in this love! [Tuma] What are your plans for your life after prison? [Kuessel] Considering the length of time, I cannot really speak of plans. Nevertheless, I am "using" the time behind bars to study, study, and study to prepare for any eventualities after my release. Many prisoners leave prison and are fully dependent on the state. I am planning to take life into my own hands -- whenever, wherever, and under whatever circumstances!
