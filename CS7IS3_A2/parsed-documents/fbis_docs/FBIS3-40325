He received us in the red salon of the Patriarch's Palace in Belgrade, which is "reserved" for all official visits to the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Visibly fatigued because of his numerous duties and still more frequent requests from many foreign media wishing to convey what the patriarch has to say in their respective countries, Patriarch Pavle responded--in his own way--to all the questions we put to him. [Kuburovic] It is often said--in differing connotations, unfortunately--that the Serbs are a chosen people, "people of heaven." What, in your opinion, Your Holiness, does that mean, and where is that promised land of Serbia? [Pavle] You recall the words of Mother Jevrosima, that is, the words of our people spoken through the person of Mother Jevrosima: "Do not, son, speak falsely, influenced either by your father or your uncles, but look only to the justice of the true God. Better to lose your head than to commit a sin against your soul." Those lines contain in compressed form the historical and evangelical view of the Serbian people, the rule, the core and soul of that people, by which it has lived for centuries. It is true that we are men, children, of the earth, but we are also children of heaven. That is why down through the centuries there have been members of our people--both men and women--who have achieved the ideal of the evangelical doctrine: Saint Sava, Saint Basil of Ostrog, Saint Peter of Cetinje, Holy Prince Lazar, and so many others. We who live in these times are of the same flesh and blood as they were, and so we should strive to be the chosen people, that is, to live according to evangelical principles. That, as far as I am able to understand, is what it means to say that the Serbs are a chosen people. [Kuburovic] A chosen people, then, is a people that tries to live according to all the principles of justice.... [Pavle] Yes. According to the principles of justice, God's truth, and everything that is holy and honorable and acceptable to dear God. But to generalize and to say that all Serbs are holy and honorable is not only inaccurate, it is immoral, to say the least. So, we can only say with pride that there have been individuals in our people who have set the standard, and it is from them that we came to be called the chosen people and chosen Serbia. But to say that all Serbs have been such, we do not even dream of thinking that. [Kuburovic] Does that mean that every people, thanks to honorable individuals who have set the standard for entire generations, can at a particular moment refer to themselves as chosen? [Pavle] Our church deals with quality, not quantity. It is not the number of believers that is important, but the sincerity and depth of their belief. This is pointed out to us by the Lord himself and Jesus when he refers to Moses tending the sheep of his father-in-law Jethro in the desert. He saw a bramble bush that was burning, but was not consumed. Moses went to see this sight and heard a voice from the bush: "Moses, put off thy shoes from they feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Abraham is the father, Isaac the son, and Jacob the grandson. God refers to himself as the God of three men from three different generations, although there were millions of people in each of those generations. God does not refer to himself as the God of the millions, but the God of the holy. It is up to us, then, to try among the millions to be people who are not inhuman, but among those individuals who strive toward divine justice. [Kuburovic] Recently, public interest of both believers and others has focused on a letter which you sent out some time ago to the clergy of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which in a way fixed how much a priest could collect for his services. What is that about? [Pavle] Saint Paul the Apostle, in referring to maintenance of the Old Testament clergy, told the Christians: "Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple, and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel" (1 Corinthians 9:13-14). It is clear, then, that the faithful have a duty to support their pastors who preach God's word to them and perform services for them. Over time, that maintenance has been provided in various ways. Now, in most of our church this is done by the believers, when services are performed, providing funds to the priest for his support, either in money or in kind. This is not the buying and selling of God's blessing, nor, as it is said, "a charge for clerical services." The letter pointed out that the parishioners' ability to pay must be taken into account, the priest must bear in mind that now it is a question of survival for both under these great economic difficulties. [Kuburovic] Does that mean that the priests of the Serbian Orthodox Church do not receive a monthly salary when they are supported by the contributions of their congregation? [Pavle] Ever since the war, priests have not had any pay except what they received from their congregation. To be sure, in the practice of the Christian church, and this goes back almost 2,000 years, and in many countries that principle is respected even today, congregations support their own priests. To be sure, priests had a duty to take only as much as they really needed, but today it is difficult to make a strict definition as to how much is really needed. And we have been informed that there are priests who have been raising their standard of living in an unexemplary way and at the expense of their congregation, which accounts for these disagreements, dissatisfaction, and criticism. [passage omitted] [Kuburovic] Some of your actions, including the frequent use of public transportation, surprised the public. Although many of our people have now become accustomed to meeting you on the street, in a bus, or in a train, they nevertheless wonder: Why is the Serbian patriarch not traveling by car like his predecessors? [Pavle] I have heard that there are people who think that this is some kind of posturing on my part, because, as a man on the street told me, "I understand that there are times when there is a need to astonish people." That view is utterly foreign to me as well as to Christianity in general. People probably do not know that I come from the country, that after the war I lived for a long time in an area where there was no public transportation, and usually one had to go on foot, and even when there were vehicles, the monasteries were almost always left far from the main highway. In these times today, we have all forgotten man's real need to walk, to clean his lungs and limber up his legs. For years, I have been accustomed to walk and this is no difficulty for me. But people are people, they interpret everything according to their own thinking. I will not deny that the patriarchate has a car and gasoline, but in these times of scarcity it is essential to preserve what we have. What would happen if we had no reserve of fuel in the patriarchate and the patriarch of Istanbul came to visit? We would certainly be in an inextricable position, but people from the rest of the world have a hard time understanding our troubles. [Kuburovic] Your Holiness, you are a man known for not liking to attract public attention. Still, there have been very frequent occasions when some act of yours caused a stir. I am thinking specifically of Arkan's visit to the patriarchate and to you personally. There is talk that in connection with that visit about 300 priests held a meeting and informed you that they objected to your having received him. Many are therefore wondering whether you are aware that in these times of political ferment there are party leaders who will represent that meeting as an expression of your support for his party and policy? [Pavle] I receive people in politics mainly as people, not as presidents or members of this or that party. That was also my approach in this case, considering it my obligation to meet everyone who requests this of me on the spiritual plane. Those are the reasons why I acceded to the call of a man condemned to death to visit him in the Nis prison and take his confession. I also went to Zabela near Pozarevac to talk to a man sentenced to 20 years in prison, just as I responded to the call of Vuk Draskovic when he was in prison. Why, then, would I not receive Zeljko "Arkan" Raznatovic as well? I have made use of all these meetings with political figures to call upon them, assuming that they have certain influence, never to forget that it is their obligation to always behave as men and adhere to the principles of the Gospel. I remind those who have forgotten that Christ said: "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." And then He said: "They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick." Seeing it as my pastoral duty that I should always talk to all people who seek it of me, I am ready to accommodate whenever I can. [Kuburovic] But you do not deny that certain people want to misuse the meeting with you in an attempt to use the church for certain interests of their own? [Pavle] It is true that some people want, not only want, but are in fact striving, to tie the church to their own boat and yoke it up to their own cart. We all know that there are people in politics today who want to manipulate everyone and everything, including the church, but we in the Serbian Orthodox Church cannot reconcile ourselves to that. The church does not want to pull the wool over anyone's eyes by manipulating the doctrine of the Gospel, but it likewise tries to protect itself from all those who would use it, lead it, and mislead it. [Kuburovic] Does that mean that the Serbian Orthodox Church is neutral, more precisely, uninterested in politics? [Pavle] We know it is not possible to be neutral, and that is why we always try to act for the good of our people, but in such a way that that action does not harm any other people either. The church, and the Serbian Orthodox Church in particular, has never wanted to govern all and everything in this world; it has always tried to be what the father is in the family, making itself heard only when some serious situation arises. It is the role of the church to advise both the people and individuals what their duty is, which often we forget when some very serious situation arises. [Kuburovic] For years now, along with all the other troubles which have befallen it, the Serbian Orthodox Church has suffered from a dangerous disease: dissension. Incidentally, other Orthodox churches have not been spared this either, they also have their dissenters. Therefore, Your Holiness, please give us your comment on the events in Cetinje on Saint Luke's Day. Is autocephaly something to be demanded when someone has a political need for it? And why do you think atheists are so interested in having "their own" church? [Pavle] The church was established 2,000 years ago in order to serve the people, but not to serve it by human measure, but by the measure that comes from God, and that means that it ennobles the intrinsic characteristics of any people. If the church, however, exceeds that measure, and because of interests that come from this world it misses its aim and ceases to be the "pillar and bastion of the truth," allowing people to hitch it up to their own cart, then the church ceases to be God's church and becomes a political church. It does not surprise us, then, that the atheists should be striving to hitch the church up to their cart, because they understand the role the church has and could have among people, and so they want to use it for their own purposes. Our duty, I am referring to the church, is not to allow ourselves to be manipulated. Not because we want to be above everyone else and to tell everyone what to do, but simply because it is the obligation of the church to act for the good of all men. As for the church in Montenegro, it has always been a part of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Presumably, Patriarch Arsenije III Carnojevic, who was born in Cetinje, and then Bishop Visarion, and Bishop Sava, and then Bishop Peter I the Holy, and Bishop Peter II, knew to what nationality they belonged and what church they served. People who do not understand that, and it rather appears they do not want to understand it, the less truth they have in their hands and the weaker their evidence, the louder they get. We should therefore remember the principle of the Holy Father that in conversation we be mild in our speech and strong in our evidence. Never the other way around. That is why it is clear to us--upon hearing the strong words in Cetinje in defense of a so-called independent Montenegrin church--we realized that they had no evidence at all. You could see that these people shouting in Cetinje, talking about some church of their own, did not even attempt to cross themselves. [Kuburovic] It seems that the Cetinje dissension is a continuation of what happened a few decades ago according to the Macedonian formula, which is special because church dignitaries are chosen by the acclamation of the "people," that is, by a particular policy. [Pavle] Back in Turkish times in Montenegro, the popular assembly did choose the political ruler, but never the spiritual ruler. To be sure, it is another matter that in Montenegro the spiritual and political leaders were often the same person. The final split with the church in Macedonia, which has not been recognized by any Orthodox patriarchate in the world, actually occurred because our church could not allow spiritual leaders to be elected in a secular council. It was clear to everyone that this was a case of political abuse. [Kuburovic] Now that splits in Orthodoxy have been mentioned, we cannot fail to ask you whether suffering in common has brought the Orthodox peoples closer together and unified them? After all, by all appearances today it is somehow the Orthodox peoples suffering the most: the Russians, Jews, Serbs, and the sanctions against our country are not bringing any good to the Bulgarians, Romanians, and Greeks, inflicting immense financial loss on them. [Pavle] The Orthodox peoples have always had something that joined them together, and that unity in trouble has become still more pronounced and direct. You recall that Njegos said: "Sympathy is a kind of support." It is enough for someone to understand us, and if at the same time they offer material and spiritual support, that is exceedingly important. There is a rule that troubles shake up a person, indeed even entire nations, so that they are able to sense what is essential, what brings them closer to others. All of us Orthodox peoples have a need for us to support one another with our common faith, to do what we can--not less--and what is in our power, and what the time and occasion requires, we believe that God will act on our behalf, as he has done for our ancestors. [Kuburovic] Some people say of this time that it is a time of trial for Orthodoxy and Christianity in general. [Pavle] To be sure, in the place where they arose 2,000 years ago--in Egypt, Palestine, and the East--Orthodoxy and Christianity have been almost entirely wiped out. Only God knows why this is the case. But if there must be suffering for the truth and justice, then it is 1,000 times better for us to disappear because of the truth and justice than for us to remain on the road of falsehood, injustice, and evil. [Kuburovic] Is not a world congress for the Orthodox peoples and churches more necessary in this time than ever before? Is that precisely what representatives of the 14 regional Orthodox churches from all over the world agreed on some time ago in Geneva? [Pavle] Since the eighth century, the Orthodox Church has for one reason or another never had a worldwide congress, and the issues have built up over the centuries. All the Orthodox churches and peoples have a common need to resolve them. I cannot say when the long-awaited Eighth World Congress of Orthodox Churches and Peoples will take place. There are difficulties in organizing the congress, from the question of where to meet to political pressures and the Iron Curtain behind which various Orthodox churches have lived at one time or another. The Geneva meeting of representatives of the world's Orthodox churches of which you speak will certainly help to clear the way to holding future meetings and to resolving the very important issues such as qualifying for autocephaly. [passage omitted] [Kuburovic] You talk to foreign journalists almost daily. What do they ask you most frequently, Your Holiness, do they understand that the world has contributed to the occurrence in the former Yugoslavia of what none of the nationalities would have wished upon themselves? [Pavle] It is true that we frequently meet foreign journalists, whom I try to introduce to things which I know are not easy for them to understand. When they ask me: Who is to blame for this unfortunate Yugoslav war? I answer what I really think--that we ourselves are most to blame, and that means the Serbs, the Croats, and the Muslims, but that Europe and the United States also have a share in all our troubles. It is difficult, however, for foreigners to understand our reality--our historic divisions not only from the time of World War II, but also earlier--even when they are the most well-intentioned, but especially if they have certain interests of their own. Unfortunately, the world wants to fit us with a cap made for itself. One of the journalists from the outside world to whom I talked recently seems to have gotten a good understanding of the world's influence on the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia, and he told me: "What are you going to do when the breakup of Yugoslavia is often being decided on by people who do not distinguish Slavonia from Slovenia or Slovakia?" Thus, I have been accused, after a recent visit to Austria, of talking about events in Bosnia and making no distinction between the Muslims and the Turks. Those who make those utterly groundless accusations against me perhaps do not know that I lived in Bosnia for 10 years before the war when I was going to junior high school in Tuzla and in the classroom I had a Muslim on one side and a Croat on the other. So I know Bosnia quite well, I do not confuse the Turks with the Muslims, but neither do I accept that the Muslims are Bosnians, that is, autochthonous, and the Serbs aggressors who came I know not from where, presumably from Serbia, having decided to drive that autochthonous people from its home. If people in the outside world took a bit more care with the facts, the historical facts, they would know that as far back as the 10th century Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus mentioned the Serbs in Bosnia, saying that they had a border with the Croats at Livno and on the River Cetina. Historical facts are historical facts: In the 12th century, the Priest Dukljanin records that the Serbs were settled from the great River Drina westward, which is called Bosnia, but eastward all the way to Lab in Kosovo. Ignorant of this or not wishing to know it, some people would at this point like to prove to us that the Serbs belong only in Serbia. It seems some people want to prove that the only place for the Serbian Orthodox Church is in Serbia, and so they are bombing the seats of the bishops, the church treasuries, temples, and ancient monasteries. The most recent in the series of these unfortunate examples occurred on the night of the Catholic Christmas in Karlovac, where the headquarters of the Orthodox bishop was bombed, the building was destroyed, and no one knows what happened to the rich treasury, whether it was looted or buried. [Kuburovic] All of this is happening at a time when the metropolitan of Zagreb and Ljubljana has been asked by the government to return to Zagreb for the Orthodox Christmas, having fled from there two and a half years ago. How will the Serbian Orthodox Church react to all that? [Pavle] In principle, as I understand it, no one has the right to prevent church officials from visiting their congregations and directing them. I am referring here not only to the Orthodox, but to priests of the other faiths as well. But in reality it is different: Seven Orthodox bishops cannot return to their seats, and a new trouble has occurred, an explosive charge was planted in the bishop's palace in Karlovac. How can the Serbian Orthodox Church, then, tell Bishop Nikanor of Upper Karlovac to return to Karlovac or Bishop Lukijan to go back to Pakrac, when they have nothing to go back to there? That is why the church will not tell anyone to go or not to go, but it is clear to everyone that the conditions do not exist for going back, at least for the present. We know of the need, the important need, for priests to be with their people, but it is difficult to expect people, not only if they have a family, but even if they are monks, to risk their lives for the church they serve. We hope that the time will come when priests can return among their believers in safety. [Kuburovic] Are you encouraged, Your Holiness, by the fact that at the recent ecumenical meeting in Pecuj representatives of all the religious communities of the former Yugoslavia unanimously signed the declaration condemning not only the war, but also the sanctions? [Pavle] We are, of course, encouraged that everyone unanimously--all the representatives of the Roman Catholics, the Orthodox, and members of the Islamic Religious Community--condemned the war and the sanctions, although, it is true, they did not mention by name against whom those sanctions were imposed. It is good to see a change beginning in the conception that there is no collective guilt of one people, because war crimes are committed only by individuals, not by entire peoples. We have always felt and have tried to represent to the world that in these times we cannot behave as in the time of Hitler and Mussolini, who punished entire peoples for a nonexistent collective guilt. To our great regret, again in the case of the Serbian people the world has applied the principle of collective punishment to an entire people. It is therefore a particular success that representatives of the religious communities from the former Yugoslavia unanimously condemned the war and the sanctions, and sanctions were applied only against the Serbs. [Kuburovic] Does it not seem to you that the outside world, although it does not recognize its own participation in provoking the Yugoslav war, is trying in a way to correct its mistake by issuing permits to the Serbian Orthodox Church to import 4,000 metric tons of food from Bulgaria and Greece? [Pavle] It is true that the UN Security Council did issue us a permit to import a large quantity of food and drugs, but it is also true that the period of time given us to accomplish that is extremely short, and we are fearful about whether we will succeed in getting together the necessary funds. And a great deal is needed to purchase such a quantity of food and drugs. But let us hope that the Serbs in the outside world will once again this time help even more than they are able, and it is up to us to do everything to distribute the aid as fairly as possible. Unfortunately, it must also be said that people ready to take advantage of the suffering of others for their own personal gain always turn up in times of great trouble. So-called war profiteers are making money from the misfortune of their people. The government, of course, has a duty to protect us from such people, but while evidence has been found for many of them, innocent people are suffering. [Kuburovic] At the time when this issue of NIN reaches its readers, we will be celebrating Christmas. What kind of Christmas message, Your Holiness, could you convey to all Serbs both in the country and abroad, but also to all people of goodwill all over the world? [Pavle] I desire peace for all peoples in the world and hope that God will help so that no nation and no state in the world goes through what has befallen us. We need peace as the foundation of everything necessary in this world, and for us Christians Jesus represents our peace. He said: "I leave you My peace, I give you My peace." How necessary peace is and the extent to which we Orthodox know how to appreciate peace is evident in the liturgy of Saint John the Eloquent, which is used the most in the Orthodox Church. The word "peace" is mentioned more than 30 times in that liturgy. The reference is, of course, to man's peace with God, which then brings peace for man himself and all people. That need for peace is very strong in our people. That accounts for the custom of saying "God's peace be with you," a greeting that the Serbs have used down through the centuries on Christmas: "God's peace be with you! Christ is born," just as the Serbian people long ago understood the value and need for peace, I would like to see that peace prevail between our people and among all peoples in the world, both our friends and enemies, greeting them all with the old Serbian greeting on the holiday of Christ's birth: God's peace be with you--Christ is born!
