The land-locked province, whose economy has for long been hindered by inconvenient communications, neighbors Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar (Burma), having a border of 4,060 km. Officials said that the past 15 years have turned Yunnan into one of the frontiers of China's reform and opening-up. It has so far opened two-thirds of its counties to foreigners and established eight state-level and eight province-level outlets on the border. International cooperation in economy, science, technology, culture, education, sports and public health resulted in the approval of 509 foreign-invested enterprises in Yunnan last year. Using self-collected funds and cooperating with Myanmar, the province's border areas last year built and upgraded highways to three important towns in north Myanmar, much improving communications between them. In Ruili and Wanding business people from outside the two countries are arriving in surges. By the end of last December the three towns of Hekou, Tianbao and Jinshuihe on the Sino-Vietnamese border reopened. The provincial capital of Kunming is now linked by highways with the important northern Vietnamese port of Haiphong, via the border town of Hekou. China's only state-level outlet on the border with Laos was also opened in Yunnan last year. Two-way border trade between Yunnan and the three countries has been increasing by large margins to reach more than 2.87 billion yuan-worth last year. The Mekong River, which winds through China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, has turned out to be an economic bond among the countries. Since 1990 China and Laos have repeatedly launched inspections, and experimental sailings, of the river. Last year China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand surveyed 360 km of the river during the dry season, obtaining abundant data on dredging and navigation. In January this year experts from the four countries sponsored a conference here to study the prospects of official navigation of the river. The two ports of Jinghong and Simao along the Lancang River, the name of the part of the Mekong in Chinese territory, have been approved as state-level outlets designed to promote the local economy. The Yunnan provincial government has reached agreements with Laos, Thailand and Myanmar to build two highways connecting the two countries. The highways will then be extended to Malaysia and Singapore. Meanwhile, a local railway line in Yunnan is being extended to Dali in the western part of the province and is expected to eventually link up with the railway network of Laos. Yunnan's plans to connect itself with neighboring countries by water, road and rail have aroused interest of the Asian Development Bank, which has provided loans for these communication projects. Kunming airport has become a major international airport in the region, as it has opened direct air routes to Rangoon, Bangkok, Chiangmai, Singapore, Vientiane, Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong. The city also envisages developing routes to Phnom Penh and Ho Chi Minh City. Currently the province is building and upgrading other airports, including those at Zhaotong, Lijiang and Dali. Seven of the airports will open to traffic by the end of this year. Meanwhile, Yunnan is making efforts to improve the highways connecting Kunming and the outlets on the border, such as Hekou and Xishuangbanna. Officials said major highways within 200 km around Kunming will have been upgraded by the end of next year. To date, Yunnan has established trade and economic ties with more than 100 countries and regions worldwide. Last year the province registered a two-way trade volume of over 1.21 billion U.S. dollars- worth and received more than 400,000 overseas visitors. Provincial Governor He Zhiqiang said that Yunnan is keen to consolidate and expand cooperation with Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, as well as to develop cooperative channels with the Republic of Korea, Australia and Indonesia. He said his province also intends to initiate economic ties with Cambodia, the Philippines and Brunei, while engaging in promoting friendly relations with India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. During the first Kunming export commodities fair last August, Governor He vowed to turn the annual event into an influential international fair as a measure to promote Yunnan further in the global arena.
