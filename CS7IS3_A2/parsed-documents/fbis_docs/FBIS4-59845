At the meeting, the president emphasized the expansion of economic cooperation between the two countries in line with diplomatic ties. He said: Although there are grounds for cooperation between Asian countries, it is not at the expected level. Perhaps the tendency to cooperate with the West and lack of complete confidence and trust in the natural facilities and potentials in the region is one of the factors preventing its realization. Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed the necessity for the two countries' joint committee to become more active to present to the world a suitable example of regional cooperation. At the meeting, Jaffery said: Implementing the agreements reached between Iran and Pakistan, particularly those reached during Mrs. Benazir Bhutto's visit, are always stressed by the Pakistani Government.
