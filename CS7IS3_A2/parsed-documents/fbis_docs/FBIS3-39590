On the left, the Left Democrat-led progressive front announced agreement on candidates -- with the Greens, in particular, saying their demands had been fully met -- and the Left Democrats unveiled a government programme to "rebuild Italy" via job-creation-through-growth, "fairer" taxes, a further reform of the electoral system to introduce a double ballot and facilitate "a clear choice of parliamentary majority and premier," and the attribution to local government of "all the functions not expressly given to central government." The 32-page programme of the Left Democrats thus made important concessions to regionalist urges by envisaging "tax autonomy" for local and regional governments. It also proposed the transformation of one of the two houses of parliament into a regional assembly. Expressly ruling out one of the fears raised by the right, it said there would be no tax on Treasury bonds (BOTs). After the electoral accord on the right between the Northern League and Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy) in northern Italy and between the latter and the far-right National Alliance in the rest of the country, the centre thus remains the one "pole" still to agree on candidates. Segni indicated this evening that he would not be pressing for a veto on some candidates who have been seen as too closely identified with past political ways, by saying that he would only issue an "overall" judgement on the People's Party lists. People's Party leader Mino Martinazzoli rejected the view that the two centrist forces had been on the verge of breaking apart, saying that "if demands are not too excessive and there is an awareness of the political validity of the accord, things can be sorted out." The deadline for naming candidates is tomorrow; the deadline for presenting them is Monday [21 February] -- provided that 250 signatures are collected for each candidate.
