The ministry reported that cumulative revenues from taxes levied as of April for fiscal 1993 came to 47,496.83 billion yen, up a scant 0.8 percent from the year before but lower than a 2.3 percent growth estimated in the third supplementary budget. The figures are for taxes in fiscal 1993 that ended on March 31. The taxes collected as of April 30 came to 87.2 percent of the 55,650.00 billion yen estimated in the supplementary budget, the rate being down 1.2 percentage point from a year earlier. "Attaining the supplementary budget estimates is not easy," a ministry official said, citing the lower-than-expected growth in declared income tax proceeds. He said it all depends on corporate and consumption taxes to be collected in May for the fiscal 1993 book closing in March by almost all Japanese companies. "We can't give definite estimates because big fluctuations are expected," he said. But private think tanks projected an overall revenue shortfall of some 1 trillion yen for fiscal 1993. Because of the prolonged economic slump, the government has already trimmed tax revenue estimates twice in two extra budgets following the initial 1993 budget. Cumulative proceeds from declared income tax as of the end of April came to 4,573.96 billion yen, up 0.9 percent from the year before, but sharply lower than the estimated 11.4 percent growth. Yearly declarations are made by March, and declared income taxes are levied in April. "Declared income tax revenues are certain to fall below the estimates" of 5,302.00 billion yen, the official said. Overall tax revenues for April alone came to 5,150.68 billion yen, up 1.7 percent from the year before, the ministry reported. Income tax revenues in April totaled 3,563.21 billion yen, up 3.5 percent, with cumulative revenues standing at 22,991.85 billion yen, up 2.1 percent but lower than the previously estimated 3.9 percent growth. Declared income tax proceeds in April rose 5.8 percent to 2,299.64 billion yen, and withholding tax revenues fell 0.5 percent to 1,263.57 billion yen. Corporate tax proceeds in April fell 8.0 percent to 551.23 billion yen, stemming from sluggish earnings by both major and smaller companies that closed their books in February, the official said. As a result, cumulative corporate tax revenues stood at 8,937.71 billion yen, down 10.2 percent, compared with a projected 1.5 percent decline. Consumption tax revenues dropped 8.0 percent in April to 427.69 billion yen, with the cumulative amount standing at 3,932.74 billion yen, up 9.1 percent and higher than an estimated 4.1 percent rise. As for other major items, the official said there were no major changes in the tax revenue trends.
