It was addressed by its leader, Etienne Tshisekedi -- the first time he has made such a big public appearance in a long time. He comes as the tussle over the prime minister's post drags on interminably. Tshisekedi says he is the legitimate premier. President Mobutu won't hear of it, and there is a split in the opposition alliance, the Sacred Union, with some parties deserting Tshisekedi and putting up their own candidates. Chris Green asked journalist Mikheli Ron in Kinshasa what the atmosphere has been like at today's rally: [Begin recording] [Ron] I mean, it was an atmosphere of great enthusiasm, very cheerful. There were probably about 20,000 people in all, and they crammed into the botanical gardens -- which is in the center of Kinshasa. There were people waving green bands, which is the usual sign of victory and peace, and a lot of people had to climb up into trees to get a glimpse of the stage. Women were taking off their rags and laying them down on the floor to form a ceremonial carpet for Tshisekedi to walk on as he came into the botanical gardens. [Green] So it seems they gave him a fairly extravagant welcome? [Ron] He got a very enthusiastic reception. He always does, but he hasn't actually been seen in public for quite a while. The last big crowd event was when his mother died, and there were a lot of people who turned up for her funeral, but he hadn't actually spoken in public for the last three months. [Green] And what did he say today? [Ron] His message was, as ever, that he remains the prime minister of Zaire and expects to be reconfirmed by President Mobutu. He appealed to President Mobutu to approve his position as the prime minister, to sign the decree that would make that legal, and he said that if this doesn't happen he is willing to call for a general strike in the state's diamond mining company, the MIBA [Bakwanga Mining Company], and he said that now that the copper mining industry, Gecamines [General Quarries and Mines Company], has virtually closed down, this would obviously bring the whole of Zaire's economy grinding to a halt, and that.... [Green, interrupting] Is that actually a credible threat on his part? [Ron] I think it is credible, in that if he were to launch that kind of call he might well get a response. Yes, I think he does have that kind of popular support. [Green] Did Tshisekedi have anything to say about relations among the parties opposing Mobutu? [Ron] Well, relations are extremely strained at the moment between his UDPS party and some centrist opposition parties that are fielding their own candidates for the post of prime minister. Last week France, Belgium, and the United States sent their diplomats to his house to ask him to reopen talks with those parties. Today, he wasn't being very conciliatory. He basically said that those parties are welcome to come back into the fold, but they will have to show solid signs of good faith before they will be accepted. He did not really.... [Green, interrupting] Solid signs of good faith presumably means full support for Tshisekedi? [Ron] I think that is what he means. He certainly wasn't showing any signs of compromise.
