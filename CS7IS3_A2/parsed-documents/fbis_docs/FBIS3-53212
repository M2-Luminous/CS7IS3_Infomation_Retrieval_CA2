[passage omitted] The attack first came to light earlier the same day with a report in the English-language Tehran Times newspaper which blamed it on Iran's main armed opposition group, the Mojahedin-e Khalq [MKO]. The attack was a "premeditated plot to damage" Iran's prestige and undermine its "recent improved relations with European countries," it said. The Mojahedin, in a statement sent to AFP in Nicosia, denied the charge as "absurd" and countered that the attack was the work of the Iranian government. "With the deepening of the regime's economic and political crises, Khomeyni's heirs have found the only recourse in stepping up domestic suppression and terrorism," it said. [passage omitted] Sunday's shooting comes amid on-going tension in relations because of the death sentence issued by Iran's late spiritual guide Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni against British writer Salman Rushdie.
