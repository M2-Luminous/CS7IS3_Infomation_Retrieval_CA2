FR940816-1-00012 FR940816-1-00006 PANAMA CANAL COMMISSION 35 CFR Part 103 RIN 3207&hyph;AA36 General Provisions Governing Vessels AGENCY: Panama Canal Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: Under existing regulations, fees for booking transits at the Panama Canal are assessed at a fixed rate per Panama Canal Gross Ton. The Panama Canal Commission has proposed a major revision of the rules for measurement of vessels using the Panama Canal expected to become effective October 1, 1994. Under the proposal, the existing rules of measurement will be replaced with the Panama Canal Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS). PC/UMS will no longer utilize a Panama Canal Gross Tonnage value. Accordingly, fees for the use of the transit booking or reservation system must be assessed on some other basis. This proposed rule recommends retention of the existing method of calculating booking fees for vessels subject to PC/UMS transitional relief measures and the fixing of fees for all other vessels in reference to the PC/UMS Net Ton. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before August 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be addressed to Michael Rhode, Jr., Secretary, Panama Canal Commission, 1825 I Street NW, Suite 1050, Washington, DC 20006&hyph;5402, (Telephone: (202) 634&hyph;6441), (Facsimile: (202) 634&hyph;6439). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael Rhode, Jr. at the above address and telephone. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 18, 1994, the Panama Canal Commission published in the Federal Register (59 FR 18332) an advance notice of proposed rulemaking with a request for comments and a notice of hearing with respect to a related matter_a complete revision of the Rules for Measurement of Vessels for the Panama Canal as set forth in 35 CFR part 135. Comments were solicited and received, and a public hearing was held May 25, 1994 in Washington, DC. The views presented by the interested parties were considered by the Board of Directors of the Panama Canal Commission. The Board gave final approval on July 13, 1994 to proceed with implementation of the PC/UMS. The proposed rule together with the Board's recommendation was forwarded to the President for his approval. The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on July 18, 1994 (59 FR 36398). It is expected that, on or before August 30, the final rule will be approved by the President and published in the Federal Register . It is scheduled to become effective October 1, 1994. Corresponding changes in the transit booking system regulations are necessary to reconcile 35 CFR ยง103.8(e) with the aforementioned revisions to the rules for measurement of vessels using the Panama Canal. Under existing ยง103.8(e), fees for booking transits at Panama Canal are assessed at $0.23 per Panama Canal Gross Ton. With the expected replacement of the existing regulations on October 1, 1994, a Panama Canal Gross Ton value will no longer exist. Instead, under the revisions, the new PC/UMS will utilize a PC/UMS Net Ton value. Accordingly, in order to continue using tonnage as the basis for rate assessment for the transit booking system, fees must be assessed on the tonnage value used in the PC/UMS. Therefore, the Commission proposes that for vessels transiting the Canal for the first time after September 30, 1994 transit booking fees be fixed in relation to the PC/UMS Net Ton. At the same time, however, the Commission desires to minimize the financial impact of the change on the customer. As with the PC/UMS itself, the Commission is striving for revenue-neutrality in the aggregate and for minimal impact for the individual customer. Therefore, the proposed rule also provides special relief measures for vessels which have previously transited the Canal.
