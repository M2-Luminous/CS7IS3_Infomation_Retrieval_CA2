Informed sources in the administration of the Chita region have told ITAR-TASS about two cases of army units seizing power installations in eastern Trans-Baykalia in the first ten days of April. The first incident was reported in the Borzinsk district, where the power suppliers cut electricity supplies to one of the military units which failed to pay for the earlier supplies. The army reacted promptly by occupying an electricity substation. Some days later a similar case was reported in the Chernyshevsky district. Both conflicts were settled only after state authorities intervened. The army units stationed on the territory of eastern trans- Baykalia have not been adequately financed for some time already and owe the electric power sector about five billion roubles (2,822 million dollars)
