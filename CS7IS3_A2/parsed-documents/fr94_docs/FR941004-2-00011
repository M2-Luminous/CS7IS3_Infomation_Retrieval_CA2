FR941004-2-00011 FR941004-2-00005 Verification As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify information used in making our final determination. Suspension of Liquidation In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from India, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register . The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated dumping margins, as shown below. This suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping margins are as follows: ␣ 1Manufacturers/producers/exporters 1Margin percent Sivanandha 10.16 Karmen 37.04 All others 15.85 Article VI, paragraph 5 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade provides that ``(no) product *␣*␣* shall be subject to both antidumping and countervailing duties to compensate for the same situation for dumping or export subsidization.'' This provision is implemented by section 772(d)(1)(D) of the Act. Since antidumping duties cannot be assessed on the portion of the margin attributable to export subsidies, there is no basis to require a cash deposit or bond for that amount. Accordingly in this investigation, Sivanandha's FMV is based on home market sales and hence, the antidumping margin must be adjusted. In the Preliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from India, (59 FR 28337, published June 1, 1994), Sivanandha's export subsidy was 3.53 percent ad valorem, which will be subtracted from the margins for cash deposit or bonding purposes. The rate listed above reflects this adjustment. Since Karmen only has U.S. sales, its FMV is based on CV which reflects export subsidies. Because the export subsidies were reflected in both USP and FMV, the subsidies did not affect the margin calculations using CV. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or the posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping margins, as shown above. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. ITC Notification In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry within 75 days after our final determination.
