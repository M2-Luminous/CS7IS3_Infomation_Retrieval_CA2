"The situation isn't easy to assess," he added on the eve of a visit to Rome during which he will meet the Berlusconi government's economics ministers as part of the multilateral European surveillance being applied to the Italian accounts under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty. According to Ravasio, current thinking at Commission headquarters is that the Italian taxation system must be put into order, a topic that he said will be on the agenda during the EU summit on the island of Corfu at the end of the month. "When a system is too complicated, it's unlikely to be efficient," he said, pointing out that far more taxes are levied on the Italians than on their counterparts in other EU nations. The complexity of the system also holds down the size of the tax take, he asserted. Ravasio pointed out that the International Monetary Fund had also given Italy the same advice, adding that Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini seems "very active" on this front too. Ravasio's mission is not linked to granting Italy the third ECU2 billion tranche of an EU loan granted to the Amato government to help tide over the public finance crisis. "The Italian Government has still taken no decision on the issue, and no request has yet been received for the third tranche," he said. The EU finance ministers are given the job of monitoring the European economies under the Maastrict Treaty to check whether they are making progress towards their convergence targets. Achieving them should culminate in turning the ECU into Europe's single currency. "The objective is to reach the end of 1996 with a majority of the countries ready to adopt a single currency in 1997," said Ravasio. "The Commission's latest studies seem to show that this is not impossible."
