The rise of grain and edible oil prices since November last year has been brought under control, he said, and the prices of these commodities in the markets throughout China are stable as a series of measures have been taken by governments at all levels. At present, most of the state-owned grain shops sell grain at marked prices with unlimited supply, the official said, adding that in some areas the prices of grain and edible oil have dropped. China will continue to strengthen the management of the markets and control and supervision of the prices, he said. "Those who seek exorbitant profits through driving up prices will be punished severely," he said. He mentioned that a series of reform plans involving taxes, finance and investment will come out this year. "The government will take effective measures to soften the negative impacts of these plans on society," he stressed. In addition, measures such as increasing salaries, and subsidies and incomes of farmers will be taken. Meanwhile, China will spare no efforts to develop its economy to guarantee supply, the official said. The state reserves of grain in 1994 will be sufficient, while the supply of edible oil, sugar and some articles of everyday use will meet the demand. "China has the conditions to keep prices low and markets stable," he said.
