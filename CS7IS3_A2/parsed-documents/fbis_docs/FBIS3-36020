At a meeting with the president's regional representatives on Monday, he said that the organizational and theoretical work to set up such a party has already started. A while ago, at a news conference in the Kremlin on the results of elections to the Federal Assembly, Boris Yeltsin said it was necessary to form a political force supporting the president's course. There will be no compulsory membership in the president's party, however, there is a provision for: A structure at the top that will work on issues of financing and of the electoral campaign in terms of preparing for 1995-1996, when the competition for the post of head of state will unfold. Guidelines for the future party will be spelled out in the presidential message that Yeltsin will deliver to the Federal Assembly on 18 February, Filatov assumes. This will be a major document set to develop the Russian Constitution, he said . Representatives of the Russian president in regions also intend to promote the formation of the presidential party. Thus, an inter-regional constituent conference is scheduled for 7 February in Samara. On the same day a similar conference is planned in Moscow. According to Nikolay Medvedev, head of the Russian presidential administration for work with territories, it is people who are not involved in local administration who should initiate the creation of this party, rather then the president's representatives in regions. Structures of the presidential party may have different names in regions, for example: People's Party or Party of Support for the Reform. The heart of the matter is that, according to its idea, the party must unite democratic forces across Russia.
