Although manufactured at the technological level of the 1960's, it has been exported to several countries in the world. It is armed with a 100-mm cannon with a rifled bore, which is loaded manually, and then the PKT 7.62-mm (or SGM) coaxial machine gun and the DShKM 12.7-mm antiaircraft machine gun. Numerous modifications and improvements have now been made in the T-55 tank in order to increase its rate of fire, armor protection, and mobility. More or less successful results have been achieved. When production of control systems for the M-84 tanks was being prepared in our country, the same system was installed in T-55 tanks still in use in units of the VJ [Army of Yugoslavia]. That was the first refinement and improvement of the characteristics of this armored fighting vehicle. Following those first modifications, it turned out that its combat and technical characteristics could be considerably improved with minor profitable investments, that is, the effectiveness of its fire could be increased, armor protection could be raised to a higher level, and the work of the crew could be facilitated by installing special devices. That, of course, would also increase the likelihood of the personnel's survival and protection of assemblies under the most extreme conditions of use. This tank's rate of fire was increased by installing two launch rails for Malyutka antiarmor guided missiles. As is well-known, they can hit enemy armored vehicles and fortified structures over a range from 500 meters to 3 km, which improves the T-55 tank's ability to wage antiarmor combat more effectively over greater distances. At the same time, the missile operator is protected from enemy fire. Two antiarmor missiles are mounted on each launch rail; they are guided from the control panel in the tank. The mechanism for elevation of the cannon's barrel is used to set the missile's basic slope at the time of launching. The operator guides the missile by looking through the tank's existing sights, in which the magnification factor is increased by additional optical equipment. In addition to the missiles on the launch rails, there are four more missiles on the tank's turret. Modifications to the T-55 have also improved the characteristics of the ammunition, and installing heat-insulating pads on the external surfaces of the cannon's barrel have reduced more than 80 percent deformations occurring during action because of uneven cooling. This has increased the accuracy of the main armament--the cannon. Because an entire family of hand-held antiarmor weapons for close combat has developed in recent years, including, for example, rocket launchers with shaped-charge warheads, it was reasonable to strengthen protection against these projectiles. At the same time, increasing the tank's overall armor protection would have been very expensive and impractical, and it would have considerably increased the tank's total weight and reduced its mobility. That is why a system for protection against the shaped charge similar to the design on the M-84 tank was installed on the tank. That is, screens to protect against shaped-charge warheads are used on this tank to protect the tank's flanks beneath the mounts of the boxes and fuel tanks, the critical line where the tank's armored floor plates join the sides, and also surfaces at the level where the tank's turret joins the armored hull. Twelve launchers have also been installed on the front of the turret to eject smoke canisters in front of the tank at distances greater than 100 meters. The launch tubes, the firing panel, and other equipment were taken over from the M-84 tank. Thanks to use of smoke-canister launchers, the tank is camouflaged by a smoke screen on the forward side, which reduces the disadvantage of the smoke screen of the heat-smoke apparatus of the engine, which, depending on the wind direction, is mainly created behind or to the side of the tank, and provides it insufficient protection from the front. The smoke canisters are so designed that they can be activated electrically and by hand and thrown around the tank. Aside from making it possible to eject smoke canisters, the launch tubes increase the turret's protection against the shaped charge. Actually, projectiles fired at the tank are activated when they strike those tubes before they hit the turret, which reduces their effect during action. A plow has also been installed on the T-55 tank so that it can dig itself in; it is on the lower front slanted plate of the nose, making it possible for the tank to dig itself in in 15 to 20 minutes depending on the soil type and category. It takes two to three minutes to convert the plow from working to traveling position or the other way around. This modification has made the tank more independent in providing its own cover, and the plow serves as an armor plate affording additional armor protection to the front of the tank. The improvement and modifications to T-55 tanks, although carried out under conditions of the embargo, have considerably improved essential tactical and technical characteristics of this medium tank, above all the rate of fire over longer range and protection against shaped charges. This has secured its survival on the battlefield and made it possible to respond decently to the enemy's tanks.
