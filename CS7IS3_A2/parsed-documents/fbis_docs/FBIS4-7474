[Ekov] From the historical point of view, the name is the same. We both claim that we have legitimately inherited it. Some of the tasks that our organization and [VMRO-DPMNE leader] Ljupco Georgievski's organization have set for themselves are the same, such as the democratization of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and the struggle for its final recognition. Nevertheless, these seem to be the only things that we have in common. Unfortunately, despite its name, the DPMNE has betrayed the principle on which the VMRO has always based itself and developed. I mean the defense of the Bulgarian spirit in Macedonia. An ideology has been adopted embodying a regime of terror and all the repressive methods of the Macedonian state, along with the theory of an independently existing Macedonian nation. Thus, Macedonian nationalism, partly rejecting the outdated form of the Communist Party, is trying to assume some kind of democratic image. Naturally, this was not accepted by part of the DPMNE, which was followed by an inevitable split. Those who thought differently organized a new VMRO -- the Fatherland Party [Tatkovinska Partiya], led by Dimitar Crnomarov, former deputy chairman of DPMNE, who was expelled for "pro-Bulgarian tendencies." Unfortunately, these are unpleasant facts that affect our national interests. However, they should be known so that the Bulgarian public may be acquainted with the biased and hostile feelings prevailing among the ruling forces in the Republic of Macedonia. [Tikhova] In that case, what kind of Macedonia should be established and by what means? [Ekov] It should be an independent, sovereign, and democratic Macedonia, based on legal, political means. [Tikhova] Do you mean Vardar Macedonia, or all three parts? [Ekov] We are talking about Vardar Macedonia. The truth is that after 1934, when the VMRO, which was an underground organization at the time, and the legal organizations were also dissolved, the slogan for an independent Macedonia within its geographical borders was raised. Then came World War II. The Paris system of peace accords actually buried the idea of a "geographic" Macedonia. To talk about the creation of a new, united Macedonia today means causing an explosion in the Balkans. We have a typical example of how borders are being shifted here. In our opinion, the Macedonian problem, whose crucial point is related to the fate, the rights, and freedoms of the Bulgarian population in Vardar and Aegean Macedonia, should be decided by opening the borders rather than shifting them. If this should appear as utopia today, it could become reality in the future. Let us recall that many similar conflicts have existed in Western Europe, but see how the problem between Germany and France related to the no less controversial territories of Alsace and Lorraine was resolved. There is no reason to believe that different kinds of people live in the Balkans, people who are incapable of settling their conflicts in the same manner. [Tikhova] Nevertheless, the Macedonian problem also affects Albania. [Ekov] Yes, you are talking about Mala Prespa, Korchansko, and Golo Brdo.... We went to Albania for the first time in July 1993. I shall never forget what I experienced during my meetings with the people there. The people could not believe that Bulgaria had remembered them. Most of them identify themselves as Bulgarians, although I must admit that some of them behave like Albanians, while others try to appear as Macedonians. [Tikhova] Nevertheless, how did we reach a situation in which it is possible to talk about Bulgarians in Albania? [Ekov] Albania has not recognized a Bulgarian minority, but it is tolerant toward activities aimed at cultivating the Bulgarian spirit of self-preservation among individual members of our population in Albania. We have no claims and do not intend to raise any claims toward the Republic of Albania for recognizing the Bulgarian minority. In our view, the solution of the problem should be sought in terms of guaranteeing individual rights. [Tikhova] The organization whose successors you are did not particularly respect the sanctity of human life. Does the historical memory of the VMRO bear some marks of guilt? [Ekov] If anything is on our conscience, it may be the unnecessary fratricidal conflicts during some periods of our organization's existence. However, such deadly conflicts were inspired from the outside. It is impossible to react with traditional methods when one is deprived of all real opportunities whatsoever to express his free will, and when one is subject to physical violence and brutality. The revolutionary terror exerted by the organization was always a reaction to the violence used first in the Turkish Empire and later on in Greece and Serbia against the Bulgarian population. Whenever the VMRO had the opportunity to do so, it became a legal organization. World War I gave us the opportunity for the legal establishment of a party defending the interests of the Bulgarian population both in the Vardar part and in the Aegean region. Hence, the choice of our methods was not prompted by the organization, but was rather imposed by external circumstances. [passage omitted] [Tikhova] Is it true that Mr. Tatarchev is introducing a split in the ranks of the VMRO? [Ekov] I doubt it, because Mr. Tatarchev has repeatedly proved to be in sympathy with the goals and tasks of the VMRO, as well as with the practical activities of the organization. He is the descendant of a family that has given much to the organization. [Tikhova] Generally speaking, there can be no question of a split within the VMRO-SMD? [Ekov] I think that we have learned from the numerous splits of the past, and we are the only organization that has not split today. [Tikhova] How could you resist the currently escalating activities of the Ilinden United Macedonian Organization [OMO] [Ekov] In our opinion, we have always resisted it through our active propaganda work on a local scale and by our persistent demands that the official Bulgarian institutions should do their duty in preventing subversive activities directed against the state. Many people would like to see us involved in a conflict, but it has already become evident that such things belong to the past. As a matter of fact, OMO has long since been a fiction, solely supported by the interests of the mass media.
