They might also be witnessing the closing chapters of the story of the Alliance. Tough-talking by Beijing officials and last week's scuffles between Alliance members and Hong Kong police outside the Xinhua headquarters in Happy Valley have left people with little doubt that the Alliance, already branded "subversive" by Beijing, will not be allowed to survive after 1997. Formed in 1989 at the height of the democracy movement, the Alliance -- an umbrella organisation with 222 member subgroups -- is the largest political organisation in Hong Kong dedicated to the promotion of democracy in China. In the past five years, it has consistently condemned political prosecution and called for the release of political prisoners in China. Every year, its schedule is filled with events to remind forgetful people in Hong Kong of those sad days in 1989 and of mainland activists in jail for taking part in the movement. At an information centre set up by the Alliance, news clippings, books, journals 'and video tapes are freely available to anyone interested in learning more about the democracy movement. Apart from all these activities the Alliance has been acting discreetly behind the scenes. Dozens of mainland dissidents have been smuggled out of China with its assistance. Many have been granted asylum and have settled in the West. It also maintains an extensive communications network with dissidents in the mainland who have been forced underground by the authorities. But when the soldiers from the People's Liberation Army march across the Shenzhen River at midnight on June 30, 1997, all these contacts may come to an end. Although they won't admit it in public, many of the Alliance leaders are prepared -- at least psychologically -- for the grand finale. Its financial reserve which stood at about HK$5.7 million [Hong Kong dollars] by last April can be depleted by 1997. "We have paid the price for doing all these things," said liberal legislator Cheung Man-kwong, who is a member of the Alliance's standing committee. "(Those in the Legislative Council) will have to step down in 1997...It is our conviction that the crackdown will one day be rehabilitated." At present, seven of the 20 standing committee members of the Alliance are Legislative Councillors. Since there will be no "through-train" for the council in 1997, their membership of the Alliance will not affect their chances of serving beyond the handover. It will, ironically, probably help boost their image to help them win seats in the 1995 elections. While it is obvious that the days of the Alliance are numbered, there is little indication of what its leaders are preparing to do in the final count-down. Veteran activist Lau Shan-ching, who spent 10 years in a Chinese jail for his political views, believes the Alliance might have to shut down its underground operation and act strictly according to the law. "I think the Alliance may have to stop activities like smuggling dissidents out of China that can be considered illegal after 1997," said Mr Lau who is also a member of the standing committee. "Although we will stand firm on our principles, we can't afford to give them an excuse to disband us." The activist, often criticised for his radical political views, warned that the 1997 deadline could prove more unpredictable than most people expect if the future Special Administrative Region government handles it poorly. "There will be demonstrations on July 1, 1997...but I don't expect the Alliance will play a leading role. Its (the Alliance's) leadership is kind of conservative," Mr Lau said. He also feared that if the Alliance was disbanded by the future SAR government its followers would be driven into forming "radical political groups" resulting in chaos in the streets. "They (the SAR government) will have to go to court if they are to disband us. If that happens, I am not sure that they will win," he said. His biggest criticism of the Alliance was that it has failed to offer its followers a clear political direction on China and has done very little in counteracting the psychological warfare launched by Beijing after the 1989 crackdown. While he acknowledged the Alliance had promoted concepts such as press freedom and right of assembly among its followers, it had failed to "educate" them about "falsehoods" propagated by the communist party. "I think it is not enough just to call for the rehabilitation of June 4 The Alliance has to point out more forcibly that all these problems China is facing today are in one way or another because of the crackdown. People are beginning to agree with them [communists] that the crackdown was justified as the economy is booming and the situation in China is stable. But that's not true, he said. "We must point out that the Communist Party has lost its ideology. It is bound to fall apart after Deng Xiaoping dies. That's what the Alliance has failed to do. "Without a clear message, we will lose our support." Mr Cheung dismissed the suggestion that public support for the Alliance was fading although less people were taking part in its organised activities. "Who still goes to Xinhua to protest these days? The heat has died down. We cannot attract the media any more. News of our activities has been placed far down the page in newspapers. But it's exactly because of these things that there is a need to go shouting against these abuses. It's easy to forget. Once people forget the pressure (on the Chinese Government) would also be reduced," he said. Looking forward, Mr Cheung said with many dissidents now either in hiding or exile, the Alliance would concentrate on lesser-known activists in prison, like Shanghai dissident Yang Zhou. "We will fight till the last minute. Even though it's the last minute should we not fight then?" Mr Cheung said. "Don't underestimate the silence at the moment. A large number of the people who have witnessed the bloody crackdown still live. And no one could forget the Nanjing massacre," a reference to the 1937 massacre by the invading Japanese army. If the Alliance survives after 1997, Mr Lau said, it would be the first group of political activists to organise memorial activities on June 4 in land ruled by China.
