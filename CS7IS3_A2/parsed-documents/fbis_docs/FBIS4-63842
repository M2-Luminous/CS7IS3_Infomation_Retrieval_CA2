At the end of last week 'Ali Salim al-Bid, deputy chairman of the Yemen Republic's Presidential Council, announced the secession of the south of the country and the formation of a new independent state -- the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]. Moreover, elections to the Presidential Council were held almost immediately in the southern capital of Aden, and it is planned to form a government of the republic in the very near future. In a statement on this issue, an ITAR-TASS correspondent reports, 'Ali Salim al-Bid stressed that the new state is "part of the Arab nation and its political system is based on the principles of party and political pluralism." The DRY sees its main aim as being to restore Yemeni unity on the basis of the Document of National Accord and Reconciliation signed 20 February this year. At the same time, the leader of the "Southerners" called on Arab states to recognize the DRY and give it every possible assistance. This development of events has forced 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the leader of the "Northerners," to issue an order to resume the offensive on Aden which was suspended for the Muslim feast of 'Id al-Adha. Bloody battles have again been launched in the vicinity of the al-'Anad Air Base, 56 km from the southern capital. Judging by everything, the "Northerners" have succeed in establishing control over this strategically most important installation. Indirect confirmation of that was the statement from the "Southerners'" military command to evacuate arms dumps and stores of material and technical resources from the region. At the same time, there have been reports of the construction of defensive fortifications in the suburbs of Aden. Meanwhile, almost a month of fighting has shown that neither side has been able to win the strategic initiative. Different sources in Sanaa have admitted that the resistance from the "Southerners" has been "unexpectedly stubborn." In 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's opinion, this is also happening because "certain countries are continuing to supply arms to Aden." In this connection 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih stated that these actions will be seen as blatant interference in the country's internal affairs, with all the ensuing consequences. He also warned against any attempts to voice support for or to recognize the DRY. Strangely enough, there are some stubborn rumors in Sanaa that the first state to recognize the independence of South Yemen has been Russia. This has forced Russian Foreign Ministry representatives to categorically deny these fabrications. Viktor Posuvalyuk, director of the Department for Near East and North African Countries, stated that Moscow is expressing extreme concern about the continuation of hostilities in Yemen and is calling for a cease-fire, which would benefit the entire Yemeni people.
