Talking to newsmen at Moscow's Vnukovo-2 airport before boarding a flight for Milan, Chernomyrdin said the Federation Council, too, would be able to see what was what in the economy and would endorse the budget. According to Chernomyrdin, the Duma committees had done a great job. After the draft budget was presented to the Duma on May 11, he said, they came out with more than 300 amendments to that document. Doing it all over again would make no sense, Chernomyrdin said. His impression was, some individuals were simply afraid to have nothing to do. In Chernomyrdin's view, it was about time for the government to work on a draft budget for 1995, instead of going back to what it had already done. Chernomyrdin said the government had pledged to come out with a draft budget for 1995 in September.
