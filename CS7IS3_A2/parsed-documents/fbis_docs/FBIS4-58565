Approximately 250 freed prisoners arrived in the Gaza Strip and the remainder in Judaea and Samaria. This was reported by Palestinian sources this evening to our correspondent Moti Amir. The sources claimed that the IDF had presented erroneous figures and misled the media with regard to the exact number prisoners released. Our correspondent notes that IDF sources this evening confirmed that due to last-minute technical problems, less than 400 Palestinian prisoners were released today, and not 1,000 as originally intended.
