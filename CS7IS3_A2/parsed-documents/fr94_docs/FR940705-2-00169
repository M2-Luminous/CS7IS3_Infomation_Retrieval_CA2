FR940705-2-00169 FR940705-2-00091 Note: Recombinant DNA or RNA molecules derived therefrom, which contain less than two-thirds of the genome of any eukaryotic virus (all viruses from a single Family (see Section V-Q) being considered identical (see Section V-S), are considered defective and may be used in the absence of helper under the conditions specified in Section III-D&hyph;1. Section III-C&hyph;3-a. Experiments involving the use of infectious or defective Class 2 animal viruses (see Section V-A, Appendix B-II, and Appendix B-II-E) in the presence of helper virus may be conducted at BL2. Section III-C&hyph;3-b. Experiments involving the use of infectious or defective Class 3 animal viruses (see Section V-A and Appendix B-III-D) in the presence of helper virus may be conducted at BL3. Section III-C&hyph;3-c. Experiments involving the use of infectious or defective Class 4 animal viruses (see Section V-A and Appendix B-IV-D) in the presence of helper virus may be conducted at BL4. Section III-C&hyph;3-d. Experiments involving the use of infectious or defective Class 5 viruses (see Section V-A and Appendix B-V) in the presence of helper virus shall be determined on a case-by-case basis following NIH/ORDA review. A U.S. Department of Agriculture permit is required for work with Class 5 agents (see Sections V-R and V-T). Section III-C&hyph;3-e. Experiments involving the use of infectious or defective animal or plant viruses in the presence of helper virus are not covered in Sections III-C&hyph;3-a through III-C&hyph;3-d and may be conducted at BL1. Section III-C&hyph;4. Experiments Involving Whole Animals This section covers experiments involving whole animals in which the animal's genome has been altered by stable introduction of recombinant DNA, or DNA derived therefrom, into the germ-line (transgenic animals) and experiments involving viable recombinant DNA-modified microorganisms tested on whole animals. For the latter, other than viruses which are only vertically transmitted, the experiments may not be conducted at BL1&hyph;N containment. A minimum containment of BL2 or BL2&hyph;N is required. Caution_Special care should be used in the evaluation of containment conditions for some experiments with transgenic animals. For example, such experiments might lead to the creation of novel mechanisms or increased transmission of a recombinant pathogen or production of undesirable traits in the host animal. In such cases, serious consideration should be given to increasing the containment conditions. Section III-C&hyph;4-a. Recombinant DNA, or DNA or RNA molecules derived therefrom, from any source except for greater than two-thirds of eukaryotic viral genome may be transferred to any non-human vertebrate or any invertebrate organism and propagated under conditions of physical containment comparable to BL1 or BL1&hyph;N and appropriate to the organism under study (see Section V-B). Animals that contain sequences from viral vectors, which do not lead to transmissible infection either directly or indirectly as a result of complementation or recombination in animals, may be propagated under conditions of physical containment comparable to BL1 or BL1&hyph;N and appropriate to the organism under study. Experiments involving the introduction of other sequences from eukaryotic viral genomes into animals are covered under Section III-C&hyph;4-b. For experiments involving recombinant DNA-modified Class 2, 3, 4, or 5 organisms, see Section V-A. It is important that the investigator demonstrate that the fraction of the viral genome being utilized does not lead to productive infection. A U.S. Department of Agriculture permit is required for work with Class 5 agents (see Section V-R and V-T). Section III-C&hyph;4-b. For experiments involving recombinant DNA, or DNA or RNA derived therefrom, involving whole animals, including transgenic animals, and not covered by Sections III-C&hyph;1 or III-C&hyph;4-a, the appropriate containment shall be determined by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Section III-C&hyph;5. Experiments Involving Whole Plants Experiments to genetically engineer plants by recombinant DNA methods, to use such plants for other experimental purposes (e.g., response to stress), to propagate such plants, or to use plants together with microorganisms or insects containing recombinant DNA, may be conducted under the containment conditions described in Sections III-C&hyph;5-a through III-C&hyph;5-e. If experiments involving whole plants are not described in Section III-C&hyph;5 and do not fall under Sections III-A, III-B, or III-E, they are included in Section III-D. Note: For recombinant DNA experiments falling under Sections III-C&hyph;5-a through III-C&hyph;5-d, physical containment requirements may be reduced to the next lower level by appropriate biological containment practices, such as conducting experiments on a virus with an obligate insect vector in the absence of that vector or using a genetically attenuated strain. Section III-C&hyph;5-a. BL3&hyph;P (Plants) or BL2&hyph;P + biological containment is recommended for experiments involving most exotic (see Section V-W) infectious agents with recognized potential for serious detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems when recombinant DNA techniques are associated with whole plants.
