The plan is part of moves by the government to practically screen each and every military project before it decides the defense budget, EPB officials said Monday. The decision was apparently prompted by suspected irregularities in the Yulgok project and a recent artillery ammunition scandal. Public criticisms have been rising against the misuses of taxpayers' money under the pretext of military buildup. In the past, the Defense Ministry asked for an annual budget for the Yulgok projects without specifying in detail where it was going to use the money. Because of the nature of the projects, the military has maintained that they had to be kept in secret. From now on, however, all Yulgok projects are to be subject to screening by budget compilers at the EPB, who will check the need and soundness of each project. The Yulgok projects had accounted for 30 percent to 40 percent of the total defense spending every year. The Yulgok project, which was launched by President Pak Chong-hui in 1974, had spent a total of 30 trillion won. Last year's budget for the project amounted to 2.9 trillion won, or 31.6 percent of the entire national defense budget. There are 148 projects, including the purchase of the Air Force's next generation fighter plane and new tanks for the Army and destroyers and submarines for the Navy.
