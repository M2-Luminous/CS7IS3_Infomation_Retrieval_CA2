Addressing some three thousands of the supporters of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Meciar criticised the parliament, the government of his successor Jozef Moravcik (Democratic Union of Slovakia, DEUS), President Michal Kovac as well as journalists, particularly for their allegation that he was expecting a baby with the former director of his secretariat, Anna Nagyova. Meciar said he was going to deal with existing problems "even in the street" because the media were not giving enough space to the present opposition. He accused his former party fellow, now Deputy Premier Roman Kovac, of embezzling five million dollars, but did not elaborate. The affair allegedly marked the beginning of their conflicts which resulted in Kovac's departure from the HZDS at the beginning of the year. This fact motivated the motion of no-confidence in Kovac proposed by the present opposition in parliament last week. The motion is to deal with it in the near future, but no exact date has been announced yet. Meciar also accused Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the coalition Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), of informing President Bill Clinton in February 1993 of his intention to revive Czechoslovakia. Meciar said this step should be preceded by a merger between the KDH and Democratic Left Party (SDL, former communists) and the disintegration of the HZDS. The next HZDS meeting is planned on June 1. Meciar's supporters want to fill the 8,000-seat Winter Stadium.
