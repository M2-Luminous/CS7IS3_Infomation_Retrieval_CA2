"Right now, the most urgent issue is with those who have escaped from logging camps in Siberia," Han said in a press conference with foreign correspondents. Seoul announced this week it will accept all North Koreans who fled the logging camps in Siberia and seek resettlement in South Korea. The number is estimated at as many as 500. The decision focused new attention of another group of North Koreans who have fled the home government and are in flight throughout China, seeking a way to the South. "We have no particular plans to actively seek return, coming of those in China, simply because we don't have the kind of requests that were made in connection with the loggers in Siberia," Han told reporters. Pyongyang and Beijing have an agreement that says the two sides will repatriate any illegal entrants from the other side. Officials here have said they are concerned any exposure of such North Koreans in hiding in China will risk their personal safety.
