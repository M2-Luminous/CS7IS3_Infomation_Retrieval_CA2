Deputy House Speaker Thawin Phraison said the motion was submitted by Sisaket MP Chamnong Phothisaro and was accepted for the House meeting agenda. Whether the motion would be moved up for debate at the Lower House's next meeting would depend on the opinion of the majority of the Lower House members, Mr Thawin said. Fellow lawmakers said yesterday that Mr Thanong should know what course of action to take because he is the one embroiled in the scandal. Phalang Tham Party [PTP] founder Chamlong Simuang said as an MP, Mr Thanong should know best what step he should take as a result of the scandal. Maj. Gen. Chamlong said, however, that in the interests of justice and fairness Mr Thanong's position should also be heard. The PTP de facto leader denied that the United States' accusation against Thanong was part of a plan by PTP to ruin Chart Thai's chance of joining the coalition. He also said that was no reason for PTP to try to discredit Chat Thai. "I believe the people know Khun Thanong's problem. MPs are grown-up people and they should set themselves up as models for others to obtain the public's trust. We all know what Khun Thanong should do," Maj. Gen. Chamlong said. Commenting on the issue, Deputy House Speaker Thawin said he believed the Nakhon Phanom MP possessed "political spirit" and knows what he should do. [passage omitted]
