Attorney General Diego Valadez Rios said in a news release that the person being held, Mario Aburto Martinez, 23, "authorized" prison officials to shave off his moustache, which he was wearing in the first photographs that were released. The attorney general, who is in charge of prosecuting federal offenses, stressed: "Let there be no impression that there has been any kind of switch or some sort of cover-up." Privately owned television stations have broadcast footage of Aburto's arrest. At the time of his arrest, just after he had shot Colosio, presidential candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), he was wearing a moustache. On Friday, authorities presented an individual to the media they identified as Aburto. The man was behind bullet-proof glass at the Almoloya High Security Prison in Juarez, Mexico State, close to the Mexican capital. The murder occurred just as Colosio was leaving a campaign rally in the northwestern city of Tijuana, Baja California, near the U.S. border. Valadez said the investigations into the Colosio murder were being handled with the utmost clarity, honesty, seriousness, impartiality, and respect for the law and the press to maintain public trust in the law enforcement institutions. Fingerprint records and all of the material regarding the investigation have been made available to the proper authorities and to the press to avoid speculation. A second person, Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, was arrested in connection with the incident, but he was released later. Valadez said that the suspect made his initial statement yesterday before the Mexico State First District Judge, during which he reaffirmed his original confession. He added that there has been significant progress regarding information about the suspect's rearing and current lifestyle. Valadez reported that investigators have interviewed Aburto's family and other witnesses, and he denied that there is any other person in custody.
