According to him, once being launched, the election campaign has been marred with gross irregularities of the election law banning any assistance from abroad to parties running for the forthcoming elections. In particular, Andronik said, at the polling station in the village of Varnica, which opened a week earlier for voters of Moldova's breakaway Dniester region, the local administration head instructed residents how to vote for opposition parties. Moldovan parliamentary chairman Pyotr Luchinskiy expressed regret that the election campaign is blemished with breaches of law and ethic norms by the opposition, "which seeks to regain its popularity by these means". He did not rule out that the Central Electoral Commission largely consisting of representatives of opposition parties would not approve voting results if Moldova's Agrarian Democratic Party won the elections. In this case, Luchinskiy stressed, the Supreme Court will have the final say. And the court has already cancelled the ruling by the Central Electoral Commission not to open polling stations in Gagauz-dominated areas for fear that residents there might vote for the Agrarian Democratic Party.
