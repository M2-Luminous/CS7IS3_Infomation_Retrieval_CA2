"Some district officials and even high-up central government officials have been sticking their hands into Hong Kong," Lu Ping, the Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said in Shenzhen. "No department or district will be permitted to meddle in or interfere with Hong Kong's business or affairs," he told an approving audience of rotarians at a club luncheon. "The prevention of this sort of thing happening starts now." He said Hong Kong people could expect to see officers of the People's Liberation Army in the territory but he pledged that Beijing would not station members of the People's Armed Police in the territory. China would adhere to the principle of "one country, two systems" and the provisions of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and Basic Law to maintain the status quo after the change of sovereignty. He said Hong Kong should remain a business centre and should serve as a "golden bridge" between the two different economies. It should never be turned into a "political bridge" through which someone could penetrate and alter the mainland's socialist system. "Anybody who wanted to transform the two systems into one was only daydreaming," he said. "Hong Kong people should prevent this golden bridge from breaking down. "And the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office would bear the responsibility of promoting the Basic Law on the mainland so that all departments observe the Basic Law in dealing with matters relating to Hong Kong." Mr Lu conceded during his 40-minute speech that some mainland officials had expressed views that were contrary to the Basic Law and this was a problem raised by some Hong Kong affairs advisers earlier in the week. But he reiterated the importance of the principle of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong and said the formation of the Preliminary Working Committee had provided the starting point in this direction. More Hong Kong people could take part in preparatory work for the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government and it would lead to a solid foundation for the future administration, he said. His remarks were made just hours before China launched another advisory body in Hong Kong, incorporating 274 community leaders from a wide political spectrum into a group to be called district affairs advisers. There were some small "l" liberals among the appointees, but there were still no members associated with the United Democrats [UDHK], a group labelled by mainland officials as "subversive". The third tier of advisers, after the Hong Kong Affairs Advisers and the Preliminary Working Committee, taps the Hong Kong Government's existing system of advice and representation. There are 20 municipal councillors, one legislator and 108 district board members -- 12 of them being board chairmen. Other are kaifong association representatives, academics and businessmen. In an apparent bid to address criticism that China was unwilling to hear sharply dissenting views, the new list of advisers includes a few moderate democrats. Meeting Point has been given two seats, while the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL) got four. The pro-China Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong will provide 43 advisers. Speaking at the launching ceremony at the China Resources Building in Wanchai, XINHUA (the New China News Agency) director Zhou Nan asked the advisers to make use of their "wisdom and their influence" in society to work for a smooth transition. Although there were people who tried to create obstacles to the return of Hong Kong to its motherland, the Chinese people would not bow to it, Mr Zhou said. "We will stand firm together with the patriots in the recovery of Hong Kong's sovereignty, following the (principles of) `one country two systems' and `Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong people' set out in the Basic Law," he said. In a brief outline of the advisers' duties, Mr Zhou said they should be able to reflect the views of the Hong Kong people and promote the Basic Law, the mini-constitution for the SAR. Mr Zhou also called on the advisers to encourage the public to participate in all sorts of social affairs, but he did not go into detail. They should also offer their opinions and suggestions on important issues related to the sovereignty changeover, he said. Mr Zhou did not say whether advisers would be consulted on district affairs, their area of expertise. Quoting the words of the paramount Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, Mr Zhou said it was important for "those who love China and Hong Kong to participate actively in all sorts of social and political affairs of Hong Kong." UDHK vice-chairman Yeung Sum yesterday criticised the new body as merely a "united front tactic" by the Chinese Government to isolate the party. Mr Yeung said he was not surprised nor disappointed to find all party members excluded from the new organisation. "We are not their target for a united front because some of our members supported the pro-democracy movement in 1989," he said. "But the Chinese side should think about whether they should isolate us in the long run if they really want to listen to the voice of people in Hong Kong." But appointee ADPL vice-chairman Leung Kwong-cheong, defended the role of the advisers, saying that it was important to strengthen communication with China. Asked if this could split the territory's pro-democracy camp, Mr Leung said: "No one could split us but ourselves. It is important that other pro-democracy groups do not criticise us (for becoming advisers) all the time. "If they noticed anything wrong with our performance, say we did not convey a certain kind of opinion, they are welcome to give us constructive advice," he said.
