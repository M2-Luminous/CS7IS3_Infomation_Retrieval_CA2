FR940527-1-00188 FR940527-1-00014 Medicare provides extra payment in addition to the regular DRG payment amount for extremely costly or extraordinarily lengthy cases (cost outliers and day outliers, respectively). Section 13501(c) of Public Law 103&hyph;66 requires the Secretary to phase out payment for day outliers in 25 percent increments beginning in FY 1995. This reduction in day outlier payments will be offset by an increase in payments for cost outliers. The statute also requires the Secretary to establish a fixed loss per case threshold for cost outliers instead of a threshold based on a fixed multiple of the DRG payment amount or other fixed dollar amount. For FY 1995, we are proposing that a case would receive cost outlier payment if costs exceed the DRG amount plus $23,300. We are also proposing to increase the marginal cost factor for cost outliers from 75 to 80 percent. The payment impacts of this change are minimal. The largest impacts appear to be related to geographic location in terms of census divisions. Urban hospitals in the Middle Atlantic census division have payment reductions of 0.5 percent per case. Rural Middle Atlantic hospitals have a 0.3 percent decline. In New England, both urban and rural hospitals experience decreases of 0.2 percent. Since the changes to outlier policy result in a shift in payments from cases paid as day outliers to cases paid as cost outliers, this indicates that these areas have higher percentages of day outliers. This is consistent with our previous analysis indicating above average impacts related to day outlier policy changes in the northeastern portion of the country (see the June 4, 1992 proposed rule, 57 FR 23824). The largest negative impact occurs among hospitals for which we could not determine Medicare utilization rates. This group experiences a 1.4 percent fall in payments per case. This appears to be primarily attributable to 9 hospitals whose outlier payment percentages fall by more than 20 percent. H. All Changes (Column 7) Column 7 compares our estimate of payments per case for FY 1995 to our estimate of payments per case in FY 1994. It includes all of the changes discussed in the previous columns. It also includes the impacts of statutory differences from FY 1994 to FY 1995. These differences were noted in the introduction. Specifically, they are: an increase in DSH payments to urban hospitals with 100 or more beds and to rural hospitals with 500 or more beds, and the elimination of the MDH provision. This column also displays the impact of the 1.1 percent lower than estimated outlier payments during FY 1994, also described in the introduction and the Addendum. Another change from FY 1994 is that there is no budget neutrality adjustment to account for midyear wage index corrections. Last year's adjustment factor was 0.998188. In addition, a single geographic reclassification budget neutrality factor was applied to the proposed FY 1995 standardized amounts of 0.993814. The FY 1994 factors applied to the urban and rural amounts, respectively, were 0.992529 and 0.999472. Finally, the budget neutrality adjustment factor for the updated wage index and the DRG recalibration is 0.997647, compared to the FY 1994 factor of 0.999003. Although the net effect of these changes are small, they have an effect on the payment differences shown in this column. Column 7 also reflects the 1.1 percent updates to the urban standardized amounts. The increase in differential payments to rural hospitals that results from eliminating the rural amount is shown in Column 1. There may also be interactive effects among the various factors comprising the payment system that we are not able to isolate. For these reasons, the values in column 7 may not equal the sum of the previous columns plus the other impacts that we are able to identify. We also note that the percent changes associated with geographic reclassification decisions by the MGCRB shown in Column 5 are not included in the percent changes shown here, since Column 5 reflects the impacts of geographic reclassifications relative to the FY 1995 baseline rather than the FY 1994 reclassifications. The impacts of FY 1994 geographic reclassifications relative to the payment impacts of FY 1995 reclassifications are shown in Column 5. The impact on all hospitals is a 3.0 percent increase in payments from FY 1994. The net change in total payments due to the proposed changes for FY 1995 shown in columns 1 through 6 is 0.7 percent, due to the elimination of the rural standardized amount. After accounting for the 1.1 percent update to the urban standardized amounts, the move to a single outlier offset, and a smaller overall geographic reclassification budget neutrality factor, the difference between the FY 1994 final standardized amounts and the FY 1995 proposed standardized amounts is 1.5 percent. As described in the discussion of the impacts of eliminating the rural amount, the portion of this increase due to the smaller outlier offset is already reflected in the changes shown in Column 1. In addition, the update to the hospital-specific rate for SCHs is 1.4 percent in FY 1995. The average increase in payments due to updates that is shown in Column 7 and not in Column 1 is about 1.2 percent.
