(BBC) documentary about the life of Chairman Mao Zedong at their club on Monday. But the board of governors of the Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC) said they would go ahead with Monday's screening of "Mao Zedong: The Last Emperor" -- and also ignore an unusual Hong Kong government request that they secure a permit for the members-only event. FCC Vice President Carl Goldstein said China's demand was presented to the board by two officials of the foreign affairs department of the Hong Kong branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, Beijing's de facto consulate in the British colony. "We have come to express our hope -- that is, to make a request that the FCC takes measures to stop the showing of this film," Goldstein quoted one of the officials as saying. "It villifies and slanders our late chairman and hurts the feelings of the Chinese people." FCC President Philip Bowring responded that the club's decision to organize the screening was not a judgement of the documentary's accuracy. Goldstein added that XINHUA was welcome to send a representative to the screening to give China's opinion. The officials took note of the offer but were otherwise non-committal, he said. On Wednesday, the Hong Kong Government's Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority got involved, telling the FCC by fax that it must get a permit before the showing. It has never before made such a demand for FCC film or video screenings, and Goldstein said the club would send a letter back saying the requirement would be ignored. Ironically, the authority's demand came the same week Governor Chris Patten told a US press rights group, the Freedom Forum, that his administration would fight "uphill and down dale" for press freedoms ahead of Hong Kong's return to China in 1997. Last month Beijing unsuccessfully put diplomatic pressure on London to block the original British telecast of the documentary, produced on the centenary of his birth, which alleged that in his later years he consorted with young women. Sino-British relations are already at a low point over Patten's decision to press ahead with electoral reforms aimed at extending local democracy ahead of 1997. Hong Kong's biggest television station, Television Broadcasts Ltd., has acquired rights to the documentary, but has yet to say when it will air it. The video was already shown to about 50 local democracy activists at a private screening last weekend, with permission from the television authority.
