FR940705-2-00237 FR940705-2-00091 Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;g&hyph;(3). Appropriate steps should be taken to prevent horizontal transmission or exposure of laboratory personnel. If the agent used as a vector is known to be transmitted by a particular route (e.g., arthropods), special attention should be given to preventing spread by that route. In the absence of specific knowledge of a particular route of transmission, all potential means of horizontal transmission (e.g., arthropods, contaminated bedding, or animal waste, etc.) should be prevented. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;g&hyph;(4). Eating, drinking, smoking, and applying cosmetics shall not be permitted in the work area. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;g&hyph;(5). Individuals who handle materials and animals containing recombinant DNA molecules shall be required to wash their hands before exiting the containment area. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;g&hyph;(6). A double barrier shall be provided to separate male and female animals unless reproductive studies are part of the experiment or other measures are taken to avoid reproductive transmission. Reproductive incapacitation may be used. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;g&hyph;(7). The containment area shall be in accordance with state and Federal laws and animal care requirements. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;g&hyph;(8). A biosafety manual shall be prepared or adopted. Personnel shall be advised of special hazards and required to read and follow instructions on practices and procedures. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;2. Animal Facilities (BL2&hyph;N) Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;a. Animals shall be contained within an enclosed structure (animal room or equivalent) to minimize the possibility of theft or unintentional release and to avoid arthropod access. The special provision to avoid the entry or escape of arthropods from the animal areas may be waived if the agent in use is not known to be transmitted by arthropods. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;b. Surfaces shall be impervious to water and resistant to acids, alkalis, organic solvents, and moderate heat. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;c. The animal containment area shall be designed so that it can be easily cleaned. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;d. Windows that open shall be fitted with fly screens. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;e. An autoclave shall be available for decontamination of laboratory wastes. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;f. If arthropods are used in the experiment or the agent under study can be transmitted by an arthropod, interior work areas shall be appropriately screened (52 mesh). All perimeter joints and openings shall be sealed and additional arthropod control mechanisms used to minimize arthropod entry and propagation, including appropriate screening of access doors or the equivalent. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C. Biosafety Level 3_Animals (BL3&hyph;N) (see Appendix Q&hyph;III&hyph;B) Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1. Standard Practices (BL3&hyph;N) Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;a. Animal Facility Access (BL3&hyph;N) Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(1). The containment area shall be locked. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(2). The containment area shall be patrolled or monitored at frequent intervals. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(3). The containment building shall be controlled and have a locking access. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(4). The Animal Facility Director shall establish policies and procedures whereby only persons who have been advised of the potential hazard and who meet any specific entry requirements (e.g., vaccination) shall enter the laboratory or animal rooms. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(5). Animal room doors, gates, or other closures shall be kept closed when experiments are in progress. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b. Decontamination and Inactivation (BL3&hyph;N) Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1). The work surfaces of containment equipment shall be decontaminated when work with organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules is finished. Where feasible, plastic-backed paper toweling shall be used on nonporous work surfaces to facilitate clean-up. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2). All animals shall be euthanized at the end of their experimental usefulness and the carcasses decontaminated before disposal in an approved manner. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(3). Needles and syringes shall be promptly placed in a puncture-resistant container and decontaminated, preferably by autoclaving, before discard or reuse.
