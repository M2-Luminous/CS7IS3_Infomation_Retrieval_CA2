The minister was consulted about initiatives in this direction by Center Alliance Party [PAC] President Adolfo Ballas. Rebolledo said: "In our capacity as government we believe that, in compliance with the laws currently in force, the court's rulings on this matter must be respected." He said that this was the governing coalition's proposal regarding the human rights subject in its government program. He added: "The idea of a new amnesty law has not been considered." The proposal made by Ballas, who proposed a new amnesty law that would benefit military officers who had been tried and civilians involved in terrorist attacks, was flatly rejected by the members of the Communist Party [PC]. Yesterday the Leftist Democratic Party, like the PC, categorically rejected the new amnesty law proposed by the PAC. PDI Secretary General Antonio Leal said that the initiative would only establish a precedent of a new "pardon" that lacks any ethics. Leal said it is immoral for this possible amnesty law to be proposed by the president of a member party of the coalition because it implies ignoring the governing bloc's policy on the subject as well as affecting the performance of the magistrates who currently hear cases involving violations of human rights.
