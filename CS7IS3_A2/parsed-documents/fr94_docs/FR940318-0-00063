Background This document contains final regulations to be added to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The final regulations provide rules regarding the treatment of options in determining whether a loss corporation has an ownership change within the meaning of that section. Proposed regulations on this subject were set forth in a notice of proposed rulemaking published in the Federal Register on November 5, 1992. See 57 FR 52743. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) received comments on the proposed regulations and held a public hearing on February 2, 1993. Having considered the comments and the statements made at the hearing, the IRS and the Treasury Department adopt the proposed regulations as revised by this Treasury decision. Explanation of Provisions Section 382 of the Code limits the amount of income earned by a corporation after an ownership change that can be offset by losses incurred prior to the ownership change. In general, an ownership change is an increase of more than 50 percentage points in stock ownership by 5-percent shareholders over a three-year period. Section 382(l)(3)(A) states that, except as provided in regulations, an option to acquire stock is treated as exercised if the deemed exercise would result in an ownership change. That section also provides that a similar rule applies in the case of certain interests that are similar to options. These rules are implemented by ยง1.382&hyph;2T(h)(4) of the temporary regulations. The IRS issued the proposed regulations in response to numerous comments regarding the practical difficulties of applying the option rules in the temporary regulations. The proposed regulations were intended to reduce these practical difficulties by narrowing the scope of the option rules and simplifying their application.
