The leaflets say that the plot was masterminded by the leader of the Russian Party of the Economic Freedom Konstantin Borovoy and the leader of the Party's local branch, businessman Sergey Manukyan. Speaking over the Tiraspol cable TV "Asket," Lebed described the leaflets as sheer nonsense. He said, though, that the Transdniestrian leaders involved in what he said machinations and corruption and cheating the ordinary people, are trying to shift the blame for their mistakes and the deteriorating economic situation in the region on the Russian military. The commander has said that he was prepared to prove this and cooperate in this respect with other bodies to establish the truth. Observers believe the authorship of leaflets belongs to the Transdniestrian Security Ministry, whose leader Vadim Shevtsov-Antyufeyev is in constant conflict with Aleksandr Lebed. Addressing last Tuesday the Tiraspol parliament, he accused in public the Russian general of plotting a coup. Commenting in an interview with Interfax on the fact of the leaflets appearance, the speaker of the Transdniestrian parliament Grigoriy Marakutsa has said that he ordered to conduct investigation into the case and establish real authors of the leaflets.
