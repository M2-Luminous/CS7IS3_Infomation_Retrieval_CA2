The defendant, Hasan Muhammad Tulays, a corporal in the Lebanese army and member of Islamic Resistance, a paramilitary wing of the pro-Iranian group Hizballah, had confessed to the killing. He testified that at the time of the shooting of Christian Gouttiere [name as received], the military attache at the French embassy, he had "received an order to kill any French person". The military court that sentenced Tulays rejected his lawyer's appeal for amnesty, saying that to do so could damage relations between France and Lebanon. Under a law passed in 1991, the death penalty in Lebanon was replaced by a sentence of life at hard labor. An alleged accomplice of Tulays, Munzir Rammal, tried in absentia, got the same sentence. Tulays was 26 at the time of the shooting. Gouttiere, 54, was shot in the head three times in a Christian suburb of Beirut, near the French embassy.
