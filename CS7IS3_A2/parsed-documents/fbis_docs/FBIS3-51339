According to the report, Chester has reportedly exerted pressure to have Deputy Carlos Acevedo excluded from the list headed by Vinicio Villar on which he appeared as a candidate to the post of first vice president of the Legislative Branch. It was confirmed that the U.S. official went to the Legislative Palace yesterday afternoon and sat in the diplomatic box, where he talked with several deputies, including Cesar Porres and Rafael Rottmann of MAS [Solidarity Action Movement]. He was also seen talking with Carlos Acevedo shortly before Acevedo declined to run for first vice president. The U.S. veto has reportedly occurred because Acevedo was included on a list of 16 deputies to be purged, and his election to such an important directorate board post would be considered "terrible." When asked about this subject, Acevedo admitted that, in fact, he had been notified that the U.S. Embassy did not approve of his election, and that is why MAS demanded he decline the nomination, but he rejected the speculations, which caught most of the deputies' interest. He believes "it was a false alarm, because I personally spoke with Mr. Chester and he assured me the embassy did not exert pressure." Besides, he said the diplomat told him he came to Congress only to observe the elections, to ascertain they were carried out within a democratic framework. Acevedo has said he declined simply to remove an obstacle, to avoid being an obstruction, and to allow the negotiations to continue appropriately. Besides, he believes he has good relations with the U.S. Embassy, because he has even been praised for promoting the Narcotics Law and has been invited on numerous occasions to visit that North American country.
