In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y, PLO Executive Committee member Yasir 'Amr said that this meeting has been proposed by Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department. 'Amr indicated that in a telephone conversation with him from Tunis, Faruq Qaddumi stressed the importance of this meeting under the current circumstances experienced by the Palestine question and in light of the Israeli intransigence on the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. 'Amr stressed the importance of Palestinian-Jordanian-Syrian-Lebanese coordination before going to the 11th [as published] round of negotiations in Washington on Monday. The PLO Executive Committee member praised the results of the Syrian-U.S. Geneva summit. He denied that these results have terrified the Palestinian side. 'Amr said: On the contrary, these results will help the Palestinians and support their arguments before the Israeli negotiator. He indicated that the concepts that President al-Asad raised will obviously and directly help the Palestinian track. He said that these concepts must be followed during the interim and the final phases. 'Amr added that this summit has set a formula for resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East and specified the concept of a durable peace, a peace that satisfies the parties concerned and that is based on the resolutions of the international legitimacy and the principle of trading territory for peace. 'Amr described President al-Asad as a man of broad vision with a brave pan-Arab position, a man who is aware of the future and of the current changes. He noted that President al-Asad is a man of a profound experience, and that he has placed Israel before a difficult option if it wants to be part of the Middle East. [passage omitted]
