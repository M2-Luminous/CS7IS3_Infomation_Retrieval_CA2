It is anticipated that President Kim Yong-sam will actively propose the ROK Government's policy to President Kim Il-song if the summit talks are realized. The government policy is one of the active initiatives for assuring North Korea's nuclear transparency and providing a breakthrough in economic cooperation between the North and the South. Whether or not North Korea will accept the proposal will be noteworthy. A high-ranking government official said on 24 July: "North Korea has explained to the United States about its plan to convert the current graphite-moderated reactors to light-water reactors and requested the United States to support this but the United States is having difficulties in providing actual support due to its domestic laws even though it agrees to the plan in principle. In this context, our government is preparing measures to take the initiative to participate in the construction of light-water reactors in North Korea." The official also said: "It is inevitable that North Korea's light-water reactor construction will be a multinational project involving the United States, Japan, and Russia. The ROK Government will soon begin discussing detailed support measures with the United States and Japan." Another government official said: "The core question of the North Korean light-water reactor project is who will provide the capital. The ROK Government is examining a plan to assist North Korea in obtaining construction funds from the Asian Development Bank by guaranteeing the repayments." Meanwhile, during a meeting with Selig Harrison, senior fellow of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu said: "The United States could request Russia to provide light-water reactor technology to North Korea, and South Korea and Japan could provide the capital." In the event that the ROK, the United States, and Japan reach an agreement to support North Korea's light-water reactor construction project, the project could begin upon the signing of a bilateral or multilateral treaty on nuclear power assistance. It is estimated that the construction of one light-water reactor in North Korea would cost $1 billion to $1.5 billion for a period of over 10 years.
