From Friday, March 25, the maximum purchase price for raw silk was set at 200,000 yuan ($22,989) per ton. The measure was taken in concert by China National Silk Import and Export Corp and 31 local companies to encourage production and exports. So far this year, the price of raw silk has jumped 25 percent to 230,000 yuan ($26,438) per ton. To a large degree, analysts say, the price spike has held back silk exports. Last year, exports of raw silk declined from 1992 but the precise figure was not available. Soaring domestic prices for raw silk add another burden to the sluggish international silk market, analysts say. They add that this year silk consumption will not rise in Europe or Japan, the major markets for Chinese silk products. The unchecked spiral in prices for raw silk has fueled a rampant increase in the nation's production of mulberry, whose leaves are fed to silkworms. Over time, though, the production expansion will force down prices for raw silk, eventually hurting mulberry producers. This will unsettle farmers in China's hinterland and minority regions, whose livelihood depends on mulberry. The price gyrations resemble those of 1988, when the country was caught off guard by fierce competition among growers of silkworm cocoons. Cutbacks in cocoon production led directly to price hikes. At the same time, booming domestic silk enterprises demand more raw materials, making the shortage of raw silk even more acute. In addition, many manufacturers raised prices following the recent revision of tax regulations and the unification of the dual exchange rates. In fact, such increases are considered unwarranted because the value-added tax introduced this year imposes no extra burdens on major domestic enterprises. In contrast to raw silk exports, silk garment makers anticipate a buoyant overseas market this year. Last year, they exported more than 310 million pieces, compared with 70 million in 1990. The garments accounted for 70 percent of all silk exports last year. Chinese silk production last year ballooned to 32.7 billion yuan ($3.76 billion), or 22.26 percent more than in 1992. Silk production is the country's third largest textile sector after cotton spinning and artificial fibre. China is still the world's leading producer of silk products, accounting for more than 65 percent of the total. In 1993, China was responsible for some 70 percent of the world's output of silkworm cocoons.
