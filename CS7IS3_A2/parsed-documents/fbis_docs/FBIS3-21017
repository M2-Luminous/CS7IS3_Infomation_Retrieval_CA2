A developing country, Turkey, and an international organization, Eutelsat, lost precious communication tools. Several weeks at least will be needed for the technical inquiry, bringing Ariane's commercial ambitions to a temporary halt. These are the weighty consequences of the failure of the 63rd rocket launch six minutes after lift-off from the Kourou space center in French Guyana. However, this should not cast doubts on the credibility of the European rocket. This was only the sixth accident to occur since launches commenced in December 1979. It already appears that this failure was due to a malfunctioning component in the engine of the third stage used on this version. According to the announcement made yesterday afternoon by Charles Bigot, managing director of the rocket's production company, Arianespace, the faulty component was a roller bearing in the turbopump supplying the engine with oxygen. "We view this problem seriously but also calmly, because we know that our rockets are reliable" he said, before quoting from a letter from French Industry Minister Gerard Longuet assuring him of the "confidence" of the French government. A commission of inquiry will submit a report explaining in full the circumstances of the incident, before the next rocket launch which could be delayed only a few weeks. Yet, everything had started very well on Monday evening for this 63rd rocket flight, which took off as planned at 2137 GMT with its payload of "Turksat 1", Turkey's first telecommunications satellite, and "Eutelsat II F5" belonging to the European organization of the same name. Everything went according to plan with the first and second stage separations, and the ignition of the third stage engine on this "Ariane 44 LP" rocket was greeted with the usual sigh of relief on the ground at the Kourou space center. Sensitive Point Some 80 seconds later the flight controllers noted an abnormal pressure drop in the third stage engine's combustion chamber which was suddenly extinguished. From that point on, the rocket and its two satellites were irredeemably lost. Even at an altitude of 200 km Ariane had not built up a speed sufficient to push it into orbit, and its radar trace, represented by a dot on the control screens, plummeted towards the middle of the Atlantic before crashing a few minutes later. By the end of the evening, in French Guyana the first analyses of the measurements taken between third stage ignition and its premature shutdown had revealed an abnormal heating-up of one of the roller bearings in the third stage engine's turbopump, a kind of "carburetor" used to inject the mixture of liquid hydrogen and oxygen needed to make it work. Some 60 seconds after lift-off, the bearing of the shaft supplying the engine with oxygen gradually started to heat up before its temperature rose suddenly at the 80-second mark, which was probably when the bearing jammed, blocking the turbopump and causing the engine to stall because it was no longer being supplied with fuel. This extremely sophisticated engine has been responsible for four of the six Ariane failures. However, it would appear that this failure will not lead to a rethink of the engine's design: "We fully master its technology, even if it is one of Ariane's more sensitive points. I consider its design to be the state-of-the- art," Charles Bigot forcefully underlined. He also remarked that there had not been a third-stage failure since 1986, some 44 flights previously. While he admitted that Arianespace would not run the risk of launching another version of the rocket before the commission of inquiry had reported back with its conclusions, he believed that an initial report could be available by the middle of February. The possibility of flights beginning again within a few weeks cannot therefore be ruled out. Given that there have been 26 successful flights since the last accident in 1990, and the fact that these two satellites were particularly well-insured -- according to Kourou the launch had been covered for $350 million -- Monday evening's failure seems to have been received calmly. Engineers were talking of a chance mishap, difficult to take but at the end of the day quite "acceptable" for a launcher that originally was designed with an MFR of 10 flights to keep production costs down. The Arianespace managing director even stated: "It should be possible to gradually claw back the delay caused by this problem to achieve our aim of 30 launches over the next three years." With some 70 percent of the world market in civilian satellite launches, Ariane still has, after the loss of these two satellites, a total of 35 firm orders for putting satellites into orbit between now and 1997. Arianespace stated yesterday that the coming weeks should see no cancellations cutting into this winning formula, which generates revenues of more than Fr17 billion.
