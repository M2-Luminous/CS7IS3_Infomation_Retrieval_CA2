Dudayev's statement was released today by the CHECHENPRESS agency. The Chechen president's opinion is that "with the connivance of local authorities and law enforcement bodies, drug addiction has reached such proportions that it threatens the nation's gene pool." The CHECHENPRESS agency reports that the procurator general "has been instructed to draft a law on applying the death penalty to drug dealers." According to Dudayev, "As a beginning, it is necessary to hold a few public executions," CHECHENPRESS reports.
