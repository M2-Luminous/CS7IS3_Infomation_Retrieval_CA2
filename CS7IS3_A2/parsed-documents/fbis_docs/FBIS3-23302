Last year the interior board servicemen liberated 47 hostages, including 6 children. During the past two months 12 hostages have been liberated. In the meantime, Sidorenko believes that criminals actually seize at least twice as many people. In his opinion, an increase in hostages in the near future will be caused by the aggravating competition among criminal gangs for the spheres of influence in St. Petersburg. In this connection, Sidorenko noted a considerable rise in illegal arms supplies. According to him, since the beginning of this year, the regional board for combat against organized crime has confiscated about 70 firearms, supplied mainly from Estonia. Sidorenko pointed out that it is difficult to trace arms supplies due to the lack of cooperation with the police of the Baltic states. "Sometimes it is easier for us to cooperate with FBI and Scotland Yard than with the Baltic states' police," he noted.
