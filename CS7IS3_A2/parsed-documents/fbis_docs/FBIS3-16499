Gasprom resumed supplying its earlier volume of blue fuel to the Republic. By the end of Tuesday [15 March], deliveries are expected to reach earlier [word indistinct] volume of 54 million cubic meters. This was agreed by Russia's Gasprom and the Belarusian Beltransgas during their negotiations in Moscow. A delegation of gas-industry specialists from Belarus, headed by Beltransgas Director Mikalay Macharnyak, went to Moscow for the sole purpose of discussing conditions for repaying Belarusian debts for Russian natural gas deliveries. In line with agreements reached with Ukraine's partners, 150 percent [as heard] of Belarusian debts for last year's deliveries will be settled by financial means while 50 percent will be met by supplying Russia's Gasprom with equipment and materiel. This year's debt will be settled by financial means. A repayment schedule for this quarter has already been agreed upon. An agreement in principle has also been reached on the joint ownership of property of the territory of Belarus, but the actual Russian ownership share will be determined at a later date. According to ITAR-TASS, it was determined that a final resolution of the questions under discussion will be adopted within the next 10 days.
