I would like to express thanks to [Luxembourg] Foreign and Defense Minister [Jacques] Poos as well as to Ambassador Linster and his colleagues. Since our last ministerial meeting, we have made a significant degree of progress in the development of the WEU. This afternoon, we will welcome the Central European and Baltic states as associate members. I am grateful to all my colleagues that the proposal that I and [French] Foreign Minister [Alain] Juppe made in the fall of last year has been taken up in such a constructive manner. I believe that we can be very pleased with the result. If we are serious about admitting these states to the European Union [EU], then a closer linkage with the WEU should accompany associate membership with the EU. The creation of associate membership status should achieve that. I believe that the incorporation of these states into European and transatlantic security structures should constitute an important contribution to the security of all of Europe. The possibility of participation on the part of these states in our security and defense policy consultations as well as future humanitarian and peace missions will create new fields for cooperation. This cooperation is simultaneously closely linked to an expansion of the Partnership for Peace with NATO, which is intended to enhance military cooperation in particular. Germany is in favor of closer cooperation between the WEU and the EU. When we assume the presidency of the EU at the beginning of July, we want to work consistently to achieve further progress. At the same time, a close link with NATO will be increasingly important. This is the background against which our closer cooperation with the associate members of NATO should be viewed. In the future, they will be increasingly drawn into our consultation and decisionmaking process as well as into our joint operations and will thus play a comprehensive part in the further development of the WEU. The NATO summit's clear support for the further development of Europe's security and defense identity with the goal of a common defense policy for the EU is an important basis for a stronger transatlantic partnership. The summit decision that the Europeans could use the Atlantic alliance's common structures and capacities for military missions within the WEU framework is a way of setting the course for our future cooperation. The implementation of the NATO concept for the creation of an allied command is of great significance for the further work of the WEU. The period of expanding the WEU must now be followed by a period of enhancement. Our goal, which we set at Petersberg in 1992 -- that is to say, to carry out missions to secure peace independently -- is still to be achieved. A significant improvement in cooperation at the level of armed forces groupings, command structures and logistics, as well as intelligence and infrastructure planning is necessary. This could be a key issue over the next few months. Please allow me to say something about the WEU consultations about satellite-aided intelligence gathering. It is a very ambitious idea. We now face having to make a decision about whether we will cooperate beyond the study phase and go over to the project phase. I believe that we should essentially accept that challenge, because without a common European intelligence capacity, a common crisis-management approach can scarcely be realized. The projected expense, which is significant, must be substantiated in a way that involves no objections. The WEU will soon face the next test when it becomes involved in the administration of Mostar. Over the past few months, WEU planning on policing has advanced considerably. If security and order is not maintained in Mostar, then all other measures aimed at reviving the city are built on sand. Should the WEU assume this task, it can once again demonstrate that after its successful participation in the implementation of the embargo in the Adriatic -- together with the Atlantic Alliance -- and on the Danube -- along with the EU -- it can make an important contribution to the restoration of peaceful coexistence in Mostar. The second half of 1994 and 1995 will be overshadowed by the EU Government Conference schedule for 1996. That also applies to the WEU as a integral part of the development of a European security and defense identity. The proposal made by the future Dutch presidency regarding an examination of the requirements of a European defense policy as the focus of the second half of the year has the full approval of Germany. When Germany holds the EU presidency, we will cooperate closely with the Dutch presidency to smooth the way with regard to the EU and WEU so that the government conference can open a new page on the path toward a common European security and defense policy.
