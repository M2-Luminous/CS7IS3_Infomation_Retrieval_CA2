Underlying MITI's establishment of the support center is its conclusion that as a result of the scheduled reorganization of the Coordinating Committee for Export Control (Cocom) in late March as a new organ designed to prevent the spread of arms to "strife- potential countries," it will be more important to strengthen export control systems of countries other than the advanced nations. Three staff members will be working at the support center on a full-time basis, and its planned activities will include the holding of export control seminars for Asian nations and former Soviet republics including Russia, and the dispatch of experts to these nations. MITI, in its budgetary requests for fiscal 1994, has appropriated 40 million yen for the support center. It held an export control seminar for Asian nations last October for the first time, but from now on, such activities will be conducted by the support center.
