FR940224-0-00003 FR940224-0-00001 Due to the amendments to 7 CFR parts 1 and 2, adopted by this rule, it is necessary in this rule, to make technical amendments to 36 CFR part 223 to conform it to the rules of practice, established by this rule, which govern the adjudication of sourcing area applications pursuant to the Act. This rule amends the rules governing initial sourcing applicants, published in an interim rule at 55 FR 48572 (Nov. 20, 1990). Specifically to conform the procedures in the interim rule to this rule, for ongoing applications, 36 CFR 223.190 is amended as follows: 1. Section 223.190(g) is revised to state that the application review process will be conducted pursuant to the Rules of Practice Governing the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas Pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq .), found at 7 CFR part 1, subpart M. 2. Section 223.190(h) (introductory text) and (h)(1)&hyph;(3) are removed. 3. Section 223.190(h)(4) is redesignated as 36 CFR 223.190(h) and is revised to state that a final decision will be issued within four (4) months of receipt of the sourcing area application or initiation date of the formal review of the sourcing area. 4. Section 223.190(h)(5) is redesignated as 36 CFR 223.190(i), and 36 CFR 223.190(h)(5)(i)&hyph;(iv) are redesignated as 36 CFR 223.190(i), (1)&hyph;(4). 5. Newly redesignated 36 CFR 223.190(i)(1) is amended by deleting the words ``approving official'' and adding, in their place, the words ``the Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer.'' This rule also makes technical amendments to 36 CFR 223.191(e) to conform the sourcing area review procedures to the rules of practice adopted in this rule (36 CFR 223.191 was published in a final rulemaking at 56 FR 65834, December 19, 1991). Specifically, this rule removes from 36 CFR 223.191(e) the words ``deciding official'' and adds, in their place, the words ``the Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer.'' This rule also amends the following sentence in paragraph (e), ``The deciding official shall, on the record and after opportunity for a hearing, approve or disapprove the sourcing area being reviewed'' by adding to the end of the sentence the words ``pursuant to the Rules of Practice Governing the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas Pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620 et seq .), found at 7 CFR part 1, subpart M;''. Environmental Impact This rulemaking consists primarily of technical and administrative changes related to the rules of practice governing the adjudication of sourcing area applications pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq .). No extraordinary circumstances have been identified that might cause this proposed action to have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, this rulemaking is categorically excluded from documentation in an Environmental Impact Statement or an Environmental Assessment (40 CFR 1508.4; Forest Service Handbook 1909.15, Environmental Policy and Procedures, ยง31.1b(2), 57 FR 43208, September 18, 1992). Paperwork Reduction Act This action contains no new or additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and contains no collections of information as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. and its implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320. Therefore, the Paperwork Reduction Act and its implementing regulations do not apply to this rulemaking. Regulatory Impact This rule relates to internal agency management. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, notice and opportunity for comment are not required, and this rule may be made effective less than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register . Further, since this rule relates to internal agency management, it is exempt from the provisions of Executive Order 12866. Finally, this action is not a rule as defined in Public Law No. 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and thus is exempt from the provisions of that Act. This rule has been reviewed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12630 and it has been determined that the rule does not pose the risk of a taking of constitutionally protected private property. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under this rule: (1) All state and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule or which could impede its full implementation will be preempted; (2) No retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) No administrative proceedings are required before parties may file suit in court challenging its provisions.
