"I have told the leaders of my coalition government and an emergency meeting of the cabinet of my intention to resign," Hosokawa told a press conference at his official residence in Tokyo. "I have received their approval," he added. Hosokawa said he bears the responsibility for the wranglings between the ruling coalition and the opposition camp over his loans from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin Co., which has kept the Diet budget business paralysed. The announcement came only days after a media frenzy over reports on his joking about stepping down, which he strongly denied. Hosokawa had refused the opposition Liberal Democratic Party's demand to summon his former aide to the Diet over his 100 million yen (950,000 U.S. dollars) loan from Sagawa, and denied he was personally involved in a Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) share purchase, which he said was done by his late father-in-law. Earlier, before the news conference, he suddenly summoned the leaders of the coalition to the premier's official residence and formally told them he was quitting. "The reason for my decision to resign is the paralysis in the Diet," one coalition official quoted Hosokawa as telling his colleagues at an emergency cabinet session. He also said a new problem has been uncovered about his personal financial management, according to TV reports. But he did not specify the issue. Hosokawa, 56, took office last August, ending a 38-year-long grip on state power by the Liberal Democratic Party.
