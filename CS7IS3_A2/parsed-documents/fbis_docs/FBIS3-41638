In an 18-hour meeting that started Thursday [2 December], Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands refused to accept a proposal that EC countries should be made to recycle up to an initial 45 percent of paper, glass and aluminium packaging. The three countries said the target was too low, and meant that they would have to relax their own recycling laws and thus produce more waste. ``It is absurd to try to impose ceilings which would increase the waste produced by some countries,'' German Secretary of State Clemens Stroetmann said. He refused to accept a compromise proposal which would allow some countries to exceed the recycling limits, on the grounds that they would then have to show they have adequate recycling capacity. Germany is currently involved in a row with some of its EC neighbours because it produces more recyclable waste than it can process, and exports much of it for treatment, notably to France and Spain. The EC's poorer southern members, meanwhile, argued that they should be exempted from the recycling norms because they could not afford the necessary recycling capacity. EC Environment Commissioner Ioannis Paleokrassas said failure to establish recycling norms would result in legal battles between neighbouring countries. The European Commission maintains that harmonisation is necessary because, under EC single market laws, no country is supposed to impose regulations that impede the free market of products around the community. However, the European Court of Justice has said Denmark is justified in banning imports of aluminium cans because the Danes do not have sufficient recycling capacity to handle them. The Belgian chairman of the environment ministers' council, Magda de Galan, called a special meeting for 13 December in a bid to find a compromise. She said that meeting would also debate a controversial proposal to institute a tax on energy and carbon fuels as a way of fighting global warming. The meeting could not agree Friday on a joint ratification of the Rio convention on climatic change by the year-end, despite their commitment to do so at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. Germany, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg have demanded that ratification should go hand-in-hand with a decision to impose an energy tax. But Britain has refused to accept such a tax. Earlier, the ministers agreed to cut the production of methyl bromide, a toxic fumigant and pesticide, by 25 percent before 1 January 1998. And they decided to speed up the phasing out of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which is used mainly in refrigeration and is harmful to the earth's ozone layer. Production will be cut 35 percent by 2004 and stopped entirely by 2015.
