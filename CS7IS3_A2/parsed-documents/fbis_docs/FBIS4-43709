It seemed to me that these elections had, on the one hand, revealed a feeling of dissatisfaction among our compatriots on the way in which Europe was working, though they did not in the main call into question their basic attachment to Europe; on the other hand, these elections have resulted in a fragmentation of France's representation in the EP, which could be damaging to the interests of our country. I have drawn the following two conclusions, about which I wanted to inform the representatives of the EP: The first is that the coordination of the activity of French officials in Brussels must be better organized. For this reason, I will preside over a monthly meeting prepared by Mr. Alain Lamassoure, the minister for European affairs, where we will examine developments in Brussels -- directives, regulations -- which we sometimes feel are adopted without sufficient national consultation. Second, in order to fight against the unfortunate effects of the fragmentation of the French delegation in the EP, I have proposed that, every month, French members of the EP from all parties should meet with the European affairs minister, so that they can be informed of what the government is doing, of what its policies are, what it is currently debating, and so that the debate in the EP is coordinated with the government. In other words, to put things very simply.... [Announcer interrupts] Well, that was what the prime minister had to say live after meeting with the leaders of the European election lists this morning.
