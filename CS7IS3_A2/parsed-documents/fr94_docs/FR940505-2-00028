Take notice that on April 28, 1994, Koch Gateway Pipeline Company (Koch), P.o. Box 1478, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1478, and Florida Gas Transmission Company (Florida), P.O. Box 1188, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1188, filing in Docket No. CP94&hyph;385&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization to reassign volumes of gas to be delivered pursuant to an exchange agreement between the two pipelines under the blanket certificates issued to Koch in Docket No. CP82&hyph;430&hyph;000 and issued to Florida in Docket No. CP82&hyph;553&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Koch and Florida state that one of the three exchange points specified in the original exchange transaction is inactive and is no longer needed. Koch and Florida propose to reassign the gas volumes to the remaining two exchange points. They further state that the total volumes to be delivered after the requested reassignment will not exceed the total volumes authorized prior to the request; that they have adequate capacity to accomplish the reassigned deliveries without detriment or disadvantage to other customers; and the proposed change will not impact either of the pipelines' peak day and annual deliveries. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to §157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.
