He added that "specific decisions will be made in accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine" in the near future. Mikhalchenko pointed out that the Ukrainian Constitution never envisioned presidential elections in the Crimea. He also said Ukrainian Speaker Ivan Plyushch had warned the Crimean parliament of the impossibility of holding such elections before. The Ukrainian president's press office is expected to come out with a statement on the issue in a day or two. As a result of the first round of the presidential elections in the Crimea on January 16, the leader of the Republican Party of the Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov, led the race with 38.8 percent of the electorate. He is widely known as a supporter of the Crimea's unification with Russia. Ukrainian patriotic forces will never recognize the legality of the presidential elections in the Crimea, according to the statement the leader of the Civic Congress of the Crimea, Sergey Litvinov, made in an interview with INTERFAX-Ukraine. At the same time, he admitted that the Crimean elections were a fiasco of nationalist movements whose popularity on the peninsula is very low. In his opinion, this is a result of the Ukrainian leadership's imprudent policy which left Crimean Ukrainians with no support. A deputy of the Ukrainian parliament and one of the leaders of the nationalist movement "Rukh," Les Tanyuk, commented on the election returns by saying that their main result was the failure of Kravchuk's team. "People voted not against Nikolay Bahrov (Speaker of the Ukrainian parliament -- INTERFAX) as a politician, but rather against Bahrov as Kravchuk's representative," he told INTERFAX-Ukraine. He put all the blame for this on the Ukrainian president who failed to promptly stand up against the illegal elections as a guarantor of the Constitution. Tanyuk said Yuriy Meshkov promised easy ways out of simple situations and in this sense he was one of Zhirinovskiy's men to a great extent. The repercussions of the elections may be very dangerous and disastrous both for Ukraine and Russia, as well as for the whole of Europe, Tanyuk said.
