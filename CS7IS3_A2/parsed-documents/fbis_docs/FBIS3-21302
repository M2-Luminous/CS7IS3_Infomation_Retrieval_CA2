AL-HAYAH has also learned that the Libyan General People's Conference has conducted a limited cabinet reshuffle. The Libyan media yesterday reported al-Qadhdhafi's remarks in Banghazi, in which he said that Libya had arrested "spies" working for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, among them hardline Muslims, and threatened that the Libyan people would tear any "traitor" to pieces. Al-Qadhdhafi gave no details about the identity or number of the alleged spies, but he said that they had spread false rumors to the advantage of U.S. intelligence. "The traitors are not only the spies we seized the day before yesterday," he said, "nor only stray dogs [dissidents], but also those who had joined the Muslim Brotherhood organization." He added that the spies were acting as part of a plan to weaken the morale of the Libyan people in facing the sanctions imposed by the United Nations, to force Libya to hand over those accused of blowing up the Pan American plane over Lockerbie. "They [the spies] are responsible for many of the rumors we heard in the streets, on the orders of U.S. intelligence," he continued. "The rumors were fabricated and concocted for them by U.S. intelligence, who asked them to spread them among Libyan citizens to hamper the spirit of our people, and make Libyans have doubts about their revolution, to weaken them before America, Britain, and France, and make them hand over their sons. The Libyan people will chop them into pieces." [passage omitted]
