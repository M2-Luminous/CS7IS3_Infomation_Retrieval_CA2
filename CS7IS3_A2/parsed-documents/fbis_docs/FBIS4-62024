The head of the Russian state drew attention to some strategic factors in East-West economic relations, particularly to the fact that "the merging of the Western investment potential with the resources and labour force of the new independent states is becoming increasingly pressing in our days". "It is absolutely clear now that the Russian Federation, like the other CIS states, has irreversibly embarked upon the road of reforms, switching over from the centralised planned economy to market relations, and is fully resolved to go the whole hog," Yeltsin pointed out. The address of the Russian president who, as noted here, wanted to attend the general session personally, but could not do it due to the busy programme of his official visit to Germany, had set the tune to many other speeches. "I readily joined the work of the international committee," its vice leader and chairman of the "Deutsche Bank" supervisory council Friedrich Wilhelm Christians noted, "because I was sure that integration processes had begun in the CIS countries. The former republics of the Soviet Union made a big mistake when they presumed that each of them could survive independently after the USSR's collapse. This is impossible today. Not only much time was wasted in vain during the years that had elapsed since then, but great damage was inflicted upon those states, too," this prominent German banker who, as he said, has been actively cooperating for the past 25 years first with the former USSR and then with the CIS nations, told the general session. "And after the beginning of the integration process, not only in the political but also in the economic sphere, it was time to think of the emergence of those countries on the world market," Christians noted. "The Bonn general session," head of the international committee and Chairman of the Council of Experts of the Russian Government Georgiy Khizha stressed, "is an important event in the international economic life. "The preservation of peace, political stability and democracy in the CIS countries and other states of the world depends largely on economic and social progress. The work of the committee should make a substantial contribution to the development of real partnership, trust, and mutual understanding. International security in the interests of all the countries of the world can be achieved through economic cooperation," Khizha stressed.
