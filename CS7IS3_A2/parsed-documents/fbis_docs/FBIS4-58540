The government approved the policy today. I should explain that according to that policy from now on our private sector will also be able to set up non-banking credit establishments. As you know, at the moment in our country only banks deal with money matters. [passage omitted] In a developing country, which needs more investments; more savings, there is a need for more instruments to attract people's savings. That is why in many developing and developed countries non-banking establishments exist. We also decided to create such non-banking establishments in order to offer, on the one hand, a more diverse variety for people's investments and, on the other hand, to be able to offer loans. The only difference between those institutions and banks is that they cannot issue written credit documents. That is they cannot offer check books to the public. They can offer all types of saving accounts and offer all type of loans, but they cannot offer any current accounts. In our announcement next week we shall set out all their conditions so that those seeking to set up such establishments can apply accordingly. God willing, such establishments will begin operation in our country and a better efficiency is brought about in the country in the allocation of resources. [Correspondent] Thank you, Dr. 'Adeli, for your explanations.
