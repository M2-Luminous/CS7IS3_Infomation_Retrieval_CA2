Having briefed the participants on the province's overall plan for economic development for the current year, Ma said: This year will see Henan Province undergoing the most intensive reform. In the wake of the introduction of some reformatory measures and the adjustment of interest relations, it is certain that some new circumstances and new problems will be emerging, and some unstable factors will be coming to the surface as well. When performing its duties, the armed police force is to do away with these unstable factors before they gain ground. In doing so the armed police force is supporting reform and development. Amid the great tide of reform, the armed police force will be playing still more important a role. Therefore you are expected to conscientiously sum up experience, work harder, strive for greater progress, and make greater contributions.
