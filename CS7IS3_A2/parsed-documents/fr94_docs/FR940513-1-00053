FR940513-1-00053 FR940513-1-00012 Example 8. Taxpayer Z prepares a report that it is required by state law to submit to a state corporation commission. Z sends a copy of the report to its delegate in the state legislature along with the taxpayer's letter opposing a bill that would increase the state sales tax. Even though the letter to the delegate is a lobbying communication (because it refers to, and reflects a view on, specific legislation), under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, the preparation of the report does not constitute influencing legislation. Example 9. Taxpayer Y purchases an annual subscription to a commercial, general circulation newsletter that provides legislative updates on proposed tax legislation. Employees in Y's legislative affairs department read the newsletter in order to keep abreast of legislative developments. Even if Y attempts to influence legislation that is identified and tracked in the newsletter, under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section, the time spent by employees of Y reading the newsletter does not constitute influencing legislation. (d) Special imputation rule. If one taxpayer, for the purpose of making or supporting a lobbying communication, uses the services or facilities of a second taxpayer and does not compensate the second taxpayer for the full cost of the services or facilities, the purpose and actions of the first taxpayer are imputed to the second taxpayer. Thus, for example, if a trade association uses the services of a member's employee, at no cost to the association, to conduct research or similar activities to support the trade association's lobbying communication, the trade association's purpose and actions are imputed to the member. As a result, the member is treated as influencing legislation with respect to the employee's work in support of the trade association's lobbying communication. (e) Anti-avoidance rule. If a taxpayer, alone or in coordination with one or more other taxpayers, purposely structures its attempts to influence legislation to achieve results that are unreasonable in light of the purposes of section 162(e) and section 6033(e), the Commissioner can take such steps as are appropriate to achieve reasonable results consistent with the purposes of section 162(e), section 6033(e), and this section. (f) Effective date. This section is effective for amounts paid or incurred on or after May 13, 1994. Taxpayers must adopt a reasonable interpretation of section 162(e)(1)(A) for amounts paid or incurred prior to this date. Par. 3. In §1.162&hyph;20, paragraph (c)(5) is added to read as follows: §1.162&hyph;20 Expenditures attributable to lobbying, political campaigns, attempts to influence legislation, etc., and certain advertising. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (5) Expenses paid or incurred after December 31, 1993, in connection with influencing legislation other than certain local legislation. The provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section are superseded for expenses paid or incurred after December 31, 1993, in connection with influencing legislation (other than certain local legislation) to the extent inconsistent with section 162(e)(1)(A) (as limited by section 162(e)(2)) and §§1.162&hyph;20T(d) and 1.162&hyph;29.
