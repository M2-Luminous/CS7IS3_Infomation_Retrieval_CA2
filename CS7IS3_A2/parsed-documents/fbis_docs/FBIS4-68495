Koptyug: "Attempts To Resolve the Question in Parts Is Doomed to Failure (Speech at the Scientific-Practical Conference `Strategy of Stabilization of the Economy of the Region: Problems and Resolutions'"] [Text] A feverish search is going on today at the level of state and territorial structures for extricating industries and territorial multibranch complexes out of the profound crisis in which they find themselves. Programs are being considered and formed on how to stop the slump and to restore the most important spheres of the economy of Russia (the fuel-energy sphere, enterprises of the military-industrial complex, the agro-industrial sector, the municipal economy, etc.) and its regions, krays, and oblasts. These programs are being lobbied by representatives of industries and territories in the Federal Assembly, in the Russian Federation Government, and on the president's staff. In the process, someone succeeds in extracting something, but the situation, on the whole, is only getting worse. To do justice to the significance of today's conference on problems of the development of Novosibirsk Oblast and the efforts of the Siberian Accord interregional association throughout Siberia in general, which is important for the future, I would like to note immediately that the efforts to resolve the question in parts are doomed to failure. The question of "how to survive" can be resolved in part, but it is impossible to find an answer to the question of "how to live and develop?" If we go along with the "reforms" conducted in recent years, if fundamental changes are not introduced in the strategy of socio-economic transformations in the country, then it simply would be daydreaming to count on the fact that, with the help of industrial and territorial programs, we will succeed in averting a further drop into the abyss of a crisis and in improving the situation in the regions. Why? Let us analyze it. The pivotal point of the reforms being conducted in our country is the attempt to introduce comprehensive market relations and private property across the board, even on the land on which we all live and feed ourselves. To expect that the market and general privatization in property will themselves regulate everything is ridiculous. Russians have already felt the full impact on themselves of just what a "wild market" is, but a civilized market is built over decades. It is impossible to build a civilized, regulated system of market relations in 500 or 1,000 days. And this must be clearly understood. The country is reaping the fruit today of the "revolutionary" effort to join the market. Why do I think that today's attempts to resolve the problem in parts is hopeless? First of all, because the country at all levels of management--state, branches of industry, and local--was deprived of the basic part of investment resources. And the matter here is by no means only in the catastrophic slump in the volumes of production, although there was no such production crisis in the entire history of the development of industrial countries in peacetime. The sharp slump in production is not so much a reason as a consequence. The consequence of the kind of policy that was conducted in Russia during the last two years. What then do we have as a result of the clumsy reformation? The introduction of elements of the market system were absolutely correctly reasoned as a need to arouse the initiative of the people, and with the help of entrepreneurial structures to ensure a rise in the output of products for the spheres of consumption and production. But for this, the levers of state stimulation of private-entrepreneurial production should be engaged, not even to mention the state sector. Did the state guarantee this? No. Although the support and protection of the domestic producer is the sacred obligation of the state and of those who formulate policy. Today, as a result of the disproportion of prices for raw materials, energy, transport, and industrial articles, and the incredibly high credit interest, to produce something in the overwhelming majority of production sectors means to operate at a financial loss. What kind of an entrepreneur will begin to do this? It is precisely for this reason that the entrepreneurial structures in Russia went mainly (by 90 percent) along the path of trade, and, more specifically, speculation. Playing on the already mentioned price disproportions, they are amassing enormous capital that is not invested in domestic production, but is exported abroad. The accumulation of capital in the countries to which capital is exported makes it possible to lower credit rates there and thereby expand investment in production. It is embarrassing for me to call things by their name. Ask Western economists how they would characterize the actions of their government, if they would permit a similar situation. In the system of market relations, the principle of "self comes first" works especially distinctly. But so that the concept of "self" include not only personal, but also national interest, developed countries have built a very tough system of regulators and limiters. But how much capital "flows away" abroad? According to the estimates of the experts, about $30 billion have been exported, and about $1.5 billion are exported monthly at the present time. This is an enormous blow against the economy of Russia. Judge for yourself. An attempt is being made to draw up the state budget of Russia for 1994, which is being discussed at the present time, with an increase in expenditures over incomes by approximately 10 percent, or, in a monetary expression, by 60 trillion rubles [R], which is equivalent to $33 billion, and the annual export of capital is valued at the present time at $18 billion; i.e., more than half the budget deficit. According to official data, $15.5 billion out of the $48 billion value of exports did not return to Russia. But through channels that are not monitored? In similar situations, civilized countries conduct strict control over the export of capital in order to force it, with the help of economic and legislative measures, "to work" in their own country. While not undertaking the necessary measures in this direction, Russia at the same time is trying to cover the chronic deficit of the state budget at the expense of foreign loans. But, first, two-thirds of foreign credits usually remain in the crediting countries to support the production of that product (be it grain, industrial articles, or technology) that is later delivered to Russia owing to the credits. Thus, we are once again stimulating the development of production and the creation of jobs most of all not in our own country, but among our neighbors, burdening our state budget with foreign debt interest payment obligations. Second, that third that does come to Russia disappears "in the sand," as a result of the chaos in the spheres of management and control. Third, the real sum of financial resources that came to our country during two years (1992-1993) because $15 billion in foreign credits amounted to $4 billion, which corresponds to the total export of capital for two and a half months. No less a powerful blow to the economy of the country was delivered and is being delivered by the insane policy of privatization. I cannot call the privatization that is being conducted at government level anything other than a fantastic swindle. I will not talk about the enormous disorganizational role of this policy with respect to industry, agriculture, the municipal sphere, etc. I will dwell only on the financial side of the matter. What is a voucher from a financial standpoint? Nothing more than a small share of a monthly wage. Anatoliy Borisovich Chubays, at the beginning of the "division" of state property, gave assurances that every voucher is at least equivalent to a passenger car. But no matter how much you try, you will not succeed in finding a commercial structure that is ready to take a voucher in exchange for a passenger car or other motor vehicle. One voucher is nothing, but thousands and tens of thousands of vouchers in the same hands, this is considerable, inasmuch as they give the owner the right to acquire large property at a favorable price, and in this case the voucher can really be "converted" into a passenger car. Did the people win as a result of voucherization? No. Did the state win from it? Also, no. I will explain why the last answer is also negative. Toward the beginning of 1994, somewhat more than half of the state enterprises in the country were privatized, principally small and average ones. Now, in order to complete the privatization program before the summer of 1994, the privatization of large enterprises is unfolding at an increased pace. The "revolutionary" nature of the pace and methods of privatization is akin to the "revolutionary nature" of the shock construction of the system of market relations. The privatization program allegedly pursued economic objectives, but, in fact, they were purely political. Now, these objectives are no longer concealed--to quickly create a class of large property owners who would not allow the policy of capitalization of the country to be stopped. And it must be said that the achievement of this objective is not far off. And perhaps it has already been achieved, which I will talk about below. Did the state receive anything on an economic plane from the implementation of the privatization program? As an answer to this question, I will quote an excerpt from a March article of John Ross, an economic adviser to a group of Laborites of the British Parliament, which was published in DELOVOY MIR. "...In order to understand what this means for state incomes, it is necessary simply to note that the privatization of one large steel foundry in Brazil--Usiminas--gave the state $1.17 billion. In Mexico, the privatization of 950 enterprises (and in Russia by the start of 1994, 85,000 enterprises were privatized--V.K.) gave the state $23 billion. But, after all, both the Brazilian and Mexican enterprises are incomparably smaller than, for example, ZIL. Nevertheless, in Russia the income from privatization was practically zero in comparison with the value of the removed funds. "The implementation of this program had an exclusively macroeconomic consequence. The squandering of state property made it qualitatively difficult to finance the budget deficit. Thus, this privatization program from the beginning deprived the country of income from property that belonged to it, and afterwards the possible profits from its potential sale. The indirect consequences of this policy, operating through the budget, will lead to a reduction of credits and, as a consequence, to the closing of enterprises. "Unquestionably, it was not the Central Bank that was the biggest creator of the budget deficit in Russia, but the privatization committee." Thus, the objective that was really pursued by the authors and implementers of "shock" methods of introducing the market system and privatization, and specifically, the formation of a class of large owners of capital and property, was achieved. According to official data, 10 percent of the most well-to-do people in Russia on the average have incomes that are 11-12 times greater than 10 percent of the people who are least provided for. In a number of regions, this ratio is two to three times higher, and if the unaccounted for and concealed incomes are considered, it undoubtedly is even more. Such a disproportion cannot help but prompt social disruption. For the reasons talked about above, the new class will not invest its capital in Russia's economy in the near future. Their prime task now is to take power into their own hands, real power, and not official, window-dressing power. The answer to the question "Can something still be done to stop the fall of Russia into the abyss?" depends on how far they have already moved ahead in this direction. It is a difficult question. Judging by certain signs, they have moved ahead far. Remember, for example, how many times a resolute struggle was proclaimed against organized large-scale economic and physical crime and against that without which organized crime cannot exist--against corruption of the state apparatus--but it turns out in practice that despite the measures that are being proclaimed, these monstrous ulcers on the body of the country are only spreading. Not only is trade shifting to the control of criminal structures in increasingly greater measure, but also such very important spheres as the system of money circulation, foreign economic relations, and privatization. The state allows the swindlers in the sphere of business to collect enormous amounts of money from the population through fake banks and funds and to disappear with them without a trace. But what is to be done, if some chances of saving the economy still exist? It follows from what was said above that the resolution of economic problems today lies most of all in the political sphere and in the sphere of government management. The failure of the "shock therapy" policy in Russia is obvious. The consequences of this are very grave. It is necessary to admit this courageously and to display the will for a decisive correction in policy. This is required of both the leaders of the country and society. I will mention in this connection the winged phrase of Academician L.I. Abalkin: "Christ was crucified on the demand of the masses!" By whom and how such a demand of the masses is formed is another question. I fully agree with the words the president of the Russian Federation uttered at an expanded meeting of the government at the beginning of March of this year: "A policy is required of the government today that is calculated to have promise. To reform the economy at any price is an erroneous slogan. The people can reject a reform that is too burdensome" (which, in fact, occurred in the elections to parliament of Russia in December of last year). "In the end, the government must realistically develop a structural-investment policy. There is no other way to stop the technological roll back of Russia's industry. Otherwise, we can lose what little we have--industries, retained personnel, technological and other positions on the world market, and a native intellectual potential." Correct words, only they are pronounced with a big delay. If deeds follow words with just as much of a big delay, then it will already be late. What steps have to be taken now to create the conditions for restoring production in Russia? The same ones spoken by that outstanding president of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, who was elected to this post at the beginning of the 1930's, when the country was rapidly plunged into the abyss of an economic crisis that resulted from "a wild market"--he introduced tough state regulation and began to ease it when the country was once again on its feet. Borrowing from the Country of the Soviets the experience of strategic planning and state regulation, after adapting it to the capitalistic system, he saved this system. But over the course of three-quarters of a century, we have closed our eyes to the experience of the development of capitalist countries, ignoring the fact that state regulation can be implemented not only by the command method, for which we paid or plunged ourselves (or we were pushed) into another extreme, but by more effective economic methods. Perhaps, at least now, while sliding toward the abyss of a crisis, we will see clearly and we will borrow from the history of the United States the path suggested to them by our country for getting out of the crisis. But this requires the firm will of the leaders of the country and an understanding of their actions by the people. Persuasions according to the principle of Leopold the cat have little promise today. In a speech at the expanded meeting of the government, the president of the Russian Federation, while characterizing the actions planned for 1994, declared: "I will begin by bringing order and strengthening state economic principles." It would be very nice, if this did not remain just a declaration. If we are talking about a correction of the economic sphere as such, then one of the paramount questions here is the monstrous disproportions in prices, and the key elements are the prices in the fuel-energy complex and in transport. On the one hand, the fact that domestic prices for energy sources are below world prices leads to the current conditions of criminalizing the sphere of their removal to the foreign market and to an increase in the already mentioned accumulation of capital abroad. On the other hand, an increase in domestic prices for energy sources will result in an industry that is already collapsing without this and will increase the total amount of mutual nonpayments. Let us imagine that the prices of energy sources will be increased to world prices. Inasmuch as the energy and material consumption of our industries, as a rule, is higher than in developed countries, and labor productivity is lower, the prices for the products of these industries will increase higher than world prices, and, given open national borders (with respect to foreign economic relations), this production will turn out to be noncompetitive not only in the foreign market, but in the domestic market as well. The consequences are obvious--industry and agriculture will be utterly ruined Consequently, to raise domestic prices for energy sources to world level without erecting customs barriers for imports of key types of products is impermissible. But inasmuch as our industrial production should be brought onto the world market--otherwise we will always only sell raw materials and become a raw material appendage of the developed countries--then it is obvious that before industry is reconstructed and its indices approach those of the West, domestic prices for energy sources must be lower than world prices. The level of favorable prices for energy sources should be tied strictly to a program of phased reduction of the specific (per unit of product) energy consumption of an enterprise. The wage fund of the workers of the enterprise should also be tied to this and other programs for increasing the efficiency of production. As long as the market mechanism is not working, the state is obliged to regulate the price of manpower; i.e., wages, at least in the main industries of the economy. But, today, the lack of coordination on wages in our country is unbelievable. As for the fuel-energy complex, at least at first, it will have to be subsidized, while simultaneously cutting the Gordian knot of mutual nonpayments. No less important for Siberia with its enormous territory is the level of the cost of transportation services. Expenditures on railroad transportation render many types of raw materials unsuitable for extraction, inasmuch as the processing complexes are usually located in other points of Siberia. Even without this, transportation costs greatly weaken cooperative relations. And, finally, the last thing I want to talk about, while contemplating the future of the country. Knowledge will be and is already becoming the main capital in postindustrial society in the developed countries. The destruction at all levels of education, fundamental and applied science, and culture will deprive our country of the future. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the plans of the economic development of Novosibirsk Oblast and Siberia, but only the nearest events can be predicted. As for long-term projects and programs, without resolution of the aforementioned global overall state problems, there is a great probability that they will turn into harebrained schemes. Territorial efforts today must be combined and directed at changes in the strategy of socio-economic reorganizations. The details of the strategy can be argued, but its outline is generally apparent. There is a whole series of sensible documents and reports bearing on this question, and pertinent decisions must be made. The time is short. The adoption of such decisions can really only be achieved by the united efforts of the regions. The attempts of certain territories to extract resources or benefits only for themselves will turn into losses for everyone. Siberia needs economic integration of the territories on the basis of resourceful, technological, and economic mutual replenishment of each, and not disintegration. There is a need for the collective defense of a worthy place and role of Siberia in the economy of the country. It will be sad and vexing if the "Siberian Agreement" does not fulfill the hopes placed on it. On occasion, one hears reproaches of separatist tendencies directed at Siberians. I do not think that there are objective grounds for this. It seems to me that an understanding prevails in Siberia that a sensible combination of regional and national interests can be achieved only given the unconditional supremacy of the federal legislative authority and the simultaneous transfer of a significant part of executive authority functions to the localities with a guarantee of economic opportunities to fulfill these functions. At the same time, the general federal policy with respect to the regions should take into account their main features and the significance of their development of the country as a whole. As for the predictions and recommendations for the economic development of Siberia and its territories, we presented them at the appropriate All-Russian conference in June of 1993. They will also be given with an amendment to the events of recent months in this congress in speeches of representatives of the Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Without going into detail, I will say that the core of these recommendations is the position that it is precisely Siberia with its very rich resources, production, and scientific potential, and special territorial situation, that can play the "role of the locomotive" that will pull the country out of the crisis. This can be done by implementing the conditions mentioned above and by declaring Siberia a zone of strategic interests of Russia. The alternative is that Siberia can become a zone of strategic interests of the United States. After all, fantastic ideas of purchasing Siberia from Russia for about $3 trillion, with the payment of this sum over 20 years, are already being nurtured; moreover, half with "payment in kind"; i.e., with the goods and services of the producers of the United States. The delirium of a madman? I would grade similar proposals precisely as delirium, but the fact is that the Western mass media only publishes "delirium," when there is a demand for it, and when it is necessary to sound out the opinion of those whom this might concern. This should be kept in mind when encountering similar delirious ideas.
