Details in the following report by Kassab Samawi: [Begin recording] [Samawi] Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali led the welcoming party at the airport for 117 Jordanian and other Arab nationals who arrived from Sanaa this evening aboard a Royal Jordanian Airlines plane. The prime minister shook hands with each of the Jordanians and Arabs. [Al-Majali] As you know, his majesty the king is particularly sensitive to humanitarian issues, as much with regard to non-Jordanians as Jordanians. Of course, in this case, given that there is a large number of Jordanians in Yemen, his majesty ordered that military and civilian planes be sent to evacuate whoever wished to be evacuated, particularly women and children. Four planes have thus far made the trip there and back. We are in constant contact with our ambassador in Sanaa to keep us posted. His majesty ordered that medicines be dispatched to Yemen. A well-trained and well-equipped medical team has travelled to Yemen to help out. [end recording]
