FR940930-0-00239 FR940930-0-00029 (a) A railroad that exclusively operates freight trains only on track which is not part of the general railroad system of transportation; (b) Rapid transit operations within an urban area that are not connected to the general railroad system of transportation; and (c) A railroad that operates passenger trains only on track inside an installation that is insular; i.e., its operations are limited to a separate enclave in such a way that there is no reasonable expectation that the safety of the public_except a business guest, a licensee of the railroad or an affiliated entity, or a trespasser_would be affected by the operation. An operation will not be considered insular if one or more of the following exists on its line: (1) A public highway-rail crossing that is in use; (2) An at-grade rail crossing that is in use; (3) A bridge over a public road or waters used for commercial navigation; or (4) A common corridor with a railroad, i.e., its operations are within 30 feet of those of any railroad. 6. Section 234.4 is added to read as follows: §234.4 Preemptive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 20106 (formerly §205 of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 434)), issuance of these regulations preempts any State law, rule, regulation, order, or standard covering the same subject matter, except a provision directed at an essentially local safety hazard that is consistent with this part and that does not impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. 7. Amend §234.5 by removing paragraph designations, listing definitions in alphabetical order, and adding the following definitions to read as follows: §234.5 Definitions. * * * * * Appropriately equipped flagger means a person other than a train crewmember who is equipped with an orange vest, shirt, or jacket for daytime flagging.

The retroreflective material shall be either orange, white (including silver-colored coatings or elements that retroreflect white light), yellow, fluorescent red-orange, or fluorescent yellow-orange and shall be designed to be visible at a minimum distance of 1,000 feet. The design configuration of the retroreflective material shall provide recognition of the wearer as a human being and shall be visible through the full range of body motions. Acceptable hand signal devices for daytime flagging include ``STOP/SLOW'' paddles and red flags. For nighttime flagging, a flashlight, lantern, or other lighted signal shall be used. Credible report of system malfunction means specific information regarding a malfunction at an identified highway-rail crossing, supplied by a railroad employee, law enforcement officer, highway traffic official, or other employee of a public agency acting in an official capacity. * * * * * Warning system malfunction means an activation failure or a false activation of a highway-rail grade crossing warning system. §§234.15 and 234.17 [Redesignated as §234.6] 8. Redesignate the heading and text of §234.15, and the heading and text of §234.17, as the heading and text of a new paragraph (a) of §234.6 and the heading and text of paragraph (b) of § 234.6, respectively; add a new section heading for newly designated §234.6; and revise the newly designated paragraph (a) of §234.6 to read as follows: §234.6 Penalties.

Any person (including but not limited to a railroad; any manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of a railroad; any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, or facilities; any employee of such owner, manufacturer, lessor, lessee, or independent contractor) who violates any requirement of this part or causes the violation of any such requirement is subject to a civil penalty of at least $500, but not more than $10,000 per violation, except that: penalties may be assessed against individuals only for willful violations, and where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated violations has created an imminent hazard of death of injury to persons, or has caused death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $20,000 per violation may be assessed. Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. Appendix A to this part contains a schedule of civil penalty amounts used in connection with this rule. * * * * * 9. Designate §§234.1 through 234.6 as ``Subpart A_General'' and designate §§234.7 through 234.13 as ``Subpart B_Reports.'' 10. Add new ``Subpart C_Response to Reports of Warning System Malfunction,'' and new ``Subpart D_Maintenance, Inspection, and Testing,'' to read as follows: Subpart C_Response to Reports of Warning System Malfunction Sec. 234.101␣Employee notification rules. 234.103␣Timely response to report of malfunction. 234.105␣Activation failure. 234.107␣False activation. 234.109␣Recordkeeping.
