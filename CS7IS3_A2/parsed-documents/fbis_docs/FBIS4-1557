Wang Kuicai, economist of the Internal Trade Ministry, said in an interview with XINHUA that China's total retail sale volume of commodities will continue to increase by a big margin this year, adding that 1994 will be another year of fast growth for China's economy. The stable economic growth will ensure ample supplies of various commodities and the actual demand for commodities will remain robust this year, according to the economist. According to official estimates, the country's total investment in fixed assets this year will be up 20 percent over the 1993 figure. Moreover, the reform of the wage system and particularly the measures taken by the government to support the agricultural sector will help raise the per capita income by 26 percent for urban residents and by nine percent for farmers. The economist expects that in 1994 the total retail sale volume of commodities will jump by around 23 to 24 percent to hit 1,650 billion yuan to 1,680 billion yuan. The present situation of supply exceeding demand will remain unchanged this year, though the supply of some agricultural and sideline products may fall short of demand. The State Ministry of Internal Trade made a comprehensive analysis of the supply and demand of the country's 726 major commodities recently. The results showed that 95.8 percent of the 542 major industrial products have struck a balance between supply and demand or supply exceeding demand; and 62.5 percent of the agricultural and sideline products are also in that state. However, edible oil and cotton will fall short of demand, the economist said. According to the experts, price rises and insufficient supply of some agricultural and sideline products will constitute the major potential factors fluctuating Chinese domestic markets. Therefore, the experts stressed that all the government departments involved must see to a stable growth of domestic markets and try their best to maintain overall balance between supply and demand. They called on various localities to straighten out in good time the structural contradictions and regional imbalances, by means of macro economic control and market regulation, so as to ensure a prosperous and stable market. Ying Wenhua, another economist of the Internal Trade Ministry predicted that the markets for capital goods, particularly the sale of steel products, will be brisk in the first half of 1994, which he believed would in turn invigorate the whole market.
