FR941230-2-00044 FR941230-2-00035 Geological Survey Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC); Public Review of Position Paper and Recommendations on Linear Referencing Systems AGENCY: U.S. Geological Survey, Interior. ACTION: Notice; request for comments. SUMMARY: The FGDC is sponsoring a public review of a draft position paper and set of recommendations on linear referencing systems for roads, railroads, and navigable waterways. A linear referencing system is a mechanism to identify locations on a transportation system, such as a road network, using defined reference points and distances from the reference points measured along routes in the network. Linear referencing systems are employed to locate features such as bridges and other structures, events such as accidents, and attributes such as pavement condition. The development of a standard system would aid the exchange of data, which in turn would increase the utility of information and decrease duplication of efforts. The draft recommendations will be used to guide the activities of the FGDC, especially in the implementation of the concept of framework data for the National Spatial Data Infrastructure. The success of these actions depends on the inclusion of views of State and local governments, industry, and the public. The purpose of this notice is to solicit such views. The FGDC invites the community to evaluate the draft position paper and recommendations DATES: Comments must be received on or before March 10, 1995. ADDRESSES: Written comments concerning the draft should be sent by mail to LRS Review, FGDC Secretariat, U.S. Geological Survey, 590 National Center, 12201 Sunrise Valley Drive, Reston, Virginia 22092. The draft may be requested from the same mailing address, or from Internet address gdc@usgs.gov or facsimile number (703) 648&hyph;5755. Internet users should identify their name, affiliation, and postal and Internet addresses at the bottom of their message. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jennifer Snyder, FGDC Secretariat, U.S. Geological Survey, 590 National Center, 12201 Sunrise Valley Drive, Reston, Virginia 22092; telephone number (703) 648&hyph;5514; facsimile number (703) 648&hyph;5755; or Internet ``gdc@usgs.gov''. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The draft was prepared by the FGDC's ground transportation subcommittee under responsibilities assigned by Office of Management and Budget Circular A&hyph;16. The subcommittee, chaired by the Federal Highway Administration, includes representatives of other modal agencies of the Department of Transportation, as well as other Federal agencies. The subcommittee plans to sponsor additional discussions about linear referencing systems at the Geographic Information Systems for Transportation (GIS&hyph;T) Symposium, which is scheduled to be held April 2&hyph;5, 1995, in Sparks, Nevada. Dated: December 19, 1994. James R. Plasker, Associate Chief, National Mapping Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;32187 Filed 12&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;31&hyph;M
