The Moslem forces which control this northern Bosnian town are burning piles of tyres to make it look as if the town is in smoke after an air raid, the sources said. Moslem-controlled Radio Sarajevo alleged on Sunday that Bosnian Serb aircraft had destroyed the bridge across the River Bosna which bisects Maglaj, and Moslem army commander Gen. Rasim Delic has requested the commander of the U.N. Protection Force in Bosnia, General Sir Michael Rose, to order "an immediate intervention" by the NATO air force. The NATO Command for Southern Europe in Naples, Italy, on Sunday denied that Bosnian Serb aircraft had violated the "no fly" zone over Bosnia. NATO Spokesman in Naples John Jeffrey said NATO had no information about any violation of Bosnian air space and could not confirm that Maglaj had been raided from the air. REUTERS, Mega and Antenne 1 television crews have filmed Moslem assaults on the eastern slopes of Mt Ozren and the situation in nearby Maglaj, and the footage showed the town to be quiet. Bosnian Serb military sources said that the Moslem allegation of a Serb raid on Maglaj was designed to draw attention away from Moslem offensives in the north -- in the areas of Mt Ozren, Trebava and Doboj, and in the Bosna river valley. The Bosnian Serb army said in a statement that a Moslem sabotage unit from Tesanj had blown up the iron bridge in Maglaj in order to prevent Moslem civilians from crossing to the right bank of the Bosna and fleeing to Moslem-held Zenica in central Bosnia, under an agreement with the Bosnian Serb army.
