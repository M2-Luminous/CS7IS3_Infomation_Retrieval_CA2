The sources said Japan will do its best to dispel such concern among Asian nations and to gain their confidence. Japan's occupation of many Asian countries before and during World War II still keeps ASEAN nations nervous about the country's military intentions. Foreign ministers from six ASEAN member countries and their dialogue partners agreed at a 1993 session to set up the forum to discuss security matters in the region. Representatives from 18 countries and international organizations will attend the forum's first session at the foreign minister level in Bangkok. At the session, Japan will reaffirm the importance of the U.S. presence in the region, and brief participants on its defense policy in an effort to boost their trust and strengthen relations with them as key partners, the sources said. As part of efforts to dispel Asia's concern, Japan will explain its policy of continuing to shoulder the costs for U.S. forces in Japan, they said. China's military modernization and concerns over North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons are also likely to be taken up as topics at the forum. ASEAN links Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Among the 18 other countries and organizations attending the session will be the European Union, Japan, Russia and the United States.
