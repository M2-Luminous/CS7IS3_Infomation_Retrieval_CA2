James? [Barkhuizen] Norma, from a quiet Bisho everything has suddenly erupted into chaos. People are out on the streets, the whole of Bisho is filled with people carrying placards and shouting slogans. Earlier when I was at Brigadier Gqozo's house I was forced by his bodyguards -- at least six of them, all armed -- I was forced to call Television News in the earlier bulletin and to say Brigadier Gqozo was not under house arrest. When I had reported that, the bodyguards brought the brigadier into the room to speak with you on the telephone. It was a very tense situation. Later I left, and at the gate, when I was leaving the palace, a Ciskei Defense Force member, a corporal, told me that he was going to search my car because Brig. Gqozo must not be allowed to escape under any cirumstances. Shortly after that Brig. Gqozo was taken out through the palace gates under guard. I waited for them at the Ciskei police college where the strike has been under way since yesterday, and where the hostages are being held. Brig. Gqozo wanted to speak with Ciskeian police force members in small groups at the college. On his arrival at the gates he was led into an ambush. No shots were fired, but people armed and in Casspirs [armored vehicle] and other vehicles surrounded his own armored vehicle and his bodyguards. One cannot tell whether the bodyguards themselves led him into the ambush, whether they are part of the plot, or whether they have also now been arrested. But they were taken back from the police college under armed guard in a convoy, back through Bisho and out to the Bisho stadium, where the Bisho massacre took place in 1992. Civil servants, Ciskei Defense Force and Police Force members have all gathered in the stadium. They are demanding to hear Brig. Gqozo. That is the situation at the moment. I will have to leave for the stadium now to see what happens there. [Odendaal] Thank you very much, James.
