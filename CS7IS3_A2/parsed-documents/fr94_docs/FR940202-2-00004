FR940202-2-00004 FR940202-2-00001 Five respondents were opposed to increasing the amount of bid guarantee to 10 percent of the advertised value. The basis for their objection was that the additional bid guarantee would place an additional economic stress on the small timber purchaser and would eliminate many from bidding. The agency disagrees. The bid guarantee (deposit with bid) is a good faith showing that a timber sale high bidder will complete the requirements for contract award and will execute the contract within the specified time period. The bid guarantee also serves as a measure of the ability of the bidder to meet the financial requirements for a downpayment, periodic payment, and bonding capacity. Many bidders use bid bonds as a bid guarantee rather than obligating their cash. If bid bonds are used, only the high bidder would be required to convert the bid bond to cash, and it is not necessarily an increase in cash requirements for all bidders. The high bidder's cash would then be used to offset the amount required for downpayment. The increase in bid guarantee from 5 percent to 10 percent of advertised value will result in the high bidder making a larger cash deposit for the approximately 30 days between the bid date and the due date for the downpayment. This short-term increased cash requirement could create a financial hardship for some high bidders. The agency believes that this hardship is more than offset by the increased protection from speculative bidding and from contract repudiation. The increase in bid guarantee will also provide the government with increased financial security by providing a source of funds to satisfy the Government's losses if the contract is repudiated. Therefore, an increase in bid guarantee to 10 percent of the advertised value is adopted in the final policy. 3. Procedures for Determining Contract Repudiation Damages The proposed policy based the determination of damages resulting from repudiation of a bid on the terms contained in timber sale contract provision C(T)9.4. Provision C(T)9.4 generally establishes damages as the difference between current contract value at the time of breach and the bid value established upon resale. The proposed policy provided the option of retaining the timber and establishing damages for breach based on appraised rather than resale value, if resale could not be accomplished in the immediate future or if no bid was received at resale. One respondent supported the concept that repudiation constitutes a breach of contract. The respondent suggested that the penalty for this breach should not only exclude the bidder from participating in the resale, but also treat damages as a default with the bidder being required to furnish double the normal downpayment until any default amount is satisfied. The agency agrees with this comment. Repudiation of contracts will be handled under 36 CFR 223.49(e) which requires that a purchaser or affiliate awarded a future Forest Service contract must meet additional downpayment requirements under specific circumstances, including failure to perform in accordance with the terms of a timber sale contract. The additional downpayment requirements are that such a purchaser must make a minimum downpayment equal to 20 percent of the total advertised value, plus 40 percent of the total bid premium. Three respondents suggested that repudiated contracts be offered and sold to the second high bidder at the price submitted by that bidder. They further suggested that damages be determined as the difference between the original high bid and the second high bid. This approach would be satisfactory in many instances. The agency believes, however, that there will be instances where second high bidders would decline to accept the sale at the price they bid because of the lapse of time from the bid date. When this occurs there would be no resale of the timber and, consequently, no basis for determining damages. This approach would also present the risk of selling the sale at the lower second high bid when, during an ascending market, open competitive bidding would result in a higher bid. Consequently, the final policy retains the features of the proposed policy, and damage calculation will be based on offering the sale to the lower bidders in descending order of their bids at the high bid price. If no bidder accepts the sale at the high bid price, it would normally be reoffered at advertised rates for open bidding. One respondent stated that the proposed policy was an over reaction to the problem and suggested that the government make an estimate of repudiation damages before advertising and then set the bid guarantee accordingly. This approach is similar to the concept of liquidated damages that is currently the method for determining damages resulting from repudiation of service contracts. however, the agency believes that to adequately protect the public interest, damages must be based on an actual loss or cost to the government and that estimating the damages of a potential repudiation well in advance of the fact would be fraught with inaccuracies and very subjective. It would be very difficult to accurately estimate bid rates 60 or more days in advance. In summary, this approach would not provide the government with an adequate determination of damages resulting from repudiation of a bid. Four respondents objected to the language of the proposed policy that would provide the Forest Service the option of retaining the timber and establishing damages for this breach based on appraisal rather than resale, if resale cannot be accomplished in the immediate future or if no bids are received on the resale. These respondents think that the Forest Service must resell the repudiated sale in order to establish damages. They contend that if the repudiated sale is withdrawn for some reason, the government has not suffered damages. They would establish damages based on the resale value plus certain additional costs, such as interest and the cost of resale. The agency disagrees with this comment. The effort and resources expended to prepare and offer a timber sale are made in good faith. Repudiations add delay and costs regardless of subsequent events. Delay may cause loss of the opportunity to sell the timber at all if timber is damaged or deteriorates due to fire, insects, or storm damage. Also legal or other government actions such as new legislation, new court interpretations of existing law, or an agency listing of a wildlife species as threatened or endangered may develop during or as a result of delay which make prompt resale not possible. Even though most sales are reoffered for sale within six months, the agency strongly believes that damages based on the appraised value of the sale plus administrative costs associated with the repudiation are appropriate if the sale cannot be reoffered. Therefore, the final policy differs from the proposed policy only in that a bidder that repudiates a timber sale contract will be subject to double down payment for future contracts. Under the final policy, when a sale is reoffered and the resale bid price does not exceed the original purchaser's price plus certain additional costs (e.g. interest and the cost of resale), damages are assessed at the amount of the deficiency. Further, the policy provides the Forest Service the option of retaining the timber and establishing damages for this breach based on appraisal rather than resale, when resale is not accomplished in the immediate future or if no bids are received at resale. 4. Timber Sale Discounting The proposed policy would have discontinued the discount procedure implemented on a forest-wide test basis on some National Forests in western Oregon, western Washington, and northern California and would have applied the current discounting procedures on an individual sale basis when timber characteristics support a need for immediate harvesting. Instances might include fire-damaged, insect-damaged, and wind-thrown timber when prompt removal would support the accomplishment of land management objectives and provide for optimal utilization of salvage timber.
