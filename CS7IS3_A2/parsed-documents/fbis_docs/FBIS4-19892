Cetin added that all Serbian forces are expected to withdraw from Gorazde by noon today. Cetin made this statement at Ankara's Esenboga Airport before leaving for talks in Azerbaijan. In reply to a reporter's question on the cessation of Serbian attacks against Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cetin remarked that UN peacekeeping forces entered Gorazde in order to be stationed between the city and the Serbian forces, which will withdraw from the city. According to the latest reports concerning Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cetin announced, positive developments are taking place in Gorazde and therefore the UN secretary general's special representative does not favor a NATO attack at this stage. He added: Consequently, we are not expecting an attack at this moment, but, I would like to repeat that the Serbs could always be expected to change their minds and act differently. Assessing the recent NATO decision aimed at putting an end to the Serbian attacks on Gorazde, Cetin declared that this is a very important decision which does not contain any loopholes. Pointing out that the decision covers all safe havens, Cetin noted that according to the decision, the NATO Council will not have to adopt another decision in the event of a possible Serbian attack against the other four safe areas outside Sarajevo and Gorazde. I hope this determination on the part of NATO will constitute a new important step taken toward a just and realistic peace, the foreign minister stated. In his statement, Cetin stressed that Turkey has always supported Azerbaijan. His visit to Azerbaijan aims at demonstrating once more Turkey's support, Cetin remarked. He will return to Turkey tonight.
