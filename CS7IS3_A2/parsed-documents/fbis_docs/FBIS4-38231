Responding to claims by the Rwandan Patriotic Front that Egypt is providing the government with weapons and that Egypt has endorsed a Security Council resolution to send troops to Rwanda to appease France, Rif'at made a statement today affirming that Egypt favors no side to the conflict in Rwanda. He said there is a question mark over the Rwandan Patriotic Front's insistence on accusing Egypt of providing the government there with weapons despite Egypt's assertion that it is not. He added that Egypt supported Security Council Resolution 929 on the intervention of a UN force with a humanitarian task to protect the refugees and the displaced in Rwanda relying on practical and objective considerations, primarily Egypt's desire to ensure protection and security for endangered civilians with emphasis on the humanitarian nature of the mission.
