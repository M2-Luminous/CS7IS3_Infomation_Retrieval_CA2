It was then that the first ICBM's were placed on combat standby in the United States. Along with heavy strategic bombers, they were organizationally part of the USAF's Strategic Air Command (SAC) set up at the time. But, unlike the ICBM's and strategic bombers, nuclear missile submarines (SSBN's) were not made part of SAC. They were subordinate to fleets operating in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Mediterranean. Thus the U.S. strategic nuclear triad that came about at that time was not a unified formation. Operational command and control of ICBM's and strategic bombers was effected by the Joint Chiefs through their command centers and the SAC command, with command and control of nuclear submarines and their ballistic missiles being effected by the Joint Chiefs through their command centers and a system of special communications aircraft. As for administrative control -- responsible for force organizational development, material and technical provision and other types of logistics and supply, and combat training -- it was exercised by the USAF SAC command in respect of ICBM's and strategic bombers, and by the relevant fleet commands in respect of SSBN's. Although this system for the organization and command and control of U.S. strategic offensive forces was occasionally criticized, it existed right up to 1993, when an improvement was made to the structure and system of command and control. SAC was disbanded. It was replaced by the U.S. Armed Forces' Joint Strategic Command (JSC), which is operationally subordinate to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. All the combat-ready forces of the U.S. nuclear triad -- ICBM's, strategic bombers, and SSBN's -- have been transferred to the JSC's jurisdiction. Why did the U.S. military leadership reform the organizational structure of its strategic offensive forces and abolish SAC? The main objective was to enhance the effectiveness of the combat use of strategic offensive forces by optimizing their command and control under the new conditions of the disposition of forces in the world and the adoption in the United States of a military strategy termed a "regionally oriented" strategy [strategiya "regionalnoy napravlennosti"]. The U.S. military-political leadership has for the first time clearly separated the two lines of command and control of all strategic offensive force systems -- the operational and the administrative. Operational leadership is now handled by the Joint Chiefs and the JSC, which control all combat-ready strategic offensive forces. Administrative control of the strategic offensive forces has not been united. Currently it is exercised in the following way -- ICBM forces are administratively controlled by the USAF Space Command (which includes the 20th Air Army), and strategic bombers are administratively controlled by the newly created USAF Air Combat Command (ACC), which organizationally includes all strategic aviation. As for the administrative control of nuclear submarines equipped with ballistic missiles, those functions remain under naval command and directly with the Pacific and Atlantic Fleet commands. In the opinion of the U.S. military leadership, this reorganization of strategic offensive forces and command and control systems should lead to a significant enhancement of their combat capability and ensure centralization, efficiency, and flexibility on the part of the U.S. strategic leadership. The idea of reorganizing the structure and system of the command and control of U.S. strategic offensive forces was carefully analyzed and discussed in advance. It was phased in beginning in 1991. Measures to enhance the efficiency of the system for command and control of the strategic offensive forces and the global system for the operational command and control of the U.S. Armed Forces as a whole were carried out first. Then improvements will be made in terms not only of organizational structure but also of technology, taking account of new technological developments in the sphere of the development of information systems, communications equipment and systems, and computers. The JSC Command and Headquarters are located at Offutt military base (Nebraska). Planning for the combat use of all U.S. strategic offensive forces is carried out by the Joint Chiefs under a single -- or, as is sometimes said -- integrated, operations plan. That is the state of play with regard to the organizational restructuring and reorganization of command and control of the U.S. strategic offensive forces. The U.S. strategic nuclear forces have 1,000 ICBM launch vehicles, including 50 MX ICBM's and 950 Minuteman 2's and 3's. They have more than 2,200 nuclear warheads. The U.S. strategic nuclear forces have 199 strategic bombers, including 85 B-1B's and 114 B-52's. They have around 1,700 nuclear warheads. The U.S. strategic nuclear forces have 30 nuclear submarines with ballistic missiles, including 27 with Trident ballistic missiles and three with Poseidon ballistic missiles. In total they have 600 submarine-launched ballistic missiles and more than 4,000 warheads.
