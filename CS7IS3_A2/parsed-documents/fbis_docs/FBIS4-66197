To run state enterprises well, Tongling has seized "the bull by the horns" in enterprise property-rights system-reform, focusing on reform of midsize and small state enterprises. As part of my work, I have been fortunate enough to participate in and learn about this city's reform of medium-sized and small enterprises. I am reporting here all that I saw and learned, as thoughts on and a case study in converting the operating forces of large state enterprises. I Tongling City, located along the lower Chang Jiang [Yangtze River], is one of Anhui Province's subordinate cities that produces mostly mineral resources. As it was rich in copper, it was named the Tongling "SEZ" in the 1950s, to practice a uniform ownership form and a highly centralized planned-management model. Since China's urban economic reform, it had carried out enterprise reforms, such as streamlining administration and devolving authority to lower levels, introducing the contract system, and merging superior enterprises with inferior ones. While these reforms had all generally had a certain positive impact in invigorating enterprises, none of them had touched on the property-rights system. While the dominant profit mechanisms of a market economy had not yet been established, with enterprise operating efficiency still poor, other simultaneously-developing enterprise-ownership forms, such as the three kinds of foreign trade enterprises, and private and household operations, were as dynamic as wildfire. By the end of 1992, the city had 356 independently accounted state industrial enterprises at the township level and above, of which 88, or 24.8 percent, were reporting book losses, with this percentage reaching 42 percent of enterprises throughout the city when including potential and hidden losses. Once the new financial system went into effect, the real percentage would be even larger, with one-half of these enterprises in particular trouble, being nothing but "empty shells." If this continued, state enterprises would have had ever-narrowing prospects with, in contrast to the private economy, equivalent input not bringing commensurate output, and real advantages not being brought into full play. So how could these state enterprises have played their dominant role? After the 14th CPC Congress, Tongling City investigated and analyzed the status quo of its state enterprises, finding that the apparent causes of its large-scale enterprise losses were a heavy historical burden (debt and [over]staffing), the great inertia of the old system, and the independent decisionmaking power provided by the regulations on converting enterprise [operating] forces not only not implemented, but impossible to implement. The substantive problems were that government administration had not been separated from business management, the conversion of government functions was lagging, and responsible government departments were holding enterprises on a tight string in areas such as organizational structure, investment decisionmaking, labor employment, and personnel distribution, making it hard for enterprises to escape their subordinate status. On the other hand, enterprises were beset with difficulties, so needed government "protection." While they might take a half-step outward, they would finally be forced to retreat and ask for government help, making it truly a case of "while the cord was not yet cut, things remained in chaos." So we were forced to ask: While collective land ownership remained unchanged, how had the contract system been able to stimulate peasant initiaive to develop the agricultural productive forces? And in the same economic climate, how had private and so many township enterprises grown so prosperous? The crux of the matter was the establishment of an ownership form suited to productive-forces development, to find an optimum model combining the workforce with capital goods. The property-rights system was the "intermediary point" of this combination. The in-depth connotation of ownership form was that the legal ownership rights to socialist state enterprises belonged to the state. The rights to the economic benefits of state ownership were realized through market-economy subjects--enterprises managing their assets. Enterprises, as an aggregate of their quantitative employees, represented the state in protecting and increasing the value of state assets, while representing their employees in ensuring steadily higher incomes. As market subjects, enterprises needed to be commodity producers and managers independent of government. As our traditional state-enterprise, state-run system evolved under a planned economy, its historical burden was great. The current need to convert enterprise operating forces to become market oriented was also inseparable from government help and promotion. During the conversion of losing enterprises to shareholding, who would subscribe to the shares? If they were offered for sale, how many would be able or willing to buy? It was very hard for enterprises themslves to acquire such motivation. The issue was what and how the government should help. Government assistance could only create the "initial promotional factor" for market access, merely helping to get started and clear obstacles. While it could deliver a part, it could not deliver over the long term. This is what produced the idea of leased operation of medium-sized and small state enterprises. II In July 1992, the first leased operation began with the municipal silk factory. This plant had been in operation for 82 years, having over 1,100 employees, fixed assets worth 9.8 million yuan, and by the end of 1991, accumulated losses of more than 13 million yuan, leaving the enterprise in a state of less assets than liabilities, and over 90 percent of its employees drawing welfare benefits to get by. So in July 1992, the municipal party committee and government decided to begin leased operation of this factory. In just four months of leased operation, efficiency improved and, by year's end, profits and taxes had reached 193,700 yuan, with the enterprise beginning to revive. By the time the silk-factory experiment had begun to succeed, the municipal party committee and government had learned an important lesson: that in order for its many medium-sized and small losing enterprises to escape their plight, the adoption of the leasing form, with full corporate authority for management and operation, was probably a good way to convert [operating] forces and effectively reverse losses. Without changing ownership form, this attracted the maximum vital forces of the private economy, gradually establishing enterprise operating subjects suited to a market economy. In early 1993, the municipal party committee and government drew up the pertinent provisions and implementation regulations, which began the widespread reform throughout the city of leased operation targeted at medium-sized and small industrial and commercial enterprises. By September, this city had 40 leased-operation enterprises (including sub-factories and shops), leasing 51.39 million yuan of state assets and 19.44 million yuan of collective assets, distributed in the 11 industries and systems of silk, textiles, nonferrous [metals], industrial chemicals, power, machinery, coal, light industry, commerce, supply and marketing, and grain, and involving 6,212 employees, of whom 4,711 were working in leased-operation enterprises, with the other 1,501 under the responsibility of the labor sector for management, training, and reemployment. While the experimental enterprises had been practicing this reform for only a few months, they were all beginning to show vigorous and exuberant vitality, with a great change in the spirits and appearance of lessees and employees, an improvement in enterprise operating state, and generally better efficiency. The first 24 experimental enterprises averaged 30 percent better labor productivity, with clearly higher employee incomes and, in addition to payments to the state for leasing contracts, realized profits and taxes of more than 1.3 million yuan. The basic operating practices of Tongling City's leased-operation reform were: -- Evaluation of assets, inventory of resources, and setting forth of leasing terms. Based on the operating state of the various enterprises, the municipal government leased the assets of midsize and small, state and collective, industrial and commercial enterprises to individual operation in a compensated form. The leases could be of an enterprise's whole assets, or of part of them, such as a shop or a production line. Before leasing enterprises, the lessors evaluated enterprise assets according to pertinent state provisions and market criteria, setting forth the leasing terms. Based on the principle of protecting and increasing the value of state assets, the leasing fee rates were set based on the reference standards of prevailing bank interest rates and the fixed-assets profit rate for the trade, or the average fixed-assets profit rate for interrelated industries, combined with enterprise realities, making them more scientific and fair, to avoid the arbitrary "one-on-one" negotiations of the contract system. -- Public solicitation, and competitive selection of lessees. Open solicitation of prospective lessees, through inspection of bidders' leasing terms and qualifications, selected the best leasing operators. Leasing contracts signed by lessors and lessees became valid upon notarization by the notary public sector. Leasing terms were generally three-10 years, with lessees having to pay lessors leasing fees of 5-10 percent of assets, and venture guarantees of 1-10 percent of assets. -- Employee arrangements. Once enterprises began leased operations, the former enterprise employee status, cadre ranking, grade wages, state-set labor insurance welfare, and pertinent wage adjustmnets and subsidies all remained unchanged, recorded in employee personnel files, as grounds for determining wage grades and transfer and retirement treatment once leasing terms expired. Operators had the authority to reorganize former employees, signing set-term job contracts. From the day on which employees began jobs, operators paid their wages and determined their incomes on their own. Pensions of employees retiring during leased-operation terms operated according to the overall regulations on social old-age insurance, with overall insurance payments being the responsibility of lessees. Employees leaving or waiting for jobs were paid unemployment insurance, with the labor sector helping lessors in their management, training, reemployment, and job choice. -- Bonded debt and tax policy. While the former enterprise bonded debt was the liability in principle of the lessors, it could also be entrusted to the lessees. New bonded debt incurred during the leasing term was the liability of the lessees. Once enterprises became privately run, their tax system, rates, and burdens, and all other rates, were dealt with as private enterprises. All collected leasing-fee, depreciation-charge, and legal tax-exemption income was used to pay debts, or treated as reproduction-development income. -- Profit distribution. Leased-operation enterprise distribution was based on the contract principle of "adequate payments to both the state and enterprises, with all of the rest belonging to operators and employees." -- Financial system. In order to ensure that leased-operation enterprises had real cost accounting, rational assets liquidity, and accurate financial statements, lessors assigned personnel to factories. But while these personnel carried out oversight, examination, and verification, they did not interfere in any enterprise decisionmaking or operating activities, with their wages and all remuneration being the responsibility of the assigning units. -- Operating rights. As to the 14 operating rights provided to enterprises in the regulations, except for assets-disposal rights (which needed the consent of the lessors), all others were transferred to lessees, as well as given legal protection, with no department, unit, or individual allowed to infringe upon them. -- Jurisdiction over newly added assets. The jurisdiction over newly added assets was set according to the principle of the investor being the owner and beneficiary. As to assets bought with personal income out of aftertax profits, as well as with other self-owned lessee funds, the property rights and their disposal belonged to the lessees. -- Party and mass organizations. Party, CYL, and labor union organizations in leased enterprises had to be sound. While they were elected according to their respective charters, whether such organizational personnel were full- or part-time was decided by lessees. III. The reform practice of Tongling City in the leased-operation model for medium-size and small industrial and commercial enterprises was of farreaching significance in improving enterprise operating conditions, raising state-enterprise economic efficiency, reversing state-enterprise losses, converting enterprise operating forces, promoting and perfecing the socialist-public-ownership property rights system, speeding up the conversion of government functions, and fostering enterprise subjects suited to socialist markets. 1. It clarified property rights relations, resolving the issue of the lack of ownership-rights status in public ownership. Through leasing contracts, the state-assets representative, the state, through government or government-entrusted lessors, was made the representative agency for public assets, exercising ownership rights. These owners leased assets in compensated form to individual operation, acquiring corresponding ownership benefits, while lessees, upon fulfilling leasing promises, enjoyed full leased-assets possession, control, and use rights. In order to ensure the protection and increase in value of assets, and the operators' own interests, lessees managed public assets as if they were their private assets. In other words, as to operating form, this showed the subjectivization of operating activities. In our traditional property rights relations, in which the state was both owner and manager, everyone owned assets, while being unable to possess them, with all being the enterprise owners, but noone being liable for enterprise operating consequences. Governments knew only the number of enterprises, but were unclear about the amount of assets. So the leased operation and inventorying of resources subjectivized the representatives and managers of public assets, to overcome the enterprise-subject sham. 2. It remolded the "four independent" market-access subjects. Operators not only acquired from contracts widespread operating autonomy, but also broke free from the administrative subordinate relations between enterprises and government, leaving only profit-contract relations tied to property rights. Operator job advertisements were not divided by grade. While Tongling's 40 leasing operators had been divided into office-level, department-level, and ordinary workers and cadres, they were now all operating on the same level, facing the same markets. As to what, how much, and how they would produce, they looked only to markets, not to the government. On the other hand, the contracts clearly delimited government behavior, clarifying what government should and should not do, and converting the relations between government and enterprises from the former one of the leaders and the led to one of the servers and the served, thus speeding up the conversion of government functions. The government assumed liabilities, such as pre-leased enterprise bonded debt, and post-leased training and reemployment of those who lost or were waiting for jobs, thus sending enterprises into the fray with lightened packs. The "four independents" of market subjects, independent operations, independent liabiliy for profits and losses, and independent self-development and -restraint forces, became a geunine possibility. The contract system had pluralized enterprise targets, often making sweeping assessments of enterprise personnel, distribution, hiring, and even employment, education, and sanitation, making government behavior more businesslike, while leaving enterprises with no autonomy, not having to be liable for operating consequences. 3. It combined effective growth and restraint forces, overcoming the contract system's "shortsighted behavior." With enterprise behavior marketized and enterprise operations subjectivized, the prime responsibility of operators was to preserve and add to the value of managed assets. Tongling City's leasing contracts provided that lessees pay 1-10 percent of leased assets as venture guarantee funds, 10 percent of leased assets as leasing funds, and 10 percent of aftertax profits as assets-guaranty funds, as well as setting aside depreciation fund per provision. This sharply increased the contractors' sense of urgency and pressure, while giving operators 20-50 percent of aftertax profits as operating returns. This genuinely consolidated operators' duties, rights, and interests. With rigorous accounting and auditing systems, leased enterprises could no longer become "empty shells." Meanwhile, sharp market competition and profit-incentive forces generally kept lessees from "shortsighted behavior" that divided and ate everything up. Tongling City generally set contract terms at seven to 10 years. With lessor consent, 80 percent of operators upgraded their leased assets, adding related equipment to expand production. The earliest experiments, the Jinxing and Jinshan silk factories, invested 170,000 yuan and 200,000 yuan respectively in new fixed assets, as well as setting aside development funds per provision. Employee incomes all conscientiously adhered to the distribution principle of being lower than both labor productivity and profit growth. 4. This perfection and development of leasing was a turning point in China's socialist ownership, enterprise structural adjustment, and property rights reform. As a market economy is a free economy, legal and free operations and assumption of liability are features of market-economy subjects--enterprises. "Market economy development creates a nonpublic economy, whose growth in turn speeds up market-economy growth, giving natural ties between the market economy and the non-public economy" (in the Seventh NPC work report by the industrial and commercial alliance). The ownership structure that evolved under China's planned economy, eliminating the level-by-level upgrading of individual and private ownership, was very unsuited to the needs of a socialist market economy. Meanwhile, as most medium-sized and small state enterprise operations are linked to daily lives in light industry and textile products, being small in scale, diversified in category, widespread in distribution, and subject to sharp change, leasing is more suited to these features, which is a key mission of China's ownership and enterprise structural adjustment. Leasing avoids the erosion of public assets, while assimilating the maximum private-economy advantages. Tongling City also provided that after leasing, lessees could use 5 percent of their aftertax income for enterprise shareholding, with 20-50 percent of employee afterincome-tax profits converted to shares for investment in enterprises. In this way, these enterprises will gradually become jointly owned by the state, the operators, and individuals, converting to shareholding or shareholding-cooperative systems. Based on their conditions, the state (government) can then either take out its shares or increase its investment, while responsible departments or industrial departments can gradually be converted to state-assets operating companies, ultimately better suiting China's industrial structure, ownership system, and property rights system to market economy development needs. While Tongling City's leasing reform of medium-sized and small enterprises has just begun, with many issues not yet having fully shown up, it is undoubtedly a valuable and bold attempt to speed up the conversion of public-enterprise operating forces. As to its initial operation, it is still subject to certain problems that need solved, such as: -- How to set scientific and fair lease-fund percentages. -- The matter of the inequity between lessee-assumed risk and state-assets loss risk. -- The fund shortage, with lessees having great difficulties resolving working capital shortages on their own. -- The relations of enterprise party, labor union, and CYL organizational establishment and activity to private operators. Another problem is that concepts do not convert easily. While enterprise losses brought hard times, this was considered an unavoidable matter, with no use in placing blame. While leased enterprises have turned losses into profits, so that times are better, there are invariably hangups and misunderstandings about converting public enterprises to the lessee's profitmaking mindset, leaving lessees with concern about possible disturbances. Losses left an easy conscience, while profits cause uneasiness, which is also a conflict.
