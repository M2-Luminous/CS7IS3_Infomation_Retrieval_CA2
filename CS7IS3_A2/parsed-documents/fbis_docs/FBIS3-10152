While the country's political affairs continue along their course, often in an uncontrolled struggle of ideas of thoughts set forth by the defenders of both the government and opposition, there is a specific, everyday matter that is always put on a back burner; that issue is Peru's economic reality. While the news media, politicians, and leaders discuss human rights, the Cantuta law, the sentences in the La Cantuta case, and other legal and political issues, the Peruvian people's pockets remain a source of concern. I would like to know what economic progress can be expected in 1994. Will there be any improvements in our economic indexes, apart from inflation, which is something tangible that can be seen by all Peruvians and by other countries also? How is the recession unfolding; are we defeating it? Is there economic reactivation in Peru? Can we say there is light at the end of the tunnel? What will happen with pending disbursements, international loans, bilateral relations, and relations with private commercial banks? I would like to know if indeed this year, as has often been said, the economic situation will have any bearing on the Peruvian people's pocketbooks. Should this fail to be the case, the entire problem will boil down to speeches and theories. I would also like to know the terms of Peru's new agreement with the IMF. To discuss these and other issues we have invited Economy and Finance Minister Jorge Camet, to whom we are grateful for his appearance on this program. Good morning, Mr. Minister. Welcome to "Saturday Focus." [Camet] Good morning. [Vargas] [passage omitted] Let's take the bull by the horns right away. Mr. Minister, I would like to start off with recent information and gradually address the country's everyday problems. What, exactly, are the terms of Peru's new agreement with the IMF, and why is there talk of a new agreement? Does it mean there was a discussion or debate over the previous agreement which led to changes? Why is the agreement called a new agreement with the IMF? [Camet] We have a three-year agreement with the IMF which is called an Extended Facility Fund [three previous words in English]. However, a program is created every year; therefore, we had a 1993 program, and this year we negotiated and discussed the 1994 program. The 1995 program will also be discussed. [Vargas] What is the scope of this new program? Has the entire program been modified? We all know that the government's economic program is executed under the IMF's strict surveillance. Are there any conditions in this new agreement? [Camet] We establish goals for the program and we discuss them with the IMF. This time our target was inflation of 20 percent, a growth rate of 4-5 percent, increased international reserves of approximately 576 million [no currency specified], zero net domestic credit at the BCR [Central Reserve Bank], continued fiscal austerity marked by spending from our income, and a deficit that can be covered by foreign loans of approximately 2.5 percent; I cannot remember the exact figure. The fact of the matter is that the IMF has agreed to all our main targets. We discussed differences we had over the use of privatization funds and concluded that we could spend 450 million [currency not specified] on anything we wanted, while the remaining funds available to us would be held in reserve, because we need to have a certain amount for a Brady Plan down payment, which we hope to have by the end of the year. [Vargas] Now it is Augusto Alvarez Rodrich's turn on "Saturday Focus." How are you, Augusto? [Alvarez] Good morning, how are you? There are two topics I would like to discuss regarding the 1994 program, and one of them is taxes. It is clear that Sunat [National Superintendency of Tax Administration] has made an effort, but it is also clear that the effort is still insufficient compared to what is needed and that there is still a knotty side to our economic outlook. I would like your impression of how much headway can be made in the field of taxes, and what can be changed this year -- specifically in terms of those things that have not worked that well? [Camet] Augusto Alvarez has broached a very important topic, and I appreciate the question. Just as last year, when we devoted much attention to inflation, because we believed we needed to reduce it as well as reduce expectations of higher inflation -- which, in our opinion, was one of the main causes of inflation following the cutbacks my predecessors had made -- this year the issue is tax collection. Tax collection is fundamental. In Peru we have a saying: You cannot have belts without leather. Tax collection is critical and basic. Last year, tax collection amounted to about 10.5 percent of the GNP; this year we estimate it at 12.1 percent. Half-jokingly I have said that if Sunat Director Sandro Fuentes only collects 12.1 percent, I will give him a top grade of 10. Nevertheless, Sunat needs to collect considerably more. As a practical measure, we have provided Sunat with two new international experts who are already working -- one in verification and the other in detection -- to cover the most important sources of tax evasion. It is not a matter of raising taxes, which are already high; it is a matter of reducing tax evasion. [passage omitted] [Alvarez] Mr. Minister, I would like to discuss another large issue which, like the fiscal issue, is complex -- namely, negotiating the foreign debt. According to experts, in the next two years the foreign sector could become a source of great pressure for the development of the economic plan. My question is this: What will the banks be told? Sometimes it seems commercial banks expect results that exceed Peru's capacity to pay. We are talking about whether Peru can enter a scheme to service the debt. The way it stands now, Peru should assign about 45 percent of all exports to debt repayments, which is impossible. Therefore, what will the banks be told? [Camet] As you all know, we began negotiating with the banks in November 1993. We had not been able to do this earlier because of the great number of creditors. This forces us to assign priorities and enter into agreements with them one at a time. We Peruvians should not forget that on 18 March 1992 we seriously began to rejoin the world economic system when we signed an agreement to update our debts with the IMF and the World Bank, thanks to the support received from Japan and the United States -- support we should always be grateful for. For nearly a year, we have been doing effective and realistic work in this area. We do not have the money to repay the banks, and, therefore, an honest debtor must offer assets if there is no money. Consequently, we offered the banks the ability to convert the debt into investments -- an offer that was well received in principle after our auditors, such as the IMF, certified that it was indeed true that we had no money. It is easy to say I have no money, but it is important that this be true. [Alvarez, interrupting] Excuse me for interrupting. The first point is that there is no possibility of giving the banks any money. Was the only option left to exchange debt for privatization? [Alvarez] There is no money whatsoever. We have offered them the ability to participate in privatizations in part with bonds [papeles], because we also need cash, and therefore we will make a mixture. We have informed them that case by case, privatization by privatization, we will indicate what we feel is convenient on how much should be in cash and how much in bonds. So far, the only case is Centromin [Central Peru Mining Enterprise] with $60 million in bonds against $280 [million] in cash. [passage omitted] [De Leon] Mr. Minister, I would like to refer to a specific issue with regard to the National Bank. Numerous leaders, among whom for example is former President Fernando Belaunde, have expressed their concern over the fate of the state bank. As far as I know, the government has only made general statements regarding the bank's restructuring. Nevertheless, I have some information here. I would like to know how you responded to Defense Minister Victor Malca last year when he asked you in an official note not to close the Puerto Inca banking agency. After noting that this is a banking agency that serves the people and public employees in this region, Malca asked you to reconsider reopening this agency because it is important for this region's development. I believe that Minister Malca's concern is similar to that of many Peruvians. Continuing with the National Bank issue, I would like you to tell us what advantage there was for Peru in withdrawing $33 million from the Nation Bank's accounts and transferring these funds to the Bank Wiese in an operation with Switzerland regarding the foreign debt. What is Peru's gain in this, Mr. Minister? What is the government's policy in terms of the National Bank? I understand that the word restructuring is only a figure of speech. Is the bank being closed? Are the bank's powers being taken away? Is it no longer a state financial institution? It is also almost no longer the institution that collects taxes.... What is the government's policy with regard to the National Bank? [Camet] Monopolies are never convenient; for starters I will take up the tax collection issue. For some time now -- it is not measure I implemented, but one that I agree with -- for the benefit of the taxpayers, taxes can be paid to the financial system in general. Notwithstanding, the National Bank collects 70 percent of the taxes. The other 30 percent fall within an agreement between Sunat with several private banks that have accepted the conditions to carry out this task. The National Bank is not going to disappear. The National Bank was created during a time convenient for its creation; this was the work of Mr. Belaunde. Mr. Belaunde, unfortunately for the nation, closed the Deposit and Consignment Bank. The National Bank, like many state enterprises, has on one hand distorted part of its duties, while on the other it is in a very difficult financial situation. This is the main reason why we are restructuring the bank, and not as a matter of speech, as you may have been informed, Mr. De Leon. We want to preserve it as the Treasury's bank. It has fundamental duties, and this is why the National Bank will not disappear. Of the 430 branches, 230 are located in remote places where it is the sole institution that deals with financial matters, although it may only act as tax collector and cashier in very poor places where there are no other economic activities. [De Leon] Nevertheless, the Puerto Inca agency was closed down. General Malca mentioned this in his official note. [Camet] Since the National Bank is the only institution that represents the state in those areas, the offices will not be closed in those areas. At the same time, however, the National Bank must be efficient. At the National Bank there is not only a very serious situation concerning where it belongs; it can almost be said that the institution is bankrupt to a certain extent. I cannot categorically say this; we have people analyzing the bank. The National Bank's credit to the public enterprises, its enormous passive... [pauses] the bank's passive assets total 9 million soles per month, while its active assets only total 4 million soles per month. Do you realize the magnitude of these figures I am presenting to you? I do not want to give you any more figures because I do not yet have the final report. [passage omitted] [De Leon] [passage omitted] Once again I ask you, what is the advantage for the National Bank to have $33 million withdrawn from its funds upon orders of Mr. [name indistinct] to be subsequently deposited -- it specifically says here -- in the Wiese Bank. [Camet] Look here Mr. de Leon, I have known you for some time, you are an excellent reporter.... [De Leon, interrupting] Thank you sir. [Camet] I know you from Confiep [National Confederation of Private Business]. I am going to explain to you this specific case because I see you have been given information -- not distorted but definitely biased. I am going to explain to you this case. In the Donors Club in Paris we were offered by the consulting group loans or donations for two years to the amount of $900 million to address poverty. A fundamental aspect of our program is to diminish poverty. We were offered through donations that are already being made effective. [sentence as heard] The case you mentioned is related to Switzerland's forgiving of our debt of $130 million. This pardon demanded the deposit of approximately $30 million by Peru. The donor demanded that this sum be deposited in a private bank. Well, if the donor forgives us $130 million conditioned to the deposit of $30 million in a private bank, I will most certainly deposit this in a private bank sooner rather than later. This is what has been reported to you in a biased fashion. [De Leon] I do not seen that it is so biased. [Words indistinct, Camet and De Leon speaking simultaneously] I understand that a negotiator is precisely that. I believe that, for example, the Continental Bank and the Interbank are state banks but legally they can operate as private banks.... [Camet, interrupting] If the donor [words indistinct with de Leon and Camet speaking simultaneously]. If the donor demands that the funds not be deposited in a mixed bank either, well, for a $130-million donation to Peru, we place $30 million in a private bank, just as is demanded by the donor. Mr. [name indistinct] only chairs a four- to five-member committee which oversees the negotiations with the donor. [Salazar] Mr. Minister, I would like to ask you about a couple of specific things. I believe there are two main stabilizing elements in the economy: interest rates and the exchange rate. What plans are there for 1994 in these areas? A second question: You have said you will fire Sunat Director Sandro Fuentes if the GNP does not grow from 10.5 percent to 12.1 percent, which is really a 1.6 percent GNP growth. If you are expecting the GNP to gain five points during 1994, as you have predicted, why make the statement in the first place? Last, sir, you say you would like to hire international experts to prevent tax evasion. Perhaps you are not aware, but reports I have seen just recently state that tax evasion is on the rise all over the world. In the United States, particularly, evasion is growing enormously. What kind of international experts are you planning to bring in? [Camet] Thank you. Regarding interest rates, unfortunately these are still high. I believe the financial system in general took a while to adjust and readapt. This area did take a lesser beating from the economic readjustment plan than other areas did, and interest rates are slowly but surely falling. I have several studies on the exchange rate situation I am examining at this time. They demonstrate that, if in fact there has been some degree of dragging in this process, the difference has been no greater than 10 points. This is a very controversial issue. This year we expect to gain three points with respect to parity, and I hope we do. The exchange rate at this time is seasonably stable. This has become quite a regular thing for this time of year. I remember that in 1992 we lost a lot of ground with respect to parity. This loss, however, came because of the excessive increases we had during 1992, when we gained 10 percent, which led us to heavy inflation in the first quarter of 1993. I believe it is rather conservative to speak of a 4 or 5 percent growth of the GNP. I think it will be more than that. I hope it will be more. Regarding the international experts on controlling and reducing tax evasion, we are not going to hire them. They are already working. These are people with great experience. One had extensive experience in Chile. His specialty is auditing. This individual is a very good adjunct. We also have experts working on internal organizations and preparing control systems for interagency communications via computer. Our people also worked well to establish the taxpayer registration number. [Salazar] What I meant was this: If the overall GNP is going to grow more than 5 percent, then the 10.5 percent increase in tax collection would provide greater income. An increase from 6 percent to 10.5 percent would mean greater tax collection. Why does the state need greater tax collection if you said the budget will be kept within austerity limits? [Camet] Better tax collection means more solutions for poverty than what we are able to provide now. We will be able to increase public investment. [Salazar] Public investment perhaps, but there is not very much room for ending poverty or for improving social spending, right? This would mean programs that are not currently included in the budget. [Camet] If you add loans, certain figures in the budget, and social spending coordination -- which Alfonso Bustamante started and we will continue -- you will find that at least 3 percent of the GNP is dedicated to poverty within the budget's current parameters. [Salazar] That is really not all that impressive, you know. [Camet] When seen by the one who collected that 10.5 percent last year, it is almost one-third. That is a significant effort in itself. We could only have achieved this now that the economy is beginning to move in the direction you all are witnessing. [Salazar] There have been greater allotments for other types of spending than social spending. [Camet] We have cut back on basic expenditures, but this area still represents 7 percent. [Salazar] Defense, for example, is much greater than social spending, is it not? [Camet] No, it is not greater. Please bear in mind that Peru no longer buys a single tank or a single fighter plane. Peru is only buying equipment for its domestic needs, which is all light equipment. [passage omitted]
