Bolormaa at the press conference. Speaking with Mongolian and foreign newsmen she said about the measures supposed to be done within the framework of the national programme for development of children in Mongolia up to 2000. The national programme was endorsed by the Government of Mongolia on May last year. According to Bolormaa, are being improved the conditions for getting education by children, developing their gifts. Although the children's problem remains to be actual one for today. [sentence as received] The right of children for education is being exercised insufficiently. From year to year the number of children quitting their lessons for financial or other reasons is growing. In accordance with the 1993's data, more than 100 thousand children of school age are out of school. A high mortality rate for newborns and small children yet remains to be recorded. On the scale of the country there are some 924.8 thousand children orphans. The number of homeless children is ever growing. There appeared quite a new notion of street children which up to recently was not available in the lexicology of Mongolians. All this, according to Bolormaa, dictates the necessity for unifying efforts of people for settling down the key children's problem under the conditions of the transition to a market economy.
