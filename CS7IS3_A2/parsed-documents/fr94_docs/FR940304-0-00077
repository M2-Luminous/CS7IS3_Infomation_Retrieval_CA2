FR940304-0-00077 FR940304-0-00019 Historically, Tetramolopium arenarium was found on the island of Maui on the western slope of Halakeala and on the island of Hawaii from the Kohala Mountains, the northwestern slopes of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, and the slopes of Hualalai. Only one population is known today, and it occurs on Hawaii in Kipuka Kalawamauna at PTA on federally managed land. At last count (January 1993), there were 29 reproductive and 79 juvenile plants in a 660 by 200 ft (200 by 60 m) area (HHP 1991v1 to 1991v4, 1991w, HPCC 1990a, Laven et al . 1991; R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1992; R. Shaw, in litt ., 1993). This species typically grows in open 'a'ali'i-dominated Lowland or Montane Dry Forests at elevations between 2,600 and 4,900 ft (800 and 1,500 m) (Lowrey 1990). Associated species include 'a'ali'i, pukiawe, Chamaesyce olowaluana ('akoko), and Dubautia linearis (na'ena'e) (HPCC 1990a). The major threats to Tetramolopium arenarium are competition from alien plant species, particularly fountain grass; grazing, browsing, trampling, and habitat disturbance by feral goats, pigs, and sheep; habitat disturbance and damage to plants as a result of military exercises; fire; and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the single existing population (Douglas et al . 1989, HPCC 1990a, Herbst and Fay 1979). Hillebrand (1888) described Zanthoxylum hawaiiense based on a specimen collected on the island of Hawaii and also indicated an unnamed variety for a specimen collected on Lanai. Other names published for portions of this taxon include: Z. bluettianum (Rock 1913), Z. hawaiiense var. citriodora (Rock 1913), Z. hawaiiense var. velutinosum (Rock 1913), and Z. hawaiiense var. subacutum (St. John 1976). Some authors placed Hawaiian species in the genus Fagara , resulting in F. hawaiiensis (Engler 1896) and F. bluettiana (Engler 1931). Sherff (1958) named F. hawaiiensis var. citriodora , F. hawaiiensis var. subacutata , and F. hawaiiensis var. velutinosa , all of which are considered within the range of variation of Z. hawaiiense in the current treatment of the Hawaiian species (Stone et al . 1990). Zanthoxylum hawaiiense of the rue family (Rutaceae), a thornless tree usually 10 to 26 ft (3 to 8 m) tall with a trunk up to 10 in (25 cm) in diameter, has alternate leaves comprising three leathery, triangular-oval or lance-shaped, gland-dotted, lemon-scented, toothed leaflets usually 1.3 to 3.9 in (3.4 to 10 cm) long and 0.6 to 2 in (1.5 to 5 cm) wide. The stalk of each of the two side leaflets has one joint, and the stalk of the terminal leaflet has two joints. Flowers are usually either male or female, and usually only one sex is found on a single tree. Clusters of 15 to 20 flowers 1.6 to 3.1 in (4 to 8 cm) long have a main flower stalk 0.8 to 2 in (20 to 50 mm) long and individual flower stalks 0.08 to 0.2 in (2 to 4 mm) long. Each flower has four narrowly triangular sepals about 0.04 in (1 mm) long and four hairless petals (possibly absent in male flowers) of an unknown color. The fruit is a sickle-shaped follicle (dry fruit that opens along one side) 0.3 to 0.4 in (8 to 10 mm) long, containing one black seed about 0.3 in (7 to 8 mm) in diameter. This species is distinguished from other Hawaiian species of the genus by its leaves, which are always made up of three leaflets of similar size; the presence of only one joint on some of the leaflet stalks; and the shorter follicle with a rounded tip (Stone et al . 1990). Historically, Zanthoxylum hawaiiense was known to occur in the central portion of the island of Kauai; on east Molokai; in the central part of the island of Lanai; on east Maui on the southwestern and southern slopes of Haleakala; and on the island of Hawaii in the Kohala Mountains, on the northern slope of Hualalai, and on the northwestern slope of Mauna Loa. There is now one living individual known on Kauai in Kawaiiki Valley on State-owned land. On Molokai, three extant populations of the species occur on privately and State-owned and federally managed land in Kalaupapa National Historical Park (NHP), in Pelekunu Valley, and near Puu Kolekole. The Molokai populations extend over a distance of about 3 by 2 mi (5 by 3 km). Although the number of plants at one of the sites is uncertain, it is estimated that the three populations contain five plants. On Lanai, one population with an unknown number of individuals has been reported on privately owned property in Kaiholena Gulch. On east Maui, extant populations of Z. hawaiiense have been found in Kahikinui, above Lualailua, above Kanaio, and in Auwahi. These four populations extend over a distance of approximately 5 by 3 mi (8 by 5 km) and contain a total of fewer than ten plants. On the island of Hawaii, individuals are found at Puu Waawaa and at PTA on State-owned and federally managed land. These extant populations are located about 13 mi (21 km) apart and contain a total of about 150 plants (R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1993; R. Shaw in litt ., 1993). In summary, Zanthoxylum hawaiiense is currently located on 5 islands and consists of 11 populations and about 166 individuals (HHP 1991x1 to 1991x16; R. Shaw, pers. comms., 1991, 1993; R. Shaw, in litt ., 1993).
