The demonstrations have been staged at a time when thousands of Palestinians in the Zionist regime's prisons are staging a hunger-strike to protest against the anti-human policies of that regime. Hundreds of Palestinians in Nablus, Ramallah, Jerusalem, and Bethelem cities staged demonstrations in support of the Palestinian prisoners protesting against the Zionist usurpers' policies of detaining and suppressing the Palestinians. Tens of Palestinians were subjected to the burst of machine gun fire during clashes between the Israeli troops and the Palestinian protesters and a large number of them were wounded. At this important juncture what we are witnessing is the fact that the peace-seeking mask has fallen from the face of the Zionist usurpers. As a matter of fact, despite its earlier commitments regarding having negotiations with all the Arab delegations within the framework of the Security Council resolutions, the Zionist regime concluded the Gaza-Ariha (Jericho) accord by violating the commitment; the accord, that on the basis of international law, has no legal link with the principle of autonomy. Despite Israel's commitment thousands of Palestinians are still being detained in the dreaded Israeli prisons. The Israeli officials have informed the PLO of their conditions, saying the Palestinian prisoners should sign undertakings in confirmation of the Gaza-Ariha accord and following their release they will not be permitted to return to their birth-places. They can only live in Gaza and Ariha. There is no doubt that the announcement of these conditions by the Zionist usurpers is a breach of international agreements, especially the fourth Geneva convention which rejects any disrespect to life and property of a nation under occupation and condemns the same. On the other hand such a move by the Zionist regime is a blatant violation of all the commitments signed by the regime which has promised to free all the prisoners unconditionally. Now in light of these facts the world opinion is once again confronted with the reality that it is the inefficiency of the world bodies, especially that of the UN in dealing with the regime firmly that has encouraged the Zionist regime to continue the massacre and suppression of the innocent Palestinian nation.
