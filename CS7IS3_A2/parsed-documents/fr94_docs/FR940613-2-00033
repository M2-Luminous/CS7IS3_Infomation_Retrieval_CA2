FR940613-2-00033 FR940613-2-00020 Golden Spread proposes to amend Schedule A for each Rate Schedule to add a special facilities charge provision and a Rider A, which contains the formula to be used in calculating the special facilities charge. The special facilities charge will allow Golden Spread to recover costs from a member related to a transmission or distribution facility which that member has requested that Golden Spread acquire, construct, or cause to be constructed. In addition, Golden Spread filed a Special Facilities Agreement with Midwest which provides for the construction by Golden Spread of a nine mile segment of 69 Kv line on the Midwest system, with associated costs being recovered from Midwest under the special facilities charge provision. Copies of the filing were served upon Golden Spread's jurisdictional customers, the Public Utility Commission of Texas, and the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.
