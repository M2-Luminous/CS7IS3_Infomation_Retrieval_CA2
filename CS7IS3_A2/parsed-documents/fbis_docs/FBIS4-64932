But this is not the case! One of party secretary Peter Orn's major tasks, before he leaves his job after the election and becomes secretary general of the Swedish Red Cross, will be to show how hard the Liberal Party has fought in order to build the welfare and how intensely one is now working on a renewal of the welfare state. Because there is no doubt that it has its flaws and shortcomings, the way it has developed. The public monopolies must be abolished, according to Peter Orn. And that is what the party is working on as part of the government, now that, for example, the family doctor and school allowance are being introduced and Cultural Minister Birgit Friggebo [Liberal Party] is breaking down the media monopoly. Recently the Conservatives have talked increasingly loudly about scrapping the welfare state and instead backing a basic security system, in which private insurance solutions would replace the principle of lost income in today's social insurance system. At the same time tax cuts are high on the Conservatives' list of measures. Liberal Party leader and Social Minister Bengt Westerberg has clearly indicated, to the Conservatives, that the Liberal Party will not agree to any tax cuts that force reductions in the welfare system. Powerful Motives Despite these basic ideological differences between the two parties, Peter Orn sees no hesitation in governing with the Conservatives. "It is possible to govern together. We still have several important points in common," says Peter Orn. What is common is getting the economy straightened out. That was also the principal reason for the parties joining together in the previous election campaign on the program "New Start for Sweden." "There are strong motives for this government continuing for at least one more mandate period. The economic reorganization is far from complete. The Social Democrats have not shown that they have an economically good program," says Peter Orn. That is why he does not believe that the Social Democrats will succeed in coping with unemployment, one of the most important issues during the next election period, since their economic policy does not hold up. In Peter Orn's opinion the Social Democrats also fall short in their view of the welfare state when they want to scrap the family doctor system and eliminate the school allowance. But on the EU [European Union] issue as well the Social Democrats are much too vague, and membership in the union is of major importance to the Liberal Party. Peter Orn can see that the neoliberal proponents within the Conservatives have hurt the Liberal Party to some extent. "Sometimes that debate can give a picture of the Liberal Party being a defender of status quo. It is important to show that we want both to keep the welfare standard, which we participated in establishing, and at the same time renew it through reform of the major freedoms of choice for schools, child care, health care, and media." Altogether, the conclusion for Peter Orn is that the invitations from the Social Democrats for cooperation or shared government are categorically rejected. "This government will be a majority government," says Peter Orn. Social Democrats Most Unhappy What will happen if the election result shows that it is not possible to get a majority government is another story: "Then one must be prepared to create a government across the bloc boundaries. But what that will look like, whether we will participate in it, that we have not taken a position on at all." It is not all that easy to implement one's dearest issues even in a government position. At the moment the family doctor system is threatened by the fact that New Democracy intends to vote against the proposal together with the Social Democrats. Then, as far as Peter Orn is concerned, it will have to become an election issue again, and he is not worried about that debate. "We will take that fight if it becomes necessary. Most unhappy about that will be the Social Democrats. They realize that when a system is in the middle of changing, it backfires on the one who wants to tear it up." Important Reform The dissatisfaction, or disinterest, which has shown up in opinion polls and in the debate by the Swedish people and the physicians against the family doctor system is something that Peter Orn takes with equanimity -- opposition is always present during changes. "This reform is important because it establishes the basic principle that the patient should have the right to choose the doctor he wants. The day that is accomplished the family physician is anchored in the hearts of the Swedish people." Equality between men and women is another urgent question, on which Peter Orn himself has vigorously worked for the introduction of a paternal month. He hopes, as liberal as he is, that the necessity of a month's paternal leave will get the employer to change his attitudes toward the men who want to remain at home with their children. The next major equality issue will be work for equal pay by men and women. Another Liberal Party profile issue is a generous refugee policy. During this mandate period, however, concern about the former East Europe has increased pressure on the borders, and Immigration Minister Birgit Friggebo has tightened the refugee policy by introducing, among other things, the need for visas for Bosnians. "The refugee issue has been very difficult," admits Peter Orn, but he believes that the party has nevertheless been able to stick to the humanity principle. Own Identity Criticism of the refugee policy within the party has been harsh but good, according to Peter Orn. The result was that once again the humanitarian reasons for refugees being able to stay weigh more heavily. Stricter Application He also states that application in asylum matters, in view of the large stream of refugees, has become stricter. One way of preventing the Alien Commission from being tougher is, according to Peter Orn, that the government once again can take over cases for decision that can then become guidelines. Just before ending the interview, Peter Orn examines the diagram that shows that the Liberal Party has a major base of voters who could envision voting for them (but when it comes down to it do not). He states that this problem is nothing new. "Possibly it is so that this center position that a liberal party occupies can be mistaken from both the right and the left. The great challenge for us is to show that we have an identity of our own and that it is based on our liberal values. We do not reflect them with respect to other parties."
