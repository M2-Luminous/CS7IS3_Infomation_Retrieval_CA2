FR941216-1-00102 FR941216-1-00012 Appendix H to Subpart F of Part 184._ Category (04), Hazard Division 1.2_ Nonmass Detonating, Fragment Producing1 1Net explosives weight 1Inhabited building distance (ft) 1Public traffic route distance (ft) 1Intraline distance (ft) 1Magazine distance (ft) 2Above-ground 2Earth-covered No limit specifically required for safety reasons 400 240 200 200 (2) 1Limited quantities of items in this class, for reasons of operational necessity, may be stored in facilities such as hangars, troop buildings, and manufacturing or operating buildings without regard to Q/D. Examples: small destructors, fuzes and firing devices. 2Earth-covered standard or nonstandard magazines may be used without limit for this category. However, the construction, siting, and orientation requirements of subparts D and F of this part for Hazard Division 1.1 must be met. Note: List of items (examples only): Small arms ammunition with explosive projectiles; 20mm ammunition with explosive projectiles; fuzed ammunition with non-explosive projectiles when caliber and packing limit the hazard in accordance with this class; WP smoke hand grenades; and nonmass detonating CBUs.

However, the construction, siting, and orientation requirements of subparts D and F of this part for Hazard Division 1.1 must be met. Note: List of items (examples only): Fixed and semifixed ammunition, rockets and rocket components, chemical ammunition containing explosive elements, and nonmass-detonating CBUs.

Storage in earth-covered magazines is therefore preferred. 2If the HE in (12) 1.2 items at an operating line PES is limited to 5000 lbs, intraline distance may be reduced to 200 ft. 3Earth-covered standard and nonstandard magazines may be used without limit for this category. However, the construction, siting, and orientation requirements of subparts D and F of this part for Hazard Division 1.1 must be met. Note: List of items (examples only): Separate projectiles with explosive ``D'' filler, except high capacity types, caliber 8-inch or larger; fixed and semifixed ammunition; nonmass-detonating CBUs; rockets, rocket motors and nonmass-detonating rocket heads.
