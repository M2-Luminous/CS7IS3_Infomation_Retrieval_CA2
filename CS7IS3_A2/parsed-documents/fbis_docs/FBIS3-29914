Answering a request from the Netherlands, Samdech Hun Sen said troop reduction cannot now be implemented in Cambodia because of three essential factors: First, the reduction can affect political problems; second, the royal government still needs Armed Forces for self-defense and to counterattack the KR, preventing them from further causing insecurity among the people; third, the government has not yet provided those troops with any skill or possibility to earn a living after the troop cut. Samdech Hun Sen reaffirmed that only peaceful political means can solve the KR conflict, not military offensives. He also said that the security situation and the KR problem are not obstacles to the Netherlands' investment in Cambodia or the Netherlands' aid to the country. He urged investors to do business in Cambodia since the country abounds with manpower, and he called on the Netherlands to help promote Cambodia's agricultural sector. Mr. Georges Albert Wehry informed Samdech Hun Sen that at present the Netherlands is exploring how it can help Cambodia and determine what its needs are. The Netherlands already granted $1.5 million in aid to Cambodia [words indistinct].
