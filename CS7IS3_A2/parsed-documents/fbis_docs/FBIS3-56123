The BNF leader thinks that the U.S. Embassy invited to the meeting organizations that are against Belarusian independence and oppose the BNF rather than the Supreme Soviet or the Kebich government. We made a phone call to Mr. Paznyak and asked him to explain what actually happened at the Embassy and what would be the BNF's next moves. [Paznyak] Well, I was presented to members of the National Accord Party and former party hacks who once opposed the referendum and the Popular Movement. A very strange lot of people. This is why I thought that I was put in an awkward position here. What kind of opposition would this be? So I expressed my doubts as to the relevance of my participation at that meeting, which, I heard, even spilled over to the press pages. However, Embassy officials have again brought me the invitation today. I think that the Embassy's mistake is one thing, but it is a completely different thing that I should attend that meeting out of respect for President Clinton and the United States. This is why I certainly will go there. And I would like to assure everyone that I am not going to make any controversial statements there. Since President Clinton offers such an opportunity, I will be glad to accept it. [Correspondent] And there will be no face-to-face meeting of Paznyak and Clinton? [Paznyak] No. After all, this may not be so important because the meeting will take place in Kuropaty [burial place of victims killed by the Soviet security police in the 1930's]. But in Kuropaty we will talk about Kuropaty, of course. [Correspondent] What questions is the opposition going to bring up during this meeting? [Paznyak] This will be a short, 15-minute meeting. So considering the presence of many political party activists, I don't think any serious questions will be raised. I think that the conversation will touch upon the delayed democratic processes in Belarus, and on assistance from a democratic state such as the United States for those processes. This is going to be the main issue. I consider it a crucial fact that President Clinton is going to visit Belarus, seeing it as an independent state. This proves that Belarus managed to attract the attention of the United States.
