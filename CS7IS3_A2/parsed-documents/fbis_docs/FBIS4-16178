[passage omitted] Boris Yeltsin briefly answered journalists's questions. [Begin Yeltsin recording] Foundations have been laid down for cooperation between us that I think will develop very actively in the future, now that a treaty has been signed, together with a number of important agreements. I consider my personal contacts with the King, the government chairman, the chairman of Catalonia, and other politicians a matter of no small importance. This was a good contact on a human level. There is nothing to divide us. We are united by Europe, the European issues we have in common, the questions of security common to all of us, and of course the issue of economic stability both in Russia and in Spain. There is a lot we can learn here, and I was interested to hear about the Spanish experience of the transitional period, which we too are currently going through. There are some lessons we can learn from it, and this will be beneficial to Russians and to Russia itself. [end recording] The Russian president's plane is expected to land in Moscow very shortly.
