In a bold operation, 30 drug traffickers of the Red Brigade invaded the Engenho Novo Police Precinct in Rio de Janeiro and rescued 38 inmates from the cells. [Begin unidentified reporter recording] The gang closed 24 de Mayo Street, one of the busiest in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. The group comprised 30 men, armed with rifles and machine guns, who wore civilian police vests. The seven detectives who were in the precinct were taken prisoner and handcuffed. The gang opened cells and released the 38 inmates. The gang took all the weapons from the police precinct and even used a police vehicle to escape. A man who was riding a motorcycle in the area was beaten. Within 30 minutes, more than 100 policemen had begun the search for the gang. The shantytowns of surrounding areas were cordoned off, but only two inmates were recaptured. Another inmate was found dead in a street close to the precinct. He was a police informer who was murdered by the gang. The police knew that the order to take over the police precinct came from drug trafficker Atlas Ferreira, aka Adam, one of the principal Red Brigade chiefs and a drug trafficking leader in the Vigario General shantytown. The police believe the main objective was to rescue one of the gang leaders, Luiz Carlos Goncalvez who has been sentenced for homicide, assault, and kidnapping, and who was to be transferred to a high security prison today. The police were impressed with the boldness of the gang. As they left, they fired shots in all directions leaving marks on the walls and scaring the neighborhood. One shot entered the window of the house next to the precinct. [end recording]
