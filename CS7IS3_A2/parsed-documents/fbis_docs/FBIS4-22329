FBIS4-22329 "jpusr035___94034" FBIS-USR-94-035 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 7 April 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS Statistics for January-February Reflect Continuing Statistics for January-February Reflect Continuing Production Decline 944E0622A Moscow EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN in Russian No 11, Mar 94 p 1 944E0622A Moscow EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN Russian CSO [Report from data of the Russian Federation State Committee on Statistics: "Industry: The Decline Continues"] [Text] In January-February of this year, Russia's industry yielded production output amounting to 34 trillion rubles [R] in current prices, including about R18 trillion in the month of February. Physical volume of production decreased by 23.6 percent as compared with January-February of last year, including by 23.1 percent in January and by 24.1 percent in February. In January-February 1994, of 406 of the most important production varieties taken into periodic-accounting consideration, production volume increased over January-February 1993 levels for 37 entries and decreased for 362 entries. Over the first two months of this year, 50.5 million tonnes of oil, including gas condensate, were extracted--13 percent less than the January-February 1993 level. Some 50.3 million tonnes of coal were extracted (8 percent less) and 109 billion cubic meters of gas (on the level of the first two months of last year). In ferrous metallurgy, the production lag in January-February 1994 behind last year's levels were as follows: for output of cast iron--20 percent, steel--26 percent, finished rolled metal--22 percent, and steel pipe--48 percent. In machine building over the January-February period of this year, production output constituted 50 percent or less of the level for the same period of last year for half the products taken into account (metal-cutting machine tools, forging and pressing machines, bulldozers, freight cars, tractors, trucks, grain-harvesting combines, forage harvesters, and others). In the chemical and petrochemical industry, the production decline continued in February of this year for the majority of the most important production varieties. In general over the two-month period, output of synthetic ammonia decreased by 26 percent, sulfuric acid--by 30 percent, soda ash--by 53 percent, mineral fertilizers--by 29 percent, chemical fibers and filaments--by 49 percent, and motor vehicle tires--by 41 percent. A reduction of more than half was seen with respect to the production of thermoplastic pipe and pipeline components, fiberglass and fiberglass products; output of chemical plant protection preparations was reduced by two-thirds. The production of tires for agricultural machinery came to less than a third of last year's level. In January-February 1994, production of consumer goods decreased 27 percent from the level of the same period last year, including by 31 percent for nonfood products and by 17 percent for food products. In light industry, the output of socks, hosiery, and knitted articles decreased by 27 percent, footwear--by 54 percent, woolen fabrics--by 53 percent, silk fabrics--by 61 percent, flax, hemp, and jute fabrics--by 45 percent. The production of cotton fabrics increased 22 percent. A significant reduction was seen in January-February of this year as compared to the same period of last year in the production output of most garments: overcoats and light overcoats--by two-thirds, jackets, raincoats, suits, trousers, and skirts--by almost half, shirts and dresses--by 22-28 percent. The chief reason for the production decline remains enterprises' lack of working capital and problems in production output sales due to the high prices. Diminished production volume was seen with respect to the majority of cultural and domestic items over the first two months of the year: refrigerators and freezers--by 2 percent, washing machines--by 42 percent, tape recorders--by 56 percent, television sets--by 17 percent, porcelain, pottery, and majolica dishware--by 22 percent. In January-February of this year, the output of two- and three-compartment refrigerators and freezers increased over the level for the same period of last year. The production volume of most food products was lower than in January-February of 1993: of meat--by 26 percent, whole milk production--by 17 percent, butter--by 31 percent, flour--by 17 percent, cereals--by 34 percent. Significant reductions over last year were seen with respect to the output of macaroni products, lump sugar, starch, and concentrated foods (by 37-50 percent), confectionery items and baker's yeast (by 15-20 percent). Output of baked bread and other bakery products was reduced by 13 percent. Only half the production output of January-February 1993 levels was attained with respect to vodka and vodka-based liquor, including 44 percent for February. In February of this year, 4,300 enterprises in Russia had lengthy production stoppages for all or certain varieties of output. Work-time losses amounted to 22 million man-days, or 18 percent of the time-sheet resources of these enterprises (analogous figures for February of last year: 2,400 enterprises, 6 million man-days, 8.6 percent of time-sheet resources). Some 22 percent of the workers at enterprises where work was discontinued were directed to take supplemental unpaid or partially paid leave in February at the initiative of management. Twenty-eight enterprises of the fuel industry conducted strikes over the past month, resulting in a labor-time loss of 60,000 man-days.
