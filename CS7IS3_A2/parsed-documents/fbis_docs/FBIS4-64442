This is the first time since acceding to the prime ministership in 1982 that Gonzalez has canceled an officially announced visit for domestic political reasons. In mid-morning a communique from the general secretariat of the government spokesman's office announced the indefinite postponement of the visit to the aforementioned countries. The announcement of the cancellation came 40 hours before the departure time and when some members of the official retinue -- mainly bodyguards -- and several journalists from Madrid were already in Bucharest. Foreign Ministry officials believe that the deterioration in the domestic political situation poses a threat to the prime minister's entire program of international activity in May and June, which is a very busy one. Gonzalez's next official visit, starting 15 May, is to Paraguay, the only Latin American country which he has not visited. "Let us hope," one diplomat joked yesterday, "that Mariano Rubio does not disappear two days beforehand -- following Luis Roldan's example -- and set back this visit too." In diplomatic circles it is also considered a virtual certainty that Gonzalez's summit meeting with Helmut Kohl -- scheduled for 6-7 June in the former East Germany, five days before the European elections -- will also be canceled. The same circles also fear that the Conference of Latin American Nations in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 14-15 June will be neglected in the Spanish press. Gonzalez plans to arrive there the day after the European election, and his interpretation of the results will relegate the meeting to the background. Apart from Cartagena, another appointment that the prime minister cannot avoid is the European summit in Corfu, Greece, on 23-24 June, which will appoint the next president of the European Commission. Gonzalez had so organized matters as to leave most of his international activity until after the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] congress in March. The following week he received President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev and in April he received Russian chief of state Boris Yeltsin and UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. Immediately after the Rubio scandal exploded Gonzalez's joint press conference with Yeltsin 12 April was the shortest that people could remember in the hall of the government spokesman's general secretariat. The Spanish prime minister made sure to take questions from journalists that he knew and that would only ask him about matters relating to foreign policy. There were no questions about the Rubio affair.
