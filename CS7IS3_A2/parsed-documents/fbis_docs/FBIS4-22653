According to Central Electoral Commission [CEC] data, on 3 April elections took place in 30 districts, with a high voter turnout. CEC Chairman Ivan Yemets, in particular, reported that 81 percent of voters cast their ballots in Gusyatinskiy District in Ternopol Oblast; 78 percent--in Izoslavskiy District in Khmelnitsk Oblast; and so on. According to preliminary data, elected on 3 April were: scientist Vasiliy Kostitskiy, a national-democrat close to Rukh, in Ivano-Frankovsk Oblast; the leader of Ukrainian socialists, Aleksandr Moroz (Kiev Oblast); and Vladimir Bortnik, a representative of the so-called "party of power" and head of the Ukragrotekhservis concern. Repeat elections confirmed the current disposition of political forces in Ukraine and voters' preferences for some or other political forces. The second round also confirmed the personal confrontation between the leaders of two branches of power--parliament Speaker Ivan Plyushch and President Leonid Kravchuk--which has been increasingly gaining momentum lately. The latter and his team justly saw in the fact of parliamentary elections and the election of a new Supreme Council a threat to the very existence of strong, practically unlimited presidential power in Ukraine. As is known, the first thing the new parliament is expected to do, in the words of current Speaker Ivan Plyushch, is adopt a law on the president of Ukraine's new powers. It is envisaged that he will be only a head of state with purely representative functions, and therefore moving presidential elections from 26 June of this year to a later date--which Leonid Kravchuk and his entourage insist on--is out of the question. Some political forces--both old and new--also speak for a variety of reasons against strong presidential authority. In particular, the communists and socialists declared through their leaders that they see abolishing the institution of the presidency in Ukraine as the final goal of their parliamentary activities. Their reckoning is simple: Behind the backs of the resurrected soviets one can also restore a firm vertical line of party-communist omnipotence. Many regional economic managers, too, would like to see a weaker presidential authority, justifiably seeing in it the strengthening of the functions of the Kiev center taking the place of the Moscow one. The only forces that unconditionally support strong presidential authority are those that associate with it the conduct of a reformist course. The presidential team apparently took this circumstance into consideration only lately, and for this reason made several steps in the direction of privatization. In particular, on 1 April the parliament's newspaper GOLOS UKRAINY published a list of 150 enterprises whose stock Ukrainian citizens can buy with their privatization certificates, as well as procedures for conducting this operation and samples of the documentation needed. The publication of these documents looks more like an April's Fool joke than real help in privatization or its actual implementation, since Ukraine still lacks a network of investment funds, brokerage offices, and other institutions servicing the process of denationalization; the road of the privatization certificate to the object of privatization, on the other hand, is difficult and convoluted because of various paperwork formalities. Parliament Speaker Ivan Plyushch permitted himself a sharp personal attack against Leonid Kravchuk at an election precinct during the voting on 27 March, and is still in a fighting mood. Over the past week the mass media showed several times a recorded interview in which Ivan Plyushch urged Ukrainian citizens to participate in the second round of elections. He also urged the citizens to decide were they stand politically without squandering more money on the conduct of repeat elections. And on 3 April on Ukrainian television Plyushch said: "You have to show up and vote--this is best in every respect. We have neither the money for repeat elections, nor the need, nor the time to hold them. I appeal to all people of Ukraine; I plead; I bow deep to them: Come, cast a repeat vote, elect deputies. Whom you elect is your business. I want to say once again: He who has the power has the key to paradise. Now the people have the power. Whom you will pass this power to will be determined in the repeat elections."
