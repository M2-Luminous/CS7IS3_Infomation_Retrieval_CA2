Informed Palestinian sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: The meetings were called by Fatah Central Committee Members 'Abbas Zaki and Muhammad Jihad after a statement was issued attacking them vehemently and crudely criticizing their conduct and personal lives. That statement was issued several days ago in Tunis and faxed to PLO offices and departments. It contained expressions contrary to the general ethics and the spirit of amity which had governed past differences. The sources said that the statement was not signed and concluded with the phrase "this is the first in a series of scandals to be published later on." They added that one of 'Arafat's advisers deported from the occupied territory might be behind it. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that during these meetings, held in extreme secrecy, 'Abbas Zaki and Muhammad Jihad threatened to take measures unprecedented since the famous secession of Abu-Musa [Sa'id Musa] and his group in 1983 which resulted in armed clashes at the time. Zaki and Jihad blame 'Arafat for what happened, claiming that had he not protected some individuals, they would not have dared commit such folly. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has also learned that these meetings coincide with internal Fatah problems, especially in the occupied territory, between the conflicting wings of the movement, some of which have for some time now been rejecting President 'Arafat's appointment of certain individuals in the occupied territory. That prompted a delegation of Fatah members in the occupied territory to go to Tunis to discuss with the leadership these issues and excesses threatening an eruption of armed confrontations. According to the same information, a large number of Central Committee members have expressed profound resentment of that statement and expressed solidarity with 'Abbas Zaki, Muhammad Jihad, and others including Abu-Ziyad al-Qurbi who were also included in these accusations. They demanded that those who were behind that statement should be exposed and so should their interest in doing such a thing in these critical circumstances when the Central Committee meetings should be concentrating on discussion of the "secret" file pertaining to the resumption of the negotiations on which talks are now being held in Tunis and Cairo without the knowledge of many members, and on the press reports about agreement being discussed in Cairo, which would mean resumption of the negotiations. But there has been no official statement to that effect.
