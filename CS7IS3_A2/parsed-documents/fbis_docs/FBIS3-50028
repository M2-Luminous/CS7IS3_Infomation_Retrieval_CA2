Uhrik told journalists after leaving the meeting room, that the Slovak National Party (SNS) faced the decision of whether to "slavishly support" the destructive policies of Premier Vladimir Meciar or to create a constructive alternative. Today's decisions are not guided by a search for truth and constructive solutions, but by the corruption of some SNS members by Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Uhrik said. He declined to go into details about the corruption, but said it was one of the causes for the party's current crisis. Uhrik said he had spoken out for party unity and the dismissal of party functionaries under HZDS influence. The Central Council had earlier refused to accept Uhrik's resignation, which Uhrik took as a sign that the council was "distancing itself from the methods of the past carried out by a small group of people in the leadership." Yet this group applied these very methods recently against SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak, who was accused of undemocratically splitting the party and of holding secret talks with Hungarian politicians on toppling the Meciar government. The anti-Cernak faction has, "besides lying and hitting below the belt, not shrunk from calling up the image of a bloody conflict in southern Slovakia, just in order to get rid of the chairman," Uhrik said. Today's Central Council session is expected to resolve the conflict between Cernak and his party opponents, Deputy Premiers Marian Andel and Jozef Prokes, who advocate drawing the SNS closer to, or even uniting with, the HZDS. "Today we must decide unambiguously between two party lines," Cernak told CTK earlier today. He said he intended to call for a party congress to decide the issue, since only a congress can make personnel changes in top party functions.
