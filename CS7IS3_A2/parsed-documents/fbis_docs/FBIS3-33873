Their reaction was as follows: [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] We are expecting things to start to happen after this appointment. What is important today is what the man of the transitional period will do rather than who is in charge of the transitional period. [Unidentified correspondent] Kamel Laroussi, you are a leading member of the Islamic Nahda Movement. What is your reaction? [Laroussi] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. The leader of the movement already answered this question when he said that the appointment of Liamine Zeroual to lead the country during this period came about first because he was a member of the National Liberation Army. However, what we are hoping will take place during the next phase is that he will work in accordance with the consensus reached by the parties, in a bid to bring about national reconciliation. Thank you. [Correspondent] Ahmed Mahsas is a historic figure and at the same time he is leader of the Union of Democratic Forces. Mr. Mahsas, what is your reaction to the appointment of Liamine Zeroual as head of state? [Mahsas] Of course we, as a political movement, did not take part in the dialogue for certain reasons. However, as far as state issues are concerned our concern is to correct the foundations of the state. We believe that the appointment of brother Liamine Zeroual is a positive move in this decisive period. He has shouldered a colossal responsibility. Such an appointment may be able to stop the serious deterioration if measures are taken that will make the Algerian people feel that something new is taking place. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Mahsas. Mr. Abdelkader Merbah, leader of the Majd party, will you give us your reaction to the appointment of Liamine Zeroual as head of state? [Merbah] I said in my news conference on 23 December that there were some signs for a positive change. I was then trying to hint to Liamine Zeroual as well as other officials of the state. Thanks be to God, time has shown that I was right. We are very happy at the appointment of Liamine Zeroual as head of state because we think he is committed to making a clean break with the past, and he is a fair and strong man. A strong Algeria needs strong men to set the house in order. Algerians were desperate. We hope that our despair is over with the appointment of men like Zeroual to lead the country.
