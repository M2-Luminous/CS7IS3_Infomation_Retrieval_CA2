He is the former governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast who sought to create the Urals Republic, leader of the nonpolitical movement Revival of the Urals, and a member of the Federation Council. Sverdlovsk Would Not Be Swayed by Tears, Either This man could say: "I made myself." He was born in the infamous year 1937, having already lost his father. His father was wasted one month before the son's arrival on the absurd and terrifying charge of "not being one of us." He was not "one of us" because he was a joiner, a cabinet-maker, headed a variety-show band, and "wore a Polish suit," and finally, just because he was a "Volga German." At age four the boy ended up an orphan, but with a living mother who was exiled to the north without correspondence privileges. He was a vagrant from 1942 to 1947. The war, the one woe shared by the entire people and the entire country, "helped" him to not become a thief or die. His mother found him in Verkhnekamsk through the all-Union search service. Having been hopelessly late for everything good early in life, he made up for this with a persistence and ambition that turned out to be characteristic. At the age of 21 he graduated high school. He tossed the handbook "Where To Go To Study" at random, and it opened to the letter "S." He was not expected anywhere, but Sverdlovsk had so many institutes! He opted for the mining institute. The gifted student began to write his candidate dissertation even before defending his diploma. However, his scientific career was not to be for the most mundane reason, although he was retained as a junior research associate: There was no money to support his wife and daughter. To be sure, he would yet defend the dissertation and become a candidate of technical sciences. At that time, he went to Nizhniy Tagil where he began his climb, not skipping a single step: from foreman to chief of the Sreduralstroy territorial construction association. He built dozens of unique enterprises within strikingly short periods of just one year. When one of these enterprises was being commissioned, Boris Yeltsin, the leader of the oblast at the time, deeply touched, took off a golden alarm wristwatch which had, in turn, been given to Yeltsin as a birthday gift by...Leonid Ilich himself, and gave it Rossel. They also began to value Rossel in the Urals as a good regional-level leader when he was elected oblast executive committee chairman in 1990 and soon also chairman of the oblast soviet. This combination of positions was authorized for Sverdlovsk Oblast on an experimental basis. In 1991 Rossel was appointed head of the administration by a presidential edict. He got a difficult place to manage. When Rossel assumed this position, grain stocks in the oblast were sufficient for only 10 days. Later, there was enough for one day. Desperate appeals to officials in Moscow accomplished nothing. One night he got on a plane and flew to Almaty, to Nazarbayev. Kazakhstan agreed to provide grain in exchange for metal, timber, and pipes. However, Rossel had to break all the contracts.... A new misfortune soon occurred--the banks stopped paying out cash. Gaydar helped Rossel as best he could. However, the catastrophe struck the entire country, and other ways out had to be sought. They made an arrangement with Perm, which had ready cash but no butter or mayonnaise.... Even then the shrewd Rossel understood that he could not expect favors from on high. On one hand, the resources of the country were dwindling; on the other hand, the burden of power oppressed the center, and it began to delegate power down a drop at a time. In the process the center wasted no opportunity to show the "provincials" who was in charge in the house by signing or failing to sign "authorization" papers. However, the much desired decrees concerning the oblast, which had been arranged with a lot of difficulty, had ceased to carry any weight. There was no force that could make these papers with the state emblem "work." `We Are Pragmatists, Not Separatists' Rossel says: "Self-dependence is a trait of my character. I was assigned a certain volume of work, and from that moment on the supervisor ceased to exist for me. I was responsible for the work from beginning to end, and I always did it, no matter what this cost me." You cannot call him a romantic. He is intelligent, prudent, and pragmatic. He is a man with a lot of willpower. His are the strong shoulders of a skier, all-rounder, volleyball player.... He likes combinations including many moves, such as in chess and Russian checkers, in which he has respectable ratings. Generally, he is a fighter. Having pondered his position and the situation in the country, he resolved to take the next step. In 1991 his team developed a statute of real power in the oblast to supplement the Federation Treaty and submitted it to the Supreme Soviet. The Supreme Soviet rejected the statute. Rossel then secured a meeting with the president and showed him a draft edict on an economic experiment. He tried to persuade Boris Yeltsin that if the experiment worked out, it would be possible to expand it to include other regions without a loss. The president approved the idea and called Viktor Chernomyrdin right away. He was supportive, too. The old pattern of making the rounds of offices and collecting endorsements for the edict began. As a result, there were 18 rejections instead of the 18 necessary endorsements. What was to be done? Rossel gathered a narrow circle of like-minded people and argued that the final step remained: to create a republic. After all, under the Constitution in effect at the time, one had to have status in order to obtain rights, and in order to get status, one needed to be called a republic because oblasts had virtually no rights. "We had one chance in 100. I understood that my venture could end in my being relieved. However, we acted solely within the law." According to the old Constitution, they first polled the population and held a session of the oblast soviet. Subsequently, they proclaimed the republic in July 1993 and adopted a declaration. A draft Constitution was developed, which they used as the basis and published in the press. The people responded. Rossel received more than 1,000 remarks which were considered by a special constitutional commission. Finally, the Constitution of the Urals Republic was ultimately adopted, and at the same time a law on elections was approved at a session of the oblast soviet according to which an election of the legislative assembly and governor of the Urals Republic was to be held on 12 December. At this point, Moscow choked with wrath. First, a fax was received on 9 November on the oblast soviet being dispersed; an envoy urgently flew to Yekaterinburg to keep an eye on the actions of "separatists." At equal time intervals, the official who arrived reported to the center what was happening, and said that Rossel did not intend to disband the oblast soviet but, on the contrary, had signed a decree on protection for deputies left without a job following the presidential edict. The following day, a second fax message came on Rossel being relieved for "exceeding state authority." It is an irony of fate that the Sverdlovsk candidate for deputy of Russia Boris Yeltsin wrote in his election program in 1990: "Following a referendum, self-governing socioeconomic territories and regions may be formed within the RSFSR. Their rights will be set forth in the new Constitution of the RSFSR." In turn, Sergey Shakhray, chairman of the Goskomnats [abbreviation as published; State Committee on Federation and Nationality Affairs], who as recently July had stated that it was necessary to relieve Rossel from his position, on familiarizing himself with Rossel's proposals became an active proponent of the idea of economic federalism, making it the banner of his party and the campaign for elections to the State Duma. This begs the question: Whom did the officials from Moscow hurt more? Indeed, Eduard Ergartovich was relieved from the position of governor. However, at a meeting of the council of the Association for Economic Cooperation Between Oblasts and Republics of the Urals Region immediately following Moscow's decision, he was elected president of this association. This indicates the opinion of the leaders of five oblasts and two republics of Russia. Could the officials have hurt themselves the most? After all, having closed down this experiment, they will soon be unable to distribute anything themselves; after all, production is continuing to fall. However, most importantly they have hurt the residents of the Urals who did not intend to sail away from Russia in their boat but, on the contrary, intended to live together with everyone, but producing goods intelligently and strengthening relations that multiply our common wealth. *** Appeals and letters seeking that the edict concerning Rossel be canceled are still being sent to the president. I for one recalled one episode from his life. He writes "German" in the box "nationality" in questionnaires. This was what his parents wrote, as well as his forefathers, who ended up in Russia under Catherine II. In terms of his way of life, upbringing, and religion, he is Orthodox, baptized, and Russian. Recently Jacques Attali, former president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, tried to open his eyes to the mystery of his stock, telling him that Germans do not have such a last name, but that this was the last name of the 27-year-old Rossel, a military figure of the Paris Commune, who was shot after the revolution was defeated. The Rossel dynasty hastily left Paris, going to Germany. It is hard to say whether this is a legend or the truth. Something else is striking: Each nation is prepared to consider a talented man its own--Pushkin with his African blood, and Lermontov with his admixture of Scottish clans. So, the French want to "appropriate" our Rossel, too. It is ridiculous.... We need him ourselves.
