This has been indicated by relevant messages from CDU/CSU delegates, mainly from the new laender, SPD Manager Guenter Verheugen told journalists in Bonn on Tuesday [10 May]. He ruled out any tactical maneuvers by the SPD in the Federal Assembly votes. The Social Democrats will vote for Rau all the way through. Speculations that the SPD will vote for the Free Democratic Party candidate Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher in the third round are unfounded, [Verheugen said].
