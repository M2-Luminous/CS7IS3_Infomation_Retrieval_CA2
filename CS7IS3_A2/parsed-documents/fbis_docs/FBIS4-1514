They were: --Vague leadership. Being contented with the current situation, not using their brains, being slack at work, having no distinguishing features, not making breakthroughs, and having no creativity in work. --"Principle" leadership. Being accustomed to talking about great truths, general principles, and general concepts, but lacking deep and thorough analyses of problems, and not showing real knowledge and deep insight in light of reality when giving guidance to work. --Wait-for-instruction leadership. Waiting for instructions from higher levels in handling any matter, acting according to what people at higher levels say, making no investigation, no studies, no personal stands, and taking no initiative for solid work in solving problems. --Leadership of shirking responsibility. Shirking one's duties to higher or lower levels or to lateral organizations, making no progress in work, and blaming others for any mistakes made. --Weak leadership. Trying hard to play the part of a good person, being afraid of confronting tough issues, of undertaking responsibility, of facing contradictions squarely, or of tackling difficult problems. --Nonprofessional leadership. Not acquiring new knowledge and new skills on one's initiative despite changes in the situation, depending only on old experience and old ideas, looking triumphant and considering oneself right despite one's incompetence in work. --Formalist leadership. Doing superficial work, seeking sensational effects, blowing one's own trumpet in writing articles and summing experience while paying no attention to actual results. --Routine work leadership. Being busy with welcoming people and seeing people off, accompanying people to meetings and dinners, attending ceremonies for laying foundation stones and cutting ribbons, wasting energy on reading speeches, and failing to grasp essential work. --Reckless leadership. Paying empty lip service, telling lies, forging accounts, reporting false achievements to put up an outward show and to please people at higher levels, striking one's chest and promising to do something which one never intends to do. --Favor-currying leadership. Being enthusiastic in establishing relationships and visiting people, seeking fame and personal gain, and even openly demanding official posts and power. A few days ago, Cheng Weigao, together with cadres of some provincial departments, went to Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou to carry out investigations. They discovered that an important reason why some localities had long been unable to open up a new situation and why work had not been properly done was that there were problems in the ideology and work styles of some leading cadres. Cheng Weigao pointed out that, although the number of cadres with the ideology and work styles mentioned above was small, their influence was bad. In some localities, many things had been delayed; reform, opening up, and economic construction had been prevented from developing better and faster; and the image of the party and the government among the people had been damaged, causing resentment among the people. In view of problems in the ideology and work styles of leading cadres, Hebei Province has adopted corresponding measures for assessing and using cadres and for further establishing necessary rules and regulations.
