FR940124-1-00016 FR940124-1-00005 B. I/M Program in California 1. California Committal SIP: The State of California submitted an I/M committal SIP on November 13, 1992. The committal SIP submittal became complete by operation of law under section 110(k)(1)(B) on May 13, 1993. The submittal includes a letter from the Executive Officer of the CARB and a copy of Resolution 92&hyph;74 which was adopted at a public hearing held by the CARB on November 13, 1992. The Resolution directs the Executive Officer to submit the committal letter to EPA as a revision to the SIP. The submittal included a commitment by the governor's designee, the CARB Executive Officer, to the timely adoption and implementation of I/M programs meeting all requirements of the I/M regulation and the Act in all nonattainment areas in California where these programs are required. A schedule of adoption was included in a letter sent by the CARB Executive Officer to EPA on January 15, 1993 clarifying certain details of the November 13, 1992 I/M committal SIP submittal. In the schedule California committed to passing legislation authorizing an I/M program by September 10, 1993. The committal SIP lists October 10, 1993 as the deadline for the legislation to be signed by the governor. 2. EPA Proposed Approval: On June 28, 1993 (58 FR 34553) EPA proposed to conditionally approve the committal SIP under section 110(k)(4) of the Act. In the alternative, however, EPA proposed that, if the State failed to adopt legislative authority or meet certain other applicable interim milestones in the commitment prior to EPA's final action on the submittal, EPA would disapprove the committal SIP. The basis for such disapproval would be a determination that California could not meet the November 15, 1993 SIP revision submission date if it failed to meet the interim milestones. Therefore, since the State could not meet its commitment, final approval under section 110(k)(4) would not be appropriate. 3. State Legislative Action: On November 15, 1993 California failed to meet its commitment to EPA. By letter dated December 30, 1993, EPA Region 9 notified the State that the proposed SIP revision submitted on November 15, 1993, did not contain the critical elements required by statute and that the State had failed to submit a complete SIP revision as required by the Act. For example, the proposed SIP revision did not contain legislative authority for the State to implement the proposed SIP revision. In addition, EPA Region 9 notified the State that the proposed SIP revision was an incomplete SIP submittal because it was not subject to a public hearing. Further, the State failed to meet the interim deadlines in its committal SIP. California was required to obtain legislative authority for the adoption and implementation of an enhanced I/M program during the 1993 legislative session under the November 15, 1992 I/M committal SIP submittal. Bills to change California's existing I/M program were introduced during the 1993 legislative session and hearings were held by the Senate and Assembly Transportation Committees. The legislature adjourned, however, on September 10, 1993 without having adopted I/M legislation. Failure to provide such authority prevented California from submitting a complete SIP revision by November 15, 1993. Earlier this year, EPA anticipated the possibility that the California legislature would fail to adopt necessary legislation during the 1993 legislative session. On April 13, 1993, EPA and the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a joint letter to Governor Wilson advising him that EPA would exercise its discretionary authority under section 110(m) of the Act to impose sanctions if the legislature failed to adopt adequate legislation. On November 24, 1993, EPA issued a press statement indicating that EPA would temporarily halt the process of imposing sanctions to permit discussions between the parties to resolve the issue. 4. Importance of Timely Implementation of Appropriate I/M Programs: Beyond being a specific mandate of the Act, enhanced I/M programs play an important role in the ability of California areas to comply with the CAA requirements for achieving the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and CO, as well as the Act's requirements for reasonable further progress (RFP) reductions for ozone. The Act provides that each state in which all or part of an ozone and/or CO nonattainment area are located is required to provide an attainment demonstration showing that its SIP, as revised, will provide for attainment of the ozone and/or CO NAAQS by the applicable attainment date(s). The Act further requires that each state in which all or part of a serious, severe, or extreme ozone nonattainment area is located shall submit SIP revisions that will reduce VOC emissions by November 15, 1996 by at least 15% of the 1990 baseline emissions. If the reductions identified in the SIP revisions are less than 15% of the baseline emissions, the State may obtain a waiver under section 182(b)(1)(A)(ii); this requires the State to make several demonstrations, including one that the plan reflecting the lesser amount includes all measures that can feasibly be implemented in the area in light of technological achievability. Many areas in California will have difficulty meeting the RFP requirements because credit for certain pre-1990 CAA programs, such as the federal motor vehicle control program and basic I/M, is not allowed. The additional benefits of enhanced I/M, however, are fully creditable towards meeting the RFP requirement. Enhanced I/M is one of the most powerful tools available to areas in terms of providing expeditious reductions in both VOC and NOx, both of which are treated in most California plans as precursors of ozone. Finally, a federally approvable enhanced I/M program represents one of the most cost-effective air quality control strategies available. Without an effective I/M program, attainment of the ozone and CO air quality standard is virtually impossible. Without appropriate enabling legislation, an enhanced I/M program cannot be implemented.
