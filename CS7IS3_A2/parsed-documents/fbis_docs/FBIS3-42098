The discussion draft submitted on 22 November 1993 had sought to repeal the amendment taking the view that all country specific amendments must be done away with. However, it was obvious, given he significance of the nuclear issue within the South Asian context, that Pressler would witness the fiercest battle between the Administration and the Congress. Senator Larry Pressler had them vowed to fight tooth and nail for the inclusion of his amendment. It appears now that he did. Analysts, both in Pakistan and abroad had built scenarios, linking Administration's attempts at shooting down the amendment as reciprocating Islamabad's tacit approval of toeing the international line on Kashmir. It was thought at the time that Washington was posturing to indicate to India its dissatisfaction with the human rights violations as also the dated Indian rhetoric of Kashmir being its atoot ang [integral part]. Ms. Robin Raphel's visit and her statements on the issue and Islamabad's decision to withdraw the resolution in the UN, condemning human rights violations by India in the valley, seemed to point to a nexus of sorts. The Administration on its part had given the general impression that Pressler had failed to advance Washington's objectives of non-proliferation, raising hopes that the amendment might be scrapped. The scenario has come apart. While the Americans might see this development in the domestic context of a usual fight between the Administration and the Congress, the reincorporation of the amendment in the Foreign Assistance Act has different connotations for Pakistan. And this does not just include the man on the street, but virtually everyone. There may be a spate of concerned statements on Kashmir by Americans, Ms Raphel's being the latest, but it is obvious that when it comes to the crunch, it is always Pakistan that falls on hard times. The development also does not dovetail with the viewpoint of some American analysts who have been advising Washington to remain even-handed in South Asia, especially in the military sphere. Simply put it means that the conventional strength of the Pakistani defence forces should at least be kept at a level where paranoid does not set in, forcing it to rely on non-conventional options in the face of growing imbalance of conventional forces vis-a-vis India. Now with the amendment still clamped on, the squeeze continues. While the ground forces could manage to scout for alternatives the air force, hardest hit by the amendment, is growing desperate. There is the question of the delivery of 71 F-16s for which Pakistan has already paid $658 million but which it cannot get because of the amendment. However, it has to keep paying the installments, another snag on which the two governments, according to one report, have been stumbling. While it would be optimistic to say that Islamabad could survive the amendment, even if the costs be high, the US response to the people of this country does not enhance its credibility in the eyes of most Pakistani. Given the present escalation of tension in the region on the question of Kashmir, the development could bode ill, forcing the saner element to concede ground to the hawks.
