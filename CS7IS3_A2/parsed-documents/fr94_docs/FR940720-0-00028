FR940720-0-00028 FR940720-0-00001 For spent fuel storage licenses, the generic costs of $2.2 million have been spread uniformly among those licensees who hold specific or general licenses for receipt and storage of spent fuel at an ISFSI. This results in an annual fee of $363,500. This represents a fee increase compared to FY 1993 in order to recover the increased budget necessary to perform rulemakings and the regulatory oversight over the increased number of licensees. To equitably and fairly allocate the $38.6 million attributable to the approximately 6,500 diverse material users and registrants, the NRC has continued to base the annual fee on the Part 170 application and inspection fees. Because the application and inspection fees are indicative of the complexity of the license, this approach continues to provide a proxy for allocating the costs to the diverse categories of licensees based on how much it costs NRC to regulate each category. The fee calculation also continues to consider the inspection frequency, which is indicative of the safety risk and resulting regulatory costs associated with the categories of licensees. In summary, the annual fee for these categories of licenses is developed as follows: Annual Fee=(Application Fee+Inspection Fee/Inspection Priority)xConstant+(Unique Category Costs). The constant is the multiple necessary to recover $38.6 million and is 2.6 for FY 1994. The unique costs are any special costs that the NRC has budgeted for a specific category of licensees. For FY 1994, unique costs of approximately $2.6 million were identified for the medical improvement program which is attributable to medical licensees. Materials annual fees for FY 1994 are 13 to 17 percent higher compared to the FY 1993 annual fees. There are two basic reasons for the changes in the fees from FY 1993. First, the FY 1994 budgeted amount attributable to materials licensees is about 10 percent higher than the comparable FY 1993 to reflect the cost necessary to regulate this class of licensees and the direct allocation of certain budgeted costs as opposed to including them in the hourly rate. Second, the number of licensees to be assessed annual fees in FY 1994 has decreased (from about 6,800 to about 6,500), resulting in a 4 percent increase in fees. The materials fees must be established at these levels in order to comply with the mandate of OBRA&hyph;90 to recover approximately 100 percent of the NRC's FY 1994 budget authority. A materials licensee may pay a reduced annual fee if the licensee qualifies as a small entity under the NRC's size standards and certifies that it is a small entity using NRC Form 526. To recover the $4.0 million attributable to the transportation class of licensees, $923,000 will be assessed to the Department of Energy (DOE) to cover all of its transportation casks under Category 18. The remaining transportation costs for generic activities ($3.1 million) are allocated to holders of approved QA plans. The annual fee for approved QA plans is $64,700 for users and fabricators and $900 for users only.
