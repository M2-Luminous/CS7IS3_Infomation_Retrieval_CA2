I convey my good wishes to everyone and thank you very much for your good cooperation and support in all my endeavors. In the past year several abnormal events occurred, including the simultaneous events of drought and flooding. Some of these abnormal events caused anxiety and concern, while some greatly affected the livelihood, occupation, and economy of individuals and the country. However, because most of us have good sense, perseverance, strong mind, and compassion, we were able to cooperate to alleviate the severity of these events. These abnormal events should make you realize that in a person's life he is going to face danger, obstacles, good as well as bad luck. No one will be able to live happily forever. Everyone must prepare his mind and body to be ready to cope with and recover from abnormalities and problems, using rationality, sound knowledge, righteousness, thoroughness, and the power of unity. I strongly wish that everyone is aware of and truly understands the country's situation. That is, our country now needs efficient and urgent development so that it will fully benefit from its resources and from every Thai person's labor and intelligence. There can be no delay for any reason, because whatever benefits that could be gained will be wasted. In this era, such a waste is a loss. We can all help by being determined to uphold national interests as the goal. Selfish interests and disputes over nonsensical matters must be minimized. One must quickly perform and complete his duties to the best of his ideas, knowledge, ability and to do so with sincerity, kindness, a sense of unity, and good intention toward others. In this way, the achievements of everyone will consolidate into happiness, security, and prosperity of the country, which is our ultimate goal. May the power of the three gems and all sacred beings in the universe protect you from all danger and evil and endow you with good and strong health, mind, and wisdom to successfully carry out all your activities that benefit yourself, the country, as well as its independence, freedom, and happiness forever. May everyone of you enjoy happiness and prosperity and the fulfillment of your wishes.
