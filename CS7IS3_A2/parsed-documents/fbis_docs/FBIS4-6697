The Korean Residents Union in Japan (Mindan) said Wednesday's regular assembly has decided to drop the word "kyoryu," or "temporary stay," from its title since the Japanese word suggests that they are only in Japan for a short time or temporarily. "We want to make clear our intention that we are permanent residents of Japan, so the characters for `kyoryu,' which were a part of our name until today, were deleted," newly-elected Mindan Chairman Shin Yong-sang, 69, said at a press meeting Wednesday following the assembly. Mindan's Information Office said Thursday that it had not yet considered whether the official English name of the group would be changed. Shin also said that while Korean residents of Japan pay taxes, they have no political rights, adding "our rights and responsibilities are not equal." He added that for the sake of Japan's internationalization, Mindan planned to campaign extensively in favor of Japan's foreign residents being given the right to vote. Many of Mindan's 450,000 members were born and raised in Japan but are still considered foreign residents. At the end of World War II, there were an estimated two million Koreans in Japan, most forcibly brought in during the 1910 to 1945 colonial period to labor in factories and mines. Although many were later repatriated, others stayed on and today some 700,000 Koreans, including descendants of those forcibly brought in, currently live in Japan.
