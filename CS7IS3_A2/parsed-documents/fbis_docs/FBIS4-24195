He told Parliament's joint committee on finance SA [South Africa] could still find a way out of the trap. "It does not matter that much that we have hit our head against the wall of the bunker, as it is still easy to get out. There are ways out of the bunker." Meijer and Bank Governor Chris Stals appeared before the committee to explain the Bank's monetary policy stance. They fielded questions on the Bank's conservative position on the deficit, IMF conditionality and the reasons behind SA's large capital outflows. Stals signalled that a reduction in interest rates was not on the card in the short term, as SA's balance of payments was still too fragile. Capital outflows, low savings and high fiscal deficits had recently placed upward pressure on interest rates, he said. He expressed concern over the "very high" level of the deficit, saying it would start crowding out the private sector when the economic upswing gained momentum. This was in response to a question from ANC MP Max Sisulu, who questioned the "magical" 6 percent of GDP level for the deficit. Stals was encouraged by the reduction in the deficit from 6.9 percent of GDP to 6.6 percent, but repeatedly warned that a borrowing requirement of 6 percent would become progressively difficult to finance once the private sector's demand for credit picked up. SA was borrowing to pay interest rather than to invest. Government's interest bill was already 5.5 percent of GDP. But sluggish economic conditions had added to government's difficulties by putting a lid on revenue growth -- a situation that would change. On interest rates, he hoped there would be capital inflows in the second half, so that it would "not be necessary to raise Bank rate". If SA experienced a capital inflow over the next six months, it could lead to a "slight decline" in interest rates. Stals also disclosed the extent to which SA's foreign exchange reserves were threatened in the run-up to the election and said the situation remained worrisome. The Bank had arranged R11bn [rand] in shortterm foreign credit lines, of which R8.5bn had been used in the first week of May. SA's reserves were battered right up to the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela. However, there had been a subsequent improvement which had enabled the Bank to cut its foreign exchange "overdrafts" to about R6.5bn. He hoped the borrowings could be reduced to zero by year-end. Commenting on the financial rand, he said deposits of about R4bn in the money market would have to be run down before the Bank could consider recommending the scrapping of the dual currency system. Other prerequisites were a narrowing in the discount between the finrand and the commercial rand to 10 percent from the present level of about 23 percent, and a substantial increase in the country's reserves. The finrand deposits had already fallen, from about R8bn 18 months ago, and the discount had narrowed. He put the finrand pool -- non-resident investment mainly in SA gilts and equities -- at about $15bn.
