FR941021-1-00017 FR941021-1-00003 §247.11 Losses and accountability. (a) Agencies will be accountable for all losses arising out of agency activity related to the issuance of FedSelect checks. Such activities include negligence, fraud perpetrated by an employee or agent of the agency, and fraud perpetrated by a service-provider or vendor receiving a FedSelect check as payment. (b) If an agency had notice that a FedSelect check was not received by the payee within a reasonable time after a payment is due, or that a FedSelect check is lost, stolen or destroyed, and the agency failed to request to the FMS that a stop payment order be placed on that item pursuant to §247.10(a), the agency will be accountable for any loss occurring as a result of the failure to request stop payment in a timely fashion. (c) Losses caused by the fault or negligence of the FMS will be the accountability of the FMS. Such losses include failure to adhere to a request by an agency to place a stop payment order on an item in accordance with §247.10(a). (d) The FMS will be accountable for losses caused by third-parties, including losses caused by alteration, counterfeit and forgery of the payee indorsement, unless such losses occur as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. §247.12 Debt collection. (a) Agencies are responsible for collection procedures on all improperly paid items arising under the circumstances described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of §247.11. However, excepting cases of fraud, an agency should write off a debt and refer it to the FMS for collection if it is not resolved within 90 days after the item was paid. When the FMS collects on the debt, the funds will be returned to the agency minus an administrative fee for the collection, in accordance with rules set forth in I TFM 4-3500. Accountability for a debt remains with the agency in accordance with §247.11. (b) The FMS is responsible for collection procedures on all improperly paid items arising under the circumstances described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of §247.11. With all such items, the FMS will make an initial demand for refund of the amount of a check payment to the presenting bank or any other debtor. This demand shall advise the presenting bank or debtor of the amount demanded and the reason for the demand. All delinquent debts will be subject to interest, penalties and administrative fees in accordance with the Federal Claims Collections Standards. Any discrepancies should be brought to the attention of the FMS.
