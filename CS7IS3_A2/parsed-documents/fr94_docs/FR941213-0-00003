The supplementary information accompanying the interim final rule provides an explanation of 12 CFR part 1609 and the reasons for its adoption. Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. , the following regulatory flexibility analysis is provided: 1. A succinct statement of the need for, and the objective of, the rule. The objective of the rule is to implement changes made to the AHDP by enactment of the 1992 Appropriations Act, the Housing Act, and the Completion Act, which establishes certain requirements for the RTC in the marketing and selling of real estate assets. The rule is needed in order to implement the requirements of the cited statutes. 2. A summary of the issues raised by public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis, a summary of the assessment by the agency of such issue, and a statement of any changes made in the interim final rule as a result of such comments. The one public comment received by the RTC endorsed the regulations as drafted in the interim final rule. No changes were made as a result of that comment. 3. A description of each of the significant alternatives to the rule consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes and designed to minimize any significant economic impact of the rule on small entities which was considered by the agency, and a statement of the reasons why each one of such alternatives was rejected. The rule has no significant impact on small entities, and therefore, no alternatives to the rule were identified or considered.
