The event was a milestone, revolutionary, worthy of press conferences and widely broadcast announcements. Finally, an effort will be made to somehow regulate the chaotic and uncontrolled commercial activity of "Ostankino"--the source of many and all kinds of abuses. According to the most modest estimates (which were used, specifically, by the Presidential Control-Inspection Administration, which conducted an investigation of the company), "Ostankino" underreceived over 60 billion rubles (R) last year. They disappeared without a trace, settling in someone's private pockets. The average cost of a minute of advertising today is $5,000. There are 100 such minutes at "Ostankino" in the course of a day. That means it should receive somewhere on the order of half a million dollars a day. Yet in fact it receives $600,000 - $700,000 a month! The heads of the company (different ones and in different periods) sooner or later came to the idea of centralized advertising. It is true, there were always opponents who tried to persuade the "chiefs" that once the genie had gotten out of the bottle, it would be impossible to force him back in. The scope of business was too great, there were too many people and structures interested in the real possession of advertising time. There was too much money involved. Despite all the "buts," the current leadership of "Ostankino" has nevertheless decided to force the genie back. It is doing so in a surprisingly quiet, if not to say secretive, manner. In the week which has passed since the moment the decision was adopted, there has not been a single interview or a single piece of information in any of the newspapers! Obviously, this really is a delicate matter, if the respected and competent people to whom I turned for explanations hesitated and avoided direct answers, while sceptics agreed to talk exclusively in a confidential manner. On the whole, all of my "consultants" agreed on one thing: The creation of a single holding company which would sell all the advertising time on channel one at firm prices is a good idea. It is specifically according to such a scheme that many Western companies exist. However, in the West they went to this scheme systematically and gradually. For us, however, the realities are different: "Ostankino" produces only one-fifth of the entire product. The remainder it presently buys from independent television companies, paying them in advertising time. They, in turn, sell this time and decide for themselves how to spend the money they receive. They produce cultural programs, which are unprofitable and to which they cannot tempt advertisers, at the expense of profitable commercial programs. Now "Ostankino" intends to settle accounts with them in real money, obtained from the sale of advertising time. And here is where the questions and the doubts arise: Will programs which are educational and cultural but unprofitable and not attractive to advertisers disappear from the air? Will the new "master of the money" dictate to "Ostankino" what to buy and what not to buy? Why, for example, should it buy an expensive domestic program when it can buy a cheap movie in the West, which will bring a huge profit? From the standpoint of business, this is normal. Yet from the standpoint of creativity, culture, and the interests of society? When the advertising holding company receives the first real profits, will it not be interested in further increasing them by means of reducing expenditures? After all, the stockholders--private firms--did not take on this endeavor out of charitable convictions?! They have to pay off "Ostankino," and to "cook up" something for themselves, if you will excuse the expression! I have heard apprehensions to the effect that the advertising holding company may go from being a mediator to being a contractor, determining the company's program policy. (It is the same principle: He who pays calls the tune). Then channel one will simply collapse, turn into a broadcaster of third-rate films, "soap operas" and advertising clips. Moreover, the skeptics say, "Ostankino" is a bottomless pit which is capable of swallowing up any amount of money, millions and billions. Just hand it over. Since there has been no reorganization of the company's outdated structure, and the budget deficit remains high, "Ostankino" will use the money received from commercial activity primarily for continuing to feed its overly inflated staff and its administrative apparatus, and to patch up the numerous holes and breaches. Where is the guarantee that there will be enough left over to settle accounts with private companies in a timely manner (and at a real price!)? There is no such guarantee. Well, and finally, the main thing: The changeover of "Ostankino" to stockholding with the participation of the television producers themselves (which is natural) has stopped. It has gotten bogged down somewhere at the level of the president's apparatus, and there is almost no hope left for it. "Ostankino," while in fact remaining state-owned, is in essence even now being changed over to shareholding. Moreover, the piece being auctioned off is its most profitable and choice one--the advertising space. In principle, there is nothing else to auction off. "Ostankino" does not own anything but air time--neither equipment, nor its own building, nor the desks in the offices, nor even the lights in the restrooms. All this belongs to an entirely different, independent organization--the Television Technical Center. Now even the advertising time has an owner--a strong, economically well-grounded monopolist which unites six advertising agencies. All the other agencies (and there is a great multitude of them in Moscow alone) will either buy advertising time from it, or will perish (which is improbable), or will begin a struggle. And we know what happens when spheres of influence are divided up. However, we do not want to think about this. First of all, because for "Ostankino" this is an experiment. After all, it is never too late to return to the former scheme. Secondly, all the apprehensions which have been expressed are in the category of versions and suppositions which, nevertheless, must be "sound-tracked." After all, it is better not to allow something than to try to correct it later. For now, it has not yet begun.
