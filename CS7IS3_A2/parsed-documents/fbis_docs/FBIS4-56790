The UPEC [Union of Cuban Journalists] members submitted a document to the participants, stating that the main cause of the distortion of our country's image is the result of miscommunication imposed from abroad. Regarding that isolation policy, the document underscores violations in the issuance of visas to travel to the United States, which prevented Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina from attending a forum recently held by the CNN network in the City of Atlanta. The document, submitted by UPEC vice president Jose dos Santos, includes an addendum of newspaper articles prepared by Cuban reporters from various media on freedom of expression and other subjects being discussed in the seminar in Chile.
