Germany's ambassador to the EU serving in Brussels, Dietrich von Kyaw, believes that Finland and Germany will find that they have common interests particularly as the EU develops its relations with East Europe, the Baltic countries, and Russia. Speaking at a German-Finnish Chamber of Commerce gathering, von Kyaw outlined, among other things, the goal of turning the Baltic into a real Union inland waterway surrounded by EU members in the Baltic countries, Poland, and Germany. Russia would not be a member, but it would be bound to the Union by many political and economic ties. Von Kyaw reminded his listeners that Germany had recently helped Finland to get into the Union. The Finns had declared in Brussels that they would walk out of the membership negotiations unless the Nordic agricultural model was accepted as part of the membership agreement. The Germans intervened at the time and talked the EU into approving the agreement. Von Kyaw said that he views EU membership as being of both economic and political benefit to Finns. According to him, it is very hard in present-day Europe to solve problems any more at the national level. "If anyone thinks that Finland's membership in the EU will resolve all of Finland's problems quickly, he is mistaken," von Kyaw, however, noted. Von Kyaw said that he believes the EU is progressing toward a monetary union, a common currency, and a central bank, among other things, in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty, his own countrymen's doubts notwithstanding. According to the German ambassador, "in the long run," the Union may also move toward a common defense policy. Finland can stick to its own security policy line "under the present circumstances." The EU will decide on its new defense policy approaches in 1996 and Finland, in von Kyaw's opinion, can at that time "present its own view of defense and get the Union to move in a favorable direction." Finland May Lose Commissioner's Seat Germany wants to intensively tighten up the Union. Von Kyaw said that the administrative organs in Brussels must be made more effective at that time. This, among other things, means that the present number of EU Commission members will be reduced. The ambassador to the EU did not specify the number of commissioners Germany is aiming for. The chief German Government parties have earlier talked of 10 commissioners, in which event Finland, among others, would lose its commissioner. Germany would also like to endow majority decisions at ministerial meetings with more authority and increase the EU Parliament's legislative powers.
