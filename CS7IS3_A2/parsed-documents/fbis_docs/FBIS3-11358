The Salvadoran TSE, for the past two years and plus days since it was installed, after being born to the country's juridical life as a result of the constitutional reforms stemming from the peace agreements about which we all know, has worked very arduously to reach this day when we, the TSE magistrates and all the personnel working in it, feel very pleased. We feel very pleased for having delivered to our country, because we have worked arduously in a clean and honest effort to ensure the obtained results are also the result of a free and just election, very clean and honest. Your presence reaffirms, based on the expressions we heard on this day, that we did things well, that we did not fail our homeland. Behind that backdrop, we will proceed in this plain but solemn ceremony for our country's life, because we think this 20 March will go down in the history of not only El Salvador or America but of the entire world, because we want to be an example for the world. To not tire you, we will proceed with the core of this ceremony. We will start to give results shortly of the various vote count certificates of the Voting Table Boards and a few of the Municipal Electoral Boards that we are receiving. I know we are all impatient to learn about those results. They will arrive. Let's wait for a moment to allow the company that specializes in computer sciences which we have hired to develop what we all want to see through the computer program; in fact, this will be the reflection of the verdict of the Salvadoran people. This will install the authorities who managed to win the Salvadorans' will and trust to consolidate democracy in our country and the much- longed for peace which we know has arrived for all Salvadorans. Thank you very much.
