He introduces the recording by saying: "The press center of the Air Force of the Russian Defense Ministry is on the air. A methodological conference for generals and officers has taken place at the main staff of the air force. It was addressed by Air Force Colonel General Petr Deynekin, commander in chief of the Russian Air Force. A special section of his address was devoted to the tasks of the Russian air force in 1994 and the prospects for its further development. The main thing for the air force, its commander in chief stressed, is to maintain battle readiness and security at a level which guarantees fulfillment of the tasks of the Russian Federation's military doctrine. The major task of the Russian Air Force for 1994 is creating air force groups in operational-strategic sectors which have become dangerous, improving the combat, mobilization, operational, and professional training of personnel and reducing the effective combat and numerical strength to the set levels while simultaneously achieving optimum ratios between combat and support constituents in the structure of the air force. "Russia's Air Force has been enlarged by a new air component. By decision of Russia's president and in accordance with the order of the defense minister the frontline air force [frontovaya aviatsiya] has been set up. The decision to set up this component was made in line with Russia's new military doctrine which was announced in November last year. The frontline air force will consist of 70 percent of MiG-29 and Su-27 combat aircraft and also several types of fighter-bombers who now are part of the air force of Russia's Defense Ministry. The frontline air force will be subordinated to the command formed on the basis of the air force staff of the Moscow military district. Air Force Lieutenant General Nikolay Antoshkin has been appointed commander of the frontline air force".
