FBIS4-53723 "dreas099_d_94021" FBIS-EAS-94-099 Daily Report 23 May 1994 South Korea Foreign Ministry Denies Report on Russian Subs Foreign Ministry Denies Report on Russian Subs SK2305121294 Seoul YONHAP in English 1132 GMT 23 May 94 SK2305121294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry on Monday denied as "not factual" the recent claim by a British military expert that the discarded submarines bought by North Korea may be used for military purposes. An article written by a British international naval forces expert and that appeared in the recently published "Jane's Warships, '94- '95," alleged that North Korea has purchased 40 submarines from Russia and that there is the danger of the submarines being used for military purposes in North Korea. "We have asked Russia about the claim through our consulate general in Vladivostok and Russian authorities said there is no such danger at all," a ministry official said. Russia, he said, explained they had sold 12 discarded submarines, instead of 40 as claimed by Jane's, to North Korea, and only one of them has actually been delivered to Pyongyang. Even this one submarine has no way but to be used as scrap because the Russian military had removed from the submarine all those parts that could be used militarily, the official said.
