FR940317-1-00179 FR940317-1-00015 The general and over-arching responsibilities for park management by NPS may be modified by specific direction in individual enabling legislation and proclamations. The individual statutes and proclamations for some units of the national park system make it clear that the units were established to provide visitors with natural quiet, an opportunity for solitude, and other attributes that are not necessarily compatible with the noise of commercial air tour sightseeing flights. Some people simply find commercial sightseeing tours over parks inappropriate and incompatible with protection of certain park values and resources. On the other hand, a commercial air tour may provide an opportunity for people to see some park resources in ways not otherwise attainable. As is pointed out in the Management Policies (NPS 1988): Over the years, legislative and administrative actions have been taking place that have brought some measure of change to these components of our national parks. Such actions impact park resources, yet they are not necessarily deemed to have impaired resources for the enjoyment of future generations. Whether an individual action is or is not an ``impairment'' is a management determination based on NPS policy. In reaching it, the manager should consider such factors as the spatial and temporal extent of the impacts, the resources being impacted and their ability to adjust to those impacts, the relation of the impacted resources to other park resources, and the cumulative as well as the individual effects. Both physical resources, such as wildlife or geologic features or cultural resources, and intangible values, such as natural quiet solitude, and the experience of wilderness, can be impaired. Impacts to Parks In the case of commercial air tour sightseeing flights operating over and near units of the national park system, the NPS believes that significant park resources are being impaired in some units. Managers of almost one-third of national park system units perceive a problem with some aspect of already existing aircraft overflights. The sound of aircraft is regarded as the primary impact. A survey of park managers confirmed that mechanical noise is among the more serious problems in parks and aircraft noise is the most prominent among these. The perception of noise and adverse effects in units of the national park system may be related to the fact that parks tend to be quieter places in general and that typical sources of noise found in urban and suburban settings are absent in most parks. The potential exists for impairment of park resources and values by the noise and visual intrusion associated with commercial air tour/sightseeing operations in other units where the air tour sightseeing industry is not yet established or developed. Given the changes in our population distribution, patterns of use of our national parks, and other factors related to transportation, it is no longer sufficient for park managers to consider strategies and actions solely within park boundaries to protect parks and their resources. Overflights are a case in point. Most overflights of units of the national park system begin and end at airports outside parks; the attractions the overflights offer are the resources of the parks themselves. Technically, the park overflight passenger is not a park visitor even though there may be significant adverse effects from noise on the park. In recognition of this fact, the FAA and the NPS are working more closely to use the FAA's plenary authority for regulation of aviation in support of NPS management objectives. FAA Authorities The FAA has broad authority and responsibility to regulate the operation of aircraft and the use of the navigable airspace, and to establish safety standards for and regulate the certification of airmen, aircraft, and air carriers. (Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (FAAct), Section 307(a) and (c); Title VI.) The FAAct provides guidance to the Administrator in carrying out this responsibility. Section 102 of the FAAct states that the Administrator will consider the public interest to include among other things, regulation for safety and efficiency of both civil and military operations, promotion of the development of civil aviation, fulfillment of the requirements of national defense, and operation of a common system of air traffic control for civil and military aircraft. Section 104 provides to each citizen of the United States a public right of transit through the navigable airspace of the United States. Section 305 directs and authorizes the Administrator to encourage and foster the development of civil aeronautics and air commerce. Section 306 requires the Administrator in exercising his authority, to give full consideration to the requirements of national defense, commercial and general aviation, and to the public right of freedom of transit through the navigable airspace.
