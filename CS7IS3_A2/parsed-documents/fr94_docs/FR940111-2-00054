The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity, mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the area of Violent and Abusive Behavior. (For ordering a copy of Healthy People 2000, see the Section Where To Obtain Additional Information.) Authority This program is authorized under sections 301 and 391 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 and 280b). Program regulations are set forth in title 42 of the CFR part 52. Eligible Applicants Eligible applicants include all non-profit and for-profit organizations. Thus state, tribal, and local health departments and other state, tribal, and local governmental agencies, universities, colleges, research institutions, and other public and private organizations, including small, minority and/or woman-owned businesses are eligible for these research grants. Current holders of CDC injury control research projects are eligible to apply. Availability of Funds Approximately $2.0 million is projected to be available in FY 1994 to fund approximately 5 to 9 grants. The amount of funding actually available may vary and is subject to change. New grant awards will not exceed $300,000 per year (including both direct and indirect costs). Research grant supplements will generally be no more than $75,000 (including both direct and indirect costs). Awards will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period not to exceed 3 years. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress demonstrated by investigators at work-in-progress monitoring workshops, the achievement of workplan milestones reflected in the continuation application, and the availability of Federal funds. In addition, continuation awards will be eligible for increased funding to offset inflationary costs depending upon the availability of funds. Purpose The purposes of this program are: A.
