Some of the Slovak press in Pozsony [Bratislava] wrote that the Hungarians are expected to declare autonomy, that they want to secede, and thus, so to speak, created tension. It seems that a very moderate viewpoint came out at the meeting of Hungarian mayors in Rev-Komarom [Komarno]. In your view, to what extent can this have a positive effect on Hungarian-Slovak relations in the coming months? [Baba] First of all, I wish to stress that the Rev-Komarom meeting was a warning meeting of the Hungarians of Slovakia, the Hungarian political forces of Slovakia. Its aim was to call the attention of the Slovak Government and political circles to the fact that Slovakia has not done what it undertook to do when it was accepted into the Council of Europe. I believe that this warning was successful, and certain political and press circles did indeed create tension artificially, since the political parties of the Hungarians of Slovakia have so far phrased their views and ideas, which are fundamentally important for the existence and future of the Hungarians of Slovakia, quite clearly, and I presume they will continue to do so. For example, education. Everyone speaks of the use of [Hungarian] names, but this is not the only issue; the issues are a proper school system, and the dangers of the reorganization of the administration. This was expressed in Rev-Komarom very moderately, and in a very acceptable tone. I hope that the Slovak Government and the moderate Slovak political circles will receive it that way, too. [Announcer] Thank you, Deputy State Secretary Ivan Baba, for coming to the studio.
