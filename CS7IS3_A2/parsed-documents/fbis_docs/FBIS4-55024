FBIS4-55024 "dreeu089_m_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-089 Daily Report 6 May 1994 THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA UN Calls Part of Serbian Border `Disputable' UN Calls Part of Serbian Border `Disputable' AU0905102094 Skopje PULS in Macedonian 6 May 94 p 14 AU0905102094 Skopje PULS Macedonian BFN [Commentary by Branko Geroski: "Disputable `Mileage' for General Tellefsen"] [Text] Brigadier General Tryggwe Tellefsen, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commander for Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], recently visited Nis, where he had discussions with representatives of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army. The news broadcast by Macedonian Television described the visit as "technical" (as was, allegedly, the character of the meeting), which was why it was not even noted by the press. In a statement for this most powerful of the media, General Tellefsen told the Macedonian public that he had had talks with Serbian officers about some "minor" questions: How to avoid border incidents between the "blue helmets" and Yugoslav troops; how to establish normal communications and exchanges of information between the two sides (in the case, the two sides are the Yugoslav Army and UNPROFOR)... together with other similar "technical" trifles that should not excite the public unduly. Unfortunately, not everything is as straightforward and simple as it may first appear. This is at least because of two unusually "strong" statements made by Mr. Tellefsen. The first is the information about the increased presence of Serbian military formations near the Macedonian-Yugoslav border, allegedly because of some Yugoslav Army maneuvers. The Macedonian public had not been informed about any maneuvers near its border or about the unusual presence of military formations on the other side of the border (this "line" should normally be taken conditionally, because there is no marked or defined line). Nevertheless, being a serious soldier, General Tellefsen does not talk nonsense (God forbid!), which means that there must have been some unusual activities on the other side of the border. Before this statement, the public had probably been generously spared this information. Let us now not split hairs or broach the question about "normal" communications between two states, when one of them violates normal procedures for informing the other whenever it undertakes unusual military activities in the vicinity of its border. This is the Balkans and one should not expect such good manners. The second statement made by Tellefsen is rather more serious: Namely, if we have understood it correctly, the general said that there is around 140 km of Macedonian-Yugoslav border regarded as disputable, militarily speaking. The border, as we know, has not been marked with posts, but there is the practice from former Yugoslavia and there are some administrative borders that Macedonia, at least until this statement was issued, assumed were undisputable -- according to statements made by government officials, there are only a few points on the border that are in dispute. General Tellefsen owes the government and the broader public a serious explanation about the criteria by which 140 km of the northern border (from Kumanovo to the Bulgarian border) is being regarded as disputable. There is no trickery here: General Tellefsen starts out from real problems faced by his soldiers -- incidents and so on. Wherever one happens, it certainly represents a "disputable" space for the UN peacekeepers. The trouble is that in each such individual case the "disputable" nature is defined by the Serbian border guards. So far there has not been a case of the Macedonian border guards or the "blue" observers capturing or kidnapping a Serbian patrol on territory that can be defined as "disputable" by the Macedonian side. The UNPROFOR delegation, General Tellefsen stated, had agreed to a certain "good will" procedure with the representatives of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army in such unfortunate cases. In brief, it was agreed that if the peacekeepers were accidentally to stray into "disputable" (read: Serbian) territory, the Serbian guards should be "gentle" and understanding. Moreover: The Serbian side will inform UNPROFOR about military exercises and maneuvers in order to avoid incidents. (But will anybody officially inform Macedonia?) At first sight, it is good that some kind of procedure has been established to avoid unnecessary incidents. However, it is possible to view this in another way. Namely, the situation on the territory (these unmarked borders) could remain so for years. During all that time the Macedonian border guards and the "Macedonian" UNPROFOR members will establish certain practices to resolve incidents. With each case, point by point, part after part of the territory that official Macedonia does not see as disputable will be treated as such. All this will be done along these 140 km, which even General Tellefsen regards as disputable. Is this not a dangerous precedent before the future necessary demarcation of the border? This is why we conclude that it would have been an elementary rule to have at least the formal presence of a representative of the Macedonian Government there. General Tellefsen could have independently informed his Serbian collocutors about his units, have any kind of fruitful conversations, even about the mentioned incidents, but the moment the Macedonian-Yugoslav border was mentioned and treated as partly "disputable," the subject unquestionably became political. The discussions of issues of such a kind without the presence of Macedonian representatives is a weird gesture, if not more than that. Nevertheless, let us be realistic: General Tellefsen is a soldier. The man has real problems on the ground and that is why his conduct is militarily pragmatic. The problems, or at least so it seems, have been solved. The general has no strict obligation to understand our sensitivities when the border is at stake or to demonstrate good manners in front of his good hosts. The problem is that the Defense Ministry did not react, and official Macedonia did not react. Not for the sake of unnecessary quarreling with UNPROFOR (God forbid!) but to make it clear that neither directly, nor "military" or "technically," can our borders be discussed without our presence. The UNPROFOR peacekeepers are staying in Macedonia without any official arrangement, and our requests for a definition of the special mandate of the forces in Macedonia have been repeatedly ignored. All of this can be considered as of minor importance, because what really matters is the peace mission. However, that is not a good enough reason for the lack of official contacts with Macedonia in this case. There still remains the statement that half of our northern border is disputable and it really will be most typical if it remains hanging over us in this way.
