FR940620-0-00056 FR940620-0-00020 33 CFR Part 165 [CGD01&hyph;94&hyph;061] RIN 2115&hyph;AA97 Safety Zone; City of Yonkers, Fourth of July Fireworks, Hudson River, NY and NJ AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for the City of Yonkers Fourth of July fireworks program located northwest of Yonkers Municipal Pier in the Hudson River. This event will take place on July 4, 1994, from 9 p.m. until 10:30 p.m. with a rain date of July 5, 1994, from 9 p.m. until 10:30 p.m., and will temporarily close all waters of the Hudson River within a 300 yard radius of two fireworks barges anchored together approximately 350 yards northwest of Yonkers Municipal Pier in Yonkers, New York. This safety zone will preclude all vessels from transiting this portion of the Hudson River, and is needed to protect the boating public from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding in the area. EFFECTIVE DATES: This rule is effective from 9 p.m. until 10:30 p.m. on July 4, 1994 with a rain date of July 5, 1994 from 9 p.m. until 10:30 p.m., unless terminated sooner by the Captain of the Port, New York. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LT R. Trabocchi, Project Manager, Captain of the Port, New York (212) 668&hyph;7933. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The drafters of this notice are LT R. Trabocchi, Project Manager, Captain of the Port, New York and CDR J. Astley, Project Attorney, First Coast Guard District, Legal Office. Regulatory History Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective less than 30 days after Federal Register publication. Due to the date this application was received, there was insufficient time to draft and publish a notice of proposed rulemaking that allows for a reasonable comment period prior to the event. There was also insufficient time for publication of this temporary final rule 30 days prior to the event. The delay encountered if normal rulemaking procedures were followed would effectively cancel this event. Cancellation of this event is contrary to public interest. Background and Purpose The City of Yonkers submitted an application to hold a fireworks program in the Hudson River. This regulation establishes a temporary safety zone in all waters of the Hudson River within a 300 yard radius of two fireworks barges anchored together approximately 350 yards northwest of Yonkers Municipal Pier in Yonkers, New York at or near 40 ○56 ’14 ’ ’ N latitude, 73 ○54 ’28 ’ ’ W longitude. This safety zone will preclude all vessels from transiting this portion of the Hudson River and is needed to protect boaters from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding in the area. Regulatory Evaluation This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. Although this regulation will prevent traffic from transiting a portion of the Hudson River, the effect of this regulation will not be significant for several reasons. Due to the fact that the event is limited in duration, that the event is at a late hour, that extensive, advance advisories will be made to the maritime community, and that vessels may safely transit to the west of the safety zone, the impact of this regulation is expected to be minimal.
