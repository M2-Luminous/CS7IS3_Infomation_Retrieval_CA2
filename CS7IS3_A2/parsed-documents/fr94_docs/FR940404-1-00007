FR940404-1-00007 FR940404-1-00002 7 CFR Part 944 [Docket No. FV&hyph;91&hyph;288&hyph;PR] Fruits; Imported (Avocados); Reinstatement and Revision of Avocado Import Maturity Requirements AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would reinstate, with revision, temporarily suspended maturity requirements based on minimum sizes (diameters and weights) and skin color for avocados imported into the United States. These maturity requirements were temporarily suspended to provide the United States Trade Representative (USTR) adequate time to review contemplated changes in the import requirements. This proposed rule would also add an exemption for certain varieties of avocados, and remove the exemption for avocados grown in the southern hemisphere. This proposed rule would also add exemptions from maturity requirements for avocados imported for certain uses. This proposed rule is needed so that imported avocados meet the same minimum size and color maturity requirements as those established for avocados under the Federal marketing order covering Florida avocados, consistent with section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937. DATES: Comments must be received by May 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning this proposed rule. Comments must be sent in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, room 2523&hyph;S, Washington, D.C. 20090&hyph;6456, or by facsimile at 202&hyph;720&hyph;5698. Comments should reference the docket number and the date and page number of this issue of the Federal Register and will be available for public inspection in the Office of the Docket Clerk during regular business hours. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Caroline C. Thorpe, Marketing Specialist, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, room 2523&hyph;S, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456; telephone: 202&hyph;720&hyph;5331; or Aleck J. Jonas, Southeast Marketing Field Office, USDA/AMS, P.O. Box 2276, Winter Haven, Florida 33883; telephone: 813&hyph;299&hyph;4770. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This proposed rule is issued under section 8e (7 U.S.C. section 608e&hyph;1) of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. Section 8e of the Act provides that whenever specified commodities, including avocados, are regulated under a Federal marketing order, imports of these commodities into the United States are prohibited unless they meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements as those in effect for domestically produced commodities. The Secretary has determined that minimum weight and diameter maturity import requirements for avocados imported into the United States should be the same as such requirements applied to avocados grown in Florida under Marketing Order No. 915 (7 CFR part 915), hereinafter referred to as the order. The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. This proposed rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. Import regulations issued under the Act are based on those established under Federal marketing orders. There are about 20 avocado importers who would be subject to the proposed avocado import maturity requirements. Small agricultural service firms, which include importers, have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. A majority of these importers may be classified as small entities.
