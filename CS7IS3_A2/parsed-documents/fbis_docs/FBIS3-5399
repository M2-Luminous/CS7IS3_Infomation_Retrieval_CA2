"The residence of Koreans in Sakhalin is attributable to the Japanese imperialists who illegally occupied Korea and forcibly took Koreans there by issuing the unlawful `general mobilization order', drove them hard and left them there", he noted, and went on: "The problem of the Koreans taken to the Far East of Russia by the Japanese imperialists is not confined to over 40,000 Koreans now residing in Sakhalin. It can be solved only when the Japanese Government sincerely apologizes and makes post-war compensations to the entire Koreans living scattered all over the territory of the former Soviet Union. "We Koreans in Russia join all other Koreans living in the territory of the former Soviet Union in strongly opposing the sinister and crafty scheme of the South Korean and Japanese authorities to move our fellow countrymen to South Korea we will wage a vigorous struggle for defence of our national dignity and interests."
