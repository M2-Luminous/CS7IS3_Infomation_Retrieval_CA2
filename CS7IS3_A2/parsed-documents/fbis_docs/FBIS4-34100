The pensioners entered the premises early in the morning. Then they urged the administrative personnel to drop what they were doing and join their protest against the possible transfer of the institute to the nation. Interior Security Secretary Brigadier Andres Antonietti and Police Chief Superintendent General Omar Abdala, who came to the institute to learn what was going on, ordered the police to evict the protesting pensioners, who left without resistance but did shout, chant, and hurl insults. The federal trustee, meanwhile, has been broadcasting a public message stating that the provincial pension fund is running a deficit of 5 million pesos per month. The message says the government could order the construction of many infrastructure projects in one year with that money. The message also says pensioners will not have their acquired rights trimmed if the service is transferred to the nation. Resignation in Catamarca Catamarca (TELAM) -- Yesterday, Governor Arnoldo Castillo said Economy Ministry Aldo Nieva resigned because of the provincial decision to transfer the social security system to the nation. Nieva was at his post for only 60 days, but from the very first he opposed the transfer of the Social Security Institute to the nation. Alert in Entre Rios Parana (TELAM) -- The Entre Rios Civil Servants Association (ATE) has declared a state of maximum alert given the possible provincial decision to transfer the local pension fund to the nation. The union issued a communique saying that in view of "the imminent risk of the transfer of our pension fund, it is necessary to immediately coordinate resistance actions with pensioner associations and sister organizations." Provincial Governor Mario Moine said "for the time being, we have not made a decision to transfer" the pension fund. Pensioner associations, however, have demanded a clear definition of the funds' future. Cordoba Opposed Cordoba -- Economy Ministry Jorge Caminotti said "the province is not thinking of surrendering its pension fund" despite pressure from the national government to transfer. He said the nation has promised to respect pensioners' acquired rights if the fund is transferred, but it has not made any promises about people who will retire from now on. Caminotti said "for us, the point is not negotiable. This is because in Cordoba, legal contributions and retentions have always been correctly paid. We take into account the entire salary, and not just half of it, as is customary in other jurisdictions." Caminotti added: "This means we are not ready to put people who have made sacrifices for many years on an equal level with people who have not fulfilled their obligations." Caminotti recalled that when the province told the nation about the need to have different treatment for new pensioners, "the national government harshly rejected our proposal. For us, the transfer involves a very important injustice, which we are not ready to accept."
