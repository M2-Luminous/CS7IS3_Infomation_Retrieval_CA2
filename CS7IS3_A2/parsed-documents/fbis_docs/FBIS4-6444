Macaspac] [Text] The country is now officially bound by two tax treaties with India and Spain, Executive Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr. said. Guingona said the Philippine Senate, the country's treaty- ratifying body, has already given its concurrence to two conventions entered into by the Ramos government with the two countries. The agreements involve the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of "fiscal evasion" with respect to taxes and income. The Senate's concurrence was contained in Resolution Nos. 69 and 70, which were passed by the Senate before it adjourned for the Lenten season, Guingona said. The RP [Republic of the Philippines]-Spain Convention and the RP-India Convention were entered into and signed by the respective representatives of the two governments in Manila on 14 March 1989 and 12 February 1990, respectively. Then President Corazon C. Aquino signed the Instrument of Ratification and forwarded the Conventions to the Senate pursuant to Section 21 of Article VII of the Constitution requiring the concurrence of at least two-thirds of the Senate before any international agreement or treaty becomes valid. Among the salient features of the RP-Spain Convention are: -- In the Philippines, only income tax applies, whereas in Spain, the coverage includes income tax on individuals and corporate tax; -- Provisions of taxation of income from dividends, interests and royalties given preferential rates of tax which are designed to stimulate the flow of investments into the country; -- With respect to personal service income, the Convention gives the country of residence the primary right to tax the same while giving the country where the services are rendered mere shares in the revenues under certain conditions; and -- Provision of a mutual agreement procedure on administrative remedies in resolving difficulties in the interpretation of the tax provisions; an exchange of information provision aimed at facilitating cooperation between the two countries in the assessment or collection of, enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes to which the Convention applies. On the other hand, the RP-India Convention's highlights include: -- In the Philippines, only income tax applies while in India, the coverage includes income tax, wage tax, company tax and dividend tax; -- Provisions on taxation of income from dividends, interests and royalties give preferential rates of tax which are designed to stimulate the flow of investments into the country; -- With respect to personal services income, the country of residence is given the primary right to tax the same while the country where the services were rendered are given mere shares in the revenues under certain conditions; and -- It stipulates a mutual agreement procedure on administrative remedies in resolving difficulties in the interpretation of tax provisions; and an exchange program provision aimed at facilitating cooperation between the two countries in the assessment and collection of, enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes to which the Convention applies.
