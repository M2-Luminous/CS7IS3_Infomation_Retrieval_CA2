FBIS4-55162 "dreeu091__a94030" FBIS-EEU-94-091-A Daily Report 10 May 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Cabinet Approves Bill on Bilingual Signs Cabinet Approves Bill on Bilingual Signs AU1105071794 Prague CTK in English 1901 GMT 10 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1105071794 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava, May 10 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government today approved the bill which, in accordance with demands of ethnic minorities and Slovakia's commitments towards the Council of Europe, will introduce the use of bilingual (Slovak-Hungarian) geographical signs in regions with strong Hungarian minority population. If the law is passed by Parliament, towns and villages in which ethnic minority makes up at least 20 percent of the population will have bilingual signs. Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner told journalists after a cabinet meeting that the law would concern some 560 towns and villages. Their names in the ethnic minority languages would be set down in a special list. Deputy Premier Ivan Simko said that the names had been studied by experts but Hungarian minority parties had not been asked for their views as they would be able to express them in Parliament. The Slovak Parliament rejected the "names law" this January with Hungarian deputies also voting against it because only towns and villages with a 30 percent minority population would have had the right to a bilingual name. There have also been disputes about the very names in the Hungarian, with the Slovak side trying to avoid names reminiscent of the Hungarization of Slovakia in the past century or of Horthy's occupation of southern Slovakia during World War Two. The dispute over the law on names culminated with taking down of signs with the Hungarian names of towns and villages in southern Slovakia last October, ordered by former Minister of Transport and Communications Roman Hofbauer on the basis of a 1990 law which did not allow bilingual signs generally used during the first Czechoslovak Republic. The Council of Europe recommended that the Slovak Republic settle the dispute by legislative means. Pittner said today that the bill approved by the government met the demands set by the Council of Europe and corresponded to the Slovak Constitution. The Slovak Government also complied with the demands of the half-million Hungarian minority last week, when it approved the bill enabling ethnic minority members to use first names and surnames in their original form. Hungarian women would not have to add the Slovak -ova suffix to their surnames. The passage of such a bill, which is to be approved by Parliament, is one of Slovakia's most important commitments towards the Council of Europe. The fulfillment of these commitments is to be assessed by the CE Secretariat at its meeting on May 17 in Warsaw.
