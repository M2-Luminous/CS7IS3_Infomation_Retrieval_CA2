The aide welcomed Russia's preparedness to send such force to Nagorno-Karabakh. Addressing a briefing in Yerevan, Zurabyan said that today Russia is the only state which is prepared to take such a step and "it is obvious that Russia shows resoluteness". He also did not rule out the possibility of the arrival to the region shortly of Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev to continue the talks and achieve a truce. The aide believes the by the moment Azerbaijan exhausted all its reserves during the recent large-scale offensive at the Karabakh front which the country launched December 18 [sentence as received]. Baku, he said, only seized the settlement of Goradiz at the expense of many casualties. At the present stage Azerbaijan has sustained another defeat, said the aide. He believes this could also be described as a defeat of the policy to settle the Karabakh conflict by the use of force. Zurabyan believes that now there are all prospects for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. He stressed the importance of the meeting in Moscow February 18 of the defence ministers of Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh. The protocol signed during the meeting, he said, provides for the establishment of truce in Karabakh and the discussion of further political steps. The concept has always served as a basis for the Armenia leadership stance, said Zurabyan. He said the frontline is to be fixed, after which the conflicting sides are to disengage the troops to 10-15 kilometers of the contact line. Next it is planned to create joint monitoring groups which will be deployed along the front perimeter and will act under the control of the joint chiefs of staff. The agreement does not provide the site for the withdrawn troops from the occupied territories. If the mechanism works, said Zurabyan, we shall have a guaranteed and lasting truce. And then the question could be raised about a four-partite summit meeting which will discuss political aspects of the Karabakh problem. Speaking about the relations between Armenia and Georgia, Zurabyan said that no matter what, they are normal and both sides believe that only joint efforts can help them overcome the crisis. The problem is related to the political situation in Georgia, he said, which is on the brink of chaos now. The explosions at the railway on March 2 indicates that the Georgian leadership does keep the situation under full control. The plenipotentiary envoy of the Russian president, the head of the peace mission for settlement in Karabakh Vladimir Kazimirov who has recently visited Yerevan and Baku, told Interfax that until the warring sides in Karabakh are not separated, any agreement on ceasefire "risks to remain just a paper". In his opinion, the withdrawal of armed units for distance inaccessible for artillery fire can be the only guarantee of ceasefire in the region. He noted that so far this condition had not yet been met, and "sporadic violations of truce continue to take place". The Russian envoy also informed that after the withdrawal 30 flexible groups of the Russian Army observers will be deployed in the "separation strip". These groups will also include representatives of the warring sides. "Only in that case it would be possible to objectively judge which of the sides committed this or that violation", Kazimirov emphasized. The Russian Deputy Defense Minister, Colonel-General Georgiy Kondratyev [name as received] who was also in Yerevan and Baku told Interfax that on Thursday he had received from the military command of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh a response to proposals of the Russian side on the settlement of the conflict. (The warring sides were offered to proceed with the ceasefire process, to withdraw to agreed regions heavy weapons within March 2- 5 and to mutually separate troops in the Mardakert and Fizuli directions - IF). According to the general, Armenia and Nagorno- Karabakh agreed to accept these proposals on the condition that Azerbaijan does the same. However Azerbaijan, he said, agreed to just continue the process of ceasefire and considered it unacceptable to withdraw arms and troops to regions determined beforehand, because Armenian units are located on the occupied territories of the republic. Kondratyev stated that if the warring sides are not separated, Russian officers will not be sent "under fire". "If the sides do not fulfil the conditions of the protocol, then let them fight until the victorious end", he said.
