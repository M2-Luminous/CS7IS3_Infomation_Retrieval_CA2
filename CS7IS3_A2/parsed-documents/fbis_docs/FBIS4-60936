Tolerated at the time of the declaration of the country's independence in August 1991, the opposition now seems completely drained. The Birlik movement (nationalist Unity movement), which organized mass demonstrations, was banned in February 1993; the Erk party (whose leader obtained 12 percent of the votes in the 1991 presidential election) has not been officially "registered" since last October. One is now operating from Moscow and the other from Turkey. The last eight prominent members of the Erk party still in Uzbekistan, including Otanazar Aripov, the movement's spokesman and secretary, were arrested at the beginning of March and have since disappeared. Francois Mitterrand, who has just completed a visit to Uzbekistan on Wednesday, made his little speech on human rights, stating in Tashkent that "the right to criticize is the precondition for social, economic, and cultural progress." To this Islam Karimov replied that it was "difficult to change people's mentality" when economic conditions are still bad, and reaffirmed that this country had "emerged from the entrails of a totalitarian system," of which he, as a former apparatchik, was the instrument. President Karimov in particular brandished the horrible spectacle of neighboring Tajikistan, where the conflict between the former communist government and an armed Islamic opposition ended in a bloodbath. The fact remains that the methods of the former leader of the Communist Party, who became president of this Central Asian country of 20 million inhabitants, are scarcely different from those of the former KGB. At least four prominent members of the opposition have been beaten up, some very seriously, by the Uzbek internal security forces in the space of a year. On the occasion of the visit by his "friend" Francois Mitterrand, the Uzbek president announced that parliamentary elections "which he had promised but which had not been mentioned for months" would take place "before the end of the year." However, in view of the turn things have taken, it is unlikely that the two main opposition parties, now in exile, will be allowed to put forward candidates. Only the former Communist Party (rechristened Democratic People's Party), of which Islam Karimov is the leader, and the two parties recently created at his instigation, are "officially registered."
