This time we are interviewing Istvan Csurka, cochairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP]. [Szombathy] On what points does the MIEP's program differ markedly from the goals of other national conservative forces? [Csurka] The major difference is on the economy. We can clearly see that the Antall government is responsible for the current situation to the extent that it did not change the 20-year-old economic and financial program of the communist nomenclature, which had been based on the constant centralization of funds and restrictions because it had to pay the interest [on foreign loans]. The economic policy of the government led by the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] was a direct continuation of the budget plans of the communists and reform-communists. The implementation of this is very interesting: Formally, the government is in power and the finance ministers -- who for the most part have not been replaced in this cycle without reason -- dictate, but the processes in the financial administration and the banks are all in communist or liberal hands. Therefore, it cannot be claimed that the national forces or the government was in power between 1990 and 1994. The MIEP wishes to change this situation, as this is where order has to be made first. While foreigners are rooting about in our pockets we cannot talk about independent Hungarian policies. The MIEP also differs in that it wants justice by further prosecuting the crimes of the past. We also want firmly to represent the national interests in culture and the dissemination of information. The current work of the public service media is intolerable, and I am saying this in spite of the fact that my party supports the two deputy chairmen leaders [of radio and television] who were appointed by the president but who are under concerted attack. A nation has the right to direct its own media and culture. [Szombathy] What was the reason for your suggestion that those who support the national side should form a forum before the elections? To what extent do you share the MDF's fear of the left-wing danger? [Csurka] The real danger is that of ignorance, rather than that of the left wing. The only reason we can talk about a left- wing danger is that a section of the masses is uninformed: They clearly place the responsibility on the national Christian- conservative forces, including the least involved MIEP, which was founded by people who had left the MDF. Dissatisfied people living in difficult conditions believe the fairy-tale that the left wing will bring back the golden age of [former Communist leader] Kadar, which never existed. This gross exaggeration is being hammered into people by the press, the radio, the television, and NEPSZABADSAG. Publicity should be made even before the first round of the elections, which would explosively give the light of recognition to people who are living in the dark. A pan-national conference would be suitable for this with a statement and with the participation of parties and mainly intellectuals. It is a misinterpretation of my words to say that I have come closer to the MDF through this: I have opened up toward all good intentions, and an example of this is my joint appearance with Jozsef Torgyan [chairman of the Independent Smallholders Party]. I am expecting the participants of the Szarszo meeting [August 1993], Hungarians living abroad, and smallholders to come to the conference. I do not want this event to be seen as a MIEP initiative. [Szombathy] How do you see you party's numerical chances at the elections? [Csurka] The MIEP has a good chance because it has massive lists in Budapest and in Pest county, and we have great popularity in the central parts of the country. This will certainly be enough to get into Parliament, and our individual candidates give us hope for a good result. We can feel people's quiet sympathy. [Szombathy] Are you preparing for electoral cooperation between the two rounds of the elections? [Csurka] Naturally. We will try to enter negotiations on this issue sensibly and honestly. We will look at who has the best chance: We will give and take. Give as good as one gets. We are willing to make an agreement with all national Christian parties that turn to us with honesty. [Szombathy] What role do you envisage for the MIEP in the next Parliament? [Csurka] It would be distasteful for us also to get involved in the pre-bargaining on ministerial chairs and coalition conditions. The MIEP's task is to be a compass for national Christian conservative forces. Guarantees have to be created that this conservative coalition would never lean toward the left, will never make pacts, and will not fall into marriages of convenience. [Szombathy] If we can believe the opinion polls, we can expect a social-liberal victory. What will the MIEP do in such a situation? [Csurka] One cannot believe opinion polls, and this has to be clearly stated once and for all. These surveys serve party propaganda purposes. However, should we be so unfortunate as for this to happen, then the MIEP will not despair: It will continue its consistent nation-organizing work.
