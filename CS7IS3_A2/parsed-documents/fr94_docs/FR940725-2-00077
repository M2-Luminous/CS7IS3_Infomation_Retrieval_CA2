AGENCY: Notice of intent to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement and announcement of a period during which written comments regarding the scope of the environmental impact statement (EIS) analysis will be received.

As required by the New Mexico State Program, Salt River Project (SRP) has submitted an administratively complete permit application for the proposed surface coal mine. The permit application contains life-of-mine information that the Department of the Interior will use to evaluate alternative actions in the EIS and will assist the Department in making decisions on the surface coal mining operation northwest of Quemado, New Mexico and in the State of Arizona. OSM requests that other agencies and the public submit written comments or statements to it concerning the scope of the EIS analysis. DATES: Written comments or statements concerning the scope of the EIS will be accepted through September 15, 1994, at the location given under ADDRESSES. ADDRESSES: Written comments or statements concerning the scope of the EIS should be mailed or hand delivered to Russell F. Price, Acting Assistant Director, Attn: Billie E.

Clark, Jr., Chief, Federal and Indian Permitting Branch, at the Denver, Colorado, location giver under ADDRESSES (telephone: 303&hyph;672&hyph;5604). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: SRP's proposed Fence Lake Mine consists of Federal, State and private coal leases situated on approximately 18,000 acres northwest of Quemado, New Mexico. The Federal Coal Leases Nos. are NMNM 78371 and NMNM 86717. The proposed mine would remove approximately 80 million tons of coal, by surface methods, over the 47 year life-of-mine. Approximately 1.8 million tons of coal would be removed per year through year 28 with about 3 million tons of coal per year being removed from year 29 through year 40. The project described in the application also includes a proposed 45-mile railroad spur that would be constructed west from the mine to supply coal to the existing Coronado Generating Station, located approximately 6 miles from St. Johns, Arizona. OSM will prepare the supplemental EIS, which will evaluate alternative actions that the Department could take on Federal decisions related to this project. In accordance with the New Mexico State Program the New Mexico Mining and Minerals Department must take permitting actions on the proposed surface coal mining operation within the State of New Mexico. The major alternative actions thus far identified for consideration are approval of the mining plan and permit application with such conditions, if any, as would be necessary to assure it compliance with requirements of the Surface mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, its implementing regulations, and other Federal laws; disapproval of the mining plan and permit application; and no action. Other alternative actions may be identified based on comments received by OSM regarding the scope of the supplemental EIS analysis. OSM is requesting that any interested party submit written comments or statements regarding the scope of the supplemental EIS. Comments/statements regarding the scope of the supplemental EIS. Comments/statements received by OSM will assist that agency in gathering information and further defining existing issues or identifying new issues or concerns that the supplemental EIS should address. Public meetings will be held in the vicinity of the proposed Fence Lake surface coal mining operation to allow presentation of oral comments and statements prior to the closing of the scoping comment period. Actual times and locations of these meetings will be announced in local newspapers at a later date. Dated: July 20, 1994. Brent Wahlquist, Assistant Director, Reclamation and Regulatory Policy.
