He will replace Belgian Lieutenant General Francis Briquemont, who asked to be relieved of his duties after criticising the UN handling of the crisis. A formal UN announcement was expected later today, said the Ministry of Defence. Gen Briquemont, 58, who has led the UN protection force [UNPROFOR] since last July, has repeatedly expressed frustration with his mandate and the lack of support. He attacked the UN Security Council last week for setting lofty goals while failing to send adequate numbers of troops to carry them out. "There is a fantastic gap between all these Security Council resolutions and the means available to execute them," he said. He stressed that he needed at least 10,000 fresh troops to carry out resolutions, including one to set up "safe areas" around Muslim enclaves threatened by Bosnian Serb forces. Gen Rose, 53, will command some 12,000 troops from a dozen different nations in a humanitarian operation that has become increasingly difficult to maintain because of the attitude of all three warring factions. Aid convoys have been deliberately halted and both the British and French Governments have hinted they might pull out this spring if peace is not reached. Gen Rose, who is currently commander of the UK Field Army, will be based at the UNPROFOR headquarters at Kiseljak midway between Sarajevo and the main UK base at Vitez. He will be responsible to the overall commander of UN forces across the former Yugoslavia, French General Jean Cot. Gen Rose, who was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards in 1964, takes over command at a time when the British are represented by the Coldstreams. The general has spent a significant part of his Army career working undercover with the elite SAS. He commanded 22 SAS Regiment from 1979 to 1982 through the Iranian Embassy siege crisis and the Falklands conflict. He masterminded the daring SAS behind-the-lines operations in the Falklands and played a key role in negotiating an end to the fighting with Argentine commanders. For more than a week before the Argentine surrender, he directed a vital operation to set up direct lines of communication with the Argentine commander General Menendez and his staff. Once the Argentines agreed to lay down their arms, he flew by helicopter into Port Stanley for final negotiations with Gen Menendez. Gen Rose's SAS experience included operations in Northern Ireland and two years after the Falklands conflict he was appointed to the command of 39 Infantry Brigade in Belfast. He was then appointed Director Special Forces as the overall head of the SAS and the Royal Marines' maritime equivalent the Special Boat Service. On promotion to general, he took command of the Army's North-East District and 2nd Infantry Division. He was most recently commandant of the Army Staff College in Camberley, Surrey, before taking up his current appointment as commander of the UK Field Army.
