Security Council to adopt an effective resolution in order to ensure security on the Israeli-held territories, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Demurin said. Speaking at a news briefing in Moscow on Thursday, Demurin said that the world community should pay attention to the idea of international protection of civilians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The alarming situation following the barbaric crime committed by an Israeli extremist in Hebron forces Russia to take further active steps in order to help overcome the current crisis in the endangered peace process. The lack of progress in the Middle East talks shows that there is the need to give the process of reconciliation between the Arabs and Israelis a new international impetus, Demurin said. "The second plenary session of the Madrid conference on the Middle East at the foreign minister level could become such an impulse. As for the immediate future, Russia stands for the continuation of bilateral talks which could be held where it is convenient for their participants," the spokesman said.
