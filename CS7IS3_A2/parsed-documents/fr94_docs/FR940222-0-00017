FR940222-0-00017 FR940222-0-00005 The FAA cannot predict the results of the required inspections, especially as the airplanes continue to age. Approximately 61 percent of the airplanes inspected in accordance with Twin Commander SB No. 208 (AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;09) had no significant spar cap corrosion, 24 percent had less than 50 percent of the established corrosion service limits, and 13 percent had between 50 to 100 percent of the established corrosion service limits. Less than 3 percent of the airplanes exceeded the established corrosion service limits. Based on an expected average remaining operating life of 20, 25, or 30 years per affected airplane (depending on the model), the incremental annualized compliance cost would be: •If only repetitively inspecting the spar cap is necessary for airplanes with an average operating life of 20 years: $904 to $7,239 incremental annualized cost (depending on the airplane model and frequency of inspection, and using a 7 percent interest rate); •If only repetitively inspecting the spar cap is necessary for airplanes with an average operating life of 25 years: $1,195 to $7,176 incremental annualized cost (depending on the airplane model and frequency of inspection, and using a 7 percent interest rate); •If only repetitively inspecting the spar cap is necessary for airplanes with an average operating life of 30 years: $1,290 to $7,495 incremental annualized cost (depending on the airplane model and frequency of inspection, and using a 7 percent interest rate); •If replacing the spar cap is necessary for airplanes with an average operating life of 20 years: approximately $9,675 incremental annualized cost (using a 7 percent interest rate) if the spar cap is replaced during the first inspection; •If replacing the spar cap is necessary for airplanes with an average operating life of 25 years: approximately $8,719 incremental annualized cost (using a 7 percent interest rate) if the spar cap is replaced during the first inspection; and •If replacing the spar cap is necessary for airplanes with an average operating life of 30 years: approximately $8,145 incremental annualized cost (using a 7 percent interest rate) if the spar cap is replaced during the first inspection. The required AD's from Dockets No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;26&hyph;AD (for Model 500S and 690B), No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;38&hyph;AD (for Models 685, 690, 690A, and 690B), and No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;43&hyph;AD (for Models 500S, 500U, 680FL, 680FL(P), 680W, and 681) will also affect certain airplanes included in this AD. The compliance costs of these other required AD's will add to the cost discussed above. However, replacing the spar cap would only be required once, so the $100,000 replacement cost, if required, would be a one-time action. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily or disproportionally burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires government agencies to determine whether rules would have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and, in cases where they would, conduct a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in which alternatives to the rule are considered. FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, outlines FAA procedures and criteria for complying with the RFA. Small entities are defined as small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated or airports operated by small governmental jurisdictions. The 562 U.S.-registered airplanes affected by this AD are owned according to the following breakdown: 92 by individuals, 7 by U.S. government agencies, 20 by states or local governments, and 443 by other entities. Twenty seven entities each own more than one of the affected airplanes: One owns 7, four own 5 each, three own 3 each and nineteen own 2 each. The FAA cannot determine the sizes of all the affected non-individual owner entities nor the relative significance of the costs estimated above. Because of these uncertainties, no cost thresholds for significant economic impact can be reasonably determined. Based on the possibility that this AD could have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, the FAA conducted a regulatory flexibility analysis. A copy of this analysis may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ``ADDRESSES ''. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979) because of substantial public interest; and, (3) may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The FAA has conducted an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Analysis and has considered alternatives to this action that could minimize the impact on small entities. A copy of this analysis may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . After careful consideration, the FAA has determined that the required action is the best course to achieve the safety objective of returning the airplane to this original certification level of safety.

Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation of part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2.
