The party's Supreme Council met Monday morning, under the presidency of Chairman Yi Ki-taek, and made the proposal after agreeing that the inter-Korean summit requires perfect preparations since it presents a historic chance to deal with various national issues including unification and the nuclear problem. Members of the supreme committee also decided to form another organization inside the party to study details of the summit including its agenda. North Korean strongman Kim Il-song, speaking through former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, has expressed his desire to meet South Korean President Kim Yong-sam for an early summit "at any time, any place and without any preconditions." The South's leader has welcomed the offer. The opposition party plans to seek an extraordinary session of the National Assembly to discuss the North Korean nuclear problem and the Seoul-Pyongyang summit. Chairman Yi said before the meeting, "There is no need for me to visit North Korea ahead of President Kim Yong-sam if the inter-Korean summit is pushed ahead with smoothly." North Korea said recently that it would welcome a visit by Yi.
