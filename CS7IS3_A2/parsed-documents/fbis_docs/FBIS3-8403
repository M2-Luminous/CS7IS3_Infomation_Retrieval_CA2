"As a matter of fact the PUNR has to be credited with the change," Ioan Gavra mentioned, "because it is us that have awakened the ruling party to reality, through this reshuffle and through the implementation of the political program. This is the political performance number one, especially that a part of the executive's program belongs to us." Octavian Cozminca, secretary of state, explains in daily ADEVARUL that the government reshuffle was necessary, because there was lack of concordance in the process of reform in some ministries. "I can assure you that the four ministers are competent politicians or technocrats." Corneliu Coposu, president of the Christian Democratic National Peasant Party, told the national radio: "I think this reshuffle has had a negative impact on public opinion, i.e. it is an inconsequential face-lift meant to extend the government's agony. The government has not been consolidated with this reshuffle, it has gained nothing in point of prestige or stability and especially as regards external credibility." Dinu Patriciu, the Liberal Party [PL '93] 1993: "Instead of a parliamentary majority that should back a genuinely reform-oriented government, the minimal solution was chosen of changing some ministers, again in disregard of the Constitution, i.e. without having them heard in the parliament. This proves that the attitude of the PL '93 was justified and we hope our partners in the opposition too, have understood that the talks with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] are not serious, as they are meant only to mark time, with no serious end." Sergiu Cunescu -- the Romanian Social-Democratic Party: "I appreciate the power has understood the necessity of appointing civilians at the head of the Ministries of the Interior and Defence. But we deplore the replacement at the head of the Army of General Spiroiu whom we highly regard." Daily ADEVARUL prints General Niculae Spiroiu's statement that the decision to change him belongs to the PDSR. "I can tell you the Army is under political control." Like President Ion Iliescu announced, General Spiroiu will represent Romania at the NATO Headquarters in Brussels, while Lieutenant-General George Ioan Danescu will remain with the Ministry of the Interior, as the new minister's deputy, thus helping with his experience in the modernization of the Ministry. As regards Petre Ninosu and Paul Teodoru, they too, will assist for a while in the reorganization of the ministries they headed -- justice and transport -- and will then be given other assignments.
