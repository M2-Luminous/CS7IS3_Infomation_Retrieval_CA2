Brazil was the sixth country to sign the protocol, thus reaffirming its commitment to refrain from adopting the death penalty. Amorim said that in addition to strengthening democracy, the protocol ensures peaceful coexistence among countries and respect for human rights. The protocol still requires approval by the Brazilian Congress. The protocol will not become mandatory until the congresses of two-thirds of the OAS member countries have ratified the convention. Amorim said that the Brazilian Constitution states that capital punishment will not be applied in the country except in case of a declared war. He said: "Brazilian legislation is in line with the highest principles of respect for human life and rights." Amorim concluded his speech by lauding OAS Secretary General Baena Soares, noting that his performance "will leave an indelible mark on the history of this hemisphere in terms of his success in promoting democracy and human rights."
