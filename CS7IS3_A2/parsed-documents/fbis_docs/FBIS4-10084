Senator Anselmo Sule, the Radical Party president, stated that the heads of political parties and government authorities discussed the situation in Congress. They also discussed other issues that will become draft bills. When asked about the commission to fight corruption, Sule said: "It has been proposed; there is a preliminary agreement and I believe it will materialize in the next few days. There has been agreement on the need for this for some time now. The commission will be established by decree and will include representatives of all political sectors because it is a nationwide problem that must be tackled by all Chileans. It has yet to be decided what it will do specifically. What it must obviously do is to assess the concrete measures, the procedures, alternatives, methods, and attitudes to be taken to eliminate the possibility of this problem surfacing or worsening." As for the government's draft bills, their precedence will be determined next week. Deputy Gutenberg Martinez, president of the Christian Democratic Party, admitted that disagreements with the opposition in the lower house were also discussed. He commented: "We were all surprised by what happened in the Senate, by the attempt to form an opposition bloc, and by the comments made by senators like Hernan Larrain, in the sense that the Senate will become a sort of opposition trench. We regard the comments by Andres Allamand positive, because they at least suggest that not event the rightist sector is quite certain about the matter. We believe their decisions on constitutional issues and the government's social priorities will allow us to determine the possibilities of a relationship with the rightist sector." Martinez added: "Our sector believes the policy of agreements and consensus regarding important national issues is the policy the Coalition of Parties for Democracy must uphold, but this does not mean we will not detect or reject any maneuver to turn the Senate into an opposition trench."
