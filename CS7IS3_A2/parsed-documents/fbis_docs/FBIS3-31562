The concerted action came after Kofi Annan, the chief of UN peacekeeping operations, said in New York that the United Nations planned to reopen the huge Tuzla airport on March 7. The international community turned its attention to enclaves around Bosnia following the success of a NATO ultimatum, which threatened air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions unless heavy weapons were withdrawn from around Sarajevo by midnight GMT Sunday. "The UN and NATO have decided to strike while the iron is hot" in the wake of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ultimatum on Sarajevo issued on February 9, commented a UN officer here, who declined to be identified. The Tuzla airport, which has been closed by Bosnian Serb gunners since May last year, is scheduled to open March 7, said Annan after meeting with UN member countries involved in the peacekeeping operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. UN troops backed by air support could be used to reopen the airport if necessary following discussions with the parties on the ground, Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has told the Security Council. NATO last month renewed an offer to use its warplanes to end the strangulation of Bosnian Serb-besieged Moslem communities if requested by the United Nations. The million-strong mainly Moslem population of Tuzla, which includes a large minority of refugees fleeing the Bosnian fighting, has been supplied by road convoys alone because of the airport's closure. According to the UN officer here, the Serbs could no longer prevent the airport reopening at Tuzla, and ``NATO planes can overfly Tuzla as they do for Sarajevo, and take out any weapon targeting the airport. "The balance of power has changed, and the Serbs, who have realised that in Sarajevo, would do well to realise it in Tuzla," he added. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, quoted by the TANJUG news agency, hinted Monday that the Serbs were ready to discuss the airport reopening, although he argued that from a humanitarian point of view it was not necessary as road corridors to the town were open. [passage omitted] Road convoys can be stopped "like turning off a tap," according to Tuzla UNHCR chief Robyn Ziebert. "If we could get the necessary convoys through, we wouldn't necessarily need the airport," he said Tuesday. The 2.5 kilometre (1.5 mile) runway has been under the threat of Serb gunners who are on three sides of the airport. On February 1 and 2, about 40 shells exploded inside the airport perimeter. On Monday, as the international community began to single out Tuzla for attention, 17 shells landed just outside. The Swedish peacekeepers, from their observation posts, noted the positions from where the shells were fired but were powerless to riposte. After months of hesitation, the 1,000 Swedish and Danish UN troops stationed near Tuzla began preparing to reopen the airport some nine weeks ago. "Everything is ready so that we can land the first aircraft four days after taking control of the area," said Colonel Bengt Berlin of the Tuzla contingent.
