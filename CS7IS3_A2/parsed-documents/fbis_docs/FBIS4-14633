The head of the Foreign Ministry noted that Canada would assist in integrating Ukraine into the European Community, would help to take the appropriate measures for its accession to the GATT, would support Ukraine in cooperation with the IMF, and would also demand that the issue of support for Ukraine by the international community be examined at a sitting of the "Great Seven."
