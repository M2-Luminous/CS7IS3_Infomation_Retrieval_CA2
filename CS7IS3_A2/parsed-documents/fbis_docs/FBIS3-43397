FBIS3-43397 "drafr004_c_94009" FBIS-AFR-94-004 Document Type:Daily Report 6 Jan 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 6 Jan MB0601124794 MB0601124794 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE CITIZEN Government Unable To 'Govern With a Firm Hand' -- "The government does not seem to have any plan of action for halting the violence in the run-up to the election, being unable to act decisively for fear of ANC [African National Congress] reaction," declares the page 6 editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 4 January. "Is it too much to expect the government to govern with a firm hand until the election decides whether it is put out of office?" "Weakness in that regard is to the disadvantage of both, because, to put it simply, both are held to blame for what is happening and both need to ensure that not only is the playing field levelled, but nobody tries to dig it up or disrupt the decisive election match that will be played on it shortly." THE STAR Self-Defense Units Part of Violence in Townships -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 6 January in a page 12 editorial believes township self-defense units, SDUs, "are part of the problem of violence in the East Rand townships of Katlehong, Vosloorus and Thokoza." THE STAR has established that "internecine warfare between rival SDUs in Katlehong is a factor in the bloodletting in the township. As an ANC official in Katlehong notes, ANC supporters find themselves in conflict with one another. His statement is important for another reason: it repudiates the official mythology that SDUs are apolitical rather than ANC-aligned organisations. The ANC admits that it has to intervene to restructure SDUs in the troubled East Rand townships." THE STAR concludes from the East Rand violence and the ANC admissions that withdrawing the Internal Stability Division from the townships "will aggravate rather than solve the problem, as the Goldstone Commission warned last month." BUSINESS DAY Negotiating Urgency Has 'Dissipated' -- "Constitutional negotiations and the operations of the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] are being conducted in a rather desultory and sloppy manner," says a page 6 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 6 January. The editorial refers to the "arm-twisting between the Freedom Alliance [FA] on one hand and the NP [National Party] and ANC on the other over preconditions for further talks," saying "it seems that we have returned to the phase of 'talks about talks' which, when conducted between the ANC and NP, went on for years. That kind of time is no longer available." "Exacerbating this problem is the fact that almost all the TEC decisions taken in the absence of the Freedom Alliance create new problems and obstacles to a final settlement." The "refreshing sense of urgency" demonstrated by negotiators in November "has all dissipated now." SOWETAN Self-Defense Units 'Banditry' in Townships -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 6 January in a page 6 editorial comments on the "war" among self-defense units on the East Rand, saying the SDUs "quickly deteriorate into armed bandits." It is a tragedy that "they have to do work that the police should be doing," and that "they are not answerable to anybody." It is "laudable" that the ANC is "trying to rein them in," but "the problem has to be tackled at a much deeper level to stop banditry in the name of self defence in the townships."
