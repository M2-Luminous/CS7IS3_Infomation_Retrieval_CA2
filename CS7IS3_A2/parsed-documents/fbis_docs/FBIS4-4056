Addressing a news conference today, Gao Zuozhi, director of the Municipal Economic Commission, invited multi-national companies to invest in such priority industries as automobiles, electronics, meters, new chemicals, new building materials, pharmaceuticals, clothing, food processing, computers, program-controlled switchboards, and integrated circuits. Specifically, he said, Beijing seeks cooperation with multi-national companies and other overseas firms in manufacturing goods with a low consumption of energy, raw materials or water, but with a high added value. Beijing also wishes to cooperate with overseas investors in moving factories in downtown areas to suburbs and undertaking real estate development projects and building service-oriented companies there, he added. Gao also revealed that Beijing has set up a number of major joint ventures with multi-national companies, including the NEC Company of Japan, the Chrysler Company of the United States, the Philips Corporation of the Netherlands and ABB Company of Switzerland. By the end of 1993 manufacturers in Beijing had established 40 major joint ventures with overseas firms, each involving at least 10 million U.S. dollars in foreign investment, he said. These ventures involve 2.08 billion U.S. dollars in total foreign investment, he added.
