This is a statement by Justice Joseph Nerette on the afternoon of 7 April during a news briefing at his home. Hoping to ignore the parliamentary decree restoring President Aristide to his post, Justice Nerette said several times: I am the constitutional president of Haiti. [Begin recording] [Nerette] Once again, I have not tendered my resignation. [Unidentified journalist] For the time being, you consider yourself the president of the Republic of Haiti even though the parliamentarians restored President Aristide to his post? [Nerette] I am the constitutional president of the Republic of Haiti. Do you want me to repeat the same thing again and again? [Journalist] Mr. Nerette.... [Nerette, interrupting] I think that is all, gentlemen. [Journalist] One small question. [Nerette] No, no, not half a question. [Journalist Rotschild Francois] Why [do you make] these statements today when you kept silent for a long time? [Nerette] I have the right to say nothing. Are you contesting my right to say nothing?

[Francois, interrupting] Do you support this initiative by FRAPH, CARENA, MDN, and CCGN to try to establish a new government in the country? [Nerette] I have already said that the country is in danger. They can call on a -- I would even say -- honest, loyal, and worthy citizen.... [Journalist, interrupting] Have they called you? [Nerette] Whether they have or not, I am president. [Francois] But, Mr. Nerette, how can you explain that you are not at the National Palace? [Journalist] Must one be at the National Palace to be president? Namphy was [words indistinct]. He refused to sit at the National Palace. He said that his office is in the barracks [previous six words in Creole: se kay jon nan'k kay li]. You have forgotten all that. [end recording]
