FR941020-1-00002 FR941020-1-00001 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Part 315 RIN 3206&hyph;AG22 Career and Career-Conditional Employment agency: Office of Personnel Management. action: Proposed rule. summary: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposes to revise requirements of the career-conditional employment system concerning reinstatement, career tenure, and probation. Consistent with recommendations of the National Performance Review, these proposals would deregulate and simplify the appointment system. These proposals would drop the time limit on reinstatement eligibility, link career tenure to completion of probation instead of 3 years of service, and clarify probationary period requirements. dates: Comments must be submitted on or before December 19, 1994. addresses: Send or deliver written comments to Leonard R. Klein, Associate Director for Career Entry, Office of Personnel Management, Room 6F08, 1900 E Street NW, Washington, DC 20415 (FAX 202&hyph;606&hyph;2329). for further information contact: Lee Edwards on reinstatement and career tenure. Raleigh Neville on probation. Both may be reached at 202&hyph;606&hyph;0830; FAX 202&hyph;606&hyph;2329. supplementary information: The National Performance Review (NPR) has recommended changes in the way the Government operates. One recommendation was to deregulate and decentralize the personnel system to give agencies more authority over hiring. Consistent with the NPR recommendations, these proposals would simplify the career tenure, probation, and reinstatement aspects of the career-conditional appointment system. A specific NPR recommendation was to abolish the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM). When this was done in December 1993, FPM Chapter 315 was provisionally retained through December 1994 to enable OPM to issue regulations to replace needed instructions found only in the FPM. Rather than transfer existing rules from the FPM to the CFR, OPM proposes to simplify requirements. Career-Conditional Appointment System The Federal career-conditional system is close to 40 years old. Because it was created to meet the needs of another era, many aspects of the system are outdated. For example, major concerns in designing the system were two provisions of the now expired ``Whitten Amendment'' (section 1310 of Pub. L. 82&hyph;253, November 1, 1951). One provision was a Governmentwide ceiling on permanent employees and another was a requirement that appointments be made on a nonpermanent basis. Thus, the length of the career-conditional period was made to be flexible so it could be extended beyond 3 years if the permanent workforce became larger than permitted by law. Today, however, both career and career-conditional employees are counted as permanent, and the idea of a varying service requirement for career tenure no longer fits our framework. Other than the probationary period, there are only two differences between career and career-conditional appointments. First, non-veteran career-conditional employees have a 3-year reinstatement eligibility. Other employees have no time limit. Second, in a reduction in force, career employees who are not serving probation have higher standing than career-conditional employees have.
