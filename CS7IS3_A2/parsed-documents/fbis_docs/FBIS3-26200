At a hearing of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commons, in addition to continuing his attack on the Chinese side, he also distorted facts, used lame arguments, and wantonly attacked some British personalities who are relatively more rational in the Sino-British disputes over constitutional issues. This move by Chris Patten naturally called forth responses from people with breadth of vision, including the abovementioned personalities. Akers-Jones refuted Chris Patten's distortion and slander against him as a "cheap jibe." Percy Craddock even published an article entitled "Patten `Has Got It Wrong' Again" in Hong Kong's SOUTH CHINA SUNDAY MORNING POST. In a cool and rational style, Craddock used facts to clarify Chris Patten's distortion and attacks. The rational response from Percy Craddock is in striking contrast to Chris Patten's character and morals as one who is rude and unreasonable and who fabricates lies. It has provided reference material, which is hard to come by, to help people understand the right and wrong of the Sino-British controversies over constitutional issues. No Consultations With the Chinese Side Before Publishing Chris Patten's Proposals The Joint Declaration states: In order to ensure a smooth transfer of government in Hong Kong in 1997, China and Britain are to "continue their discussions in a friendly spirit and develop the cooperative relationship that already exists between the two Governments over Hong Kong with a view to the effective implementation of the Joint Declaration." In the second half of the transitional period, "there will be need for closer cooperation," and "joint consideration of measures to be adopted for a smooth transition in 1997." However, Chris Patten has gone in the opposite direction. A year and a half have passed since he took up the post as governor of Hong Kong. He has done nothing good to safeguard and maintain Hong Kong's economic prosperity and social stability, but instances of his conspicuous behavior in opposing Sino-British cooperation are numerous. Percy Craddock disclosed that Chris Patten's refusal to consult with the Chinese side on the constitutional reform proposals before making his policy address was his first major move of confrontation with Sino-British cooperation. Facts have shown clearly that there was no consultation with the Chinese side prior to the formulation of the constitutional reform plan,and the plan was published unilaterally despite the admonition and warning of the Chinese side. Percy Craddock has always had reservations toward Chris Patten's refusal to consult with the Chinese in advance and his unilaterally dishing out and implementing a "three violations" constitutional reform package, ignoring the provisions of the Joint Declaration. Proceeding from the interests of Britain, he did not hesitate to criticise this openly. However, instead of making a self-examination, Chris Patten pretended to speak sternly at the Parliament, out of a sense of justice, blaming Percy Craddock, saying that this "is completely untrue, and that whether its was the result of misunderstanding or of other motivations is for Sir Percy to explain in due course." Since he distorted facts and made unfounded counter-charges, Percy Craddock had no alternative but to respond. Quoting a passage from a book he had written, which would be published soon, Percy Craddock pointed out that the Chinese reaction to the "three violations" constitutional reform package dished out by Chris Patten was so violent "because of both the manner and the substance of the proposals. Although they were informed of the substance of the Governor's speech two weeks in advance, their request that they be consulted (which in their eyes probably meant negotiation) before the speech was delivered was rejected." What is especially interesting is that this passage had been "carefully checked" with the Foreign Office as part of the official clearance and had been "accepted." The statements in this passage, which has gone through official British clearance and is officially accepted, are exactly the same as what the Chinese side has said. Chris Patten, being an "intimate friend of the prime minister" and the person who concocted and dished out the "three violations" constitutional reform package, should know better than anyone else. However, he went so far as to deny them and falsely accused the person who spoke the truth as having other "motivations." This can show only that Chris Patten intentionally tried to withhold the truth and to continue deceiving Parliament and the British public in a bid to gain support for his erroneous stand. Recently, Sino-U.S. relations have been improving, China's domestic situation has become more and more favorable, and more and more Hong Kong people have come to understand China's policy toward Hong Kong and have identified themselves with it. On the other hand, Chris Patten's constitutional reform plan has been opposed by more and more Hong Kong people, and has been criticized by industrial and commercial circles and by people with breadth of vision of other circles in Britain. Under such circumstances, Chris Patten, after returning to Britain, indeed had no way to court support in Britain other than to disguise himself, resort to sophistry, and withhold the truth. Chris Patten Deliberately Practices "Three Violations" At the hearing, Chris Patten also said that Percy Craddock had not told him in advance of "the existing political and constitutional settlement," implying that although Percy Craddock knew very well that his constitutional reform plan was one of "three violations," he had no objection. The fact is that everyone knows very well that Percy Craddock does not agree with Chris Patten's abandoning the relevant Sino-British diplomatic agreements and understanding, takes an attitude of reservation toward his constitutional reform plan, opposes open confrontation with Sino-British cooperation, and takes the stand of regarding such confrontation as "the tragedy of Hong Kong." Chris Patten has completely confounded black and white in his attempt to put Percy Craddock in the ranks of those who show support the "three violations" constitutional reform plan. In his article, Percy Craddock said that at that time, he "had no inkling of plans to circumvent existing arrangements and substantially widen the electorate by bringing in a new kind of functional constituency." On the contrary, he explicitly advised Chris Patten: "Given the existing agreements," the British side "has very limited room for maneuver"; "it is dangerous to disregard Chinese objections to any increase in the number of directly elected seats in 1995; and therefore, it is necessary to work within the agreed framework." This is tantamount to clearly and correctly reminding Chris Patten that by no means should he go beyond the agreements and understanding reached with China to make the so-called constitutional reform plan. The Joint Declaration officially came into effect as early as 1985 and the Basic Law also was published long ago. Chris Patten also bragged that he "read the Basic Law more frequently than the Bible." Regarding the agreements and understanding concerned, which were reached by the foreign ministers of the two countries, even if Chris Patten did not know about them in advance, did he ever show any indication or take any action to return to the "three conformities" when the Chinese side explained to him, item by item, and explicitly pointed out his mistakes of "three violations?" Moreover, Chris Patten also has repeatedly undermined Sino-British talks on arrangements for the 1994-95 elections in Hong Kong. Consequently, no positive results were attained and the talks finally broke down. Evidently, it is not that Percy Craddock did not tell Chris Patten the gains and losses in advance, but that Chris Patten turned a deaf ear to the advice, and deliberately and stubbornly took the road of confrontation with the Chinese side. He cannot shirk his responsibility for the deterioration in Sino-British relations. Who Is Responsible for the British Interests? In view of Chris Patten's attack to the effect that Percy Craddock "advocates an indulgent policy" toward the Chinese side, Percy Craddock pointed out that if the British side insists on not cooperating with the Chinese side on the Hong Kong issue, "the Chinese do not have to negotiate at all; they could dictate, or simply wait until 1997, when, by the mere passage of time, Hong Kong will fall into their hands with no restraints on their freedom of action." In a certain sense, this has reflected the truth. It also shows that Percy Craddock has a far better understanding of China than does Chris Patten. The British side once insisted on continuing the governing of Hong Kong after 1997, and it was willing to hold talks on the issue of returning Hong Kong only after Deng Xiaoping sternly warned the British side that if it did not change its attitude, the Chinese side would be compelled to announce unilaterally the principles and policies for resolving the Hong Kong issue. The reason is quite simple: Since time immemorial, Hong Kong has been a part of China's territory, and the Chinese Government has an absolute right to recover Hong Kong at any time. The three unequal treaties which Britain imposed on the Chinese people through such illegal means as armed invasion cannot have the authority of international law. Still less will Britain be able to continue forcibly occupying Hong Kong in the 1980's [year as published]. Therefore, Britain's returning Hong Kong to China is a question of respecting facts and legal principles, and is not a so- called question of "indulgence" or "kow towing." Chris Patten's wishful thinking of implementing the "three violations" constitutional reform plan and of attempting effectively to extend the privileges and interests of the British colonial rule after 1997 is precisely a repetition of Britain's past mistake of demanding to continue its colonial rule in Hong Kong and underestimating the firm confidence and strength of the Chinese side in safeguarding the principle of sovereignty. His experience and knowledge is a far cry from that of the more practical Percy Craddock! In his article, Percy Craddock also held that "the more we can work out by agreement, the greater the protection. That is what made the achievement of the Joint Declaration so important." Facts have precisely proved this. The signing of the Joint Declaration has given a definite date for Britain to hand over Hong Kong to China, has established the principles and mechanism for close Sino-British cooperation for a smooth transfer in 1997, and has provided sufficient protection for the rational interests of the British side in Hong Kong during the transitional period and after 1997. The principle of convergence with the Basic Law, the agreements and understanding between the two sides concerning arrangements for the elections in 1994-95, and the memorandum of understanding on the new airport are all beneficial to both sides. As long as the British side abides by all agreements on Hong Kong between the two sides, Hong Kong will benefit, and the existing and future interests of the British side also will be well protected. The interests of the British side can exist only within Sino- British agreements, and not outside them. Percy Craddock has warned repeatedly that on the issue of Hong Kong, the Sino-British agreements and understanding cannot be ignored, and that the road of confrontation with the Chinese side should never be taken. This should be said to be a rational direction for protecting the interests of Britain. The purpose of Chris Patten's persistence in "three violations" confrontation is to turn Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity, and to preserve the absolute influence of the British side so as to grab illegal privileges and the interests of colonial rule outside the Sino-British agreements. In addition, Chris Patten's gambling with politics in Hong Kong also has a personal political objective, but it is evident that all this will fall through. In addition, the interests of Hong Kong, and even those of Britain, will be damaged by Chris Patten's confrontation activities. Is it not very clear, who -- Percy Craddock or Chris Patten -- as personalities of British political circles, really is responsible for the interests of his own country?
