"There is no reason for Thailand to provide a refuge for Pol Pot," he emphatically told THE NATION. Phalangkun was responding to a FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW news release yesterday which reported that Pol Pot is believed to be residing in a well-guarded compound inside a durian plantation in Chanthaburi province. Khmer Rouge defectors told the REVIEW that the renegade faction leader had found a safe haven in Thailand after spending some time in a special residence in the Phnum Chhat area near the Thai border in late 1993. Branding the allegation "outdated information," Phalangkun insisted that the Army wanted to confirm that Pol Pot was not living in Thai territory. The communists Khmer Rouge rejected participation in UN-organized elections in Cambodia in May 1993. The guerrillas continue to fight for an advisory role in the government. An earlier report said that Khmer Rouge nominal chief Khieu Samphan agreed last week to meet Cambodian government representatives for peace talks in North Korea scheduled to begin on May 27.
