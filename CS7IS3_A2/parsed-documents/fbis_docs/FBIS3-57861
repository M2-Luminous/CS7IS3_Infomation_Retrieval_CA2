In an interview with the Berlin-based national newspaper DIE WELT (Wednesday [5 January] edition), Rexrodt said Russian-German economic relations have "a sound basis" which have developed out of "mutual interest." Their strength was also proven in the difficult Cold War period. Rexrodt stressed that "Yeltsin and the Russian Government continue to consider the further expansion of economic ties with the West as their top priority." It is clear to Moscow that the industrialized states and the international financial institutions play an important part in the reform process.
