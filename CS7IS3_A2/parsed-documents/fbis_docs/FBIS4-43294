Juppe observed that the debate over Europe was far from over. However, he is still working hard for the opening up of European Union [EU] membership to East European countries with the exception of Russia: [Begin Juppe recording] This expansion of the EU seems to me necessary. It is necessary because we have promised it. For more than 40 years we have been telling these countries: When you have thrown the yoke of communism, once the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain have fallen we will welcome you into the European family that is yours. It would seem to me absurd and dangerous if we do not keep this promise. I would add this argument, which may be contested, but which I believe to be very strong: If we reject such a development the Franco-German partnership would not withstand it. What would the EU be if Germany took a different direction? This does not mean that we should follow anyone blindly, but it is about whether we continue to maintain Franco-German relationa as one of the cornerstones of the European construction. If the answer is yes, then we should -- for so many reasons and particularly for this one -- continue moving toward an expanded Europe. [end recording]
