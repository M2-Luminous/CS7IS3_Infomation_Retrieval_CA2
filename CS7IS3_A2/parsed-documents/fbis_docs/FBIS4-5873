FBIS4-5873 "dreas073_a_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-073 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Koreans Find Documents Supporting Wartime Claims Koreans Find Documents Supporting Wartime Claims OW1404154894 Tokyo KYODO in English 1516 GMT 14 Apr 94 OW1404154894 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Nagoya, April 14 KYODO -- A group of Korean residents in Japan said Thursday [14 April] they have found a wartime Japanese Security Ministry document indicating Korean residents were conscripted to work at a warplane factory in Nagoya. The document was seized by the general headquarters of the allied occupation forces after Japan's surrender in 1945, but was later returned to Japan. It has been kept in the Diet library until the group detected it recently. The group is led by Yu Hwang-su, a senior official of the Tokyo headquarters of the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryun). The group called a news conference at Chongryun's Aichi Prefectural headquarters and distributed copies of the document entitled "Thought Quarterly," compiled by the ministry in 1944. The document says conscription squeezed the income of the Korean residents so steeply that the despondent laborers at the warplane engine factory in Nagoya had lost the will to work hard, the group said. Security Ministry investigators who probed the factory's working conditions for 15 days starting February 16, 1944, found that 24 people, or 36 percent of the 67 korean laborers, failed to show up to work, according to the document. Hong Song-chin, the group's secretariat chief and a Chongryun official, told reporters, "although we read 100,000 pages of official documents, this is the first specific name of the factory we have finally found" where Korean laborers were conscripted to work. In a related development, the same group announced it will launch a nationwide investigation Monday to gather testimonies from Koreans who were forcibly brought to Japan before or during World War II. The probe is also designed to elucidate the truth regarding the Japanese Government's crackdown on pro-independence Korean activists and citizens during wartime, it said. The group said the probe is the nation's first into Korean residents in Japan who were subjected to conscription or the clampdown on the pro-independence movement. It said it will submit its findings to the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva this August. Chongryun pollers will visit and distribute questionnaires to 10,000 households of Koreans who survived the repression or conscription, it said. The survey will cover pro-Pyongyang and pro-Seoul Korean residents, and the group hopes to complete it by the end of May. The Korean community numbers some 670,000, of which 10 percent are believed to be Koreans forcibly brought to Japan before or during World War II, and the remaining are their offspring. The probe will touch on female laborers or "comfort women," who were forced to provide sex for Japanese troops at frontline military brothels run by the Japanese Imperial Army.
