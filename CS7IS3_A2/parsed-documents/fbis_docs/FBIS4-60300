[Al-Iryani] First, I would like to state that the media, which is talking about the struggle between the north and the south, does not know the nature of the situation. Nevertheless, I will try to answer this question. [Correspondent] In other words, do you agree with me that it is a war between brothers? [Al-Iryani] A war between brothers, yes certainly, but not a war between the north and the south. The brothers, unfortunately, are fighting in one house, in one room. But I still claim that it is not a war between the north and the south. The latest developments of the situation have been that -- and I quote language used by the media -- joint northern and southern forces are heading toward Hadhramaut to topple the al-Mukalla republic declared by 'Ali Salim al-Bid. Perhaps this is an answer to the language used by the media. Joint northern and southern forces, specific brigades -- and among these brigades, which the media calls southern, are the 'Abbas Brigade and the Hunayshan Brigade, as well as some brigades from the north -- are all advancing jointly toward Hadhramaut to topple the al-Mukalla republic declared by 'Ali Salim al-Bid. These are the latest developments in the situation. [Correspondent] Do we understand from this that the northern forces have stopped advancing toward Aden? [Al-Iryani] No, no. The situation in Aden is unique and needs special consideration. The Aden Governorate has over 400,000 innocent citizens: women, children, elderly, and men. The fighters there number only in the hundreds. We do not want these few hundred to be the cause of thousands of Aden residents' death. This is why the Aden front needs special consideration. Our advance to Hadhramaut is taking place with joint forces -- as I said earlier quoting the media, northern and southern forces -- to topple the al- Mukalla republic. They will start at Saywun and then head toward al-Mukalla. [Correspondent] But so far, the fighting has targeted civilians. We have learned that a missile fell on Sanaa yesterday and that a number of civilians died in it. [Al-Iryani] First, I wish to confirm that the number of deaths in the capital, Sanaa, is three times more than the number in Aden Governorate. [Correspondent] Do we understand from this that ... [Al-Iryani interrupting] There is a great deal of speculation in the number of deaths in Aden. Not a single civilian district of Aden was targeted. [Correspondent] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim, do we understand from what you have just said that there is no intention on the part of northern troops to strike at Aden with Scud missiles? [Al-Iryani] I assure you that this will not happen. Three missiles with a range shorter than a Scud were fired at Aden airport. We cannot shell innocent people in Aden with a missile, a cannon, or a tank. The criminal secessionists, however, insist on hitting the civilians, particularly in Sanaa, so as to give the impression that a civil war is afoot and that civilians are paying the price. [Correspondent] We would like you to update us on the situation from your side. Do you plan any political moves? We know that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has sent messages to a number of Arab and foreign leaders. [Al-Iryani] Let me tell you that the secessionists have only a handful of supporters on the outskirts of the Aden Governorate. They have no military power. There are no front lines in any part of Yemen, except for the handful of supporters who have dug their heels on the outskirts of Aden. [Correspondent] This is the military situation as you see it? [Al-Iryani] I assure you that this is the true military situation. You journalists used to talk about northern and southern troops. There were supposed to be two southern brigades and three northern ones. All these brigades are now heading to take over Hadhramaut. This means that all the fronts have crumbled. There are no military forces in Hadhramaut. I assure you, there are no brigades there, because these are the brigades that were positioned there in the first place. There is no resistance left except for the remnants entrenched on Aden's outskirts. As I said, Aden has its special status. [Correspondent] This means that there are no southern forces left in Hadhramaut. [Al-Iryani] Correct. These forces withdrew to Shabwah, Abyan, and Aden and no longer present a problem. Most of these forces are now on the side of the legitimacy. [Correspondent] Does this mean that Aden is no longer a military target? [Al-Iryani] As you know, military and political considerations are linked. We are giving priority right now to political considerations until we see what happens. But its elimination as a military target, I think it does not make sense. [Correspondent] Does this mean that dialogue and a political solution are possible and that you are ready to seek them? [Al-Iryani] Yes, yes, yes, yes. [Correspondent] Even with the secessionists in the south? [Al-Iryani] Yesterday, the public attorney pressed charges against 16 Yemeni Socialist Party members. This decision was followed by a declaration of general amnesty. The others [southern officials] were called upon to take part in dialogue in the framework of the Republic of Yemen and its constitution. [Correspondent] What is your next step in light of the international reaction to the secession of the south from Yemen? [Al-Iryani] As we said repeatedly, any dealing or sympathy with those secessionists will be considered a hostile act against the Yemeni people. [Correspondent] Has it not come to your knowledge that a certain country is about to recognize what has been announced as southern Yemen? [Al-Iryani] I assure you that such a step has not been pondered at all, except by the other wretches in the Republic of Somaliland. [Correspondent] Do we understand from this that the Republic of Yemen is proposing dialogue and political settlement in place of military option? [Al-Iryani] The military option ... [pauses] It is possible (?in the city of Aden). As for the other fronts, there is no more fighting. [Correspondent] By other fronts, do you mean Hadhramaut? [Al-Iryani] I mean the fronts that saw action, in Abyan, Shabwah, and al-Dali'. For the sake of civilians' safety, political settlement is an option. [Correspondent] Does this mean that a political solution is a possibility? [Al-Iryani] Yes, before we are forced to consider the military option. [Correspondent] Do you believe that marching on Aden involves special considerations that are not ... [Al-Iryani, interrupting] Yes, and this is what I told you in the beginning of this interview. But these special considerations are not going to last forever. As you know, military options are not forever. Hours make a difference. [Correspondent] Why have you taken this position at this very moment? [Al-Iryani] Because we do not want... [pauses] because it is a populated area, as I told you. The rest of the areas that saw military clashes were quite distant from populated areas. [Correspondent] We thought, if you excuse me, that a military option was your first priority. Now, it seems that you are talking about a political option and dialogue. [Al-Iryani] It is not true that anyone in Sanaa has ever rejected political dialogue.
