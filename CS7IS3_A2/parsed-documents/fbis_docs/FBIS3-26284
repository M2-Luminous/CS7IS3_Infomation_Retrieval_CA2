Wang Zhaoguo welcomed the SEF officials, who have come to Beijing for talks with officials of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS]. He commented positively on the meetings between SEF and ARATS, and applauded SEF for keeping a channel open for contact and discussions with ARATS. Wang Zhaoguo said: Since its inception, ARATS has had many contacts and discussions with SEF, and helped advance contacts and discussions on routine affairs across the strait. Wang Daohan and Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu] had a successful meeting in Singapore last April, which General Secretary Jiang Zemin termed a successful and fruitful meeting that marked an important, historic step in the development of relations across the strait. After the Wang-Ku talks, the two organizations had several working discussions. This visit by Vice Chairman Jiao to Beijing for high-level talks is of great significance. He said: Regular contacts and discussions will help the two sides enhance mutual understanding and reach a consensus. Jiao Renhe said: The SEF and ARATS have already had many discussions. This is my first visit to Beijing; in the past three days I have had two meetings with Tang Shubei and Zou Zhekai. The two sides have made considerable progress toward reaching a consensus; one thing still lacking is "convergence" and more efforts are needed. Jiao Renhe also said: Promoting cross-strait exchanges involves a host of miscellaneous problems. A key point is to build "mutual confidence." It is hoped that things will develop in ways conducive to cross-strait exchange and cooperation. Wang Zhaoguo said: The current visit by Jiao has helped advance the development of cross-strait relations. After discussions, the two organizations have reached an understanding on the following four points: First, high-level officials of the two organizations reaffirmed the understanding on repatriation, in principle, of all hijackers; second, the two organization agreed that they should follow the principle of stressing the nongovernmental and routine nature of their discussions, eschew politically sensitive issues, and refrain from imposing their political demands on each other; third, it is essential and important to keep open a clear channel of contact and discussions between the two organizations; fourth, both sides wish to see that a second Wang-Gu meeting be held at an early date. After the meeting, Tang Shubei briefed reporters on the meeting. He said: The meeting proceeded in a sincere, cordial, and harmonious [cheng zhi qin qie rong qia 6134 2304 6024 0434 5816 3174] atmosphere.
