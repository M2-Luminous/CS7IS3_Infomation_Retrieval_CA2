We would like to dispose of the issue in another two years." These words were spoken by the majority of the banks in announcing earnings reports for the year ending in March 1994, but despite thoughts of "danger passed and God forgotten," the financial system is still plagued by old and new problems that threaten its future. Certainly, in comparison to fiscal year 1992, the total of failed loans and extended loans held by 21 city banks, long-term trust banks, and trust and banking companies was 13.57 trillion yen, which appeared to show a peaking out of such problem loans. Sales of loans to the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Co. increased significantly, while transfers into the loan amortization special accounts which represent an indirect form of amortization "were effected to the maximum" along with direct amortization, bringing the total value of loans disposed of to 3.46 trillion yen. The Ministry of Finance [MOF] increased options for early disposal of bad loans by authorized special-purpose companies to absorb bad loans of affiliated nonbanking institutions. Although we can appreciate such strenuous joint government and private-sector efforts, the Japanese financial system still represents a "Pandora's box." The old problem consists of the aid being extended to the housing loan companies, which have a very fragile structure. The seven housing loan companies are in the process of undergoing a 10-year restructuring program, but delays in recovery of asset values have caused widening deviations from projections. Since fiscal year revenues and profits have failed to grow because its share of the home loan business--which is their primary source of income--has been diverted to the public Housing Loan Corporation, loans extended to the housing loan companies will have to undergo decisions on reductions and exemptions of liabilities and extension of new loans within a year of the initial aid actions. Institutions facing difficult situations include weakly structured agricultural cooperative-affiliated financial institutions. Whether action is taken to either save or liquidate them through the use of public funds which were supposedly suspended, the situation is such that the housing loan companies, agricultural cooperative-affiliated financial institutions and MOF and Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries--which are the supervising agencies--can no longer postpone action "by allowing time to idly pass by." The problems are not limited to the housing loan companies. There is the risk that hidden bad loans will surface because of the failure of businesses whose loans were subject to reduced or exempted interest payments. In the last fiscal year, Nippon Trust Bank was forced to avoid a recurring loss by using an emergency, evasive manipulative action which accounted for an indirect amortization action as a special loss rather than as other recurring expenses. The new problem is represented in the fact that the Japanese financial system has undermined the efficiency of the capital distribution function. Amortization of loans through the use of undeclared profits in stocks required supporting the stock markets through the use of government-created stock valuations. As a result, the new issues markets have been distorted by restraints on issues at market prices and capital markets have been compromised in terms of their capital-raising functions. A good example of that situation is that many city banks which are awaiting establishment of securities subsidiaries have hesitated to issue preferred stock based on a feeling of being constrained by the MOF's Securities Bureau. Thus, the financial institutions have regressed to ancient systems. Banks rely heavily on indirect financing and securities firms are hesitant about the moves toward securitization. If direct financing fails to function properly, capital including the average business will not be able to take risks. The absence of risk capital caused banks and securities firms to assume a negative stance saying, "There is no requirement," relative to the MOF's Banking Bureau's program for promoting the liquidity of bonds. However, banks no longer have the financial strength to assume market risks which need to be placed somewhere. We believe that structural deficiency is reflected in the slow pace of loans referred to as "hesitancy to loan" and "hesitancy to borrow," especially as the substance of the capital investment recession. The regression to ancient systems on the part of financial institutions has delayed the recovery of and undermined the Japanese economy. If financial institutions decide to sit back and relax in this period of "financial disaffection" until the disposal of excessive loan problems, it just may prove that they will have failed to take essential, timely actions.
