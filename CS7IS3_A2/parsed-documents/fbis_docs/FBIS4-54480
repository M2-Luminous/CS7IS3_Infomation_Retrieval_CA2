The 168-strong British force, including 32 Saxon armoured vehicles, was due to reinforce about 500 UN peacekeepers patrolling an increasingly unstable ceasefire around the town. But a spokesman at UN HQ in Sarajevo said it had been held up since the early hours at a Serb checkpoint at Rogatica, just north of the town. The contingent is mainly drawn from the Duke of Wellington's regiment, and its commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel David Santa-Olalla will take command of UN forces in the enclave when it arrives. UN Protection Force spokesman Eric Chaperon said the situation in Gorazde was worsening and Muslim forces on Saturday fired two mortar rounds at the Bosnian Serbs. "The situation in Gorazde is getting unstable due to the increasing tension around the water plant, along the confrontation line north west of the town," he said. "Several small arms exchanges were reported in the area." Both sides agreed a ceasefire after the Serbs lifted a month-long siege of the town in compliance with a Nato ultimatum to pull back. But UN officials said the Serbs had failed to withdraw all their infantry from a two-mile exclusion zone and Muslim-led forces were ignoring requests from peacekeeping troops in the area.
