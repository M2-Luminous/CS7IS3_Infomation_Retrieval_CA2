The city "doesn't like" its harmful effect on the environment. But without the only fuel base capable of fueling all classes of ships, the fleet will be half-paralyzed. The storage tanks and production equipment of the Pacific Fleet's fuel storage facilities and bases recently marked their 50th anniversary. Given their total lack of bilge and ballast water treatment stations, their effect on the environment is limited only by the service personnel's enthusiasm. Meanwhile, taking each tonne of oil-contaminated water to the civilian sailors' treatment facilities costs the fleet roughly 10,000 rubles. This situation stems from the fact that financing for the construction of treatment facilities in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy has been frozen at the level of two constructed tanks and the foundation for a boiler. And the Primorskiy Kray Environmental Protection Committee has banned the construction of a station in the vicinity of Vladivostok altogether. The committee's specialists maintain that the treatment facilities will be an additional source of pollution! But while demanding that the navy not pollute the environment, those same specialists have not impeded the operation of a seaport bilge and ballast water treatment station located next to the ill-fated Pacific Fleet fuel base or the construction of additional treatment units at a civilian fuel storage facility in the commercial seaport. Nor are Pacific Fleet ships capable of "making their way through" to those stations: The fishermen and civilian sailors already have more than enough ships of their own, and foreign ship owners pay hard currency to have their wastes treated. And yet the Navy is accused of being the sea's most active polluter. Yes, some of the criticism of the Navy is justified. Its ships, with the exception of a few recently built ones, lack effective systems to treat bilge. Equipped only with tanks for fecal and waste water, they are forced to discharge it into the sea since the Fleet lacks treatment facilities of its own. But fewer than 15 percent of the ships and vessels based here belong to the Navy, and an even smaller percentage in terms of tonnage. If one takes into account the fact that, in addition to the sailors, 23 sewage pipes and all the city's industrial enterprises dump their waste water into the Zolotoy Rog bay without any treatment whatsoever, it becomes clear that the fleet is by no means the main "wrecker" of the environment. But when our future and the future of our children are at stake, determining who has caused the most harm to that future is not the main concern. A glance at a map showing the extent to which areas of the sea around Vladivostok are contaminated with heavy metals is truly shocking: The maximum allowable concentrations have been exceeded many times over, in some instances by several orders of magnitude. And so we need to discuss not just how to stop the practice of discharging untreated wastes, but also how to clean up wastes that are already "rotting." Can this be done? The Pacific Fleet, for example, has just 15 oil-spill cleanup ships, four of which are in Vladivostok, but only two are operable. And only one of them -- the MUS-342 -- is designed to skim petroleum product films from water surfaces. The others operate roughly like this: A man in an oil-stained padded jacket uses a pitchfork to scoop the waste from the water and toss it onto the deck. So the battle against environmental pollution at the current stage is for the most part haphazard. "We proposed the establishment of a municipal office to clean waste and bilge from the water surface back in 1989," said Captain First Rank Aleksandr Nazarenko, chief of the Pacific Fleet environmental protection inspectorate. "After all, there are city services that collect household garbage, and something similar is needed on the water. But it turns out that nobody wants to take responsibility for the water, so there still isn't anyone in charge of protecting it from pollution caused by human economic activity." Late last year a decision was adopted to assign a number of bays around Vladivostok to the city. And so now is the time to think about setting up a municipal enterprise to clean up those waters. And under these circumstances, in Aleksandr Nazarenko's opinion, the Fleet should move as quickly as possible to carry out an environmental field documentation of coastal military installations, use it as the basis for devising an environmental monitoring program, and make that program part of an integrated and centralized environmental protection system that would operate in conjunction with civilian agencies. A Pacific Fleet ecological inspection service should be initiated by pooling at least the available waste-cleanup ships and equipment under a single command (they are currently assigned to the auxiliary fleet), completing the construction of the bilge water treatment stations, and cooperating with the kray environmental protection committee. These environmental protection measures will hardly result in an immediate return that can be measured in rubles or other currency. Another kind of return is more important -- an averted ecological disaster that has been planted like a mine under our future.
