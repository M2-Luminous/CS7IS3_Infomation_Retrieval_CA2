It is an important basis for an accurate analysis of rural affairs and for the determination of strategy and economic policy in rural development. How are we then to accurately understand and effectively apply the statistical data "net farmer income"? The following points will have to be paid attention to and to be fully mastered: First, sampling network points have representative character but are not the same as having sample households all over the area. Investigation by sampling is a scientific investigative method done by first subjecting only one portion of all the units within a whole to investigation, and to infer therefrom the properties of the whole. The selection of the 20 sample counties and 1,600 sample households of Jilin Province was done as required in the uniform scheme of the State Statistical Bureau. It used the average per capita income of the preceding three years, lined it up upward and downward, compiled it into a framework, and adopted the method of random starting points and symmetric equidistances. Scientific tests have shown that this set of network points enables a better than 95.45 percent control, and that error in per capita income is limited to below 3 percent. Its representative character is not adversely affected by the way the samples are distributed. Therefore, when using "net farmer income" in analyzing problems, one may have confidence in the representative character of the "net farmer income" gained from the sampling carried out by the [official] statistical agencies. Second, peasant income is not the same as cash income. According to the regulations of the State Statistical Bureau, "net farmer income" comprises two components: all cash income of the peasant household (deducting what has to be deducted) and all agricultural and sideline products produced and consumed by the peasant himself, converted into money. For instance, the per capita income of a peasant in Jilin Province in 1992 was 807.41 yuan, of which 411.84 yuan was cash income--making up 51 percent of his net income--while the remaining 395.57 yuan were material income converted into money. Therefore, when using "net farmer income" in the analysis of certain problems, it is necessary to distinguish between cash income and material income converted to money, and to then deal with the proportions of each part, so as to gain accurate control of the level of commodity production and the purchasing power of the peasants. Third, the net farmer income level is not the same as actual degree of prosperity. Net income of peasants is an important indicator for the evaluation of the peasants' prosperity, but it is not the sole indicator. The peasant's income is the comprehensive result of the peasant household's income from productive operations and from nonproduction-related income, while poverty or prosperity of the peasant household depends on many historically related factors. Therefore, when using "net farmer income" in the analysis of poverty and prosperity of peasant households, it is necessary to simultaneously include in the analysis many other conditions, such as financial claims, financial obligations, ready cash, deposits in banks and credit cooperatives, and production-related or nonproduction-related fixed assets. Fourth, the average level of net farmer income is not the same as equality of levels. For instance, in 1992, a peasant's average net income in Jilin Province was 807.41 yuan, which shows, in the overall view, that the living standard of the broad masses of peasants in Jilin Province has gone up from subsistence level to a comfortably well-off level, but that does not mean that every peasant household has reached that level. There have been almost 30 percent with incomes of over 1,000 yuan, and 11 percent under the poverty level (at per capita 400 yuan). Therefore, when using "net farmer income" in analyzing the overall level of the production and living conditions of peasant households, attention must be paid to the imbalance among the various units under the cover of the average figure. Attention must also be paid to the fact that basic data control be established as regards the differentials among the units, so that guidance is given in a classified way, and that common prosperity for all be promoted in order to achieve it as early as possible. Fifth, the cash proportion in the peasant's net income is not the same as actual buying power. Purchasing power of the peasant (comprising purchases of means of production and means of livelihood) is indeed manifested in the cash portion of the peasant's net income, but not all cash income constitutes actual purchasing power. Some money is needed by the peasant to repay debts, some money is needed for other than commodity-related expenditure (for instance, for school and sundry expenses, travel expenses, etc.), some money is saved to be later used for other purposes, etc. Therefore, when using "net farmer income" for analyses in the problems of purchasing power, it is necessary to pierce the outer appearances and effect specific analyses. The question what proportion within the cash income constitutes actual purchasing power must be investigated and researched in a thoroughgoing and meticulous way, according to market situation and the consumption psychology of the peasant households. Sixth, "net farmer income" is not the same as actual output value. If we compute "net farmer income" from products of animal husbandry, it would comprise income from actual sales and products produced but consumed by the peasant himself, converted to money. Livestock on hand and increases due to breeding, as long as not sold and also not consumed by own household, are all not counted as income of that year. However, in some localities when testing and verifying "net farmer income" large livestock on hand, life pigs and poultry are all converted to money and included in that year's income. That is a case of mixing up the computation of "income" with the computation of "output value." Therefore, when computing and verifying "net farmer income," it is absolutely necessary to first clarify the concepts of "income" and "output value," and to master the scope and methods of measuring each of these different factors, so as to accurately use these two indices.
