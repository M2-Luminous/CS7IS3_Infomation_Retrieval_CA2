This new legislature ruled on an amnesty which freed Rutskoy, Khasbulatov and other organisers of armed resistance to Yeltsin's move to crush the old Soviet-era parliament last October. Rutskoy called for a spirit of reconciliation in Russia in a statement faxed to Russian and foreign news agencies on Wednesday. In the same statement he defended the armed resistance to Yeltsin's move last autumn.
