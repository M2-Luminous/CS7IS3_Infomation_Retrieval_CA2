"It is desirable that a government which will get the budget through the Diet and carry on political, economic and administrative reforms will be installed," he told a news conference. He warned that Japan will not be able to discharge its duties in the international arena unless the government carries out reforms. Hiraiwa said it is extremely difficult to single out Hosokawa's successor at this stage but the selection must be made within a few days. Hosokawa announced in a nationally televised news conference Friday he will resign as prime minister to take responsibility for a stalemate in the Diet over his personal finances. The standstill has held up the enactment of the national budget for fiscal 1994 which began April 1. Hiraiwa said he has given high marks to the Hosokawa government's efforts for political reform.
