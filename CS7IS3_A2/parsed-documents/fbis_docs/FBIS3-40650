Rajgopal, BJP national vice president, announced yesterday. Addressing the Karnataka state executive committee members of the party, he said the BJP would be organising seminars, discussions and public meetings from January 15 all over the country on the adverse implications of the Centre's signing of the Dunkel proposals at the GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] negotiations without consulting the opposition. The Dunkel proposals, shamelessly signed by the Centre without taking Parliament into confidence, was an affront to the parliamentary system as it affects the country's sovereignty and would harm all sections of people particularly the farmers, he said. Mr Rajgopal said the party wanted to censure the Centre in Parliament on the issue but could not do anything as the left parties shied away from the move. "We have now decided to take the issue before the people and mobilise public opinion on the dangers of the Dunkel proposals," he said pointing out that the BJP would be campaigning on the Centre's failure to take any action on the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) report on the securities scam involving a loot of over Rs800 crore. The BJP leader, who did not make even a passing reference to the Ram mandir issue during his 90-minute speech, however, asserted that BJP was not a "single-issue party." Mr Rajgopal dwelt at length on the outcome of the recent round of assembly elections in the north and claimed that those who saw the BJP nearing its end were living in a fool's paradise. Though the party's performance was not up to the expected levels, the elections have clearly established that the BJP's emergence as a major political party in the country, both in terms of securing popular votes and in the number of seats won. Quoting electoral statistics, he said that out of a total of 9.84 crore votes cast, the BJP grabbed 3.57 crore accounting for 36 per cent of the popular votes cast, winning 448 seats against the 2.59 crore votes (10 per cent less than BJP) and 348 seats won by the Congress, while the Janata Dal got hardly 89 lakh votes and 42 seats. The BJP suffered reverses in Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh due to different local reasons, while its performance in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan was better than during the 1983 polls. The setback in terms of number of seats for the BJP in Uttar Pradesh was on account of the ganging up of the Muslims and casteist forces under the Bahujan Samajwadi Party and Socialist Party alliance of Mr Kanshi Ram and Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav, he alleged. Mr Rajgopal said the BJP would be concentrating its efforts on Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, which were likely to go to the polls in April or May "We are looking for spectacular gains in Karnataka whenever assembly polls are held and make up for the loss suffered by the party in the north," he said, pointing out that the ruling Congress party's moves for advancing polls in the two southern states would benefit the BJP. Mr K.S. Easwarappa, MLA [Member of Legislative Assembly] and state BJP chief, said the party would be launching a vigorous state-wide campaign demanding elections to the taluka panchayats and zilla parishada and for rejection of the Dunkel proposals. "We are moving a resolution in this regard in the assembly," he announced.
