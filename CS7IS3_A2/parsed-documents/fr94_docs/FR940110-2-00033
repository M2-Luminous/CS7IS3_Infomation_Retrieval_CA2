ACTION: Notice of Program Interest. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Economic Impact and Diversity, desires to encourage the submission of unsolicited proposals in support of the Department's Minority Technical Education Program. Such support is authorized by 42 U.S.C. 7141 (d) and 7256(a); Public Law 95&hyph;619, part 3, sec. 2.11(d), which states that the Director of the Office of Minority Economic Impact may provide appropriate assistance to minority educational institutions to enable these institutions to participate in the activities of the Department.

For purposes of this solicitation, a qualified ``Minority Education Institution'' is a post secondary two-year educational institution of higher learning (such as a community college or vocational college) that is a non-profit entity with a minimum of 25 percent total minority enrollment. Pursuant to Public Law 95&hyph;619, ``Minority'' means any individual who is a citizen of the United States and who is a Negro, American Indian, Eskimo, Oriental, or Aleut or is a Spanish speaking individual of Spanish descent. This notice describes the principal scope of the activity and provides some guidance on submitting proposals. DATES AND ADDRESSES: Proposals (3 copies) should be submitted to Estela Romo, HRMD, U.S. Department of Energy, 1301 Clay St., Oakland, CA 94612. Applications received after March 15, 1994, will be held for one year and may be eligible for awards in FY 95. Proposers receiving awards in FY 1994 will be notified not later than June 15, 1994. Each proposal must contain a cover sheet (Standard Form 424), a technical proposal and budget justification. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: All questions concerning this program notice should be directed to Arlene Coleman at (510) 637&hyph;1870. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: With this notice, it is DOE's intent to encourage the submission of proposals for minority two year post secondary training that would address the following program objectives: 1. Increase the number of minority students that select a course of study leading to energy-related careers to enable and encourage them to bridge from high school to community college to four year educational institutions; and/or, increase the career opportunities through retention programs, retraining, and bridge programs in energy related careers. 2. Strengthen the quantity and quality of energy-related technical and academic curricula with emphasis on applied training provided for minority students at two-year post secondary schools. 3. Establish partnerships with industry and other community entities that promote economic growth opportunities of the community serviced by enriching energy-related technology transfer activities. The purpose of this notice is to encourage the submission of proposals that address one or more of the following: 1. Provide financial assistance to financially needy honor students participating in the program. 2. Establish linkages with DOE contractors and private and/or public energy-related institutions to support student and faculty internships. 3.

Eligibility To be eligible to participate in this program, an institution must be a nonprofit institution of higher education which offers a two year associate degree program, a two year certificate program, and which is qualified as an institution of higher education. The education institution must have 25 percent or more minority enrollment. It should have a history of graduating minority students in some energy-related or technical field such as applied mathematics, engineering technologies, environmental science, computer sciences, software engineering, engineering, life sciences, or physical sciences. This program is open to institutions within the United States and its territories. Institutions having more than one eligible component may choose whether to apply on behalf of the institution as a whole or to submit freestanding applications on behalf of one or more components. Individual components of a community, vocational, or other institutions are separately eligible. Indirect Costs Indirect costs will be limited to eight percent. Project Director The Project Director is the representative and spokesperson for the institution in matters concerning the award. The Project Director should be available for consultation with the DOE Program Manager and assist in resolving issues or problems encountered by the DOE Program Manager during the tenure of the project. Project Funding FY 1994 funding up to $537,110 is available for awards under this program. It is estimated that these funds will support awards from seven to eight schools with funding levels of approximately $67,000 for this first fiscal year. Funding for the second year through the fifth year is estimated at $50,000 per year subject to the availability of funds. These estimates of funding and number of awards do not bind the U.S. Department of Energy to a specific number of awards unless otherwise specified by statute or regulation. Evaluation Process and Selection Criteria Applications may be subjected to external review following preliminary screening.
