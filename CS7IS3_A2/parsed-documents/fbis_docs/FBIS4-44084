One no vote threw everything in the air again, the no vote having come from the very isolated British. The dossier will doubtless be reopened 15 July at another summit in Brussels. Meanwhile Jean-Luc Dehaene is not withdrawing. We (?highlight) this comment: As a person, I have no problem with John Major. I am not blind to his position in Great Britain. I am even sorry for him. These are a few of the things said by Jean-Luc Dehaene on television at lunchtime today in Mises au Point. Anyway, as far as he is concerned all of this is not good for Europe: [Begin recording] [Dehaene] Europe has in fact been blocked by Great Britain. That itself is not good for Europe. What is worse is that Europe has in fact been blocked for British domestic reasons, namely Major's weak position in the Conservative Party. He is under pressure from the Eurosceptics. There has been a press campaign against me which he apparently cannot resist, so he chose to try to strengthen his domestic position--and it is not clear that will be the right path in the long run--rather than to play the European game and join the consensus. So in relation to the Twelve, and in particular to the Eleven who reached a consensus on my candidacy, this creates a problem, because we are not going to put ourselves in a situation where one says: no, and then all the others say: oh, all right, we give in and we'll go and look for someone else. I am not speaking of the parliament, because when I see some of the initial reactions in the European Parliament, I say to myself that the European Council must pay great attention to what it does, because then there could be a return to form as far as parliament is concerned.
