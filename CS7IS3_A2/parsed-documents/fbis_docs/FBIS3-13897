The Pakistani announcement in Islamabad puzzled many here, and more so its logic given by that country's Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan. Islamabad alleged that the Indian Government had gone back on its commitment to lease the Jinnah House for the use of the Consulate General and refused to facilitate the acquisition of suitable premises for the Consulate General. It also accused the government of Maharashtra of making it difficult for the Consulate General to carry out its assigned functions. On their very face, these charges look flimsy and unconvincing. For example, India is on record of having rejected Pakistan's plea for the use of Jinnah House as long as 1983 when General Zia approached New Delhi with this request. Subsequently, India gave no impression that it was not firm on its rejection of the Pakistani request. India was also not obliged to find a place for Pakistan in Bombay. Pakistan knew it and yet it made the Jinnah House and its failure to find a suitable place for its Consulate General as an excuse for winding up its work in Bombay. Pakistan seems to have perfected the art of accusing others of the sins which it itself commits. India's High Commission in Islamabad and its Consulate General in Karachi worked under all kinds of trying conditions. In May 1992, a senior diplomat, Mr. Rajesh Mittal, was abducted and tortured by Pakistani intelligence agencies. It was such an awful incident that even Amnesty International deplored it. Before that, the wife of an attache was abducted while shopping and questioned about the activities of her husband and other staff members of the High Commission. In Karachi, the Indian staff was kept under constant intimidation. Those Pakistani Sindhis and Muhajirs who visited the consulate were branded as Indian agents. In August 1992, the two countries signed an agreement on the code of conduct for treatment of diplomatic, consular personnel in the two countries. They reaffirmed their commitment to the Vienna Convention of 1962 on diplomatic relations and the Vienna Convention of 1963 on consular relations. However, as the year 1992 came to a close, Pakistan gave this accord its own interpretation and asked India to curtail the strength of its staff in Karachi to less than one-third, that is, from 68 to 20. The Pakistani order mainly hurt the Muhajir community in Sindh. Muhajirs are refugees from India. They still have family ties in India. The Indian Consulate was issuing 700 visas a day to them to visit their relatives. The community which has been suffering political deprivations and discriminations because mainly of their language, Urdu, will now be denied the facility to meet relatives in India. Pakistan's sudden decision to close the consulate in Bombay came at a time when India, after the Geneva episode, was trying to create conditions for the restart of efforts to normalize relations with this important neighbor. This desire has received a setback. There could have been two reasons why Pakistan chose to close down its consulate at this time. First, because of its domestic compulsion, the government of Ms. Benazir Bhutto was trying to preempt the reopening of India-Pakistan dialogue on normalization of relations. Ms. Bhutto finds herself in an acutely embarrassing situation after the loss of face in Geneva. She calls it her victory, but the opposition remains unconvinced, especially in view of all the claims before the withdrawal of Pakistan's resolutions from the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva that a large number of commission members were willing to vote for the resolution. At present, Ms. Bhutto's government will find it difficult to restart negotiations with India. The second reason may be Pakistani intelligence agencies' strategy to keep the Muhajirs from meeting their relations in India. Muhajirs have been the special target of the military operations in Sindh, which began in May 1992. A section of the Urdu press feels no compunction in accusing the Muhajirs of being anti-Pakistan.
