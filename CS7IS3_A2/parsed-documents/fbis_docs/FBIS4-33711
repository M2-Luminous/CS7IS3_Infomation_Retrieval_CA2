FBIS4-33711 "drlat112_m_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-112 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 Brazil Law Called `Draconian to Entrepreneurs' Law Called `Draconian to Entrepreneurs' PY0906170794 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2206 GMT 8 Jun 94 PY0906170794 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO Portuguese BFN [Report by "Jn Galazi" and "Carlos Nobre"] [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 8 Jun (AE) -- Acting National Confederation of Industries (CNI) President Mario Amato said today that the antitrust law "is draconian to entrepreneurs," who feel insecure and fearful of possible punishment. According to Amato, the law will not benefit enterprises, the government, or consumers. As an example, he said the president of a state-run utility company will not be jailed if the company issues an incorrect bill. Private enterprises, however, will be subject to this type of penalty. Despite his position against the antitrust law, Amato voiced support for the Real Plan because it is being implemented gradually. Amato lectured today at a seminar entitled "The Solution Is To Create Jobs," sponsored by the Brazilian Service for Promotion of Small and Micro Enterprises (Sebrae), in Rio de Janeiro, during which he said everyone should try to promote the domestic market. In this regard, he proposed an agenda for the creation of jobs involving five topics to be discussed by the whole society: elimination of restrictions on incoming foreign capital, reduction of social contributions, promotion of exports, tax reform, and promotion of small and micro enterprises, which are the main source of jobs on the Brazilian market. Sole Workers Center (CUT) President Vicente Paulo da Silva, aka Vicentinho, endorsed Amato's words, adding his own suggestions: reduction of the work week to 40 hours, land reform, and incentives for the creation of small enterprises. Former Mines and Energy Minister Pratini de Moraes demanded the elimination of taxes on exports, noting that this can help create 300,000 jobs. Among such taxes, he mentioned the IPMF [Provisional Tax on Financial Operations], Confins [Social Security contributions], ICM [Goods Movement Tax], and IPI [Tax on Manufactured Products]. With tax exemptions, Brazilian exports will grow by $6 billion, he said, thus increasing the positive balance of trade, which last year registered exports worth $38 billion and imports worth $23 billion. Taxes paid by export industry entrepreneurs amount to $8 billion annually, and they feel insecure without a clear policy for the industry. Brazil, Burkina Faso, and Bangladesh are the only three countries that tax their exports, Moraes said. He added that exports account for only 7 percent of Brazilian industrial production, and Brazilian commerce accounts for only 0.65 percent of world trade.
