Negotiations on the automobile and auto parts sector is now facing rough sailing because Japan has rejected the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets. The automobile industry's cooperation is indispensable for settling the negotiations prior to the Japan-U.S. summit slated for 11 February and the gap between MITI and the automobile industry holds the key to the direction the negotiations will take. It was reported on 2 February that MITI asked Japanese automakers to submit their plans every year for the purchase of foreign-made auto parts and the report has become controversial. Enraged by the report, Yutaka Kume, president of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (and president of Nissan Motor Corporation), asked MITI to categorically deny the report. President Kume was enraged by the report because it came shortly after he; Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corporation; and Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president of Honda Motor Company, met with Hiroshi Kumagai, MITI minister, to ask the latter to oppose the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets. Japanese automakers worked out their voluntary plans for the purchase of $19 billion worth of American-made auto parts in January 1992 when Former President Bush visited Japan, but the plans have transformed into a Japanese commitment to the United States. The Japanese automakers have this bitter experience. In the recent negotiations on the automobile and auto parts sector, MITI proposed a cooperative approach in which both Japanese and American automobile industries cooperate in trading auto parts. MITI Minister Kumagai has said: "It would be good if automakers in the two nations decide on their trade of auto parts." In this way, Mr. Kumagai is eager to look for a way to break the deadlock in the negotiations through the formula of voluntary cooperation between automakers of the two nations. President Kume once said: "The negotiations on the automobile sector should be held between automakers of the two countries and it is ridiculous that two nations' governments intervene in their trade." In this way, Japanese automakers are increasingly reacting against the intergovernmental negotiations. With the Japan-U.S. summit one week away, MITI is getting increasingly irritated.
