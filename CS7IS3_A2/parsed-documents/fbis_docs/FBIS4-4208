During the meeting, Li and the diplomats exchanged views on furthering China's ties with these five countries. Li Ruihuan first thanked the Governments of Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate of Belgium for inviting him to visit, and he expressed his satisfaction over their careful arrangements for the visits. He said: This will be my first trip to Europe in the capacity of CPPCC chairman. It will also be a trip to fulfill the late Chairman Li Xiannian's unfulfilled wish to visit northwest Europe. I am looking forward to visiting your beautiful countries and establishing wide contacts with the leaders of the governments and parliaments, as well as the peoples from all walks of life, of your countries. I hope that the visits will achieve the goal of enhancing mutual understanding, expanding exchanges, and strengthening cooperation between China and your countries. Li Ruihuan said: China and your five countries maintain good ties, which have been furthered in the past few years. High-level contacts have been constantly on the increase, and economic, trade, scientific, and technological cooperation and cultural exchanges have borne new fruit. The volume of two-way trade between China and your five countries has increased by a fairly big margin. [The preceding sentence is omitted in the variant version] Your countries have plenty of advanced science and technology and management expertise that China should draw on. The economies of the two sides are mutually complementary to a great extent, and there exist good conditions for the two sides to further develop their relations. I hope that the two sides will tap potentials and actively promote trade and economic cooperation and exchanges. [variant version reads: ...two sides will make concerted efforts, tap potentials, and ... (adding "make concerted efforts")] Li Ruihuan said: China is deepening reforms, opening itself up wider, and promoting development. It needs not only a stable and harmonious domestic environment but also a peaceful and friendly international environment. China is in Asia while your countries are in Europe. Our national conditions and social system are different from yours, but China and your five countries have no conflicts of fundamental interests and share much common ground on the maintenance of world peace and promoting common development. This is a very good basis for our friendship and cooperation. China is ready to further develop its ties with your five countries on the principles of seeking common ground while reserving differences and of mutual respect, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, and equality and mutual benefit. Li Ruihuan briefed the diplomatic envoys of the five countries on the CPPCC. He expressed the belief that the CPPCC will make new contributions to promoting the existing friendly ties between China and the five countries. Danish Ambassador to China William Friis-Moller expressed his welcome of Chairman Li Ruihuan's visit on behalf of the five countries' diplomats. He said that the governments and peoples of the five countries attach great importance to Chairman Li Ruihuan's visit. He expressed the hope that the visit will deepen mutual understanding, promote the development of bilateral ties, and provide a chance for the five governments and parliaments to learn more about China.
