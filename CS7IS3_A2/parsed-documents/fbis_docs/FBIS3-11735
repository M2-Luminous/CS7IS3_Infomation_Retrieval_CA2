He was at the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] national headquarters, where he stood in an honor guard before Luis Donaldo Colosio's coffin. As we all know, he accompanied the body from the Mexico City international airport to the party's headquarters. The president was accompanied by his wife, Cecilia Ocheli de Salinas, and he was obviously dismayed. He told us he has lost his great friend and asked us to respect his sorrow. Let us listen to the recording. [Begin Salinas recording] I have just stood in an honor guard before the body of Luis Donaldo Colosio. I went to the airport to pick up his widow, Diana Laura, and to pick him up. My wife and I accompanied her. Just a few minutes ago, we also accompanied her to her vehicle when she decided to leave. I want to tell you that Mexico has lost a great man, and I have lost a great friend. I want to ask you to allow us to mourn him, and bid him farewell. Thank you. [end recording] President Salinas' agenda today is private. Nonetheless, it is expected that at noon he will receive [Canadian] Prime Minister Jean Chretien, with whom he had to interrupt his discussions yesterday when the attack occurred which took the life of Luis Donaldo Colosio.
