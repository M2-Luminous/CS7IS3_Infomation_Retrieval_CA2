FR940707-2-00153 FR940707-2-00079 Mine Safety and Health Administration Coal Mine Respirable Dust Standard; Single-Shift and Noncompliance Determinations AGENCIES: Mine Safety and Health Administration, Labor. ACTION: Notice of public hearings. SUMMARY: The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) will hold additional hearings to receive comments on proposed changes to the Federal program for respirable coal mine dust. The first hearing will address a joint finding by the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services that the average concentration of respirable dust to which each miner in the active workings of a coal mine is exposed can be measured accurately over a single shift. This hearing is being held under section 101 of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act). Following that hearing, MSHA will hold a second hearing to receive public comments on the Agency's intent to use single, full-shift respirable dust measurements to determine noncompliance under the MSHA coal mine respirable dust standard. The hearings will be held in Salt Lake City, Utah. DATES: Requests to make oral presentations should be submitted prior to the hearings. The hearings will be held on Tuesday, July 19, 1994. The joint MSHA-NIOSH hearing is scheduled from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. The MSHA hearing is scheduled from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. ADDRESSES: Both hearings will be held at the Holiday Inn, 999 South Main Street, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111, (801) 395&hyph;8600. Send requests to make oral presentations to the Mine Safety and Health Administration, Office of Standards, Regulations and Variances, Room 631, 4015 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia 22203. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia W. Silvey, Director, Office of Standards, Regulations and Variances, MSHA, (703) 235&hyph;1910. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 18, 1994, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services jointly published a notice in the Federal Register (59 FR 8357) announcing a new finding that the average concentration of respirable dust to which each miner in the active workings of a coal mine is exposed can be accurately measured over a single shift in accordance with section 202(f)(2) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. Based on this finding, the Secretaries are proposing to rescind the finding issued on July 17, 1971, and affirmed on February 23, 1972. Concurrently, MSHA published a notice in the Federal Register (59 FR 8356) announcing its intention to use both single, full-shift respirable dust measurements, and the average of multiple, full-shift respirable dust samples, to determine noncompliance and issue citations for violations of the respirable dust standard under the MSHA coal mine respirable dust program. Public hearings on these matters were held on July 6, 1994, in Morgantown, West Virginia (59 FR 29348&hyph;29349). In response to requests from the mining community, MSHA has scheduled a second set of public hearings in the West. NIOSH concurs with this action and will participate. The hearings will be held in accordance with the same procedures cited in the Federal Register notices for the July 6, 1994, hearings. To allow for the submission of post-hearing comments, the record will remain open until August 5, 1994. Dated: July 5, 1994. Edward C. Hugler, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health.
