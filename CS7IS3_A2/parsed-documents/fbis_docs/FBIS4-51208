The entire country must support Pudong's development and opening up, and Pudong must serve reform, opening up, and economic development in the entire country. Premier Li Peng visited Shanghai after concluding his inspection of Jiangsu. Accompanied by Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai municipal party committee, and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju, Li Peng inspected the New Pudong District and Yangpu Bridge and held a discussion meeting with Shanghai comrades. Since the party Central Committee and the State Council decided in 1990 to develop and open up Pudong, Li Peng has visited Shanghai every year to inspect the New Pudong District's development and construction. Currently, initial success has been achieved in developing the district. By the end of last year, the district had accumulated over 3,100 domestic investments and over 1,600 direct foreign investments, as well as agreements on the use of $3.27 billion in foreign funds. Li Peng was pleased with the new progress. Li Peng pointed out: Shanghai is the seaport for the very long Chang Jiang. It has a vast hinterland, a strong industrial base and superiority in personnel, developed commercial establishments, and convenient transportation. We must make full use of these favorable conditions to build Shanghai into an international economic, financial, and trade center. He said: The central authorities' decision to develop and open up Pudong is unswerving. Because the district's development is currently in the construction stage, the central authorities still need to support its development through their policy, and they will maintain continuity in the policies for Pudong's development and opening up. Following the establishment of the socialist market economy, these policies will be gradually standardized and, based on China's actual situation, constructive study will be conducted. He said: To build Shanghai into an international economic, financial, and trade center, it is still necessary to vigorously develop international shipping to form an international and domestic transportation network that links all areas. It is possible for Shanghai to become an international shipping center through harnessing the Chang Jiang. He pointed out: To become a trade center, it is necessary to open up more local and external trade channels as well as to train a large group of experts in international trade. Li Peng affirmed Shanghai's industrial restructuring policy of "vigorously developing tertiary industry, readjusting and upgrading secondary industry, and strengthening primary industry." He pointed out: To build Shanghai into an international financial center, we must vigorously develop tertiary industry, particularly finance, trade, and shipping, to serve economic development in the entire Chang Jiang Valley and even the whole country. We must upgrade the structure of secondary industry and embark on constructing some large export-oriented projects of high and new technology to form a new pillar industry. As a large industrial city, agriculture should be given equal importance and strengthened, and it is necessary to effectively tackle the "vegetable basket" project. Village and town enterprises in Shanghai's suburbs must support agriculture by acting as stable agricultural production bases for the city proper. He expressed hope that Shanghai would continue to perfect the "321" policy [not further identified] in practice. Li Peng also affirmed Shanghai's plans to remodel old city areas. Speaking about Shanghai's socialist spiritual civilization, Li Peng stressed: It is necessary to give more publicity to workers, peasants, cadres, and intellectuals who possess a sacrificing spirit and a lofty moral character. As for the encouraging changes in young Shanghai students' spiritual outlook, Li Peng said: The fact that the vast number of our country's young students have combined their own future with the motherland's destiny indicates that there is great hope for the vast number of young people and our great motherland. He said: As long as we unswervingly implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, submit ourselves to the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and do practical work, Shanghai will definitely realize its magnificent goal. Persons in charge of relevant State Council departments who accompanied the inspection included Chen Jinhua, He Chunlin, Liu Jiang, Huang Zhendong, and Jiang Yunbao.
