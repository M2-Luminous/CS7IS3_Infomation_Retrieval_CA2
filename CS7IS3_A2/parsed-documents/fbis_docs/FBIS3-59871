While the populace grumbles about shortages, officials of ERIAD [five food industry enterprises, the agency that produces and imports the commodity, are peddling a very different line. Mr. Hanoun, ERIAD's marketing director for the central region, claims that 90 percent of this year's distribution plan has been implemented, noting too that between 1992 and 1993 there was a 17-percent augmentation of product availability and several new outlets were opened in remote, rugged regions. In fact, if demand had been normal--in other words equal to last year's--the total quantity of imported and domestically produced semolina would have been ample. "What has happened is that rumors and the current situation in the country have combined to allow insecurity to creep in." Mr. Hanoun said there were three principal causes. First, semolina of late has become a "blue-chip" commodity. Second, the tripling of prices of other food products has made them prohibitively expensive. Finally, private households have been hoarding as much semolina as possible to prepare for any eventual shortages. So far this year, ERIAD's central branch has marketed close to 3 million quintals of semolina, a volume that ordinarily would have been sufficient for the region, meeting the 1993 target of 3,500,000 quintals set at the beginning of the year. "We have a distribution plan that is still being implemented," Mr. Hanoun explains. "Production units are working round the clock. ENIAL [expansion not given] is also working very hard to implement the import program and more or less stabilize the market." The regional marketing director acknowledges that at present the market is absorbing all the semolina being distributed and admits the enterprise is not really in a position to go beyond its current program at this time. But he remains optimistic about next year. In fact, two mills, one at Corso and the other at Baghlia, will be going into operation. Also, the Algerian market will doubtless be inundated once the cost of imported semolina declines. Skyrocketing prices have been a factor in their own right. A 100-kg bag of semolina sometimes costs as much as 1,300 Algerian dinars, even though the official price is only 450. Our interlocutor pointed out that ERIAD is only a retailer, not a price control agency. At Tizi Ouzou, shortages began to appear about mid-August. Substantial quantities were programmed for the region but somehow never found their way to consumers. Local officials suggest the problem stemmed from household overstocking and "organized diversion" by speculators of semolina set aside for the region. ERIAD maintains it met all its targets. During the first few months of 1992, the wilaya received 484,966 quintals, whereas corresponding deliveries for 1993 were up by 15 percent to 606,159 quintals. In the west, the problem does not seem to be as acute as in the central region, since people in the western region consume more flour than semolina. The enterprise's western region branch, which has not had a single day of down time this year, produced 103 percent of its quota. Whereas the target was 2,346,000 quintals, actual output was 2,413,000. In other words, there was surplus production. In Annaba, the shortage is due in part to the purchasing preferences of some livestock producers who prefer to buy bags of semolina at 450 dinars to feed their stock rather than pay 750 dinars. Livestock producers carried off 20 percent of the production intended for households. This has been an especially acute problem in pastoral regions such as Khenchela, Tebessa, and Batna. ERIAD's manager for the eastern region sings a quite different tune. He maintains that the annual importation and distribution program was fulfilled and that the only snag was delays in merchandise arrival. An example: In October, 45,000 quintals went on the market at cooperatives and other supermarkets. The wilaya of Annaba alone said it needed about 38,000 quintals, while the other wilayas of the eastern region claimed they needed much more than that. In November, 81,316 quintals were delivered to the port of Annaba, compared to the target amount of 104,000. In 1992, for that same period, the enterprise distributed altogether 416,235 quintals, while in 1993 the volume of semolina was 510,202 quintals. The two semolina plants in the town of Guelma together produce more than 1,000 quintals per day. The actual needs of the populace are estimated at 37,000 quintals a year. The shutdown of the two plants for maintenance caused some minor shortages. Even though supply now slightly exceeds demand, people are worried. Semolina sales in September amounted to 41,500 quintals. More than 43,512 quintals went on the market in October, including 13,850 quintals of imported product. Officials say several factors are behind the prevailing mood of insecurity. Many growers marketed their crop themselves instead of through CCLS [Special Cooperatives for Grains and Dry Legumes], since a quintal of wheat costs 1,000 dinars. Also, the semolina market has been victimized by "trabendo" [black-market] operations. Traffickers in the commodity jack up the price to several times the official rate.
