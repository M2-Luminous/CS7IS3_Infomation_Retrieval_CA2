The "truth" hit home by pointing out that the British side had no sincerity for the talks and deliberately sabotaged them. Then, the British side could do nought but defend itself once again, saying that "the Chinese side often blamed the British for having no sincerity for reaching agreement on the political structure but that this was absolutely not true in reality." What, then, are the real facts? The British Side Damaged the Foundation for the Sino-British Talks On 13 April last year, China and Britain eventually decided to hold the talks for which the Hong Kong people had ardently hoped. That day, the Chinese and British Governments jointly announced their decision as follows: "According to a decision made by the Chinese and British sides after discussion, the representatives of the two governments will begin talks on 22 April 1993 in Beijing on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong according to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of converging with the Basic Law, and the relevant agreements and understandings already reached by the two sides." In short, the foundation for the Sino- British talks was the abovementioned three principles. However, the 17th paragraph of the "White Paper" flatly denied that agreements and understandings had been directly reached by the Chinese and British foreign ministers in early 1990 on the 1995 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong, saying that "there was no agreement on electoral arrangements for 1995 and the issue has been left open for future discussion." This was a brazen negation of historical facts. As a matter of fact, in early 1990, the work of drafting the Basic Law entered its final stage and the Drafting Committee would soon make its final decision on the political structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR]. Although the drafting of the Basic Law was China's internal affair, so that things would be more favorable to Hong Kong's smooth transition and to the smooth transfer of government, and also because British Foreign Secretary Hurd had expressed his hope that "an understanding can be reached on the development of the political structure before and after 1997," the Chinese side still discussed with the British side by exchanging correspondence (written messages) between the foreign ministers of the two countries. The subjects under discussion included the number of seats in the council, the composition of the Election Committee, the voting procedures in the legislature, and the nationality requirements for members of the Legislative Council [Legco]. The seven diplomatic documents which have been made public clearly show the discussion process between the two sides and the agreements and understandings which were reached. For example, regarding the number of directly-elected seats, the British held that the number of directly-elected seats in the 1991 Legco should be not less than 18, requiring that there should be 24 directly-elected seats in the first SAR Legco in 1997. According to the consensus reached by the Basic Law Drafting Committee, the Chinese side held that there should be 20 directly-elected seats in the 1997 Legco; 24 in 1999; and 30 in 2003. At the same time, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said in his letter to Foreign Secretary Hurd: "In order to realize the convergence of the political structure before and after 1997 and ensure the smooth transfer of government, the Chinese side is willing to consider the British side's idea of increasing the number of directly-elected seats from 15 to 18 in 1991." On 12 February, Foreign Secretary Hurd sent a letter to Foreign Minister Qian, the third paragraph of which reads: "I am now ready to confirm an understanding with the Chinese Government as follows. If the final version of the Basic Law specifies 20 directly-elected seats in the SAR legislature in 1997, 24 in 1999, and 30 in 2003, then the British Government is ready to limit the number of directly-elected seats in the 1991 direct elections to 18." The final version of the Basic Law specifies the numbers of directly-elected seats of the Legco from 1997 to 2003 according to the consensus of the Basic Law Drafting Committee and the abovementioned understanding between the Chinese and British sides. The "White Paper" admitted only that the 18 directly-elected seats in 1991 were arranged according to the "common view" of the Chinese and British sides. We must then ask the British side: Did the number of 18 directly-elected seats just drop from the sky? Mr Hurd, Britain's foreign and commonwealth secretary, used explicit words in expressing the understanding. The British side agreed to set 18 directly-elected seats in 1991 precisely under the precondition that there would be 20 such seats in 1997, 24 in 1999, and 30 in 2003. The four figures in the agreement reached by the Chinese and British sides were inseparably linked together with the concrete process of democracy in Hong Kong. Otherwise, the "18 seats" would become a mysterious number that could not be understood. Why did the British side only acknowledge that the 18 directly elected seats in 1991 represented the "common view" of the Chinese and British sides? People should not think that the British side still had a fragmentary memory of the agreements and understandings reached between China and Britain. No, that is not true. For the British side, it would be the best thing if this was also negated. However, if they really did this, it would be hard for them to explain the introduction of 18 directly-elected seats to the 1991 Legco election. This was the painful and embarrassing reason why the British side had to admit that the 18 seats represented a "common view" of the Chinese and British sides. In the talks, the British side was also faced with a question it had to answer. How many direstly-elected seats should there be in the 1995 Legco? According to the agreement reached by the foreign ministers of the two countries in early 1990, there will be 20 seats in 1997; so it is logical that there should also be 20 seats in 1995. The British side refused to admit this simple fact until the third round of the talks and only then very reluctantly. As another example, the issue regarding the composition of the Election Committee was discussed repeatedly. The letter of reply sent by the Chinese side on 8 February 1990 explicitly said: "The components and proportions must be arranged according to the second point of the Basic Law's Annex I because Annex I was passed by the Drafting Committee Eighth Plenary Session by a two-thirds majority." On 12 February, the written message from Foreign Secretary Hurd to Foreign Minister Qian affirmed: "I agree in principle with the arrangements for setting up the Election Committee as you propose. The Election Committee may be set up in 1995 and the details of such arrangements can be discussed by both sides in due course." In the covering letter accompanying the abovementioned message, the British side explicitly indicated that no obstacles existed to both sides' cooperation on the issue of the Election Committee and also expressed gratitude for the Chinese side's efforts in this regard. Things were written clearly in black and white and were absolutely not so vague as the "White Paper" said in that "the electoral arrangements were left open for future discussion." In the talks, the British side continually insisted that the Chinese and British sides had not reached any agreement on the composition of the Election Committee; it also indicated that the British side was willing to consider the concrete arrangements proposed by the Chinese side according to the terms specified by the Basic Law Annex I. That is to say, in the 1993 talks, the British side refused to implement the agreement and understanding reached by the two sides in early 1990 on the composition of the Election Committee and would only give consideration to the package as a concrete program proposed unilaterally by the Chinese side. Such tricks by the British side have rarely been seen in the history of world diplomacy. The British side's denial of the fact that the Chinese and British sides had reached agreements and understandings on the arrangements for the 1995 Legco elections directly shook the foundation for the talks, making it impossible for them to move along a correct course. This also fully showed that the British side was hyprocritical when agreeing to the "common foundation" for the talks. If they refused to even acknowledge the existing agreements and understandings on the concrete arrangements for the 1995 elections, how could they have any sincerity? Here, we must ask the British side: As you agreed that the talks be held on the basis of the three principles, to what specific things do the "relevant agreements and understandings reached by China and Britain" refer? Deliberately Complicating Things Shortly After the Beginning of the Talks As their name indicated, the "Sino-British Talks on the 1994 and 1995 Electoral Arrangements in Hong Kong" were aimed at ensuring the convergence of the electoral arrangements for the last Legco, the two municipal councils, and the district boards under the British Hong Kong authorities with the Basic Law and the relevant stipulations made by the National People's Congress [NPC] so that members of the three-tiered councils could remain there after 30 June 1997, thus making things more favorable to Hong Kong's smooth transition and the smooth transfer of government. Therefore, the subject of the talks was clear and definite. However, the British side deliberately complicated things in the first round by raising three subjects beyond the scope of the talks for discussion with the Chinese side. They demanded that consultation be held on the Hong Kong members of the Hong Kong SAR Preparatory Committee; that the Chines Government guarantee its support for the election of all members of the Legco by universal suffrage in 2007; and that the Chinese side be ready to use the same model of the 1995 Election Committee to form the selection committee for the first SAR chief executive in 1997 and the election committees for other chief executives after 1997. The issue of Sino-British consultation about the Hong Kong members of the SAR Preparatory Committee. The decision made by the Seventh NPC at its third session in April 1990 already specified the composition of the preparatory committee and that all its members will be appointed by the NPC Standing Committee. This is a matter within China's sovereign power and is not open to Sino-British consultation. The issue of electing all Legco members by universal suffrage in 2007. This matter will arise 10 years after the establishment of the SAR and will be decided by the SAR on its own. This point has also been explicitly specified by Annex II of the Basic Law. The Basic Law is the fundamental law of the Hong Kong SAR and Hong Kong affairs after 1997 will also be handled on the basis of, and in accordance with, the Basic Law. The issue of whether or not there should be Chinese Government support does not exist. The issue of taking the 1995 Election Committee as the model. The form of composition and the method of forming the selection committee for the first SAR chief executive and the election committees for later chief executives have all been specified by the NPC decision and the Basic Law annexes. The British side have no right to propose any unified model. The British side's intention in raising such questions was obvious. In the tactical aspect, the British tried to set artificial obstacles to the talks, stalling for time so that the talks would not be able to achieve any result before the deadline set by the British side beforehand. Thus, it would be able to find a pretext for terminating the talks. With regard to the aim of the talks, the British side not only tried to seek an electoral arrangement favorable to itself but also tried to gain more by interfering in affairs within the autonomous jurisdiction of the future SAR. Does this show any sincerity from the British side? How Did the Sino-British Talks Break Down? Here, I would like to outline the rough course of the breakdown of the Sino-British talks according to what I know. In order to break the deadlocked situation in the talks and to achieve positive results as soon as possible, the Chinese side proposed that the talks on the 1994 1995 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong be carried out in two phases. The electoral arrangements for the district boards and the two municipal councils, which should be easier to handle and were also more pressing, were to be discussed first and settled. The talks could then concentrate on the more complicated arrangements for the Legco elections. The Chinese side then took the initiative and proposed a five-point verbal understanding during the 15th round on 28 October 1993. This proposal was as follows: 1. The British side promises to keep their nature as organs without political power and functions of the district boards and the two municipal councils unchanged so that they will converge with the relevant provisions of the Hong Kong SAR Basic Law. 2. The British side agrees to abolish the relevant provisions of the regulations on the elections for the district boards, the two municipal councils, and the Legco which prevent deputies to the people's congresses at various levels in the PRC from being elected. While revising the relevant electoral regulations, the British side will continue to maintain the provision prohibiting members of the national assemblies or councils in other countries and regions, and salary-earning officials from other countries and regions, from entering Hong Kong's Legco, district boards, and the two municipal councils. 3. Both sides agree to lower the voting age from 21 to 18. 4. The Chinese side has no objection to the British side's adoption of a "single-seat, single-vote system" for the district board and municipal council elections. 5. The British side believes that appointed seats in the district boards and in the two municipal councils should be removed from the 1994 and 1995 elections. The Chinese side holds that an appropriate percentage of appointed seats be maintained in the 1994 and 1995 district board and municipal council elections; the number of appointed seats in the district boards and the two municipal councils will be decided by the Hong Kong SAR Government on its own according to Article 98 of the Basic Law, after 30 June 1997. On 3 November, through diplomatic channels, the British side handed over its draft of the Memorandum of Understanding according to the abovementioned five-point verbal proposal with an explanation which stated: The copy drafted by the British side only made an essential change to one point in the five-point proposal put forward by the Chinese side. That is, the "single-seat, single-vote" system will be applicable to the elections of the district board, the municipal councils, and also the Legco. Apart from that, the British side accepted the entire contents of the Chinese side's proposal. As for the fifth point, the formula drafted by the British side was worded as follows: 5. The British side propose that the system of appointed membership of district boards and municipal councils should be abolished with effect from September 1994 and March 1995 respectively. The Chinese side have proposed that a certain proportion of the membership of these bodies should remain appointed, pointing out that on or after 1 July 1997 the Hong Kong SAR authorities, in accordance with Article 98 of the Basic Law, will determine on their own what the number of appointed members of district boards and municipal councils should be. The above quotation showed that the British side had already accepted the solution proposed by the Chinese sideand this is evidenced by both the British side's expression and the specific wording of the copy it delivered to the Chinese side. Thus, it is expected that results might be achieved in the "separate" settlement of the electoral arrangements after the Chinese side's tremendous efforts for the proper settlement of the difficult issue concerning the appointment system. At this moment, however, the British side once again created new trouble by demanding that the voting method for the 1995 Legco elections also be written into the fourth point of the understanding. This abruptly sharpened and complicated the matter at issue. On 5 November, through diplomatic channels, the Chinese side made its initial response to the copy delivered by the British side on 3 November and indicated that an official reply would be made some time later. The Chinese side indicated: It is "improper" to extend the "single-seat, single-vote" electoral method to the geographical direct elections for Legco as the British draft suggested. The voting pattern for the Legco direct elections should be further discussed and separately arranged when the two sides concentrate the talks on the Legco electoral arrangements. The British side expressed disagreement, and stressed that the first-stage agreement must include the voting method of "single- seat, single vote" for the geographical direct elections for Legco. It indicated that this was a point of "substance" for the British side. Otherwise, it would not be a "balanced" agreement for the British side and would not be "attractive." In order to strive for an agreement and to solve the so-called "balance" issue about which the British side was concerned, the Chinese side made renewed efforts on the second day of the 17th round, proposing that the five-point understanding between the two sides might exclude the Legco electoral arrangements. The Chinese side then handed over two versions of the draft understanding for the British side to select from. After considering them, the British side said privately that it could not accept any understanding excluding the voting method for the Legco elections. Then, it flatly rejected the drafts handed over by the Chinese side. In the following plenary meeting, the negotiating representative of the British Government read a prepared statement, saying that: "From the instructions I have received, I am not authorized to continue the discussion on the first-stage understanding." Thus, the British side first departed from the negotiating table; at the same time, they continued to hypocritically express their willingness to hold the 18th round of the talks on more extensive and more complicated arrangements for the Legco elections. After that, the British side took a series of unilateral actions to finally and tightly close the door on the talks. In order to shirk responsibility for damaging the talks, the British side later even talked a lot about the omission of the words "on its own" by the Chinese side from its draft in the 17th round of the talks. Paragraph 42 of the "White Paper" says: The omission of the words "on its own" after the reference to the Hong Kong SAR Government "did not mean that the SAR Government would in future determine on its own whether or not to retain or abolish appointed seats; that decision would be for 'the Chinese side.'" This was an out-and-out distortion! The Chinese side omitted the words "on its own" in order to make the version more concise. Despite the omission, the action will still be made by the SAR Government, and the meaning of the sentence has not changed at all. As a matter of fact, when the Chinese side handed over the draft with the omission of the words "on its own," the British side did not discuss anything with the Chinese side. If in the course of discussion, the British side had demanded that the words "on its own" be written back into the text, it is believed that it would not have been hard for the Chinese side to accept this. However, as the British side had made up its mind to terminate the talks, it had no interest in further discussing anything with the Chinese side. The misleading interpretation of the omission of the words "on its own" by the Chinese side in the "White Paper" was merely a pretext that the British side later found for shirking its responsibility for undermining the talks. "Whether going up to the heavens or going down to the netherworld, nothing can be seen at all." [ancient Chinese verse quoted from unknown source] Where was the sincerity the British side advocated repeatedly? All the facts are plain: The British side stubbornly stuck to the package dished out by Chris Patten and had no sincerity at all from beginning to end; still less did it want to reach any agreement. In the talks, the British side employed the following tactics: Damaging the foundation for the talks by means of generally affirming and concretely negating the principles; trying to rediscuss agreements and understandings which the two sides had already reached; imposing subjects irrelevant to the theme of the talks, thus causing trouble for the Chinese side and stalling for time. At the same time, the British Hong Kong authorities put into practice a number of electoral affairs which should be discussed by the two sides, thus disrupting the talks. When the talks were delayed to the deadline set by the British side, it continued to find new pretexts to terminate the talks. They then proposed talks on more complicated issues in order to shirk responsibility for damaging the talks. It then brought the Patten package to the Legco "piece by piece" according to its established plan. This was the course traversed by the British side in the 17 rounds of the talks over seven months.
