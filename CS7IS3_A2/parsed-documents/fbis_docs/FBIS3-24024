Commerce Is an Art, or How Can Anyone at the External Economic Department Be Optimistic in 1994?"] [Text] A package of documents that will regulate our country's foreign economic activity in 1994 has been submitted to Ukraine's Supreme Council for consideration. It will be a continuation of work started at the end of last year, when the Ministry of External Economic Ties asked Ukraine's Supreme Council to introduce certain changes into those governmental edicts that regulate export-import relations. We turned to minister O. Slyepichev with a request to comment on the changes that will take place in 1994 in this branch, which is important for independent Ukraine. [Slyepichev] Just two years have passed since Ukraine achieved its independence, and it is perfectly understandable that now, during the period of development of our young state, we must create our own system of external economic relations with the world community. This is a quite complex process -- the system will improve in the course of years, but one thing may be said with certainty: Ukraine's external economic policy must be nationwide, clear and legally balanced, and not narrow and departmental. [Kraslyanskyy] What proposals did the External Economic Department submit to the Supreme Council and what does it primarily want to achieve this year? [Slyepichev] First is the encouragement of exports through extensively liberalizing export policy. For this, it is envisaged to abolish the double use of the nontariff (quota or nonquota) and tariff (extra-quota or taxed) regulation of exports of the same types of goods, to introduce preferred issuing of quotas to producers of corresponding products, and to improve the sale of quotas at auctions. However, it is also necessary to know how to use quotas. On last year's example, we know that our country produced more than 25 million tonnes of metal, but only about 8 million tonnes were in fact sold. In my opinion, it is necessary to establish a procedure to have quotas passed on to other exporters if they are not used within three months. Second, the provision of an effective structure of exports and the formation of imports taking into account the interests of national producers. It is extremely important to separate exports from imports, to revise the rates of customs duty on imports during barter operations, proceeding from the required supply of critical imports, especially raw materials. The purchase of those products, which are manufactured or may be manufactured in Ukraine, must be limited. I believe that it is necessary in 1994 to introduce import quotas to use our currency resources rationally. Third, it is necessary to intensify state control over external trade operations and to ensure the timely and full transfer of hard-currency earnings to the State Currency Fund. In my opinion, to this end, we must adopt a system of guaranteed settlements for highly-liquid types of products. I do not only mean preliminary payments, but also, for example, methods of closed accrediting in Ukrainian banks. When goods cross the border, such a letter of credits is opened, and the hard currency remains in our state. Besides, it is necessary substantially to reduce hard-currency accounts opened by national exporters abroad with the permission of Ukraine's National Bank and radically to revise the procedure for granting such rights. Finally, to ensure that, during our integration into the system of world trade, the state will not be answerable for the carelessness and incompetence of its exporters, it is necessary to set, on a monthly basis, indicative prices of main types of export products on traditional international markets and their minimal levels below which exports are forbidden. It is only with the help of such a complex of measures that we will be able to ensure the reduction of the trade deficit, improve external solvency, and earn hard currency in amounts sufficient for our important internal needs. [Kraslyanskyy] There has recently been much talk on establishing special conditions for exports. What is behind this talk and will there be certain restrictions to the state's advantage? [Slyepichev] I think that, in our conditions, this is a perfectly normal phenomenon. There are things that are strategically important for us: Nonferrous metals, petroleum products, precious metals, and so on, whose sale must only be in the hands of special authorized exporters. However, they must be appointed on the basis of competition. Besides, the state must also control some types of export products (weapons, metal products, or agricultural raw materials) that may earn us particularly large amounts of hard currency. In accordance with state contracts, manufacturing enterprises or individual external trade organizations will sell these goods on a tender basis with state guarantees for the deliveries from storage of enterprises to ports. All money obtained from such sales must be transferred to the state budget. This approach will only do us good. [Kraslyanskyy] Your strategy is clear, and it seems to be instrumental at this stage of economic management. However, to implement it, it may be necessary radically to change the legislative basis. Will you be proposing a new bill on external economic activity? [Slyepichev] We have a rather good law on external economic activity, and the Supreme Council did the right thing in canceling additional decrees in this sphere. Ministry specialists and scientists did their best just to introduce certain amendments, reflecting today's realities, and the law will work fine. Businessmen and business circles need, first and foremost, stability in the economic policy, and this stability may only be ensured by legislation. [Kraslyanskyy] To conclude our conversation, are you in favor of restoring the management of internal trade at a state level? How, do you think, this problem may be resolved? [Slyepichev] It is true that, today, we are criticized for creating administrations for questions of trade, but there can be no talk of returning to the old times. We are doing everything to establish order in the provision of people with basic commodities and are trying to renew everything good that we had, for example, the holding of wholesale industrial fairs, with the participation of several oblasts, where consumer goods may be purchased. However, the main thing is that there must be single norms and rules for accounting and controlling commodity circulation for all those who are engaged in trade, irrespective of the form of ownership. Trade must be carried on properly, proceeding from the knowledge of the conditions prevailing in the world, market laws, and exchange rates.
