Security sources noted that in May Israel employed 18,000 Gazans in busywork jobs at a cost of 20 million shekels. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that Faysal al-Husayni announced that the Palestinians would shortly have enough money to finance the expenses stemming from the implementation of the Gaza- Jericho agreement. The Agriculture Ministry will immediately proceed to set up a special unit to oversee the passage of produce from the autonomy to Israel. The unit will tighten controls on shipments of produce from the territories to the ultra-Orthodox community. Our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling reports that the decision to establish the unit already at this point was made at a special meeting with the agriculture minister in a bid to curb the smuggling of produce by taking advantage of the permits given to the ultra-Orthodox community which is currently observing a ritual fallow year. Originally, the unit was scheduled to be established only after the opening of the borders with the autonomy to the passage of produce.
