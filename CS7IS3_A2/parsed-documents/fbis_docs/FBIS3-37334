We are ready to withdraw it as soon as tomorrow. This is the opinion of Russian Deputy Defense Minister Georgiy Kondratyev. He flies to Tiraspol today. In a conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent on the eve of his trip, the military commander said work in "hot spots" was his official responsibility. "I should see for myself how our soldier fulfils his duties and what he needs". General Kondratyev plans to visit Russian units of the 27th division of the Volga military district who, together with Dniester Region and Moldovan servicemen, are performing peacemaking functions in the region. According to the deputy defense minister, his trip to the Dniester Region is a routine one and is not connected with any special events in the troops. However, Georgiy Kondratyev said, there is bound to be a conversation with Lieutenant-General Lebed, commander of the 14th Army, about his "recent comments". The two generals will also exchange opinions of the situation in the region.
