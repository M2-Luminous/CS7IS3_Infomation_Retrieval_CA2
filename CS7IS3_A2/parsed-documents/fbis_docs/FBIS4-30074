The commission said the report was based on a comparison of polls taken from retailers last October and a year earlier on 10 items in four categories, including confectionery, coffee, cosmetics and sports balls. The survey showed that retail prices remained unchanged for 70 percent of chocolate items imported by importing agencies and sold at department stores, the commission said. Retailers refrained from bringing down prices of these items because of rising advertising costs, it said. Prices of domestically made biscuits failed to decline because of government regulations on raw materials such as wheat and sugar. Prices declined for nearly 90 percent of imported lipstick and slightly less than 60 percent of makeup foundations which were sold at department stores. There was no major change in retail prices of domestically made cosmetics because most of them were sold at prices recommended by manufacturers, the commission said. The commission said it will continue to monitor price movements and warned makers and import agencies to refrain from resorting to excessive measures to regulate retail prices of their products.
