[passage omitted] Why recall the past?, you may ask. Whoever recalls the past.... Unfortunately, there are grounds for reminders. The mass media are reporting on preparations for military exercises in Orenburg Oblast for Russian troops with U.S. troops participating. The preparations are in full swing. Brigadier General Leonard Holder Jr., commander of the U.S. 3d Infantry Division, has already visited Orenburg in the role of quartermaster. Russian and U.S. Defense Ministers P. Grachev and W. Perry have met in Moscow. It is not hard to guess what was discussed. Specialists are arguing over how many U.S. military personnel are coming to Russia and what hardware they are bringing with them. Meanwhile it is quite clear that the generals will be accompanied by an army of advisers, umpires, interpreters, and support personnel. First, there are many facilities in the South Urals and Volga Valley region where the gaze of outsiders is undesirable. "Friendship is friendship, but it's every man for himself when it comes to tobacco," according to the Russian proverb. Furthermore, the Americans make no secret of the fact that their foreign intelligence service is operating even in their allies' states. Second, Russians have to receive and accommodate the U.S. generals with their vast retinue. Meanwhile we are experiencing a shortage of everything. It is said that the Americans will pay for everything. This is suspicious. They are so keen to get into Russia that they are not counting the cost. It has been announced that the purpose of the exercises is to rehearse collaboration between the two states' armies in the event of an attack by a third force. But who is threatening us? Where is this third force which the Russian Army would not be able to oppose independently? There is something else at work here. Representatives of Russia's military department are hurrying. It is is not understood exactly why: Whether they are afraid to be late in joining the world community's "Partnership for Peace" or whether they cannot count on winning in the event of another storming of the White House. The Pentagon's generals are also hurrying. The interest is mutual. Which is why it would have been advisable to hold the joint exercises in the United States, where society is more stable and where there is a better supply of food and petroleum oils and lubricants. But as far as is known the question of holding the exercises on U.S. territory has not been raised or discussed by anybody. Is this an accident? I think not. At one time the United States supplied Russia with canned stewed meat and corn seeds and gave advice on how to develop Russia, credits, and aid. Of course, it gave all this not for nothing but on an interest basis, and bought up shares in the most profitable sectors of the economy. In short, U.S. ownership started to appear on Russian territory. The problem of protecting this ownership arose. The Americans' desire to stick their bayonets into and raise their flag in the most vulnerable area of vast Russia cannot be explained any other way. [Signed] Candidate of Historical Sciences Ivan Bondarev Moscow Oblast, Ramenskiy Rayon, RAOS [expansion unknown] Settlement The article by Major General (Retired) V. Chudov entitled "Our Strategists Are Too Unsophisticated" (PRAVDA, 16 March 1994) provoked an avalanche of letters to the editorial office. The general impression is that the decision on joint Russian-U.S. command and staff exercises is hasty and ill-considered and dangerous for Russia's future. Maj. Gen. Chudov's viewpoint is shared by the author of the published letter, as well as by readers I. Batsik, P. Borisov, V. Goryachev, A. Babenko, S. Kuznetsov, and others.
