Thanks to the reform and opening-up policies since 1978, private businesses have mushroomed in the province and have shown their strong muscles in the intense market competition. Now the private firms are playing an ever-increasing role in the province's economic development. By the end of 1993, the number of private firms added up to 507,000, involving more than one million local residents. Most of them were farmers. The total production output value in the private sector reached 8.16 billion yuan and the taxes they have paid accounted for 7.9 percent of the province's revenue. As the private firms have extended to every industrial sector and other fields, such as industry, construction, transport, science and technology, commerce, real estate, education, culture and information services, the investment in this sector has also expanded. A recent survey shows that the average registered funds of each private firm topped 7,614 yuan in 1993, with nearly 100 firms whose total registered funds surpassed one million yuan each. Many of the private firms have now become large enterprises or group companies. The survey also shows that about 90 percent of the individuals and private firms that were set up last year were engaged in the service industry, a hefty 40 percent rise from 1992. In addition, 43 private companies have received foreign investment, and thereby became joint ventures. The products produced by the private companies have also been sold to many foreign countries, such as the United States, Canada and the Republic of Korea. So far, the gross commodity retail sale of the private sector is about one fourth of the province's total. The rapid development of the private sector not only drives the province's economy to a new height, but also promotes its social progress. Li Anmin, a private business owner in Jiexiu County in central Shanxi and also a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, has in past few years donated 7.53 million yuan (866,000 U.S. dollars) to develop local education.
