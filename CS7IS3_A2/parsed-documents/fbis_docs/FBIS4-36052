His Royal Highness Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, the foreign minister and chairman of the session, delivered an address at the opening meeting in which he said: [Begin al-Faysal recording] [passage omitted] Brothers, while we are holding this periodic session of ours, our brothers in fraternal and neighboring Yemen are facing difficult and painful conditions resulting from the outbreak of disputes between the brothers. This led to this country and its people, which is dear to all of us, entering a whirlwind of violence and internecine bloody fighting, causing a large number of Yemeni victims every day in both the north and south. At the same time, the installations and potential of this country are being subjected to destruction. From the start, the GCC member countries sought to urge our brothers in Yemen to work for what is likely to spare fraternal Yemen the horrors of war and internecine fighting, and in so doing member countries supported the various mediation efforts, and took the initiative, through several contacts with the leaderships of the two parties to the conflict, to warn them against the dire consequences of the escalating disputes between them, and to incite them to seek understanding and concord between them. However, despite all the efforts and mediation, matters have taken a grave turn and reached the point of armed confrontation between the brothers in a bitter conflict that makes hearts feel pain. [passage omitted] What must be always present in our minds while we discuss this matter is that the internecine fighting can in no way entrench or protect unity. Quite the contrary, because the persistence of bloody confrontation can only create rancor and lead to deepening estrangement and differences. It will also undermine the bases on which the foundations of harmony and understanding could be built. If, in its Resolution No. 924 of 1 June 1994, the UN Security Council has stressed the eagerness of the international community to secure stability and an end to the fighting in Yemen, this eagerness is stronger in the GCC. Therefore, our council must issue an affirmation that the continuation of the fighting is not acceptable to us, whatever the cause and source. Likewise, continuation of the fighting will have repercussions on the GCC member countries, which will lead to the need for member countries to take measures concerning this escalating situation. [passage omitted] [end recording] [Announcer] With regard to relations with Iran, his highness said: We have not been able, until now, to find in Islamic Republic of Iran's policies anything that can put trust and reassurance in our minds, which would be by Iran's commitment to international conventions based on mutual respect and noninterference in other states' internal affairs. His highness the foreign minister expressed the Council's member states pleasure at the beginning by the Palestinian brothers of a new era of effective practice of their national rights on a part of their territory, following the agreement signed in Cairo in Dhi al Qi'dah 1414 AH, corresponding to May 1994, for taking over authority in Gaza and Jericho from Israel. On the situation in the Republic of Bosnia Herzegovina, his highness said: Although only a short time has passed since we expressed our optimism regarding the agreement reached by Muslims and Croats with regard to setting up a union between them, we see now the Serb's continuation in their oppression and aggression against Bosnian Muslims, and their defiance of the successive resolutions of international legality for bringint to an end the Serbian aggression and protection of the safe Bosnian areas. After this, the opening session was adjourned.
