FR941006-0-00029 FR941006-0-00010 21 CFR Part 556 Tolerances for Residues of New Animal Drugs in Food; Ivermectin AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a supplemental new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Merck Research Laboratories, Division of Merck & Co., Inc. The NADA provides for use of a 1 percent ivermectin injection for cattle for the treatment and control of gastrointestinal roundworm, lungworm, grub, lice, and mange mite infections. The supplement provides for revised tolerances for residues of ivermectin in cattle tissues. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Melanie R. Berson, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;135), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1643. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Merck Research Laboratories, Division of Merck & Co., Inc., P.O. Box 2000, Rahway, NJ 07065, is sponsor of NADA 128&hyph;409 that provides for the use of Ivomec ® 1 percent Injection (ivermectin) for cattle for the treatment and control of gastrointestinal roundworm, lungworm, grub, lice, and mange mite infections. The supplement provides for revised tolerances for residues of ivermectin in cattle liver of 100 parts per billion (ppb) and revised safe concentrations in cattle muscle of 120 ppb, in liver of 240 ppb, in kidney of 360 ppb, and in fat of 480 ppb. The supplement is approved as of September 12, 1994, and the regulations in 21 CFR 556.344 are amended to reflect the approval. The basis of approval is discussed in the freedom of information summary. Currently, §556.344(a) (21 CFR 556.344(a)) provides identical tolerances for ivermectin residues in cattle and reindeer. With the approval of this supplement, those tolerances will no longer be identical. Therefore, §556.344(a) will reflect the revised cattle tolerances and new §556.344(d) is established to reflect the reindeer tolerances. In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and §514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), this supplement does not qualify for marketing exclusivity because the supplement does not contain reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant. The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(1)(i) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 556 Animal drugs, Foods. Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and redelegated to the Center for Veterinary Medicine, 21 CFR part 556 is amended as follows: PART 556_TOLERANCES FOR RESIDUES OF NEW ANIMAL DRUGS IN FOOD 1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 556 continues to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 402, 512, 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 342, 360b, 371). 2. Section 556.344 is amended by revising paragraph (a) and by adding new paragraph (d) to read as follows: §556.344 Ivermectin. * * * * * (a) Cattle . The marker residue used to monitor the total residues of ivermectin in cattle is 22,23-dihydro-avermectin B 1 a. The target tissue selected is liver. A tolerance is established for 22,23-dihydro-avermectin B 1 a in cattle of 100 parts per billion in liver. A marker residue concentration of 100 parts per billion in liver corresponds to a concentration for total residues of ivermectin of 240 parts per billion in liver. The safe concentrations for total residues of ivermectin in uncooked, edible tissues of cattle is 120 parts per billion in muscle, 240 parts per billion in liver, 360 parts per billion in kidney, and 480 parts per billion in fat. * * * * * (d) Reindeer . The marker residue used to monitor the total residues of ivermectin in reindeer is 22,23-dihydro-avermectin B 1 a. The target tissue selected is liver. A tolerance is established for 22,23-dihydro-avermectin B 1 a in reindeer of 15 parts per billion in liver. A marker residue concentration of 15 parts per billion in liver corresponds to a concentration for total residues of ivermectin of 50 parts per billion in liver. The safe concentrations for total residues of ivermectin in uncooked, edible tissues of reindeer are 25 parts per billion in muscle, 50 parts per billion in liver, 75 parts per billion in kidney, and 100 parts per billion in fat. Dated: September 29, 1994. Robert C. Livingston, Director, Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation, Center for Veterinary Medicine.
