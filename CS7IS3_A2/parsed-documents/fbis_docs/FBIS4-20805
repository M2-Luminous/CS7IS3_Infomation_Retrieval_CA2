Ferhat: "Weapons for the Killers"] [Text] The recent seizure of weapons aboard an Algerian vessel has revived questions about how arms are getting to Algeria. Neither the official Algerian news service, which first reported the seizure, nor the broadcast news service, which showed pictures of the weapons seized, has provided any further information on the subject. No information has been released regarding date or place of the seizure. All we can be sure of is that the weapons were destined for armed terrorist groups active in Algeria. And it is not the first time. Some countries known for overt collusion with the Islamist movement appear to be behind this illicit trafficking, which they encourage, either directly by supplying arms or indirectly by providing the funds to purchase them. Leaders of the dissolved FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] received arms delivery offers from several countries following the interruption of the electoral process, and even much earlier. Heading the list were Iran and Israel. The numerous weapons of Israeli manufacture (Uzi) found in the possession of terrorists arrested by security services--for example, in connection with last year's attack on Boughezoul barracks--have confirmed that Israel was involved, at least indirectly. Iran, which gave its full support to the emergence on the national scene of the now-dissolved FIS, had no scruples at the time about selling it--with Israel's approval--Uzis acquired during its war with Iraq. The $3 million, which the Terrorist International, made available to the FIS last year on the eve of Ramadan was used to pay for the acquisition. Other countries are suspected of serving as intermediaries or directly financing weapons purchases for armed groups active in Algeria. The prime minister, Mr. Redha Malek, openly criticized certain European countries last December for their reckless statements about Algeria, even going so far as to point out to them that some of the arms purchases for Algerian terrorists are made in Europe. Also, during the trial of the authors of the attack on Algiers airport, one of the defendants clearly and directly implicated one of the major hubs of international terrorism--Sudan, in this case--in financing weapons purchases for armed Algerian terrorist groups. While the involvement of certain countries in financing arms purchases for Algerian armed groups may be taken as firmly established, a measure of uncertainty still prevails regarding the involvement of other countries in transporting these weapons to Algeria. On several occasions, Algerian security services have focused on the Moroccan connection, and President Liamine Zeroual, before his investiture, noted the threat on the country's western borders. In 1991, Moroccan security services reportedly signed with their Iranian counterparts an accord that would make Morocco a transit center for African fundamentalists. This report--which authorities have never denied--appears to have been well-founded, in that several armed individuals have since been intercepted by Algerian security along the border between Algeria and Morocco. There was also the Libyan connection, in particular the fact that the wilaya of Illizi on the Moroccan border has served as a drop point in recent years for Libya-based smugglers. The cooperation afforded by reputedly "fraternal" countries in transporting arms destined for terrorist cells was for a time of such serious concern that consideration was given to closing the borders with those two countries, especially the Moroccan border, which was reopened in 1988 during the Chadli presidency. Many of the facts about the security forces' recent seizure of arms on a ship flying the Algerian flag are still hidden from view, but it is a good bet that in the end the truth will not come as a big surprise to anyone...
