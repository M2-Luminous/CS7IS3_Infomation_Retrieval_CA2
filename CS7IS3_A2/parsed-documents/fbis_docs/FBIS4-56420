In an interview published in the latest issue of the Spanish weekly LA TRIBUNA, the Cuban leader said: "The blockade has caused billions of dollars in losses to our country's economy. We estimate them at $10 billion." Castro said, "If we have been able to resist for 35 years, we can certainly resist another 25," adding, "The United States and the industrialized countries have always dictated economic and trade policy to poor countries." The revolutionary leader said he expects no significant change in U.S. policy toward Cuba, because "it has preferred to continue harassing the island with an economic boycott that in no way benefits the United States but, rather, seriously hurts Cuba's civilian population." Castro said he believes "an end to the blockade would only help Cuba in terms of medical equipment and the pharmaceutical industry," because "the United States has increasingly less to offer Cuba." As for payment of the foreign debt, the Cuban president said, "The debt should be forgiven because this would benefit the United States, international trade, and all other countries." He added, "I am certain that the U.S. foreign debt is larger than that of all Latin American countries put together." Fidel Castro also said, "A nearly unanimous consensus is building on the issue of the foreign debt and the impossibility of paying it, particularly in terms of the unjust and intolerable demands imposed on Third World countries by organizations such as the IMF and U.S. banks." The Cuban leader, 67, said he has no worries about his country's fate after he departs from the presidency because there are "many people prepared to ensure continuity in our country, a country that is developing day by day through the efforts of genuine Cubans."
