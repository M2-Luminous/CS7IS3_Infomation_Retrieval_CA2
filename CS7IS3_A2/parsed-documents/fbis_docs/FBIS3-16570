He said a social charter is needed to supplement the agreement on the economic alliance designed to offset the burden of ruptured economic links inside the former Soviet Union which was "built like one huge factory." Shumeyko, who urged the search for new forms of cooperation within the Commonwealth in the cultural, economic, political and military fields, said a new legal infrastructure was needed to remove barriers from the path of economic and financial cooperation.
