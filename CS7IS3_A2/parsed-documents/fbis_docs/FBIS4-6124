FBIS4-6124 "dreas074__a94001" FBIS-EAS-94-074-A Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Tokyo Not To Sign Accord on Creation of WTO Tokyo Not To Sign Accord on Creation of WTO OW1504095094 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 14 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 9--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1504095094 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] It was learned on 13 April that Japan will not sign the accord on establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) at the ministerial talks of the multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round) which are being held in Marrakech, Morocco. The government has decided that Japan will sign the final agreement document of the Uruguay Round, but will not sign the accord on the creation of the WTO out of consideration for the ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] which is still opposed to the opening up of the Japanese rice market and out of the need for Japan to avoid signing the accord before the Diet begins deliberating it for approval. The decision shows how fragile the coalition government is. In the case of an ordinary treaty, the government signs the treaty and each signatory to the treaty ratifies it after obtaining approval from the parliament. The WTO accord, made up of 18 agreements, which is high on the agenda of the Marrakech ministerial talks, is to follow that procedure. The final agreement document, which Japan will sign, is merely a piece of paper. It confirms that "the accord on the creation of the WTO is a sum of the results of negotiations at the Uruguay Round" and makes it mandatory for each signatory to submit the accord to its parliament and the accord will take effect on 1 January 1995. Therefore, Japan's refusal to sign the accord will have no specific impact on it unless the Diet refuses to approve it in its autumn session. Japan has attached importance to multilateral treaties and its refusal to sign the accord is "regrettable," (says a government source). Like Japan, the United States will sign the final agreement document, but will not sign the accord because the U.S. administration has yet to obtain approval from Congress on individual agreements including an agreement on lowering tariffs. The European Union (EU) will sign the accord. However, the EU member nations are feuding over which side should have the authority to sign the accord -- the European Commission or member nations. Their dispute is still pending in the European Court. Japan, the United States, and Europe have been at a loss over how to deal with the accord and this confusion shows that agreements hammered out at the Uruguay Round are the outcome of domestic compromises of each negotiating nation.
