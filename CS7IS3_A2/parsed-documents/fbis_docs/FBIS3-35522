While the final casualty toll is still unknown, Palestinian sources reported a short while ago that 31 people were killed. PLO Executive Committee member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh said about 130 people were killed or wounded. Monte Carlo radio correspondent in the occupied territories reported that according to an initial count, 26 people were killed and more than 70 wounded. An Israeli Army spokesman said that only 10 Palestinians were killed when an Israeli settler opened fire at the worshipers inside the mosque. Commenting on the massacre a short while ago, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat said: [Begin recording] I do not absolve the Israeli Army from responsibility, because it is known that the Israeli Army posts guards at and around the entrances to the Ibrahimi Mosque. How did it allow armed settlers to enter the mosque while people were performing the dawn prayers? There is some sort of collusion. This has serious implications. Everyone must realize that the blood of our people is not without its price. The blood of our people is precious. These faithful worshippers were fired on while they were performing the dawn prayer at the Ibrahimi Mosque. I cannot but call on the entire world--the cosponsors of the [Madrid] conference, the permanent members and all other members of the UN Security Council, the EC, the nonaligned states, the Arab states, and the Islamic states--to shoulder their responsibility. I call in particular on the cosponsors of the conference, who signed the peace agreement with us. What kind of a peace is this they are talking about when crimes have not ceased against our people and the killing is continuing. [end recording] Commenting on the massacre also, PLO Executive Committee member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh said: [Begin recording] The Rabin government and the occupation army shoulder full responsibility for this crime. No peace can be achieved in the Palestinian territory as long as one settler remains on this land. These are criminal gangs and one of the tools of occupation. They must leave the Palestinian territory, with the occupation. The PLO regards this big crime as a very serious turning point. Complete protection for our people must be ensured, and this protection cannot be provided by the occupation forces. [end recording]
