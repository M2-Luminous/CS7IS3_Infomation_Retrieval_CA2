There were indications that the "top secret" report produced documentary evidence of Armenia-PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] ties. Noting that Armenia directly supports the PKK, the report showed that PKK militants are being trained in 13 Armenian villages. Stating that members of the Kurdish minority in Armenia are being encouraged and given money to join the PKK, the report claimed that the Armenians are also acting as mediators with Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria to secure arms and ammunition for the PKK. The report claimed that in improving PKK's ties with Armenia, ASALA [Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] laid the groundwork for the establishment of PKK bases in that country. Explaining that Armenia's aim in helping the PKK is to oppress the Kurdish people living in eastern Anatolia, the report said: "In the long-term, this country aims to isolate the PKK and, using the popular base in the region, to realize the illusion of a greater Armenia."
