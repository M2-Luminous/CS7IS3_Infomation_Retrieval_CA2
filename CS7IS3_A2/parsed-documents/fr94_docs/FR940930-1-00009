FR940930-1-00009 FR940930-1-00004 ASTA, the nation's largest travel agency trade association, filed a petition for rulemaking. ASTA urged us to adopt an express prohibition against the inclusion of lost booking fees in liquidated damages clauses. ASTA alleged that American Airlines' Sabre system was continuing to use such contract clauses since American argued that its contract terms were consistent with our rules. ASTA proposed that we amend ยง255.8 of our rules by adding a subsection that would prohibit a vendor from requiring a subscriber to pay liquidated damages to the extent that the damages enable the vendor to recover from the subscriber the booking fees that the vendor would have obtained from participating airlines. Two vendors, Worldspan and System One Direct Access, filed answers supporting ASTA's petition, while American opposed it. American asserted that its contract provision was merely a means of enforcing its productivity pricing formula, that the Department determined in the rulemaking that productivity pricing (a form of pricing that reduces a subscriber's CRS fees when it increases its use of the CRS) was permissible, and that the American contract provision as a practical matter could not keep an agency from using another system. The Department invited other persons to file comments on ASTA's petition. 58 FR 41068 (August 2, 1993). In response, System One, Worldspan, Delta Air Lines (a Worldspan partner), Air France, and three travel agencies (Hewins Travel Consultants, Travelbound, Inc., and WTT, Inc., d/b/a Woodside Travel Trust) filed comments supporting ASTA's proposal or similar restrictions on vendor subscriber contracts. American again opposed such proposals. Apollo Travel Services, the marketing arm of the second largest U.S. CRS, Galileo, stated it was taking no position on ASTA's proposal but took issue with WTT's alleged misdescription of Apollo's subscriber contracts. In its comments the Orient Airlines Association asked us to begin a rulemaking on other CRS issues. However, ASTA has moved to withdraw its rulemaking petition on the ground that American had agreed with ASTA that in future subscriber contracts American would substitute an actual damages clause for a liquidated damages clause and that American would give its subscribers the option of replacing the liquidated damages clause in their existing contracts with an actual damages clause. American would take these steps within thirty days of our dismissal of ASTA's rulemaking petition. Since American's agreement had eliminated the cause of ASTA's request for a rulemaking, ASTA wishes to withdraw its petition. Despite ASTA's request for withdrawal, System One and Worldspan contend that ASTA's agreement with American should not keep us from proposing new rules on subscriber contracts. They contend that American could demand lost booking fees as part of its actual damages and that American's productivity pricing formula requires subscribers to guarantee that American will receive booking fees during the term of their contracts. WTT, a consortium of very large travel agencies, initially filed a pleading opposing ASTA's motion to withdraw its petition. However, WTT later stated that it wished to withdraw that opposition. WTT, which prefers market solutions to business problems, has learned that American is willing to negotiate changes in its subscriber contracts with some agencies. In WTT's opinion, this means that regulatory action is no longer necessary. We will grant ASTA's motion to withdraw its petition for rulemaking, and we will terminate this proceeding. We do not believe that we should begin a rulemaking of the kind sought by Worldspan, System One, Delta, and the two smaller agencies at this time, even though their comments have cited practices by American and Apollo that may be troublesome. However, we do not now have detailed knowledge on the effects of our revised CRS rules, which became effective less than two years ago, nor on other changes that may have affected the operation of the CRS and airline businesses. Rather than begin a rulemaking, we prefer to begin an informal investigation into these issues. In that investigation we are seeking information from vendors, airlines, travel agency groups and individual agencies, and other persons with knowledge of CRSs and related airline marketing issues. That investigation should give us sufficient knowledge to determine whether we should propose changes to the rules and, if so, what kind of changes, just as our last rulemaking relied heavily on the examination of the CRS business undertaken by the Secretary's Task Force on Competition in the Domestic Airline Industry. Airline Marketing Practices: Travel Agencies, Frequent Flyer Programs, and Computer Reservation Systems (February 1990), cited at 57 FR 43782. As part of that informal investigation, we are issuing an order requiring the vendors to provide us with certain information and inviting vendors, airlines, travel agencies, and other interested persons to meet with our staff to discuss the issues. Our dismissal of ASTA's petition, of course, will not prevent us from instituting a new rulemaking on CRS issues if we find one warranted. Issued in Washington, D.C. on September 26, 1994. Patrick V. Murphy, Acting Assistant Secretary of Transportation for Aviation and International Affairs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24167 Filed 9&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;62&hyph;P
