I. Analysis of Future of China's Grain Trading in the World Market A basic question to ask before discussing how China's "re-entry in GATT" will impact on China's grain system is: Looking ahead, will China be importing or exporting grain? In 1962-1991, China imported a total of 157.231 million tons of grain, at an average rate of 5.42 million tons annually. Looking ahead, and basing our estimate on the 1962-1991 average annual grain import rate of 5.42 million tons, China's grain imports will reach 50 million tons by the year 2000. We came to this conclusion after analyzing the following grain supply and demand trends in China. (A) Analyzed from the standpoint of grain demand, the factors which influence grain demand increase are increase in population and rise in per capita income. China's population by century's end will be close to 1.3 billion. The annual population increase will add an additional grain demand of 3.15 million tons, using as estimates 200 kilo of grain consumption per capita and an annual increase of 15.75 million people. Rise in per capita income will also increase demand for grain. In many developing countries in the Asia Pacific area, the elastic rates of demand for grain relative to income range between 0.4-0.9; based on our analysis, China's elastic rate of demand for grain relative to income is 0.6. In recent years, the adjusted rate of our national economic development has been 8 percent, suggesting that the per capita income has also increased by a similar margin. Even the lowest estimate puts the rate of increase at 5 percent. Using the following formula for calculating the rate of grain demand increase: D = P + eg <sup> 1</sup> (in which D is the rate of grain demand increase, P the rate of population increase, g the rate of per capita income increase, and e the elastic rate of grain demand relative to income), therefore D = 1.4 percent + 5 percent x 0.6 percent = 4.4 percent. (B) Analyzed from the standpoint of grain supply, the 3.1 percent average annual rate of increase in 1950-1975 dropped to 2.9 percent in 1975-1985, and further to 2.2 percent in 1985-1992. The rates of grain supply increase are trending downward. It is estimated that by century's end, China's grain output will reach 520 million tons, with an average annual rate of increase of 1.9 percent. The reasons the rates of increase are dropping are: 1. Decreased amount of farmland under cultivation. From 1957-1991, a total of 243 million mu of farmland were taken out of cultivation, an average of some 7 million mu per year. 2. Decline in soil quality in farmland under cultivation. According to statistics of China's Second Soil Quality Survey, the proportion of phosphorous-poor land was 59.1 percent of all farmland under cultivation, the proportion of farmland lacking potassium was 22.4 percent, and the proportion of farmland lacking both ingredients was 13.8 percent. Farmland with less than 0.6 percent of organic contents constituted 10.6 percent of the total area under cultivation. 3. Aging water conservancy facilities. A majority of water conservancy facilities were built in the 1950-1960 era, and all of these are aging. In 1978, only 55.4 percent of the irrigated farmland was irrigated by motorized or electric means; in 1991, it was 57.8 percent, an increase of only 2.4 percent in 13 years. 4. Prospects of increasing fertilizer use to boost grain production are not bright. The reasons are: a) In 1991, fertilizer use in China per hectare of cultivated land already reached 249 kilo, which is close to the fertilizer usage standard of developed countries, and further increase in the use of chemical fertilizer will not marginally increase grain productivity by much. b) Slowing down of peasant income increase means peasants lack the purchasing power to buy chemical fertilizer. Summarizing the above, the rate of grain supply increase by the year 2000 is likely to be around 2 percent. Thus, the rate of grain demand increase in China will exceed the rate of grain supply increase, with a differential of 2.5 percent between the two. The gap between supply and demand by the year 2000 will be 50 million tons, requiring on average an annual import of 5.55 million tons, or over 50 percent of the world's grain exports. Looking ahead, therefore, China will likely become one of the world's largest grain importing countries. This is the basic finding in our analysis of the impact of "re-entry in GATT" on China's grain system. Impact of "Re-entry in GATT" on China's Grain System For a long period of time, world grain trade has not been subjected to control by the basic principles and regulations of GATT. Countries with developed market economies have all extended large financial subsidies to grain production by imposing quota or tariffs on grain imports and by subsidizing grain exports. Since the 1970's, developing countries have changed from subordinating grain producers in the interest of industrial development to protecting the former. Among Asia's most rapidly developing economies of Japan, Korea, China's Taiwan Province, all of them are now paying large subsidies to grain producers. This is by no means accidental. 1. Comparing grain production with manufacturing production, the former has a long production cycle, slow capital turnaround, low utilization rate of fixed assets, and very slow transfer of values. Manufacturing industries, on the other hand, have a short production cycle, fast turnaround of capital, high utilization rate of fixed assets, and rapid transfer of values; furthermore, manufacturing industries can, by enlarging the scope of manufacturing or increasing the number of factories, expand the overall scale of production, and can manipulate the time factors involved to expand the scope of production. Grain production, however, is limited by the area under cultivation, which allows little leeway for expanded production, and even less in terms of shortening the time frame required for grain production. 2. Grain production is easily exposed to ravages of weather, plant diseases and pests, and the ratio of input and output in production can usually not be guaranteed. On the contrary, manufacturing industries are seldom the victims of seasonal weather or natural disasters. 3. The price elasticity in grain supply and demand is not only lower than that of manufactured products, but also lower than those of other economic crops and animal food products. In terms of the elastic theory of supply and demand, the less elasticity in supply and demand, the greater the changes in prices linked to changes in fixed supply or demand. Therefore, [to deal with grain imports after China's re-entry in GATT] government interventions will be necessary not only within China, but at its borders as well. 4. The rate of grain price increase is slower than that of manufactured products. This is because manufactured products have numerous processing outlets, and with the completion of each processing cycle, prices are increased accordingly. Even if grain were to undergo further processing, however, the scope of processing would be limited and the rate of subsequent price rise rather slow. China will therefore have to support [its domestic] grain prices. Summarizing the above, it is our judgment that China must stand on the principle of grain self-sufficiency and, since coordination on a worldwide basis is lacking, China must take steps to protect its own grain producers and to intervene in grain imports and exports at the border. This is a basic principle China must adhere to after "re-entering GATT." (A) Beneficial Effects of "re-entry in GATT" on China's grain system. 1. The ultimate objective of the GATT negotiations is to promote free trade worldwide; only with free trade can capital be most efficiently allocated on a worldwide basis, which in turn can provide the impetus to individual countries to expand and develop production. Trade protectionism however interferes with efficient allocation of capital. At present, China's grain trade is basically not being protected. China has very low tariffs on grain, and in particular, none on the import of husked rice. China poses no obstacles to any negotiations to reduce tariffs on grain imports. After China's "re-entry in GATT"; however, world market grain prices will likely rise across the board. According to analyses of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, if trade restrictions were eliminated by all developed market economy countries, prices of wheat would rise by 20 percent, coarse grain by 16 percent and husked rice by 14 percent. If free trade were engaged in by all wheat-trading countries, world market price of wheat would rise by 11 percent, and market price fluctuations reduced by 35 percent2. Based on our analysis, if the United States eliminated grain export subsidies, world grain prices would rise by 10 percent.

In 1984-1985, U.S. subsidies were very low, and U.S. grain exports as a proportion of the world export market were only 35.7 percent, but with world grain supplies thus reduced, grain prices shot up; b) if the United States eliminated export subsidies, world grain prices would rise by 10 percent. Therefore, after China "re-enters GATT," and assuming all the grain exporting countries eliminated export subsidies and trade restrictions (though elimination per se is extremely difficult to carry out), then world grain prices would generally rise; and if China's grain enterprises were operating by market mechanism, domestic grain prices would also rise and this would benefit China's grain producers. 2. In terms of the overall multilateral trading system, however, China as a country also exports agricultural products, and with the gradual relaxation of agricultural protectionism, China's agricultural products will gain a larger share of the world market. In addition, with the lifting of trade restrictions, prices of world agricultural products will rise which will increase the export earnings of China's agricultural products. As an indirect consequence, China's peasant income will also rise, which will lead to greater inputs and accelerated development in grain production. B. Detrimental Effects of "Re-try in GATT" on China's Grain Output 1) China's main grain import is wheat. In 1991, wheat imports totalled 12.37 million tons, accounting for 92 percent of all grain imports that year. But China's wheat market price is higher than the world market price. In 1992, China's domestic wheat price was $146.55 per ton, while the world market price (i.e. U.S. Chicago future price) was $126 per ton.3 Yet, the quality of China's wheat is lower than that of imported wheat. The wheat-to-flour ratio of China's wheat is lower than the United States by 7-8 percentage points. Assuming that all tariffs and non-tariff barriers were eliminated by wheat trading countries, the world market price of wheat would rise by 11 percent to $140.6 per ton, calculated on the basis of the 1992 world market price of $126 per ton. That price will still be lower than China's domestic wheat price. Therefore, after "re-entering GATT," China's wheat production will face the difficulties of high price and low quality. Large quantities of wheat from abroad will pour into China, invading our domestic market and causing our wheat market price to drop. China's wheat producers will be the victims. 2) China is a major importer of world grain; in 1991, China imported 13.45 million tons of grain, paying $1.64 billion in foreign exchange. After "re-entry in GATT," if world grain prices were to rise by 11 percent, then China would have to pay a total of $1.8 billion. Based on the 5.8 [yuan to the dollar] exchange rate, China's consumers will be paying 1.044 billion yuan more than before China's "re-entry in GATT." The government will also be sacrificing its precious foreign exchange reserves. 3) At present, a majority of grain are procured and sold by the government. Prices are also set by the government. This therefore severs any linkage between the domestic market and world market. Turbulence in world market grain prices cannot be transmitted to China itself. After "re-entry in GATT," however, China's domestic grain market will be linked up with the world grain market, and thus the latter's price turbulence will be felt inside China; this linkage will increase the rate and extent of grain market turbulence and add to the cost as well as difficulties of macro regulation and control on the part of the government. 4) After "re-entry in GATT," large quantities of grain from abroad will pour into China and greatly lower our domestic grain prices. This will reduce the peasant labor inputs in grain production and generate more surplus labor to add to the already large pool of surplus labor. III. Main Policy Recommendations For Before and After China's "Re- entry in GATT" A. Protect domestic grain producers It is our judgment that China's "re-entry in GATT" will have greater detrimental than beneficial impact on China's grain system, and that unfavorable effects will outweigh favorable ones. We should therefore make use of those GATT articles which operate in China's favor to strengthen protection of and subsidy for our grain producers. B. Strengthen border interventions in grain trade China's tariffs on grain imports are very low; there is none on rice. In the circumstances where China's grain prices are close to or exceeding world market prices, China should carry out import quota control by continuing the system of issuing import permits. Although GATT Article 11 prescribes that: "Any contracting party will not establish or maintain quota, export or import permit or other measures to control or restrict the import of products from territories of other contracting parties, except for purposes of collecting taxes and other expenses," a GATT-prescribed "protective article" does allow the contracting parties to control both the quantities and values of goods permitted for import in order to protect the importing countries' external financial positions and international revenues and expenditures. On the basis of this article, China can utilize non-tariff measures or other means to control imports of grain from aboard in order to protect China's grain producers and other trades utilizing surplus labor. C. Quicken the pace of grain market reform From the standpoint of the fundamental principles of GATT, the essence of GATT is to promote a system of free trade based on market-oriented economy. From the perspective of this basic principle, there is still great disparity between that goal and China's current grain market reforms. Although some one-half of China's provinces and municipalities have freed their grain markets, the basic system at present is still a "dual-track system." If we want to re-enter GATT, we must quicken the pace of market-oriented reforms. D. Implement the linkage between China's domestic grain market and the world market. To carry this out, we need to take the following concrete steps: 1) We should encourage grain export organizations and domestic grain enterprises to develop toward a market economy. We should establish and perfect a sales and service network oriented toward the world market. 2) We should adjust the composition of grain varieties and raise the quality of grain for exports. China now exports coarse grain, soybean and maize. Because their qualities are rather low, they lack international competitiveness. In pricing, we should differentiate quality by price. We should increase the area for cultivation of high- quality rice, soybean and maize. We should apply one unified international standard for all grain exports, and abolish the present dual domestic and international standards. 3) In grain production, we should import high-grade varieties and advanced techniques from abroad and raise both these areas to international standards. E. Quickly establish and perfect a two-stage system of grain reserve and storage. In order to complete the linkage of China's domestic market to the world markets, where turbulence in world grain prices will be transmitted to China's domestic market, we need to establish a domestic grain reserve and storage system which will alleviate the impact of imports due to world grain price fluctuations. In summary, only if we conscientiously complete our preparatory work before re-accession in GATT will we be able, after entering that organization, to minimize the adverse impact it will have on China's grain system.
