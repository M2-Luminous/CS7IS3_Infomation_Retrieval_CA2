Speaking at the conference, Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, member of the secretariat, and president of the Central Party School, stressed: We must use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as the guide in studying new developments and problems in party school work under the new circumstances, to achieve unity in understanding, to strengthen leadership, and to comprehensively deepen education reform in party schools to bring about a new stage in party school education. Hu Jintao discussed five issues: 1) further clarifying the new situation and tasks facing party school work; 2) persistently using the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to guide party school work; 3) deepening party school reform, and comprehensively raising the standards of party school work; 4) building a contingent of better-qualified teachers as the key to running party schools successfully; 5) earnestly strengthening the party committee's leadership over party school work. Hu Jintao pointed out: In this crucial period of historical development, and in the face of a new situation and new tasks, we must, more than at any time in the past, attach greater importance to the party's ideological and theoretical construction; to using Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and especially Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the entire party; and to train and improve the vast number of cadres and raise the qualified personnel needed in our times. Hu Jintao said: Training cadres requires the efforts of the entire party in many areas, and party schools at all levels shoulder particularly important responsibility in this regard. Closely integrating the practice of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization; arming leading cadres with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; bringing up a theoretical backbone force; and conducting theoretical study and propaganda constitute the fundamental tasks of the party school in the new situation. They are also the basic requirements put forward by the party central committee on party school work. We must carry out the training, rotational or non-rotational, of leading cadres in active service and strive to improve their skills in finding solutions to basic political, economic, social, and cultural issues in the new period and their ability to command the overall situation, operate the socialist market economy, foster material, cultural, and ideological progress, and handle complicated contradictions. We must earnestly carry out the training of young cadres, strengthen the training of theoretical backbones, and do a good job of theoretical research and propaganda. Hu Jintao looked at, from 10 aspects, the guiding ideology, basic requirements, and work principles needed to strengthen cadres' education and theoretical work which were put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in light of the new situation facing the party and the new tasks it shoulders. He pointed out: From either the immediate or long-term perspective, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's series of expositions is of extremely great significance as a guide for us in successfully conducting party school work in the new period. When we stress the strengthening and improvement of party school work, we must first concentrate our efforts on using the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to guide party school work. Hu Jintao stressed: The key to raising the standards of party school work lie in deepening reform. The general requirements for party school reform are: Using the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the guide; focusing on efforts to vigorously improve teaching quality; strengthening scientific research and using it as the foundation; more successfully upholding the policy of integrating theory with practice; closely integrating the practice of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization; correctly understanding and grasping the law governing the work of education for party cadres in the new period; gradually establishing a sound party school education system, scientific research system, and management system with Chinese characteristics; further improving party school operations; and more satisfactorily serving the need to train qualified leaders for the party, the need for theoretical construction, the need for scientific decisionmaking by party committees and governments, and the need for reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. Hu Jintao pointed out: To further improve party schools, we must pay closer attention to and seriously strengthen the building of a contingent of teachers. We must make concrete and relentless efforts to build a contingent of better- qualified teachers in sufficient numbers in accordance with the requirement to raise their standards, improve their makeup, maintain a stable backbone force, and train qualified successors -- to build a contingent of teachers who are capable of upholding the party's basic theory and line and upholding unity between the emancipation of the minds and seeking truth from facts, who are good at studying the new situation and correctly answering new questions, and who possess strong party spirit and Marxist study style and are worthy of the name of teacher. Hu Jintao concluded: To earnestly strengthen the party committee's leadership over party school work, we must concentrate on doing three tasks well: 1) The building of leading bodies. We must select a group of comrades who have a better grasp of Marxist theory, possess rich practical work experience, and are enthusiastic about the role of party school education in strengthening the leading bodies of party schools. In addition, we must strengthen the building of ideology and work style among the leading bodies. 2) We must ensure that party schools are operated in the right direction. 3) We must help party schools resolve major issues related to their work. Hu Jintao fully affirmed the arduous efforts and important accomplishments made by comrades on the party school education front. He urged them to further pluck up their pioneering and enterprising spirit and work hard to explore new paths of party school education with Chinese characteristics to enable party schools to play a greater role in the drive to build socialism with Chinese characteristics.
