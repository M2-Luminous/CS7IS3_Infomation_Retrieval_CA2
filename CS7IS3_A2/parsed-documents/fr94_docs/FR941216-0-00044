FR941216-0-00044 FR941216-0-00012 Three letters were received within the comment period. A summary of the comments and NMFS' response follows: Comment 1. The proposed delay of the roe season for the offshore component pollock fishery will have a positive economic effect by increasing the chance that pollock will be harvested when roe quality and yield are best and the price is highest. Response. NMFS agrees that a delay of the offshore component pollock roe season should have positive economic benefits and has approved the action. Comment 2. The proposed 10-day delay of the opening date to February 5 for nonCDQ vessels that are used to participate in other fisheries before January 26 sufficiently addresses concerns about the potential for increased fishing effort in other fisheries prior to this date. Response. The proposed rule requires vessel owners/operators to choose between participating in the offshore component pollock fishery during the period January 26 through February 5 or participating in other fisheries between January 20, the start of the BSAI trawl season, and January 26. Those vessels used to fish for BSAI or GOA groundfish or BSAI crab prior to January 26 are prohibited from entering the offshore pollock roe season until February 5. This prohibition does not apply to vessels used to participate exclusively in the BSAI pollock CDQ program prior to January 26. NMFS agrees that this prohibition addresses the intent of the Council to significantly reduce the incentive to participants in the offshore pollock fishery to enter other fisheries prior to January 26. This prohibition, therefore, was approved as part of the rule implementing the proposed delay of the offshore pollock roe fishery. Comment 3. The proposed action precludes pollock catcher vessels from participating in other fisheries prior to January 26 simply because they choose to participate in the offshore component pollock roe fishery. As a result, the proposed action takes away fishing opportunity that currently exists and should not be implemented at this time. Response. NMFS acknowledges that limitations on the participation in other fisheries prior to the opening of the offshore pollock fishery could reduce potential revenues of vessels used to target on more than one species during the pollock roe season. This rule prohibits vessels from participating in other fisheries prior to January 26 if the vessels' owners/operators wish to participate in the offshore component pollock fishery prior to February 5. Nonetheless, NMFS has approved this limitation after considering the intent of the Council to minimize the preemptive impact on other fisheries that could have otherwise resulted from the delay of the offshore pollock roe fishery. Changes From the Proposed Rule This final rule has been corrected to redesignate paragraphs to correspond to Federal Register format. The final rule also is revised from the proposed rule to clarify the intent that vessels used to participate in the CDQ pollock fishery before January 26 are not subject to the 10-day prohibition on entry into the offshore component pollock fishery for vessels used to fish for BSAI or GOA groundfish or BSAI king or Tanner crab prior to January 26. Classification NMFS prepared a FRFA as a part of the RIR. A copy of this analysis is available from NMFS (See ADDRESSES ). This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 675 Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: December 12, 1994. Charles Karnella, Acting Program Management Officer, National Marine Fisheries Service. For the reasons set out in the preamble, part 675 is amended as follows:
