"The Hebron massacre forces us to accelerate this process," Beilin declared to the press after his meeting with Secretary of State Jakob Kellenberger. The latter assured him of support from Switzerland, which will open an office in Jericho soon to assist in West Bank reconstruction. Mr. Beilin also met with Flavio Cotti, head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, for 45 minutes. In the afternoon, he was scheduled to meet with the presidents of the Foreign Affairs Committees of both Chambers. The deputy minister reconfirmed Israel's commitment to peace, six days after the slaughter in Hebron in which 52 Palestinians were killed by a Jewish settler. In the near future, the release of 900 Palestinian prisoners and the disarmament of Jewish extremist settlers should help calm the situation. In the long term, the establishment of a Palestinian police force in the territories will enable the reinforcement of peace and security, the Israeli deputy minister stated. The Settlers Will Stay Mr. Beilin, however, declared himself opposed to the withdrawal of Jewish settlers from the Occupied Territories. He also said that he considered Switzerland a "model" state, particularly for its military organization and its experience in the field of humanitarian commitment. Inspired by Switzerland, Israel plans to open a hospital in Angola. For his part, Jakob Kellenberger assured Beilin that Switzerland would support Israel's efforts toward peace and economic development in the West Bank. Both men discussed the allocation of 60 million Swiss francs, promised to Israel last year, for reconstruction in the Gaza Strip and in West Bank. Office in Jericho Moreover, Mr. Kellenberger and his guest agreed to open a Swiss office in Jericho in the near future which will coordinate efforts to develop the region economically. Mr. Beilin and Mr. Kellenberger also "reached an agreement" concerning Israel's request to access records on Jewish refugees who were expelled from Switzerland during World War II. An agreement also was reached on opening an information office in Israel on the European Eureka research project. In conclusion, Mr. Kellenberger said that many questions pending since his visit to Israel last May were settled. The secretary of state will travel to Syria and Egypt next May.
