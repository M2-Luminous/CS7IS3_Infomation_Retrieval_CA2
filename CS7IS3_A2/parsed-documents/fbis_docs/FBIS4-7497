[Arben] In this matter, we want the Albanians to be a constitutive element. We ask Macedonia to cultivate a democracy of consensus. We see the possibility for equality in constructing special institutions of education, culture, and so on, as well as a kind of a broader autonomy for the communes, according to European standards. [Dzambazovski] Do you mean communes according to the map of the so-called "Ilirida?" [Arben] To be honest, I do not know what that map looks like, but I know that the people who have engaged themselves in that matter have a grotesque approach to policy. I know that the man elected for president of such an autonomous region is now president of a parallel branch in Gostivar. That makes it clear how much those people with their list of wishes are lacking in seriousness, and they do not know the mechanisms. [Dzambazovski] Compared to your faction? [Arben] First of all, we are not a faction, we are the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity]. The answer to your question is positive because we are a serious party and serious politicians. [Dzambazovski] You mentioned equal representation of the Albanians in the institutions. In number, from the professional viewpoint, or how? [Arben] I have a different approach. A historic agreement is needed. Without such an agreement we can continue the agony and waste our energy. History shows that after such agreements a period of great stability has come about in many countries. It is easy to operate after an agreement. [Dzambazovski] If there is such a climate and if your proposals are acceptable? [Arben] It is wrong to think that. The agreement will certainly stop the confusion. The Europeanization of the region is our long-term goal, while our short-term goals are issues that we can solve through policy, like the introduction of institutions into the Albanian way of life, starting from kindergarten. [Dzambazovski] Does this imply that you think the Albanians are endangered? [Arben] I think we are. There have been many decadent processes within the Albanian people, which must become a concern of the Macedonians, too. [Dzambazovski] Do you personally feel you are endangered? [Arben] I can be very flexible as an individual, and when I feel I am endangered, I can slow down. However, we are changing the identity of the collective -- the cultural identity, which is not the same as that in Albania, where there are all the necessary institutions, or in Kosovo, where there used to be such institutions. We are endangered because we do not create values, and we create bad values, wasting our time on vain projects. I think there are many political goals that we can realize without including the Macedonian political factor. We shall work toward conquering that political space, we shall create values that depend exclusively on ourselves. We must introduce into the Albanians' lives institutions that must not present an obstacle for any political party, because we shall be engaged in our own political space. Outside the Macedonian Space? [Dzambazovski] However, you cannot bypass the Macedonian parliament, speaking of such issues. [Arben] That is why we are taking one step at a time. We must reach a historic agreement, and the way to do so is through terms that we shall have to agree on, about who is going to create what. We are not asking to enter the Macedonian space. [Dzambazovski] It sounds like creating parallel institutions in the state. [Arben] No. I am talking about the fair competition that we must have, from culture to sports. The Macedonians in the area where they are dominant are competitive, and thus new values are created. However, the Macedonians in western Macedonia, for instance, are the same as the Serbs in Kosovo -- they are not competing, because they are "genetically disposed" to having the values, to being employed, to getting a flat, and so on. The Macedonians in eastern Macedonia have to strive to achieve the same advantages. It is absurd, but it is true that the Albanians have a better understanding with the Macedonians in eastern, than in western Macedonia. It is no wonder that the Macedonians in the western part are working hard to maintain the present relations between the Albanians and the Macedonians. I also wish to say that the danger for the Macedonians does not come from the Albanians or Albania, but from Serbia and Bulgaria, which only sees the country in terms of territory. [Dzambazovski] It is true that official Albania supported your faction in the long process of divisions within the PDP. Why? [Arben] That is how it looks from the outside. If we analyze the pictures, we come to that impression. Albania's influence I think, must be relevant in Macedonia, because it is a stabilizing factor in the Balkans, and it affects some stabilizing political processes. I think we have the right to communicate with the political factors in the Balkans, particularly with Albania. [Dzambazovski] Yet, you did not say why Albania supports you. [Arben] Certainly because we are more serious and because we have constructed a political vision for Macedonia, without projects like just employment in the system's institutions. [Dzambazovski] However, it is true that the PDP is an indigenous party, active in Macedonia with its program. [Arben] Yes, it is true, but the PDP also asks for legitimacy in the Albanian tissue in the Balkans, and that is natural, as it is for the Macedonian parties related to the diaspora. I think that if we have the support of Albania, we are on the right road, because the whole Albanian political course in the Balkans has demonstrated political maturity in the latest crisis. [Dzambazovski] There is one view that the affair of the paramilitary formations of Albanians in Macedonia lies behind this support. [Arben] That is political intrigue. And finally, why do you not talk about the so-called affair with those who are involved in it -- some Albanians and the Macedonian authorities, who certainly know more. Taci and I, as well as the others, have no connection with it. [Dzambazovski] Why do you make so many remarks regarding the work of the delegates and ministers? [Arben] There is a transition going on in Macedonia, but with people who used to be in positions, including the Albanians. It is a kind of a silky communist transition. Our demands are deeply human, they are not irrational, and we hope to find people who think the transition must be better. Tensions must be avoided. [Dzambazovski] Can they also be created by you? [Arben] Yes, if Macedonia does not establish a European system of values. Then such tensions arrive. We shall ask for support from the foreign factor, and we shall ask for the right to self- organization, which starts with the political organization of the political structure. We will gain efficiency in our political activity if there is a strong political organization, a public one. At this stage we are trying to strengthen a political structure that was not strong. There was a political elite in the system, and the other political subjects were on the fringes, for instance the delegates who have much stronger political semantics. [Box, p 15] "If There Is a War in Kosovo, I Shall Volunteer" The vice president of the faction, Menduh Taci, also made a statement at the interview with Arben Djaferi. Here is a part of that statement: "I stated the following for the London OBSERVER: If there is any destabilization, it will be as a result of the Macedonian authority's mistake, the Macedonians, because the Macedonians are the majority. "Some Greek Dzambazovski asked my opinion about the name of the state. I said that the citizens of Republic Macedonia must decide about the name, and that the Albanians should be included in the dispute with Greece. "The Albanians do not want bloodshed. The Macedonians should know who their friends are. Certainly not Serbia, nor Bulgaria, because it does not want to hear of the existence of the Macedonian people, and we know about Greece. So who is left? "We are constantly accused of being radicals. I shall say, in principle -- in constitutional and legal principles, if we have agreed on a matter, we want to have a definite term for its realization. If the Government wishes to make policy with `representatives of the people,' it is doing its people wrong. The times of such tricks belong to the Turkish era. "Will we organize assistance and volunteers if there is a war in Kosovo? It is not just a positive answer, but I also state that I, personally, will go to Kosovo as a volunteer -- that is my right and nobody can stop me. "The issue on autonomy will depend on the Macedonian parliament and the attitude of the Macedonian authority. And `Ilirida' is an empty project of delegate Mersim Polozani, from the time when his rating was decreasing. "The document shown by Naser Ziberi on A1 Television Broadcast looks like a `headquarters document of Lazar Mojsov.' Let us see the record -- it is not my signature, neither are the alleged tasks for cooling down interethnic relations, and so on. Nevertheless, I do not want to sue him, because I do not want to adopt his or Djeladin Murati's manners. "It is a public secret how Muhamed Halili became a candidate and how he won the elections. I conducted the campaign. If he thinks he has confidence in the constituency now, let him come, we shall present a candidature."
