These questions are answered by Sergey Mikhaylovich FURGAL, candidate of medical sciences, assistant in one of the departments of the Military Medical Academy in St. Petersburg. ``For 8 years now specialists in the department of military and general epidemiology are working on systematic validation of the principles of immunocorrection to prevent influenza, acute respiratory infections, sore throat, acute pneumonia, and suppurative skin diseases. We studied how epidemics break out in large organized groups of adults. A similar situation is found in kindergartens and schools. There always are so-called frequently sick individuals in every group. They usually constitute 15-17 percent. But, as a rule, they account for 60-80 percent of morbidity and, mainly, play a deciding role in development of an epidemic. We also considered the fact that many pathogens of infectious diseases against which there are no vaccines circulate among the people. After all, sore throats, pneumonia, and acute respiratory viral infections can be caused by the most varied viruses or bacteria. Furthermore, in a patient, both the infection proper and adverse ecological conditions, as well as the not uncommon stresses at the present time, weaken immunity first of all. This is why we are searching for effective agents to prevent infectious diseases among products that can enhance resistance and improve the immune status of the body. We have examined about 10 different drugs. And we decided on thymoline (thymogen), a peptide preparation. This bioregulator turned out to be the most physiological, safest, and does not require special supervision during intake. For example, when dibasol hydrochloride is used to prevent influenza blood pressure has to be monitored. But thymogen can be taken by anyone independently. There has not been a single case of allergic reaction to it or any other adverse side-effect. Preventive intake of thymogen in specially developed doses solves three problems: --to enhance immunoresistance of large population groups, lower morbidity and complications in groups, as well as absenteeism; --to correct immunity deficiencies in people who are often sick for long periods of time, and improve their health; --to enhance the immune response to inoculations (for example, influenza vaccine) with possible lowering of vaccine dosage and longer persistence of immunity. If an individual takes at least three thymogen injections along with vaccine, his resistance to influenza stays high for about 2 years. Unfortunately, once in a while there are items in the press to the effect that all interventions in the immune system are harmful. This is an unwarranted fear. Our many years of observation indicate not only that cytomedin-bioregulators are entirely safe, but also that thymogen is of enormous benefit to people, with its significant preventive efficacy. How is thymogen taken? What is better, injections or nose drops? Both routes are effective. But hypodermic injection maintains the appropriate level of resistance to disease for about 8 months, but not from the very first days. In drop form, thymogen has an immediate action and is active for about 2 months. For an essentially healthy person, it is enough to instill 0.5 ml solution in each nasal passage for 3 days at the start of the seasonal rise in respiratory diseases. It is beneficial to do this for people returning to work after a leave, children when they start kindergarten or school after vacation (the dosage is the same for all). Of course, thymogen should be instilled as a preventive measure if sick cases occur in a group or at home, or if one experiences early signs of malaise. Those who are sick frequently, weakened after surgery, or stress can use thymogen for up to 10 days. After 2 months, instillation for 3 days can be repeated if necessary (for example, when a new wave of respiratory disease is expected, or when going to work on a farm). But even if one gets sick, the disease will be overcome sooner and without complications under the protection of thymogen.''
