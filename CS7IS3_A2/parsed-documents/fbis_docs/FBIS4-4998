If the United States invokes sanctions, such as imposing high tariffs on selected goods, in line with the Super 301 provision, it will face international criticism. Moreover, U.S. consumers will suffer damages from the difficulties in importing goods subject to sanctions. An event in the Japan-U.S. construction talks proves that it is not easy for Washington to invoke sanctions. During the talks, the United States began to take the steps necessary to impose sanctions, but it twice postponed the implementation of sanctions. It eventually did not invoke sanctions because an agreement was reached with Japan in January. In short, the Super 301 provision is a tool to obtain concessions from a trading partner by threatening sanctions. A nation such as Japan, which is still on the threshold of "adulthood," is not immune to such trade tactics. We can see the evidence in the recent cellular phone talks. The "National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers" released by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] is one such tactic. Although it is a regular annual report, this year's edition focuses its attention on Japan, a nation with a huge trade surplus. The report stresses Japan's uniqueness, in referring to the stalled Japan-U.S. framework trade talks. It notes that the USTR will specify the market sectors that are subject to the application of the Super 301 provision unless improvements are made within six months. We know that the current U.S. domestic situation has forced the Clinton administration to adopt a hardline strategy on trade. While calming down Congress, where there are many who take a tough stand toward Japan, the administration has to secure the support of labor unions to prepare for an off-year election in November. The opening of Japanese markets will be necessary for the United States to boost its exports and to maintain the growth of its economy. Nevertheless, the U.S. hardline tactics are not only unfavorable but also dangerous. Although U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor evaluated highly the U.S. strategy in negotiations with Japan over cellular phones by saying that it would set a good precedent for future negotiations, the president of Japan Motorola expressed regret. He said: "The image of our company has suffered (because of our many demands in the cellular phone negotiations). It was a mistake." President Clinton should listen to what he has said. Even if the United States assumes by any means an advantageous position in negotiations, deals with Japan will not necessarily be smooth. Not only Japan but also other Asian countries have deepened their distrust of the United States for its selfish trade tactics. What worries us more is the possibility that the United States' threatening to impose sanctions will develop into a trade war between Japan and the United States. If a trade war occurs, it will become a drag on the world economy, which is still in the doldrums. Following the issuing of the trade report, Washington has reportedly been considering taking hardline steps in some sectors as early as the end of April. While refusing to resume the framework trade talks, the United States is considering taking hardline steps. The nation lacks a broad view and is concentrating more on domestic issues. We hope that the United States will change this attitude. The great trade imbalance between Japan and the United States stems from the cyclical factor of different economic trends, as well as from structural factors. While Japanese products enter the United States, which is a nation of overconsumption, regulations and business practices that bar foreign products from entering this country have taken root in Japan, which is a nation of excessive savings. President Clinton once said the United States was to blame for most of its trade deficits. Both Japan and the United States need to make efforts to rectify the trade imbalance. It seems that the Clinton administration thinks that although Washington has struggled to reduce its budget deficits by implementing such measures as unpopular tax hikes, Tokyo's efforts are lacking. This assertion is understandable, but it is also true that Washington has not carried out its task of increasing savings. The tasks to be undertaken by Japan have been discussed many times. For the moment, it should work to formulate effective economy-boosting and market-opening measures by the end of June. Japan must take bold actions to ease trade frictions with the United States.
