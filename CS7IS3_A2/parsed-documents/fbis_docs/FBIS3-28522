"The Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) play a very important function in the welfare of the people," said Soares before leaving for Denpasar to attend the inauguration of the new Bali-based Udayana regional military commander. He said ABRI's territorial operation in East Timor was different from those in Europe which was mostly aimed at military purposes. Noting that several western countries have often misjudged ABRI's role in the province, the governor said, "They view the presence of the troops as a violation of human rights." According to him, the East Timorese in fact welcome the troops stationed there in order to maintain security and train the residents in skills needed to develop the province. He believed the Western countries would be very surprised to learn that ABRI soldiers did not carry any weapons but a mattock instead. "The troops work with the locals to build roads, farms, churches, mosques and other places of worhip." The governor stressed that the provincial administration and residents have never objected to the presence of ABRI troops. "It is always the Westerners that like to create an issue," he added. However, Soares also said the troops would be pulled out gradually unless the locals wanted otherwise. "If they are still needed, they will stay," he said, adding that the troops would be withdrawn completely by 1995, on condition that the province showed progress.
