In a statement addressed to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and members of the Security Council, the Commission urged that action be taken "immediately" by the international community to deal with such attacks and other human rights violations. It did not specify what type of action should be taken. The Commission, which considered resolutions put forward by the European Community and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, said it wanted an end to "ethnic cleansing" and other acts of genocide in the former Yugoslavia, diplomats said. The statement called Saturday's mortar attack which left at least 68 dead and nearly 200 injured a "deliberate and unconscionable" act which was "despicable and outrageous" and called for "firm and resolute action to be tkaen immediately by the international community." The Commission also called for an end to the rape of women, the siege of Bosnian towns and the bombing and massacre of civilians and it demanded that "war criminals" be put on trial. The statement came ahead of a meeting Thursday [date as received] of the NATO council in response to a request by Butrus-Ghali for NATO backing to deter any repetition of the massacre, possibly including the use of airstrikes against Serb positions around the city.
