It has all the prerequisites to make a breakthrough into space. We have the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau at Dnepropetrovsk and the Yuzhmash, which is known to just about everyone. There are many of its special facilities with different capabilities, a National Space Agency has been established and there is a fairly good record of scientific accomplishments. In the not distant future plans call for putting a Ukrainian satellite, the "Sich," into orbit. There is least of all any desire to be exotic or to surprise the world. What is most important is the implementation of a grandiose project for remote sensing of the Earth. "Recently the method for aerospace monitoring of the state of the environment is being used more and more widely," says Vadim Lyalko, corresponding member of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, director of the Center for Aerospace Study of the Earth of the Geological Sciences Institute, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. The scientists of the Ukraine, within the framework of the "Ukrkosmosresursy" and "Kosmos" projects, have developed and tested original methods and equipment which during sensing in the ranges from ultraviolet to microwave make it possible to solve many ecological problems. These include, for example, an estimate of water saturation of the soils, rise of the water table and salinization of soils, detection of active fault zones, sectors of damage to oil, gas, heat and water pipelines, lands and water bodies polluted by heavy metals, nitrates and petroleum products, search for underground water sources, oil-gas and ore deposits, weather prediction and much else. For the complete space monitoring of the Ukraine it is necessary that the photographs carry multisided information on the geoecological state both of its territory and the territories of other countries. The members of the Scientific Council for Study of Natural Resources by Remote Methods, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, are dreaming of the implementation of such a project. Right now, however, as reported by V. Lyalko, specialists on remote sensing of the Earth have gone further. A survey from a satellite, even our own, is still not enough. In order to have complete information it is necessary to establish a network of surface stations for the reception and processing information because geoecological conditions constantly change. Accordingly, within the framework of the national space program five centers are being established, each of which will carry its own functional load. The developers were supported by the government of the Ukraine, purchasing and distributing modern computers and processing equipment to the centers. Surface stations have received the capability, for the time being in research and experimental modes, for testing space information processing methods. The work is held back by the fact that it is necessary to "hire" satellites from Russia and the United States and these services are expensive. But in the future, when the "surface-space-surface" ring is closed, the routine information collected by the "Sich" satellite will certainly become as necessary as statistics. The developers, like all the people, are dreaming and ideally see a picture such as this: at each oblast center (initially, but later in a still denser network) there will be a display from which specialists will receive not only necessary information on the geoecological state of the region, but also recommendations on the adoption of decisions in the case of accidents, calamitous events, etc. For the time being the project can be carried out only to the extent that funding or the availability of a material base allows. However, foreign countries also are highly interested in these "scraps." Professor Lyalko stated that fairly good cooperation is being organized with American and French specialists and the Arab countries, for example, have been interested in the end product of routine remote sensing. Israel would not mind receiving assistance from the Ukrainians in the search for deep (up to 100 meters) water. To put it briefly, cash on the barrel head is being asked. It remains to get it, that is, for developing and introducing unprecedented technology. However, the mastery of space by oneself is an expensive and slow business. The cooperation of countries here has very good possibilities. Understanding this, specialists at the Center for Aerospace Study of the Earth are striving to organize mutually advantageous contacts with Russia and other foreign partners. Together with Russian colleagues and with the participation of scientists in the United States and ten other countries in the world the Ukrainians are working on the implementation of the very interesting "Priroda" project. It provides that in late 1994-early 1995 a module with the most modern and perfected instrumentation will be constructed which will link up with the Mir orbital station and with which with time a solution will be found for mankind's problems of space monitoring of the Earth.
