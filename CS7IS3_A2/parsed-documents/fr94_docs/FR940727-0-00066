FR940727-0-00066 FR940727-0-00025 (f) Exhibits. (l) Attach a copy of all relevant documents. This is ``core information'' required by Executive Order No. 12778 (Civil Justice Reform). Unless otherwise directed by HQDA, each exhibit should be tabbed and internally paginated. References to exhibits in the litigation report should be to page numbers of particular exhibits. (2) Copies of relevant reports of claims officers, investigating officers, boards or similar data should be attached, although such reports will not obviate the requirement for preparation of a complete litigation report. (3) Prepare an index of tabs and exhibits. (4) Where a relevant document has been released pursuant to a FOIA request, provide a copy of the response, or otherwise identify the requestor and the records released. (g) Distribution and number of copies. Unless HQDA directs otherwise, SJAs or legal advisers will mail (first class) an original and one copy of the litigation report to the responsible HQDA office (See §516.15 of this part) and one copy to the U.S. Attorney's Office handling the case. If possible, record the litigation report onto a magnetic diskette, using either WordPerfect, Enable, or ACSII, and send it to Litigation Division. §516.24 Preservation of evidence. Because documents needed for litigation or administrative proceedings are subject to routine destruction, the SJA or legal adviser will ensure that all relevant documents are preserved. §516.25 DA Form 4. (a) General. The DA Form 4 (See Figure C&hyph;2, Appendix G, of this part) is used to authenticate Army records or documents. Documents attached to a properly prepared and sealed DA Form 4 are self-authenticating. (See Fed. R. Evid. 902). (b) Preparation at the installation level. A DA Form 4 need not be prepared until the trial attorney presenting the government's case identifies documents maintained at the installation level which he will need at trial. Once documents are identified, the custodian of the documents will execute his portion of the DA Form 4. (See Figure C&hyph;2, Appendix G, of this part). The custodian certifies that the documents attached to the DA Form 4 are true copies of official documents. Documents attached to each form should be generally identified; each document need not be mentioned specifically. Only the upper portion of the form should be executed at the local level. (c) Actions at HQDA. Upon receipt of the DA Form 4 with documents attached thereto, HQDA will affix a ribbon and seal and deliver it to the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army. That office will place the official Army seal on the packet. §516.26 Unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury. (a) General. Under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. l746, whenever any matter is required or permitted to be established or proven by a sworn statement, oath or affidavit, such matter may also be established or proven by an unsworn written declaration under penalty of perjury. Because such declaration does not require a notary or other official to administer oaths, individuals preparing statements for use in litigation should consider using this format. (See Figure C&hyph;3, Appendix G, of this part). (b) When executed within the United States. Place the following at the end of the witness statement: I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. (28 U.S.C. 1746). Executed on (Date)␣␣␣␣(Signature) (c) When executed outside the United States. Place the following at the end of the witness statement: I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America that the foregoing is true and correct. (28 U.S.C. 1746). Executed on (Date)␣␣␣␣(Signature) Subpart D_Individual Liability §516.27 Scope. This subpart guidance when DA personnel, as a result of the performance of their official duties, are either sued in their personal capacity, or are charged in a criminal proceeding. Examples of civil actions alleging individual liability include the following: a medical malpractice lawsuit against health care providers; suits resulting from motor vehicle accidents; constitutional torts; or, common law torts such as assault, libel, or intentional infliction of emotional distress. Likewise, state or Federal criminal charges can arise from the performance of official duties, including environmental crimes or motor vehicle accidents. §516.28 Policy. (a) General. Commanders, supervisors, and SJAs or legal advisers will give highest priority to compliance with the requirements of this chapter with regard to current or former DA personnel who face criminal charges or civil litigation in their individual capacity as a result of performance of their official duties. (b) DOJ policy on representation. If in the best interest of the United States, upon request of the individual concerned, and upon certification by his agency that he was acting within the scope of his employment, DOJ may represent present and former DA personnel sued individually as a result of actions taken within the scope of their employment. Representation can be declined for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to the following: the employee was not acting within the scope of his office; there is a conflict of interest; or, actions were not taken in a good faith effort to conform to law. §516.29 Federal statutes and regulations. (a) Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). (28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671&hyph;2680). A waiver of sovereign immunity which, with certain exceptions, makes the United States liable for tort claims in the same manner as a private individual.
