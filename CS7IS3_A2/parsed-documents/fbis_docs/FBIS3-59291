This step was a very directed one, being a sound strategy for rectifying the previously existing chaos in the financial and the revenue-taxation orders, as well as a key step in intensifying financial and revenue-taxation reform, which is going to play a key role in ensuring the sustained, rapid, and sound growth of the Chinese economy. Zhu Rongji's statement touched off widespread interest and admiration both in China and abroad, with public opinion favorable but still posing certain questions. I have recently received letters from certain friends, asking for my comments on several current problems and growth trends in the Chinese economy. So I am taking this opportunity to express my personal views, in response to my friends who are concerned about China's economic problems, and as instruction for all experts and academics. New Conflicts and Problems Under Current Conditions In 1993, China's economy has continued to grow rapidly on the heels of 1992's 12.8-percent growth, with the first half of 1993 seeing GNP up 13.9 percent over the same period in 1992, retail commodity sales up 21.6 percent, fixed assets investment up over 60 percent, foreign trade continuing to expand, a bumper summer-grain harvest, and urban and rural incomes also growing very quickly, for a generally good state of affairs. While these are generally established facts, there is no use denying that the advances have also seen the appearance of certain new conflicts and problems. Some of these are quite glaring ones, such as investment being too large in scale and irrational in structure, too much currency put into circulation while capital supply remains tight, increasing inflationary pressures and too sharp price rises, and revenues being in a rather grim state, all of which problems merit much attention. The appearance of these problems is directly related to the chaos in the financial and the revenue-taxation orders, such as the illegal lending among financial institutions, the chaotic fundraising at high interest rates by all parties, the construction on a scale larger than capability, the new shops and projects going up everywhere, the casual misuse and takeover of agricultural funds and priority construction-project funds, the willful reduction and exemption of taxes and interception of state revenue, and the banking and the revenue and taxation sectors exploiting their own facilities to operate various types of economic entities in search of departmental interests, as well as being affected by macroeconomic regulation and control steps not having kept up in a timely fashion during the course of conversion from the old system to the new. So rectifying our financial and our revenue-taxation orders, by enforcing financial and revenue-taxation discipline, intensifying financial and revenue-taxation reform, and tightening our macroeconomic regulation and control measures, has become a top priority, being a smart countermeasure for promoting sound growth and a good cycle for our national economy. The "Few Simple Rules To Be Observed by All Concerned" Have Begun To Show Results Have these "few simple rules to be observed by all concerned" been effective? My view is that they have. Let us take a look at the results of their application in the last few months. 1) Illegal lending has been curbed. Of the funds illegally loaned by all financial institutions, some has been and some is being recouped, basically by the set 15 August deadline. This was a key step in restoring and establishing a normal financial order. 2) The wave of chaotic public fundraising at high interest rates has been stopped, with the additional raising of deposit interest rates having brought a clear rebound in urban and rural savings deposits, in which individual savings deposits in banks increased as much as 10 billion yuan in less than 10 days. The previously very slow sales of treasury bills are now satisfactory, with their treasury payment rate already topping 90 percent. This has had a very good impact in reducing currency put into circulation, as well as in ensuring the prompt payment of the funds needed for industrial and agricultural production and infrastructure construction. 3) All areas are now inventorying and dismantling the financial institutions that were set up without PBC approval, strictly enforcing the provision that nonfinancial institutions may not provide financial services. The various economic entities set up by banks and revenue-taxation departments at all levels are in the process of being dislinked, with the injection of new credit capital having been stopped. Meanwhile, all revenue credit loans are being inventoried, with recoupment as necessary. 4) We have stopped the enforcement of the tax reduction and exemption provisions drawn up by all areas beyond their authority, strengthening tax collection and control. We have strictly controlled spending demand, particularly cutting back on group purchasing power demand, with all areas and sectors acting conscientiously. A general investigation of national finance and taxation organized by the State Council is about to begin. It is not hard to see from a summary of these results that while the "few simple rules to be observed by all concerned" have been in effect for only a very short time, they have begun to succeed. Of course, while we still need to do much work and are faced with a difficult mission, I believe that if we continue to act in such a down-to-earth manner, by making rigorous demands, strictly enforcing orders and prohibitions, intensifying reform, and tightening macroeconomic regulation and control, it will not be long before our financial and revenue-taxation orders will get back on a normal track, which is precisely the prerequisite needed for building a socialist market economy system. We Are Certainly Not in a Financial Crisis Some friends have asked: Is China in a financial crisis? I hold that this is not so, as the facts certainly do not support it. As rectifying our financial order, enforcing financial discipline, examining work flaws, and pushing forward with financial reform have been to strengthen and improve our financial work, in order to more effectively bring the macroeconomic regulation and control role of finance into full play in our overall national economy, we are certainly not in any financial crisis. While we need to acknowledge that China is now facing inflationary problems, this is occurring while our economy is growing rapidly and our people's real living standards are rising steadily, as well as appearing while our national economic might is increasing and our market commodity supplies are abundant, which is fundamentally different from the conditions arising in some countries with economic recessions and declining living standards, such as large amounts of currency being issued beyond economic capability, skyrocketing prices, and sharp currency devaluation. 1) As our currency issue is now under strict central government control, being controlled by the demands of overall national economic operations, serious inflation will not and cannot occur. 2) While our national-average retail price and cost of living indexes both reached double digits for the first half of 1993, our real urban and rural incomes increased even faster. The data corrected for inflation show real incomes up an average of 13.5 percent for city dwellers and about 7 percent for rural individuals. The RMB still has very high prestige among the vast public, proof of which is that urban and rural savings increased 124.4 billion yuan in the first half of 1993. 3) China's foreign payment capability is reliably ensured, and our international prestige is high. The recent temporary foreign-exchange conversion-market supply and demand imbalance and sharply rising exchange rates were touched off mainly by market speculation, which was unusual. Most recently, through our rectification of the financial order and tightening of macroeconomic regulation and control, our exchange rates quickly fell back, and are gradually getting onto a normal track. This shows that China is certainly not in a financial crisis. Foreign Investment Has Not Been Affected Other friends have asked: Might not rectification of the financial order, tightening of macroeconomic regulation and control, and strict control of fixed assets investment affect investment in China by overseas entrepreneurs? I hold that while such concern is understandable, the reality will not occur. China's policy of opening up to the outside world is unshakeable, our large market is very attractive, and our preferential policies on the use of foreign investment will not change. The facts prove that foreign investment in China continued to maintain a high growth momentum in the first half of 1993. MOFTEC data for the first half of 1993 show 43,632 foreign-financed projects approved, with an agreed foreign investment of $58.7 billion and an actually utilized foreign investment of $9.4 billion, up respectively 234 percent, 300 percent, and 180 percent from the same period in 1992. Since July, this momentum has certainly not slowed, with several large import projects having been concluded. For instance, the Jilin Industrial Chemicals Factory's import project for 100,000 tons of high-carbon alcohol for an accessory installation to its 300,000-ton ethylene project, and the $30-million investment contract between Suzhou City and the United States for a joint-venture construction of the first stage of the Puqiang-Suzhou Pharmaceuticals Plant, were signed in Beijing in late July. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out very clearly that the tighter macroeconomic regulation and control was not an overall retrenchment, but rather a structural adjustment. I hold that it will not only not affect foreign investment in China but, as the macroeconmic climate further improves, will even be bound to be favorable to attracting yet more investment. We welcome investment by overseas entrepreneurs that is in line with China's industrial policy. A Projection of the State of the Economy in the Second Half of 1993 What are our economic growth trends for the last half of 1993 and on into 1994? Are we likely to see sharp volatility? My view is an optimistic one. Our state of economic growth can only improve, and we will not see either stagnation or sharp volatility. The Chinese Government has faced up to the problems that are appearing in the midst of rapid economic growth, having taken a series of key steps to intensify reform, in order to solve them safely and steadily. The excessive fixed assets investment scale has been strictly controlled, with the irrational investment structure being adjusted, ongoing projects being inventoried according to the principle of acting in line with capability and the demands of industrial policy, continuation or shutdown as necessary (for instance, we have shut down construction on ones, such as unapproved development zones, and certain duplicate construction projects), and a shortening of our construction front. Our chaotic financial and revenue-taxation orders are being rectified, with some initial success. Excessive price rises have been strictly controlled, with the previous sharp price rises due to inflation for capital goods, such as rolled steel and cement, having been curbed, and beginning to recede. Our agricultural production has been reinforced, with a bumper summer grain harvest, and expectations of a good harvest of fall crops short of an exceptional disaster. Our industrial production continues to grow at a higher rate in line with production dovetailed with demand and improved efficiency. Our market commodity supplies are abundant. Our foreign trade will also continue to maintain a good momentum. All reforms, particularly of our financial, revenue-taxation, and investment systems, are advancing with emphasis. In short, I hold that while our overall national economic growth rate for the last half of 1993 will be somewhat slower than for the first half, this will be rational and more balanced. As to the whole of 1993, our overall growth rate will not fall below 10 percent, to surpass the annual plan approved by the first session of the eighth national party congress. The Chinese Government leadership is firm and strong. All areas and sectors are conscientiously implementing the center's macroeconomic regulation and control measures. The initiative of the people of all nationalities throughout China to build socialism is very high. The call sent forth by President Jiang Zemin, according to the spirit of the key speeches of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, to seize, treasure, and use well opportunities to develop the economy better and faster, is increasingly permeating the Chinese mindset. It can be projected that China's economic growth in coming years will, in line with the adjusted Eighth Five-Year Plan, grow in both a rapid and a sustained and balanced manner. I am full of confidence in this.
