A UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] statement said Karadzic sent a letter to UN envoy Yasushi Akashi during the day guaranteeing the withdrawal from around the eastern Bosnian enclave, in line with a NATO ultimatum. "Dr. Karadzic wrote... that as of that day in accordance with his strictest orders there would be no Serb personnel of any description... within the three kilometer zone in Gorazde," the statement said. The Bosnian government has said it will not take part in the ceasefire talks, due to open Thursday, unless Serbs withdraw from a three-kilometer (two-mile) zone around the eastern Bosnian enclave. The issue has threatened to scupper the peace talks, to which political and military leaders of all warring factions have been invited, along with all the major international mediators. The UNPROFOR statement added that Akashi "considers that Dr. Karadzic's letter, if implemented, provides a sufficient basis for the opening of the meeting in Geneva."
