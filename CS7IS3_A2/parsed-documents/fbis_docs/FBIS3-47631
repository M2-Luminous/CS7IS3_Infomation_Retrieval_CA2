Noting that labor relations at three strike-plagued Hyundai Group Companies -- Hyundai Motor, Hyundai Precision and Industries and Hyundai Heavy Industries -- in 1993 are being examined by the Korea Labor Research Institute, Nam said the government would see to it that they improved their labor relations on the basis of the recommendations to be made by the institute. Companies in four booming sectors -- automobiles, shipbuilding, steel and electronics -- will be encouraged to pay special bonuses from their profits in shares, not in cash. Easing of rules barring employees from selling shares obtained in employee stock ownership plans for five years is being discussed with the Finance Ministry, Nam said. Under the proposed changes, the ban will be shortened so that employees in the four sectors may sell their shares after a year. The four sectors will be induced to peg pay hikes at the level set by wage guidelines to be agreed on between the Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) and the Korea Employers' Federation (KEF) and to invest their profits in research and development and expansion of welfare facilities for employees. The government will ensure that collective pay bargaining is finished according to the FKTU-KEF guidelines by April or May in all industrial sectors. Nam recommended that Kim call a government-labor-management meeting to celebrate and promote industrial peace after collective bargaining is completed. He said his Ministry would study when and how labor-related laws should be amended after pay negotiations are settled in all areas. Illegal labor disputes, especially involvement of a third party in a labor dispute, will be dealt with strictly by law, Nam said.
