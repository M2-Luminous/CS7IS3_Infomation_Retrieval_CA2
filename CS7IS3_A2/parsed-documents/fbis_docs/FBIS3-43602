FBIS3-43602 "drafr007_e_94002" FBIS-AFR-94-007 Document Type:Daily Report 11 Jan 1994 WEST AFRICA Nigeria Abacha Presents 1994 Budget, Comments on Politics AB1001205894 Lagos NTA Television Network in English 1801 GMT 10 Jan 94 AB1001205894 Lagos NTA Television Network Language: English Article Type:BFN [Address to the nation by Head of State General Sani Abacha on the presentation of the 1994 budget in Abuja on 10 January -- recorded] [Text] Fellow Nigerians, there is in our country today a great yearning for a new direction. This yearning, which grows more urgent by the day, is both legitimate and understandable. After nearly three and a half decades of hopes raised and hopes dashed it should not be surprising that Nigerians are weary and worried. Having gone through several years in which their faith in the national enterprise has been abused and affronted, our people's impatience with the government and almost total distrust of its functionaries can no longer be dismissed as mere cynical. At the birth of this nation 33 years ago, expectations were high and the possibilities for greatness were almost limitless. We appeared set for grand attainment to fulfill what the rest of the world saw as our manifest destiny to lead the black race into the mainstream of human civilization. But just as it seemed as if our sun was rising, twilight came and we have been groping ever since waiting for a new dawn. That we must recommence our journey to greatness is clear enough. What is not clear is the state of the vehicle with which to embark on that journey. Therefore, even as we yearn fervently for a speedy arrival at our destination, there is a need for us to pause and ponder as to the shape of the vehicle in which we sit to make our journey. Nigeria is today like a vehicle which has been reduced to a cannibalized contraption. It is a vehicle heavily buffeted by the elements and badly battered by its users. No one undertakes a journey with such a contraption. When confronted with such a situation, the sensible thing to do is to commence in earnest extensive repair works having established the causes and sources of the damage. This, in a nutshell, is the assignment with which this administration is now saddled. Point of departure: In my maiden address to the nation on Thursday, 18 November 1993, I did touch on some of the factors that necessitated our positive intervention. In the course of this address I shall elaborate on those factors as a way of placing the specific measures adopted by the budget in proper context. Firstly, it must be obvious by now that our country has gone through one of the most difficult phases any nation has ever had to go through. On the economic front, enormous sacrifices were demanded from our people to undo the near total damage done to the national economy in the days of careless wastage. Nigerians readily made the required sacrifices only to find out that their gesture was not matched with expected results. All through the past decade or so the nation's economic foundations had been badly shaken and our cherished values almost totally subverted. In all these our people sought and found solace in the expectation that a new political order was in the making, which, when instituted would make the economic misfortune more bearable and the required sacrifices less harrowing. Our people gave all that it took to institute that new order, believing in the wisdom of the sage which said: Seek ye first the political kingdom and every other thing shall be added unto it. For eight years our people sought the political kingdom and conscientiously too. But just as the new political dispensation began to take shape, it suffers a horrendous blow. Months after that debacle our country is yet to recover from the impact of that rude shock which took the nation back to a point below zero level. At the height of the crisis no aspect of society was spared and no public institution escaped its destructive fallout. Our country was drifting in a manner that not only threatened the ship of state, but indeed, also the entire foundation of our existence as a national entity. It was in the midst of this dangerous drift that we found it necessary to step in to check the incipient chaos and secure the integrity of Nigeria as an indissoluble federation. We did so like other key players of the political class who were involved in an elaborate game that became a riotous event. We make no pretensions about capability but, ironically, the military still remains the only institution in the position to put an end to the drift towards the yawning abyss of total collapse of the nation. Mission-minded, the foregoing constitute the historical context of current efforts [word indistinct] relevant and appropriate direction for Nigeria's socioeconomy. Our policy direction for 1994 must therefore aim at the refashioning of the present ways of doing government business. A pointer to this need was given in my maiden address to the nation when I committed this administration to the necessity of reform of the major agencies and institutions of state. The problems which afflict our nation's institutions have brought them into disrepute and caused our people to be disenchanted with government. This administration has thus paneled a high-powered commission of inquiry into the affairs of those institutions that make or break government to demonstrate in concrete ways the need to set out our home in order before we begin to effectively use its resources for the enhancement of the quality of life of our people. It must be stated that this administration is not, by the act of instituting reform panels, out to embark on vendetta. Rather, we believe that those reforms will form the basis for a renewed phase in our institutions and government. Let me emphasize that the reforms will be a continued exercise designed to ensure greater sensitivity of government to our people's desires, greater accountability, and transparency in government and, above all, greater responsiveness by government. This administration places a very high premium on the genuine wishes of our people. This must be so because the immediate factor in our decision to intervene was the obvious drift in government occasioned by the estrangement of those in government from the governed. Previous administrations simply rejected and neglected to recognize the drift towards disintegration of our country due to their actions and inactions. Nigeria was close to disintegration at the time the military intervened on 17 November 1993. It had become increasingly clear to us, and indeed to most Nigerians, that the best way out for us was to intervene to save the descent into anarchy. This administration recognized at inception the undercurrents of the political crisis of our immediate past which was the reason for the decision to institute a constitutional conference to look into the multitude of problems which afflict us as a nation. The idea of an all-Nigeria constitutional conference is an idea whose time has come. This administration is committed to ensuring that the proposed conference meets the expectation of our people's collective yearnings for a more united Nigeria. Furthermore, this administration has chosen through the proposed conference to play the vanguard role in channeling the energies of our people towards meaningful interaction in planning the course for the future of our country. We do not intend to abdicate this responsibility. Accordingly, the government has decided and will soon enpanel a constitution commission whose charge is to organize the proposed constitutional conference. The conference in time will make appropriate recommendations to the Provisional Ruling Council on an accepted political framework and program which will lead to the emergence of a democratic polity. The apprehensions and reservations of a few of our countrymen and women about the proposed constitutional conference are fully recognized and appreciated. But these should not detract from the good intentions which form our original decision to convene the conference. Government will not abdicate its responsibility in providing the necessary and sufficient framework for a fruitful conference. Government wishes to appeal to all our people to be part of the genuine effort at fashioning a fair, just, and equitable basis of our collective existence. Fellow Nigerians, having found ourselves in the situation of authority we have the responsibility to preserve our country from collapse and at the same time to visibly pursue the course of justice and fairness. It is also clear to us that this task before the nation is to pinpoint the problems as objectively as possible and to identify patriots who are prepared to sacrifice their time and leisure to honor a total call to duty and finally draw up a program of action. The general acceptance of the team we have assembled both in the Provisional Ruling Council and the Federal Executive Council strongly suggests that the action taken to ensure that Nigeria existed for us to deliberate on its future was based on sound judgment. We are, however, not fooling ourselves into believing that because we have been joined by trusted eminent leaders from all sections and sectors of our nation, we have hereby solved the problems of the twin legacies of our inheritance, namely, a badly fractured polity and a dangerously weakened economy. We believe, however, that by ensuring a national administration composed of widely respected leaders charged with supervising our national search for a meeting ground, our intention to serve only as supervisors of this process remains genuine, nationalistic, and patriotic. We recognize that ours is a limited mandate. We also recognized that the process of reconstituting our polity and our economy must be undertaken by both the government and the governed. The state of the economy: Fellow Nigerians, the economy which this administration inherited was once characterized by great disabilities and great instabilities. On virtually all the indices, the outlook was rather [words indistinct]. Economic output, (?which) was measured by gross national product, has been on a steady decline in the past few years. Owing to the sluggish growth, employment has stagnated, while the phenomenal growth in money supply, fuelled by expansionary fiscal policies have had pressure on the oil sector. Interbank and lending rates have risen to unprecedented levels, resulting in declines in investment and production. All these have been worsened by the collapse in the value of the naira, the attendant rapid increase of service charges on external debts, and the worsening of the balance of payments profile. In short, it can be said that inadequate fiscal discipline complicated the already high incidence of budget deficits, which in turn made efforts at economic reforms more difficult to handle and led to a worsening of social conditions. Review of the 1993 budget: The federal budget of 1993 was formulated to address and redress the declining economic activities. One of its advertised objectives was to promote accountability and transparency in the management of public finance. The budget also aimed at enhancing public sector activities and social programs, while eliminating market distortions by giving freer reign to private enterprise. For reasons which are not too difficult to discern, the 1993 budget performed rather poorly, both in terms of attainment of set objectives and fidelity to the overall strategy. The budget deficit soared to 90 billion naira and this resulted in an excessive growth in money supply. The economy experienced high inflation, depreciation of the naira, and continued low capacity utilization in the (?real) sector. The political crisis which took up most of the second half of the year, only served to further accentuate these already serious problems. The 1994-1996 rolling plan: The three year rolling plan was introduced to replace the five-year medium-term program as a development strategy. The two objectives of the 1994-1996 rolling plan are to institute correct macroeconomics policies and instill fiscal discipline in order to fashion a more conducive environment for economic growth. It is this imperative that provided the context for the 1994 federal budget. Goal of the 1994 budget: The goals of the 1994 budget have been set to reverse the negative trend of the recent past. These goals are: 1. A balanced budget firmly anchored on fiscal discipline and abolition of deficit financing. 2. Identification and mobilization of new sources of collective revenue. 3. Exchange rate stabilization and the reversal of the high incidence of capital flight. 4. Rationalization of interest rates to stem the decline of the rural sector. 5. Adoption of a comprehensive budgeting approach to bring all projects into the process. 6. Reduction in the level of subsidies and subventions to federal government-owned companies and parastatals, particularly those slated for partial or full commercialization and outright privatization. 7. Effective debt management strategies to reduce the debt service burden on domestic commitments and obtain debt relief from the external creditors. 8. Rehabilitation of social-economic infrastructure and strengthening of the law and order apparatus to provide a conducive environment for legitimate economic pursuits and private initiative. 9. Increase in the capacity utilization of the industrial sector and effective sourcing of local raw materials. 10. Promotion of growth linkages in the rural economy. 11. Promotion of employment opportunities to reduce the current high level of unemployment, especially among the youth. 12. Policy fidelity and close monitoring of implementation to ensure the attainment of these objectives. These goals, singularly and in concert, define an economic framework for budget plans, and are, therefore, measures for ensuring overall discipline in our recovery effort. This administration will use these goals as a standard for measuring the performance of sectors, institutions, and officials. This administration wishes to serve notice that the monitoring and review of strategic institutions of public policy, which we have commenced, will continue to be intensified. This administration will neither tolerate the subversion of its programs and policies, nor will it allow its articulated goals and guidelines to be casually discarded or treated as mere suggestions. Revenue projection: In the 1993 budget, revenue projections were premised on a continuing conservative outlook of oil price behavior. Unfortunately, the price of oil during the year fell below the projected level of $17.50 per barrel. This is why the 1994 revenue projection from crude oil sales is based on the realistic price of $14 per barrel, calculated on an exchange rate of 22 naira to a dollar. This translates into an estimated revenue of 231.40 billion naira. Non-oil revenue is estimated at 47.1 billion naira. The Federal Government's retained revenue is estimated at 110.20 billion naira. Expenditure estimates: The expenditure estimates for the 1994 budget are largely influenced by the need to achieve the prime objective of a balanced budget. Therefore, government has adopted a budgetary approach which will commit all government expenditures to only available resources. Thus, the total expenditure outlay is estimated at 110.20 billion naira. In addition to the traditional ministerial allocations, government will seek to provide funding for projects, will multiply effects on our economy such as: 1. High-yield seed development program for improvement in agriculture production. 2. Special incentives for small-scale industries involved a production of basic needs. 3. Funding for research and development efforts. 4. Activation of support for the export processing zone. 5. The liquefied natural gas and other gas and oil related projects. 6. Special assistance program for the educational sector. 7. Continuous support for the National Directorate of Employment. 8. Enhanced security program in the urban centers and on major highways. 9. Support for highway and city lightening program to meet the Federal Ministry of Works [as heard]. 10. Support for the mass transit program. 11. Rehabilitation of tertiary health institutions and medical research centers. States and local governement finances: From the cautious approach adopted in the 1994 budget in regard to revenue from oil sales, it has become more necessary than ever, for state governments and local councils to further improve on their internal revenue generating efforts. Also given the acute concern for accountability and transparency which informed this budget, the Federal Government expects strict financial management at the other two levels of government and a visible pursuit of probity in the conduct of the activities. Local councils will continue to be funded directly from the federation account. In addition, they will continue to receive the mandatory 10 percent of state governments internally generated revenue. The state governments are required to make quarterly returns of all such transfers to the federal Ministry of Finance. Foreign exchange rate: The achievement of the exchange rate stability, which is one of the foremost objective of this budget, requires the abolition of deficit financing, increasing aggregate supply of foreign exchange through intensified export promotion, encouragement of foreign investors, and the strengthening of measures to mobilize non-oil exports proceeds. While government remains committed to the policy of deregulation and to safeguard the integrity of the market forces, it is by now recognized that one of the fundamental factors which have further complicated the national economic crisis is the low exchange rate of the naira in relation to other currencies. Government is of the firm belief that the new economic direction of policy should be such as would create the right environment for the strengthing of the naira. Government is aware that its due share of foreign exchange earnings by parastatals and government-owned companies, are not fully credited to it. Measures have therefore been put in place for effective tracking of foreign exchange earnings with a view to correcting existing anomalies. Consequently, government has decided that all foreign exchange earned by both private and public sector exporters of goods and services will henceforth be brought into the national foreign exchange account. For the avoidance of doubt, the concession formally granted to private exporters and parastatals to keep their foreign exchange earnings outside the central bank is hereby abolished. Also, in the light of our recent experience and in view of the need to create a favorable atmosphere for economic revival, government has decided that the exchange rate of the naira be fixed at 22 naira to a dollar. Government will actively monitor this decision. Government expect that Nigerians will contribute towards ensuring the sanctity of this rate against all odds. Other measures that have been adopted in order to strengthen the value of the naira include the following: 1. All imports are henceforth to be done on the basis of letter of credit, that is LC, supported by import duty reforms, IDR, and clear report of findings, CRF, except for imports that cost $1,000 or less. Imports of open accounts, including bills on collection, except on specific approval for the manufacturing and agricultural sector are abolished. All importers are to complete Form M. All imports of foreign exchange into Nigeria must henceforth be through the Central Bank of Nigeria, which shall guarantee free and unimpeded access to such forex for imports of goods and services. For the avoidance of doubt, any importer who has forex to use to import goods or services must first of all have to declare such to the Central Bank of Nigeria, complete the Form M, and establish the necessary letter of credit based on the use of funds earlier lodged with the Central Bank or designated banks. It would not be the basis for operating the LC nor could it be repatriated subsequently. Bureaux de change are henceforth agents of the Central Bank. As such, they are to henceforth sell foreign exchange at the rate prescribed by Central Bank plus a fixed commission. Bureaux de change must therefore not sell forex to finance imports, nor should they sell more than 2,500 or equivalent to any one customer. Returns of transaction must be made to the Central Bank every month. 6. [Number as heard] All parastals, corporations, companies, voluntary organizations, and any agency whether foreign local, government or private which earn or bring foreign exchange into the country must report and lodge same with the Central Bank or Central Bank designated banks and spend such only in accordance with the prescribed guidelines but without any other impediment or question by the authorities. In other words, those who earn or bring in foreign exchange should be free to utilize it as they deem fit within the guidelines to be prescribed. The guideline should be gentle enough not to scare away prospective depositors . 7. All companies, agencies, and individuals, bringing forex into Nigeria must do so only through the Central Bank or approved banks. Such foreign exchange deposits could be withdrawn freely either in naira or foreign exchange with interest at the prescribed rate. Depending on the formula that the central bank could adopt for the sale of forex importers, the commercial and commercial ad merchant bank should only act as conduit for handling transactions on behalf of genuine clients. In this regard, appointed banks should only charge prescribed commission for their services. 9. [Number as heard] The minister of finance should bring to the Federal Executive Council proposals and ways to improve custom duty collection, including the possible use and inspection agents and the redefinition of the role of the Custom and Excise Department. 10. Henceforth high customs duty will be imposed on luxury goods and such goods should not be funded from official sources. A list of such items will be prepared by the Ministry of Finance and cleared with the Federal Military Government. In order to enhance their capacity, the Central Bank and the Department of Customs and Excise will be revamped and restructured to cope with the new challenges and added responsibilities in the foregoing decision and the overall efforts to revamp the national economy. This is to be without prejudice to the proposed reorganization of the customs duty collection system. Finally, the Central Bank is to ensure strict supervision of the designated bank so that the abuses witnessed in recent years in the use of foreign exchange are eliminated and the erring banks appropriately sanctioned. To give efforts to the realization of all these economic measures an Economic Intelligence Committee will be established to monitor the strict implementation of all these policy measures. Fiscal Policy Measures: Fellow Nigerians, the main thrust of fiscal policy in 1994 is the adoption of coherent measures that ensure expenditure discipline and revive revenue drive. To this end, the minister of finance has been directed to evolve workable measures for ensuring that all duties payable on imports are fully captured into government coffers. Concomitantly, a more vigorous effort will be made to curb smuggling and reduce the leakage of collectible revenues. The life of the present tariff regime is due to expire in 1994 and a committee has been set up to review the current tariff structure and come up with a comprehensive new structure in 1995. Government has decided to introduce excise duties of some products this year. Details of these will be given by the honorable minister of finance in his budget breakdown. Suffice it to say here that all importers of goods must brace up for the payment of full duties as no new exemptions will be entertained outside of those already provided for by law. This measure will be applicable to all government agencies at all levels. Tax policy in 1994 will aim at encouraging genuine entrepreneurs while improving the enforcement of existing laws and the machinery for tax collection. However, a new tax on consumption known as value added tax, VAT, is to come into effect this year. States are to benefit from the yield of this new tax up to 80 percent of total collection. Also, withholding tax on rents, interests, dividends, among others, has been raised from 5 percent to 10 percent with effect from 1994. Monetary and Credit Policy: Government has for some time been concerned about developing an appropriate macroeconomic package that will simultaneously address the issue of the low value of the national currency. The steep rise in interest rate, high commodity prices, and the ability of the productive sector to source credit and perform adequately. [sentence as heard] After due consideration of the report of the committee raised to examine these issues, government decided to firm up interest rate so as to save genuine economic activity. Consequently, the Central Bank has been given the charge to enforce strict compliance with the various existing regulations and to ensure that banks and other institutions found violating such rules are sanctioned appropriately. Specifically, government has decided to peg interest rates as follows: Savings and deposit rate is now fixed at between 12 and 15 percent; lending rate is fixed at 21 percent, inclusive of all charges. This means that 21 percent should represent the upper limit to be charged on any loan inclusive of legal and other charges. Fellow Nigerians, the unseeming manner in which critical indices of our economic health has been grossly abused in the past few years call for decisive and drastic measures. With the existing interest rate regime, it has become clear that real producers were being penalized while peddlers of paper money, crafty manipulators, and idle speculators were milking the economy dry. No responsible government would fold its arms and watch such a negative trend continue unchecked. It is in our determination to do something positive that these new measures are being introduced and we sincerely hope that hard-working Nigerians who are the ultimate beneficiaries of a saner interest rate regime should rally around government in ensuring that these measures are not sabotaged. Additionally, in its efforts to ensure compliance with the new dispensation that the Central Bank is mandated to go beyond routine [words indistinct] where necessary and adopt active measures to bring transgressors to book. With regards to structural allocation of credit, government has decided that in 1994 structural allocation of bank credits should give priority to agricultural and industrial production. Thus, the structural percentage distribution or commercial and merchant bank credit in 1994 shall be 60 percent of all credit to agricultural production and manufacturing enterprises, while non-oil exports and others would be allocated 40 percent. The ratio of rural lending to deposit, mobilize in the rural communities would remain at 50 percent in view of the pressing need to accelerate rural development. Debt management: The management of the country's internal and external debt continues to present serious problems for macroeconomic policy and the attainment of growth objectives. In the attempt to reduce the level of debt stock, government has adopted policy measures that will lead to outright elimination of contracts not provided for in the budget. This would be in keeping with one of the cardinal points of this year's budget which is a vigorous curtailment of expenditure to ensure a balanced budget. With regards to the serving of domestic loans, the federal Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria have been charged with the assignment of designing a scheme which will result in reduction in annual debt service in real terms. On the external loan front, government will continue to strive to reach an accommodation with Nigerian's creditors with a view to ensuring more favorable terms. It is our hope that the creditors will appreciate the particularly delicate phase through which Nigeria is now passing and exercise restraints in making impossible demands that can only serve to further worsen the tenuous economic and political situation of these times. The social sector: From the broad outline given so far in this address, it should be obvious that the fiscal year of 1994 will be an intensely demanding period in terms of budgetary discipline and adherence to enunciated goals and objectives. Government recognizes that the past few years have been especially harrowing for many Nigerians, particularly people in the low- and middle-income groups and those engaged in genuinely productive economic activities. It is government's intention and determination to bring some long overdue relief to our people in the area of public transportation, access to affordable and qualitative education, health services, provision of water and adequate food supply at reasonable prices. Government is of the firm belief that such relief measures can still be comfortably accommodated within the context of a balanced budget. What is required is the adoption of the right economies in the areas of checking public sector wastage, ensuring a shift away from the current practice of using scare public resources to subsidize the already affluent through lopsided pricing of services, enforcing a tax drive that will raise the revenue accrue into public coffers, glutting of sundry leakages in the official economy, and capturing of all economic activities into the formal sector. [sentence as heard] We are under no illusion that this would be an easy task. Indeed, carrying them out successfully will require a blend of political will with which governments in Nigeria are not usually associated. Yet, we are acutely aware of the desperate situation in which we now find ourselves and have come to accept that there is really no alternative to keeping faith with our people than through sincerity and sufficient management of the economy to enable it carry out the needed social services. Consequently, 1994 will witness more vigorous activity on the part of government in the provision of improvement of social services, especially in the area of transportation and road maintenance, schools management, public health, and other related infrastructure. Our approach to the provision of social services is derived from the philosophy of social sector management which views those services not merely as items of public expenditure but more importantly as investment in a better organized society, and ultimately as imperatives for future progress given their enormous multiply effect. Drug enforcement: Drug trafficking has become a monumental national embarrassment and a cancerous malaise which is a great source of concern for this administration. Nigeria is not a producer of drugs yet because of the indiscipline of some of our people, and their general tendency to get rich quick, have turned Nigeria into a notorious drug route. This attitude has an unhealthy effect on the image of this country. This administration therefore is determined to stamp out drug trafficking in all its ramifications. Categorically, government has decided to revamp and reorganize the national Drug and Law Enforcement Agency to make it more responsive to its responsibility. It is pertinent to note that the recent seizure of drugs with a street value of over $300 million within our shores lend credence to this our renewed and vigorous efforts to fight the incidence of drug trafficking. We appeal to the international community to cooperate with us in this our current drive to stem the drug trade from our shores and plead for the exchange of information and technical assistance toward the attainment of this objective. Henceforth, government will deal ruthlessly with drug traffickers and their agents and will not tolerate the damage drug trafficking and other antisocial behaviors done to Nigeria's image. Government is determined to ensure strictest obedience and the enforcement of stiffest penalties on offenders and assert no efforts will be spared to track down traffickers and their agents. Youth and sports: Government is committed to constructive programs of youth development for nation building. In pursuit of this noble goal, the Ministry of Education and Youth Development as well as the National Sports Commission will continue to develop appropriate youth programs to prepare our young men and women for productive adult life. The future of any nation depends on a well-articulated and effective youth policy which can only be ignored at the nation's peril. This administration is highly impressed by the immense contribution of our youth in global competitions, particularly in the age group football competitions. The recent victory of our Golden Eaglets for the second time under 17th FIFA [Federation of International Football Associations] soccer competition in Japan, is an excellent example of the height which commitment and patriotism can propel us as a people. I enjoyed the Super Eagles who have qualified for the senior World Cup to emulate the excellent example of their kid brothers. The government on its part will do everything to ensure a proper and result-oriented build-up to the prestigious global competition tagged USA 94. Government will do everything possible to make the requirements of FIFA to ensure Nigeria hosting of the under 20 youth soccer competition scheduled for next year. Apart from a domestic following which soccer enjoys in our country, hosting the competition will enable us to provide the world with strategic insight to our capabilities, potentialities, and the state of the development of the game of football in particular in Nigeria. As we enter a year in which Nigeria will participate in many global sporting competitions, government enjoins all organs charged with the responsibility for sports development to show commitment and a sense of purpose in their preparation so that our flag can fly high to the glory of our beloved country. The activities of those charge with the development of sports in the country, will henceforth be closely monitored. Government can no longer watch with indifference when those charged with the heavy burden of sports administration in the country, dissipate so much energy in endless bickering thereby making us the laughing stock in the international community. The interphase of domestic policy and external demands: We are now more aware of the relationship between the various aspects of reform programs we have sought to implement and their overall effect on the quality of life of our citizens. We know that if we service debts, whose total legal character is yet to be ascertained, with our 30 kobo of every externally accrued naira and if the percentage devoted to servicing of our debts continued to increase while the total income continued to decrease, our people's welfare would also continue to be mortgaged. We know that if we embarked on economic reform projects that tie the hands of government and disable government from putting in place programs that will shelter the most vulnerable sector of our society from the negative effect of these reforms, we are actively increasing the ranks of disaffected who will demand other protection from these effects or call for a change of the economic order and of government. We know that we cannot embark on a ruinous debt service regime, mount an economic reform program, and initiate difficult changes of our political system all at the same time. While investors' capitals seek new arenas opened by the ending of the cold war, it is apparent that the Nigerian managers of our economy would have to organize novel ways of undertaking reforms without increasing the volume of conflicts within our social order. The international community must also come to understand the implications of these various programs that have shaped the condition of life of our citizens. It is no longer enough to insist on reforms whose pattern of effect has now been catalogued country after country and yet for the international community not to appreciate what are the likely outcomes of changes that it advocates. Nigeria, like other African countries similarly situated, have implemented structural adjustments of their economies. They are carrying the heavy burden that their debts place on their shoulders and they are saddled with the effect of a painful and conflict-ridden democratization of their policies. These three projects are all sources of conflict that threaten social order and peace. There must be a way of spacing them and managing the conflicts they generate. This administration believes that equal attention must now be devoted to the management of peace within our societies. Peace can no longer be assumed. New ways have to be devised for anticipating the conflict effects inherent in policy reforms. New complicities in approach have to be articulated. We know that in this task Nigeria must continue to contribute its leadership in assisting the international community in developing peaceful alternatives to the pursuit of political objectives through wars. As the curtain falls on the apartheid order of South Africa, a new day for African dawns, calling for the birth of a new leadership. This administration extends its invitation to the international community to join it in its exploration of the current condition of conflict situations that now limit our ability to march forward. Reinvigorating the executive branch: The various measures outlined in this year's budget require renewed dedication on the part of those whose business it is to implement government policies. The existing structure of the executive branch cannot serve the inherited statescraft crisis without fundamental restructuring of legacies. The civil service which traditionally has served as the implementing arm of the executive branch has over the years lost momentum in part because of the negative impact of previous reform measures. Government views with concern the current decline in the output of the civil service and is determined to do something about it. Accordingly, government has decided to revisit the 1998 civil service reform with a view to reviewing its underlying premises, its execution, and implementation to date. Significantly, however, there is a compelling and urgent need to enhance coordination as a management imperative in the executive branch of government. In the recent past, the size of the executive branch has grown so large as to be unwieldy. Quite a handful of agencies have found accommodation in the Presidency, whose scheduled responsibilities are duplications of what regular federal government ministerial departments do. In addition, the sheer size of the executive branch compounds the input processing problems and inevitably leads to the burdening of the chief executive by multiple actors, while the wearisome implication for undue centralization of power. [sentence as heard] This administration cannot afford the pleasure, the luxury of operating the existing bureaucratic structures which under conditions more conducive and more supportive was only efficient in serving the personal interest of those entrusted with authority. Government is concerned that the present organization of work in the executive branch is administratively routine and results in much activity and traffic, but without the result of functional policy leadership. Government has therefore decided on the restructuring of the executive branch to make it functional in decisionmaking, decision execution, and decision monitoring. Fellow Nigerians, in surveying the sad record of our recent past, it will be rather tempting to want to continually lament what has indeed been a tragic study in missed opportunities. It would be perfectly understandable if Nigerians now choose to engage in an unending recrimination over what went wrong, to point accusing fingers, or even to wallow in self-pity. Even before things went so bad, the apportioning of blame had become a growth industry in the society. Yet, even as we legitimately vent our anger and express our disappointment at the cavalier manner in which our lives have been mismanaged, we need to reconcile ourselves to the fact that life must go on. The past becomes an albatross only if we fail to learn from it and heed its lessons. It is now time to seek a sober understanding of what went wrong. We must now resume our search for unity and prosperity firmly anchored on peace and justice. We must collectively recommence the task of rebuilding our polity and restructuring our economy. The 1994 budget has been articulated as a modest beginning in this direction. It has been said that the true test of a nation's progress is not how much it adds to the abundance of those who already have too much, but how well it is able to provide for those who have too little. The policies this administration wishes to pursue in 1994 are aimed at providing the right atmosphere for economic growth that goes hand in hand with social compassion. This cannot but be so, given the injuries of past years. Still, a lot will depend on all Nigerians to be patriotic enough to seek to work within the set guidelines and policies rather than seeking ever more imaginative ways of sabotaging the budget, to support a government in its effort to generate more revenue by ensuring prompt and correct tax declaration and bringing their income-earning activities into the official economy, to adhere strictly to business ethics instead of indulging in arbitrary increase in prices and lowering of the quality of their goods under the guise of the regulation, to refrain from acts that tend to smear the image of the country and which discourage the much-needed inflow of genuine foreign investment, to ensure high moral standard of discipline in the economic and other activities, to imbibe a better work culture, especially in rendering of public service, to rekindle faith in ourselves and our ability to create a Nigerian economic miracle, to remain continually vigilant in holding people in authority to set standards, especially with regards to accountability and transparency in government and, finally, to refrain from doing anything that will further complicate the already testy political situation so as to ensure the stability required for economic recovery. All these are demands that underscore the need for discipline in the conduct of private and public affairs. On our part, we have committed government to initiate [word indistinct] see to restore orderly existence through the resuscitation of the war against indiscipline and corruption. We are determined to prosecute this war to the best of our ability. To this end, let me note that government had in the past decade invested massively in the infrastructure of public discipline. The appropriate agencies are hereby directed to speedily deploy what was committed to public discipline by preceding administrations for current purposes. The budget will attract criticism normally, but it is important to appreciate the commitment of this administration to brighten the prospect of our country, improve economic management, and create a stable and conducive political climate. A lot needs to be done, but I have no doubt that together we can build a better future for our great country. Please accept in arrears my best wishes for a happy and prosperous new year. Long live the Federal Republic of Nigeria! Thank you and God bless our country.
