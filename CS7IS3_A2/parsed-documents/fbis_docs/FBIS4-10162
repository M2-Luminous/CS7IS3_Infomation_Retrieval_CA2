Before the dedication, President Endara commented on U.S. accusations that Panama is not doing enough to fight drug trafficking. The U.S. Government accused the Panamanian justice system of releasing drug traffickers. Here is President Endara's response: [Endara] [Words indistinct] how many drug traffickers it does not free? It frees hundreds, even thousands, of drug traffickers. The Panamanian judicial branch -- the United States Government had better get this from now on -- is not controlled by the executive branch, as it is not in the United States. The U.S. justice system frees many more drug traffickers [words indistinct] the Panamanian justice system. [Fernandez] Do you suggest [words indistinct]? [Endara] The U.S. justice system? [Fernandez] [Words indistinct]. [Endara] Why don't they talk about corruption in the United States? They free more drug traffickers than Panama. Why do they accuse us Panamanians? Why is our justice system charged with corruption if it frees two drug traffickers? Why don't they talk about corruption over there? [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] [Endara] I am not justifying the acquittal of any drug trafficker. What I am saying is, no matter what the United States does, the executive branch will not intervene in matters concerning the judicial branch. The executive branch will not intervene in the judicial branch. If the judicial branch frees someone, we will free that person because the decision concerns the judicial branch per the same policy President Clinton follows vis-a-vis the U.S. judicial branch whenever it decides to free a drug trafficker. If President Clinton respects and heeds the U.S. justice system, I want to tell President Clinton I also respect and heed my justice system. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Endara] [Word indistinct] we will continue the task. This is a momentary [words indistinct]. For now, we will follow the same path. [Martinez] There will be a lack of U.S. cooperation. [Endara] If they do not want to cooperate, we can do nothing about it. They are the ones who consume the drug, and they are the ones who have created a problem for us in Panama. The most consumption takes place in the United States. Because the drug passes through here, some of it remains in Panama, and it affects our youths. If they do not help us, what can we do?
