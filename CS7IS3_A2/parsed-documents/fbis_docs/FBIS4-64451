Dehaene's unspoken candidacy for the succession of Jacques Delors as President of the European Commission (EC) has attracted great attention in the British press and produced a real hate campaign which is apparently also being fueled from Whitehall. From now on, the European profile of the Belgian prime minister will be an element in the debate that has arisen again in the governing Conservative Party. Officially, that argument revolves around Great Britain's future in Europe, but it is also just as much about the future of John Major as the British prime minister. In the flood of words, not everyone appears to be too bothered about the facts. And one section of the British press does not know the difference between intelligence and intellect. However, the polemics also show how self-satisfied the European Union (EU) would be even without the ever-critical and suspicious British. Over the past few days, some British newspapers quite rightly denounced the fact that the EC president is being chosen on a French-German couch from people who should above all deny that they are candidates and who have not necessarily reached their present position through elections. The British very modestly say nothing about the logical conclusion of their criticism: Let the European electorate or the democratically elected European Parliament designate the EC president. Should no German candidate emerge, then the fight will be between Dehaene and his Netherlands colleague Ruud Lubbers. With France and Germany backing Dehaene, Lubbers will probably only have a chance if Major finds support for him in Madrid or with Silvio Berlusconi. That could result in a nice little auction of European structural funds. The qualities of both candidates matter less. Those who say that the EU today needs, above all, to make the inspired ideas and decisions of Jacques Delors workable and practicable will find Jean-Luc Dehaene the natural candidate. On the other hand, anyone who is seeking any degree of understanding for the Anglo-Saxon skepticism regarding a forced trend toward European federalism, the craving to squander and to be meddlesome, and the democratic deficit in the EU must choose Lubbers. Moreover, both prime ministers are pragmatists, hard workers, poor orators, and highly experienced politicians. Meanwhile, in Belgium, people are driving themselves crazy wondering whether Dehaene can and may go. That is pure nonsense. For apart from concluding that the prime minister can earn himself a healthy promotion, it would also be good for this country to have someone occupying Jacques Delors' seat. Then there remains the argument that Dehaene is indispensable for the present government and for this country. That argument says more about Belgium's vulnerability than about the man who has dominated and fashioned politics for 15 years. Nobody is indispensable. Neither a government nor a country deserves to survive if its fate is determined by a single heartbeat.
