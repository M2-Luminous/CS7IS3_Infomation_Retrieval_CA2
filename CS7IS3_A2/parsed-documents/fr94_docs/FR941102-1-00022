FR941102-1-00022 FR941102-1-00005 As discussed in section IV of this Notice, the Commission seeks comment on a number of questions pertaining to existing power pools (both tight pools and loose pools), and their strengths and weaknesses in light of emerging competitive bulk power markets. IV. Request for Comments In order to assess the merits of alternative power pooling institutions, including the California poolco proposals, and to evaluate whether our existing policies will impede the development of such institutions, the Commission seeks comments from interested industry participants. We also believe that this proceeding is an appropriate forum to consider whether any changes should be made in our policies concerning existing power pools. Our intention is to ensure that our policies, while continuing to maintain adequate and reliable service, are consistent with the development of a competitive bulk power market. Answers to the questions below should refer to the number(s) of the specific question(s) when possible. In addition, commenters may address any other matters related to these issues. We are interested in all aspects of potential changes in, or alternatives to, existing power pools. Question 1. What alternative power pooling institutions might be beneficial? What are the strengths and weaknesses of these alternatives? What special transmission pricing needs, if any, would such alternative pooling institutions have? What specific benefits would an alternative bring that are not available today? What specific benefits of existing pools would be lost? What, if any, benefits would alternative power pooling institutions provide compared to bilateral trading? How would alternative power pooling institutions differ from a regime of bilateral trading? Question 2. Do any current Commission policies impede the formation of beneficial alternative power pooling institutions? What changes in our existing policies, if any, including pricing policies, are needed to encourage pools that facilitate competitive bulk power markets? Question 3. In discussing any alternative power pooling institution, please address how the adequacy of generation and transmission services would be ensured, e.g., maintenance of adequate generation and transmission reserves and construction of needed generating and transmission capacity? How would reliability be ensured, e.g. , control of transmission systems, voltage support, reactive power, loop flow, load following, backup services and other control area services? Question 4. What are the conditions required for alternative power pooling institutions to be beneficial, e.g. , a minimum number of sellers or buyers, a minimum geographic size, maximum market share for any seller or buyer, open membership, appropriate governance rules? Should participation by generators in the alternative pool's area be voluntary or mandatory? Question 5. Do alternative power pooling institutions have the potential to help resolve or minimize stranded cost issues? If so, how? Question 6. How would specific alternative power pooling institutions be regulated? In particular, can these institutions be designed to fit easily into the existing Federal-State regulatory structure so as to avoid duplicating the regulation of pool functions? Question 7. What are the merits of proposals to restructure the electric power industry along functional lines such as the genco-gridco-disco delineation? Should the Commission be prepared to proceed with poolco-type proposals in advance of any functional utility restructuring efforts, or should the Commission refuse to act on poolco-type proposals unless the functional restructuring occurs simultaneously? Does such a restructuring have merit even if an alternative power pooling arrangement is not adopted? Would such a restructuring facilitate the development of a more competitive bulk power market in a way that the current institutional structure of the electric power industry cannot?
