He warned that he will sue party President Guillermo Potoy for slander. Crises within the seven parties [of the National Opposition Union, UNO] worsened when National Conservative Party [PNC] member Edmundo Castillo decided to back the constitutional reforms. Tomorrow the party's directorate meets to change officers. [Jarquin, in progress] "...we believe the time has come for us to take the party's leadership and not play into the hands of those who have personal interests at stake." Adolfo Jarquin Ortel, who along with other UNO deputies will join the National Assembly on 10 January, was accused by the PSD president of having been bribed [canoneado] with thousands of dollars. [Potoy] "Corruption has raised doubts about PSD operations." [Jarquin] "I am considering taking legal action against Potoy." Meanwhile, Alfredo Cesar said that those who favor a constituent assembly really seek to move elections ahead to next year. [Cesar] "The moment the constituent assembly is elected [as heard] it will decide to leave or remove governments." [Jarquin] "We disagree with them. This has been their idea. Everyone in this country knows that we voted for a president like Dona Violeta for her to complete her term through 1996. The international community supports Dona Violeta completing her Constitutional term...." Jarquin accused Liberals and Conservatives of competing for a power take over through an early campaign. Meanwhile, the seven parties that favor a constituent assembly said they have funds to call for elections that would cost the country about $30 million. [Deputy Frank Duarte, secretary of the National Assembly] "Engineer Cesar no doubt continues to deceive the Nicaraguan people by making them believe there is a fund to finance those elections. In the best of cases it would be financed by the National Assembly and we have heard nothing of the sort." The crises also affected the PNC because Edmundo Castillo rebelled against the Constituent Assembly and said he will join the National Assembly. Dr. Castillo accused the UNO Political Council of being two-faced and acting with a double standard. [Castillo] "Enough said about being two-faced and having double standards. We need to be at the assembly, we must defend the peoples' interests." [Siria] "At one time your group also charged that the Center Group had been bribed. What will happen now that you also are accused of receiving bribes, will you also sue?" [Castillo] "I believe that if someone dares to say this I will file criminal charges. Not only will I file criminal charges but I will respond like a man...."
