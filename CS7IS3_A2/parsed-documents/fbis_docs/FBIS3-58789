Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds spoke in positive terms when commenting on the state of the negotiations after discussions with Prime Minister Esko Aho (Center Party) in Dublin. Aho began the official part of his visit to Ireland yesterday. Reynolds admitted that problems had arisen in the negotiations, but that they are no different from those of other countries. In his view, the negotiations have progressed well. The negotiations must be completed by the end of February at the latest if Finland and the other aspiring members are to be able to become members of the EU at the beginning of next year. Reynolds told FINSKA NOTISBYRAN that the timetable is a tight one. However, he considers that enough has already been achieved in the negotiations with the result that people are bound to be able to find solutions to the remaining problems. The trickiest issue in Finland's EU negotiations is agriculture. Reynolds considers Finland's aims moderate. In his view the EU Commission has produced a good analysis of the problems and that it will be possible to find a solution on the basis of this. Ireland is a warm supporter of an enlargement of the European Union. Reynolds believes that the Union should not be restricted to embracing only 12 members. Aho's visit is official. The welcoming ceremony at Dublin airport was reminiscent of the reception given to heads of state. This can be explained by the fact that the prime minister, "Taioseach" in Irish, is in practice head of state in the Irish political system. Immediately after his discussions with Reynolds, Aho held talks with Industry Minister Ruairi Quinn, who is the foreign minister's deputy. In the afternoon Aho had several meetings at the parliament building. In the evening he delivered an address on Finland's traditional international position at a gathering at the Irish Institute for European Policy. In addition to his discussions Aho also had a more lightweight program. He visited a genuine Irish public house and was given a glass of Ireland's "national drink," Guinness.
