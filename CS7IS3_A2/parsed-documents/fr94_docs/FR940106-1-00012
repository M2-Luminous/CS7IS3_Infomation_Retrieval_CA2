FR940106-1-00012 FR940106-1-00004 I. Applicability Under section 182(b)(3) of the CAA, States were required by November 15, 1992, to adopt regulations requiring owners or operators of gasoline dispensing systems to install and operate vapor recovery equipment at their facilities. The amended CAA specifies that these State rules must apply to any facility that dispenses more than 10,000 gallons of gasoline per month or, in the case of an independent small business marketer, any facility that dispenses more than 50,000 gallons of gasoline per month. Section 324 of the CAA defines an independent small business marketer. The State has adopted a general applicability requirement of 10,000 gallons per month and has not included a lower applicability for independent small business marketers. However, independent small business marketer which dispense less than 50,000 gallons have a provision for an extended compliance deadline. As more fully discussed in the EPA's Enforcement Guidance and the General Preamble (57 FR at 13514), the State has provided that the gallons of gasoline dispensed per month will be based on the gasoline throughput for each calendar month beginning January 1, 1991. The State is interpreting this requirement to mean that if a facility exceeds the throughput limits for any one month, the facility will be required to install Stage II. While the State is not calculating the average volume of gasoline dispensed per month for the two year period preceding the adoption date, the EPA believes that the State's method will require more gasoline dispensing facilities to comply with Stage II requirements. In addition, the State has specified that the State II requirements apply to all gasoline dispensing facilities, including retail outlets and fleet fueling facilities, with throughput rates as defined above. However, the State has exempted gasoline dispensing equipment used exclusively for the fueling of aircraft, marine vessels, or implements of agriculture. The EPA has determined that these limited exemptions are acceptable in the Texas Stage II program for the following reasons. Historically, the Stage II program was intended to reduce refueling emissions for ``on-road'' motor vehicles. These limited exemptions would not be considered to be on-road motor vehicles. Also, refueling systems of gasoline powered vehicles such as aircraft, marine vessels, and implements of agriculture are normally designed with nonstandardized equipment for which Stage II systems designed for on-road vehicle refueling facilities may not be compatible. The acceptability of these limited exemptions does not preclude the State from requiring refueling vapor recovery systems at such facilities at a later date.
