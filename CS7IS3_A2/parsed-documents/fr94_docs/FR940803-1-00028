FR940803-1-00028 FR940803-1-00004 1. General. The partial exemption applies to all credit union newsletters, whether instituted before or after the compliance date of part 707. Nor must a newsletter be of any particular circulation frequency (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, biannually, annually, or irregularly) or of any certain format (e.g. magazine, bulletin, broadside, circular, mimeograph, letter, or pamphlet) in order to be eligible for the partial advertising exemption. 2. Distribution. In order for newsletters to retain the partial advertising exemption, newsletters can be sent to existing credit union members only. Any distribution reasonably calculated to reach only members is also acceptable, such as Mailing newsletters to existing members Distributing newsletters at a function reasonably limited to members, such as an annual meeting or member picnic Displaying or offering newsletters at a credit union lobby, branch, or office. Distributing a newsletter in a place open to nonmembers, such as a sponsor's lunch room, is not reasonably calculated to reach only members, and such newsletter would be subject to all applicable advertising rules. Section 707.9_Enforcement and record retention. (c) Record retention 1. Evidence of required actions. Credit unions comply with the regulation by demonstrating they have done the following: Established and maintained procedures for paying dividends and providing timely disclosures as required by the regulation, and Retained sample disclosures for each type account offered to members, such as account-opening disclosures, copies of advertisements, and change-in-term notices; and information regarding the dividend rates and annual percentage yields offered. 2. Methods of retaining evidence. Credit unions must retain information needed to reconstruct the required disclosures or other actions. They need not keep disclosures or other business records in hard copy. Records evidencing compliance may be retained on microfilm, microfiche, or by other methods that reproduce records accurately (including computer files). Credit unions must retain copies of all printed advertisements and the text of all advertisements conveyed by electronic or broadcast media, and newsletters. 3. Payment of dividends. Sufficient rate and balance information must be retained to permit the verification of dividends paid on an account, including the payment of dividends on the full principal balance. Appendix A to Part 707_Annual Percentage Yield Calculation Part I. Annual percentage yield for account disclosures and advertising purposes. 1. Rounding for calculations. The following are examples of permissible rounding rules for calculating dividends and the annual percentage yield: The daily rate applied to a balance rounded to five or more decimals. For example; .008219178%, 3.00% for a 365 day year, would be rounded to no less than .00822%. The daily dividends or interest earned rounded to five or more decimals. For example; $.08219178082, daily dividends on $1,000 at 3% for a 365 day year, would be rounded to no less than $.08219. 2. Exponent numerator in a leap year. The annual percentage yield formula's exponent numerator will remain 365 in leap years. 3. First tier of a tiered rate account. The first tier of a tiered rate account is to be disclosed and advertised; ``Up to but not exceeding .␣.␣.'', ``$.01 to .␣.␣.'', or similar language. Part II. Annual percentage yield earned for periodic statements. 1. Balance method. The dividend or interest figure used in the calculation of the annual percentage yield earned may be derived from the daily balance method or the average daily balance method. The balance used in the annual percentage yield earned formula is the sum of the balances for each day in the period divided by the number of days in the period. The balance for each day is based on a point in time; i.e. beginning of day balance, end of day balance, closing of day balance, etc. Each day's balance must be based on the same point in time and cannot be based on the day's low balance. 2. Collected balance method. Credit unions that accrue or pay dividends on noncash deposits using the collected balance method must disclose collected balance information on the periodic statement in order that the member may calculate the dividend amount and annual percentage yield earned (e.g., each day's collected balance when the daily balance method is used and the average daily balance when the average daily balance is used). 3. Negative balances prohibited. Credit unions must treat a negative account balance as zero to determine the balance on which the annual percentage yield earned is calculated. (See commentary to §707.7(a)(2).) A. General formula. 1. Accrued but uncredited dividends. To calculate the annual percentage yield earned, accrued but uncredited dividends: Shall not be included in the balance for statements that are issued at the same time or less frequently than the account's compounding and crediting frequency. For example, if monthly statements are sent for an account that compounds dividends daily and credits dividends monthly, the balance may not be increased each day to reflect the effect of daily compounding. Assume a credit union will pay $13.70 in dividends on $100,000 for the first day, $6.85 in dividends on $50,013.70 for the second day, and $3.43 in dividends on $25,020.55 for the third day. The sum of each days balance is $175,000 (does not include accrued, but uncredited, dividends amounts $13.70, $6.85, and $3.43), thereby resulting in an average daily balance for the three days of $58,333.33. Shall be included in the balance for succeeding statements if a statement is issued more frequently than compounded dividends is credited on an account. For example, if monthly statements are sent for an account that compounds dividends daily and credits dividends quarterly, the balance for the second monthly statement would include dividends that had accrued for the prior month. Assume a credit union will pay $411.78 in dividends on 30 days of $100,000, $427.28 in dividends on 31 days of $100,411.78, and $415.23 in dividends on 30 days of $100,839.06. The balance (average daily balance in the account for the period) for the second 31 days is $100,411.78. 2. Rounding. The dividends earned figure used to calculate the annual percentage yield earned must be rounded to two decimals to reflect the amount actually paid. For example, if the dividends earned for a statement period is $20.074 and the credit union pays the member $20.07, the credit union must use $20.07 (not $20.074) to calculate the annual percentage yield earned. For accounts that pay dividends based on the daily balance method, compound and credit dividends or interest quarterly, and send monthly statements, the credit union may, but need not, round accrued dividends to two decimals for calculating the ``projected'' or ``anticipated'' annual percentage yield earned on the first two monthly statements issued during the quarter. However, on the quarterly statement the dividends earned figure must reflect the amount actually paid. 3. Compounding frequency using the average daily balance method. Any compounding frequency, including daily compounding, can be used when calculating dividends using the average daily balance method. (See comment 707.7(b), which does not require credit unions to compound or credit dividends at any particular frequency).
