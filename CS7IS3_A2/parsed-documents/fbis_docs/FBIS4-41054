There were two sessions -- one in the morning and one in the evening. If the discussion on the draft agreement on a cease-fire for the duration of the talks, as proposed by Romero Piriz Ballon, the UN secretary general's special envoy, had yielded some positive results, it was expected that a plenary meeting would have ensued, with foreign observers taking part. However, the ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned from Otahon Latifi, the head of the Tajik opposition's delegation, that the talks are proceeding with difficulty; the sides have been slow in moving from one point to the next and have been groping for points of contact. But that is no reason for pessimism, Latifi said. Labor Minister Shukurjon Zuhurov, leading the Tajik Government delegation, confirmed that the sides have thus far discussed only the "first paragraphs" of the UN draft. He said, however, that the atmosphere at the talks gives reason to feel some restrained optimism. The talks between the Tajik delegations will continue tomorrow. The UN envoys will take part in them.
