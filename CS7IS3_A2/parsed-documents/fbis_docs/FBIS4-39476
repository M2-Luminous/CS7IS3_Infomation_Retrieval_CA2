Letter to the Russian President"] [Text] Stavropol Kray -- The Stavropol Kray State Duma has sent a letter to Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin and the Russian Federation Federal Assembly "requesting that legislation permitting the purchase and sale of land should not be implemented and that components of the Federation should be granted the right to independently determine the procedure for regulating land relations on sub-departmental territory." In the letter, which was adopted unanimously, the deputies attribute their request to the fact that the State Duma is extremely worried about the sociopolitical situation prevailing in the kray in connection with the upcoming adoption of legislation regulating land relations in the purchase and sale of plots of land. At present, representatives of over 200 nations and nationalities live on the kray's territory, and many of them have settled in ethnic population centers. The purchase and sale of land could lead to a change in the existing ethnic status quo and exacerbate already tense relations. Furthermore, peoples for whom land has never been in private ownership (Cossacks, Turkmens, Nogai, and others) live on the kray's territory in close-knit communities. The implementation of the purchase and sale of land, the deputies are convinced, could lead to a loss of ethnic control of a priceless asset of the Russian people, that is, Mineralnyye Vody in the Caucasus. The Stavropol Kray State Duma believes that land and other natural resources may be held in state, municipal, or private ownership. However, the right to buy and sell should be extended only to truck garden and dacha plots, as well as to land occupied by structures and buildings which are privately owned. It can be said with a great degree of certainty that the State Duma deputies' view corresponds to the mass mood of the Stavropol population, almost half of which is rural. The basis for this conclusion is a kind of referendum on the question conducted among kray inhabitants by the popular newspaper STAVROPOLSKAYA PRAVDA, which has been publishing the most varied opinions over a long period of time under the "Land and Will" rubric, including those of ordinary private farmers, kolkhoz chiefs, agriculture specialists, leaders of administrations, and pensioners in the city and in the country.... The editorial office also familiarized its readers with the stance of supporters and opponents of private ownership of land living in other regions of the country. Statistics and the analysis of the opinions and readers' responses which the editorial office carried out make it possible to draw the simple conclusion. Many specialists in Stavropol believe that the squandering of the land stock must be prevented, that it would be best of all to use plots of land as social shock-absorbers -- as a kind of compensation for the socioeconomic losses that Russians have suffered in consequence of the shock without therapy. This would ease social tension today in many respects and help compensate for the sharp depreciation in the population's financial investments and other securities.
