After World War II, the Yalta accord determined the country's economic direction -- two thirds of Hungarian trade went to the CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] countries. No impulses for economic development were to be expected from these countries. The turnabout came in 1989. Hungary's opening toward the world economy, to be seen as a shift in the fulcrum of its foreign trade, was, together with the change in political regime and economic system, one of the cornerstones of a comprehensive systemic transformation. One illustration of the success of this transformation is the fact that between 1989 and 1993, Hungarian exports to the countries of the European Union [EU] rose from 24 to 47 percent. At the same time, the involvement of Austria and the Scandinavian countries in Hungarian foreign trade rose from 6 to 12 percent. In 1995, about 60 percent of Hungary's exports will go to the European Union. Forty-three percent of the $7 billion that has been invested in Hungary comes for the European Union. EFTA countries that are waiting for EU membership have invested 14 percent. These countries provide more than 70 percent of Hungary's tourist income and 90 percent of the income we earn from other services, and they permit us to finance over 50 percent of our debt repayments. These figures show that Hungary is already closely integrated with Europe. It was not easy to leave behind the restrictions of CEMA and join the rest of Europe. It was a difficult road. The most important milestones along this road were: The establishment of diplomatic relations between Hungary and the European Union in 1988; the first comprehensive accord on trade and economic cooperation, otherwise known as PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary], designed to promote the economic restructuring of Poland and Hungary and concluded in Brussels on 16 December 1991; and the treaty on associate member status with the European Union that came into force on 1 February 1994. Following a resolution by the Hungarian parliament, Hungary submitted its application for full EU membership on 1 April 1994. In accordance with an already-established schedule of Hungary's European strategy, there will be a government-level conference in 1996 in order to decide on the European Union's future geographic expansion. Only after this decision has been reached can negotiations on Hungary's full EU membership commence in 1997. Hungary's road of re-integration with Europe can be divided into clear stages. The period between the end of 1989 and the end of 1993 marked the most difficult stage of transforming the economy. Over 90 percent of prices and imports were released from control, the number of private enterprises quadrupled, the private sector's involvement in Hungary's GNP rose to over 50 percent, and the forint achieved partial convertibility. All these are clear signs of the Hungarian economy's world market maturity and its openness in this direction. Between 1994 and 1996, Hungary's European strategy will release the country from the last shackles of the state-controlled system and prepare it for the EU negotiations. Between 1997 and 1999, the prerequisites for EU membership will be created. The democratic rights that are enshrined in the Hungarian Constitution and the implementation of these rights already conform to the political conditions of the European Treaty and the 1993 Copenhagen Resolution. Hungary is now faced with the difficult task of adapting its legislation and its rules governing finance, environmental protection, health protection, and technology to EU norms. A particularly difficult task will be the subsequent fulfillment of the macroeconomic conditions of the Maastricht treaty regarding inflation, budget equilibrium, and the national debt. These objectives can be attained if the economy picks up in 1996 and economic growth exceeds the EU average. Thus, our country will be ready for the EU talks by 1997, and ready to become a member by 2000. The inevitable difficulties and sacrifices caused by this process can be alleviated by new forms of cooperation that will arise during the period preceding full EU membership. These forms of cooperate could contribute to an acceleration of Hungary's economic growth, recovery, and adaptation. But Hungary's membership of the European Union represents no burden and sacrifice on the part of existing members; instead, it represents a dowry. In economics, politics, and security, European interests, even international interests, involve the need to show that the path of comprehensive systemic change is justifiable. Hungary has a good chance of presenting the first successful transformation for everyone to see. This is also a major impulse for the remaining countries in the region. Full EU membership permits EU enterprises to avail themselves of Hungary's historic role of mediator in Eastern and Central Europe in order to develop relations even further. The 20,000 foreign enterprises in Hungary and 1,500 Hungarian joint ventures in the neighboring countries also encourage closer links with Western Europe in this region. Over the past four years, Hungary has become an extraordinarily extensive market for Western European goods, a market that is still expanding. The capital investments that have been made so far clearly show that Hungary has become a very attractive industrial location in the new European Economic Area on account of the progress in free trade, its qualified and cheap manpower, and the motivation of its work forces.
