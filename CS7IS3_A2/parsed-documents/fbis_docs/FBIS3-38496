We were discussing the previous day's successful operation by our Air Force against Zhalah camp, one of the new bases of the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. This official said: "Our air operation hit all the targets and we achieved results. The Turkish Air Force has proven that if necessary it could also destroy targets beyond 500 kilometers. In terms of distance Zhalah camp is not nearer than al-Biqa'. If the civilian authority orders, we can similarly strike at al-Biqa'." This high-ranking General Staff official placed special emphasis on al-Biqa' and made no request that this not be published. The conclusion that could be drawn from this is that al-Biqa' has been included among targets that could be struck when the international situation allows. [passage omitted]
