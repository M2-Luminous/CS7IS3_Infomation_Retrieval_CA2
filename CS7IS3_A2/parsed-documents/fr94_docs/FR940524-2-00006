SUMMARY: Pursuant to section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR part 1500), and the Soil Conservation Service Regulations (7 CFR part 650), the Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, gives notice that an environmental impact statement (EIS) is not being prepared for the Battery Creek High School recreational project in Beaufort County, South Carolina. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Ellis Morrow, Acting State Conservationist, Soil Conservation Service, 1835 Assembly Street, room 950, Columbia, South Carolina 29201, telephone (803) 765&hyph;5681. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The environmental assessment of this federally assisted action indicates that the project will not cause significant local, regional, or national impacts on the environment. As a result of these findings, Ellis Morrow, Acting State Conservationist, has determined that the preparation and review of an environmental impact statement are not needed for this project. The project purposes are to improve athletic facilities for Battery Creek High School. The planned works of improvement include the construction of an asphalt running track. The notice of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency and to various Federal, State, and local agencies and interested parties. A limited number of copies of the FONSI are available to fill single copy requests at the above address. Basic data developed during the environmental assessment are on file and may be reviewed by contacting Walter Earley, USDA_Soil Conservation Service, Ridgeland-Beaufort Field Office, Federal Building and Post Office, Main St., P.O. Drawer K, Ridgeland, SC 29936. No administrative action on implementation of the proposal will be taken until 30 days after the date of this publication in the Federal Register . Dated: April 12, 1994. Ellis Morrow, Acting State Conservationist. This activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.904_Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention_and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. Introduction The Battery Creek High School Recreational Facility is a federally assisted action authorized for planning under Public Law 97&hyph;98, the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981. An environmental assessment was undertaken in conjunction with the development of the Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D) Measure Plan. This assessment was conducted in consultation with local, State, and Federal agencies as well as with interested organizations and individuals. Data developed during the assessment are available for public review at the following location: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, 1835 Assembly St., room 950, Columbia, SC 29201. Recommended Action The proposal includes the construction of a running track at the Battery Creek High School. The High School, Beaufort County School district and the local athletic committee have committed over 78% of the funds needed for the project. The engineering plans and specifications have been completed by the school district and only financial assistance is requested. State and/or local permits concerning water or air pollution will be obtained prior to construction by the local sponsors. The Corps of Engineers 404 permit and South Carolina Coastal Council authorizations will not be required. Effect of Recommended Action The Battery Creek High School has an enrollment of 1,200 students of which 61.5% are minority. Improved recreational facilities will enable students to practice and compete with other schools which will increase self-esteem, reduce dropout rate, improve grades to remain eligible to participate in sports, and, overall, will develop a more well-rounded citizen. No land use changes will occur as the track will be constructed on an established recreational area. The proposed action will have no effect on wetlands nor will it affect archaeological and historical areas, since the track will be built around an existing football field. Endangered or threatened plants or animals are not known to exist on the site. The topography of the site is generally flat and all adjacent lands are protected with permanent grass. The soil is Sewee Fine Sand and is not considered to be prime or important farmland. The area has been committed to recreation by the school. No significant adverse environmental impacts will result from installation of this project. Alternatives The planned action will provide a high quality track and field facility which will minimize injuries and allow the students to compete with other school districts in field and track competition, thereby developing self esteem and student pride. Because no significant adverse environmental impacts will result from installation of the measures, no other alternatives, other than the no project, were considered. Consultation_Public Participation Formal agency consultation began with the initiation of the notification of the State Single Point of Contact for Federal Assistance on February 11, 1994. An interdisciplinary scoping trip was not conducted because the proposed project is planned to be placed on previously developed school property. Public meetings with regard to this project have been conducted during local district meetings and by actions of the stadium committee and booster clubs. The stadium committee and booster clubs are volunteer organizations with a goal of improving the athletic facilities of Battery Creek High School. The ultimate objective being to provide a better atmosphere to improve learning and produce better citizens for the community and the area. These organizations have raised over $5,000 toward this project. Conclusion The environmental assessment summarized above indicates that this Federal action will not cause significant local, regional or national adverse impacts on the environment. Therefore, based on the above findings, I have determined that an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Battery Creek High School Recreation Facility RC&D project is not required. Dated: April 12, 1994. Ellis Morrow, Acting State Conservationist. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;9647 Filed 5&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;16&hyph;M
