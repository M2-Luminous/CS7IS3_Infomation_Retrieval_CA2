Such cooperation--in order to be genuine, effective, and fruitful in building the nation's power base--requires a large measure of skills that are not developed within conventional contexts. The development and consolidation of this vital base requires aware leaders to possess not only concrete capabilities but also the humanitarian, spiritual, physical, and moral leadership qualities connoted by the word "leader." This base also requires innovative, enterprising leaders with firm resolve, i.e., who can make decisions at the appropriate time, not in isolation from society at large, but through interaction with it. In other words, a successful, effective, productive student and youth leadership is one that can directly and indirectly influence not only students and youths, but also the country or society at large, including all of its cultural institutions, subdivisions, and links. It is extremely important to understand, absorb, and act according to this last point, because the young generation is society's foundation, the nation's springboard, and, by extension, the nation's "most" vital segment. Therefore, crises, muddled perception, or psychological shocks affecting the young generation endanger the entire nation and its future. Hence, the importance of the young generation being led by leaders of great substance, who can scout out, nurture, bring to fruition, and unleash the latent creative abilities of this "priceless resource." The leaders whom we have in mind are not just "administrative leaders," although such leaders are important. The leaders whom we have in mind are "vital, combative, believing leaders with spirited approaches to life," who marry their consciousness to the struggle, the battle [jihad], and development, who can unleash the fresh, active, spiritual energies of the young. Only with such leaders can we say--with the utmost optimism, confidence, and trust--that the young generation will proceed on the path to building the civilized, strong, fortified society for which we hope. Based on the preceding, the election of comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn to be chairman of the Executive Office of the National Federation of Students of Iraq and the General Federation of Youths of Iraq is a great gain for this vital sector. It marks the beginning of a new phase in which the marrying of consciousness to the struggle, battle, and development will be prominent, clear, and manifest as it rises up before all segments and components of our society at large. Comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn is not a traditional leader. He is not a youth or student whose ideas are framed academically or bound by his age. True, comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn possesses all of the characteristics of youth in terms of the freshness of his spirit and his innovation, ingenuity, initiative, creativity, and vitality. However, comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn also possesses--and this is extremely important--the wellsprings of his father, the leader and symbol, Saddam Husayn, who is an inexhaustible well of combative action, brilliant combative conduct, maturity, superior ability to make decisive decisions, human touches, bravery, boldness, patience, and hearty identification with the nation's history, land, and combat mission. Comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn is not only a graduate of the school of the great leader Saddam Husayn. He is also a primary link in the equation that links the past with the present and the future. This is the link that the enemies of Iraq and the nation [ummah] are attempting to break with their reprehensible conspiracies. These conspiracies aim to deprive young Arab generations of their role and cut them off from their spiritual and combative history and legacy, in addition to distorting their culture, motives, and standards, and destroying their personality. We are thus facing a new period for students and youth that is based on the foundation built by the great leader Saddam Husayn, with his great, unlimited concern for students and youth. There are many justifications and reasons for this exceptional concern. Foremost among them is the leader's firm conviction that students in Iraq understand that educational, intellectual, and philosophical goals converge in their sector, making it a pivotal sector. Youths--of whom students comprise a large segment--are the nation's most vital segment, as stated above. Concern with youths is thus tantamount to concern with the nation's present and future. It is certain that the new leadership of the National Federation of Students of Iraq and the General Federation of Youths of Iraq will shoulder many tasks that will guarantee the achievement of qualitative leaps in student and youth activity. We believe that this will happen. In order for student and youth activity to be successful, fruitful, and effective, all state institutions must cooperate with the programs and plans of these two federations. We should realize that the development of mature students and youths is society's collective responsibility to its young generation. By themselves, neither the two federations nor other organizations can cultivate mature young people. Vital slogans must be highlighted, and efforts must be made to translate them into reality. This requires collective efforts in which the two federations are participants, but not the sole participants. The party for example, as the leader in society, can take action within social channels on two related tracks. First, it can protect students and youths from possible behavioral deviations. Second, it can solve, through education, problems that might obstruct the progress of students and youths. In this regard, the party must expand the two federations' cooperation and integration with pertinent official agencies, e.g., the Interior Ministry, the Labor and Social Affairs Ministry, the Health Ministry, the Education Ministry, and the Higher Education Ministry. The party must also emphasize basic, vital slogans, and it should do so in harmony with what is put forward by the two federations and other organizations involved in student and youth welfare. Field studies on students, for example, show that most of the problems facing students lie outside of the educational framework (e.g., the college, university, etc.), and even outside of education itself. In other words, they are social, economic, and other problems. This means that the scope of national action with respect to youths will be very extensive when it is supported by the efforts of other organizations that bear responsibility for the welfare of students as human beings, members of this nation, and future leaders. The election of comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn as chairman of the Executive Office for Students and Youth will be a great help and a major, decisive factor in making all party and state organizations work like a beehive with the two federations to achieve the goals that have been set. The moral and practical value of comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn's election by a consensus to the chairmanship of the student and youth sector is apparent in this regard. For comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn will solve the problems of students and youths based on a scientific, revolutionary, cultural, humanistic, completely integrated method. Our great leader Saddam Husayn will also solve the problems of Iraq and the nation. The results of this type of problem-solving will be great and brilliant. Comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn's solutions to the problems of students and youths will certainly be suited to and commensurate with the major challenges facing Iraq and our nation. They will be formulated in the light of creative, theoretical thought and the Ba'thist action of the essential leader, Saddam Husayn. And they will be formulated within the framework and approach of the blessed July Revolution, which has supported students and youth unlike any other revolution, Arab country, or foreign country in our contemporary history. We fully trust that the son of the great leader Saddam Husayn will play a role--the one for which our leader has raised him--in enriching the march of students and youths toward concrete action, and in enriching the major achievements that have been and will be accomplished for great Iraq. For Iraq has won its bet through the cooperation and solidarity of its resistant, patient people. It has won its civilizational bet. The glorious mother of battles has given us one proof after another that our future will be bright. The mother of battles multiplied our reserve of optimism, which is based on facts and givens. We have great confidence in our students and youths, because this faithful, primary segment--which has been raised on true patriotic principles, on the principles and values of the nation, and on the directives of the nation's leader, and which has helped defend the nation at all costs--is no longer an experiment. It is a living accomplished fact, the crown and wall of this nation, and the symbol of its vigor. The historical initiative will always remain in the hands of generations that maintain the vitality of their combative youth, the generations of the Ba'thist school, the school of the great leader Saddam Husayn, and the school of the glorious mother of battles.
