The new party made a "historic Amritsar declaration," renewing the `age old Akali' demand for the "formation of a separate area (state) for the Sikhs wherein the `quam' (community) can experience the glow of freedom and freely profess and propagate its religious view-points and at the same time uplift Punjabi culture." The declaration was read out at a public rally held inside the Golden Temple complex after the culmination of the week-long Akali unity process in which all the frontline Akali factions barring the Akali Dal (Badal) had participated. In the declaration, the Akalis speaking on the lines of the Anandpur Sahib resolution also demanded that India be re-organised into a confederation of states wherein every religion and community could freely profess and propagate its views and culture. The declaration warned that if this demand for bringing about changes in the Indian constitution on federal lines was not met then the Akali leaders would be left with no option but to launch a struggle for an "independent sovereign Sikh state." The Akali Dal which were dissolved today were the Akali Dal (Kabul), the Mann Dal, the Manjit Dal, the Babbar Akali Dal, Akali Dal (Panthic) and the Talwandi Akali Dal. The Badal faction of the Akalis aligned with the SGPC [Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (Sikh Temple Management Committee)] chief, Mr Gurcharan Singh Tohra, also announced their decision to leave their parent body and join the SAD [Shiromani Akali Dal (Akali Religious Party)] (Amritsar). The frontline leaders of the dissolved Akali factions who had taken part in the unity process which was started on Monday last under the guidance of Akali Takht acting Jathedar Prof Manjit Singh took a pledge to preserve and protect the interests of the new party. In the pledge read out by Bhai Manjit Singh who had still yesterday headed the Manjit Dal, the Akali leaders decided to re-dedicate themselves for the betterment of the Sikh community and for achieving the proposed demand for a `separate Sikh area.' Besides Bhai Manjit Singh the other leaders who took the pledge before the public gathering were former Punjab chief minister and Kabul faction leader Mr Surjit Singh Barnala, Mr Amrinder Singh of the Panthic Dal, Mr Simranjit Singh Mann, Mr Jagdev Singh Talwandi and Col Jasmer Singh of the Babbar Dal. Mr Barnala, who declared the formation of the new party, also announced to formation of a six-member committee consisting of the above-mentioned six leaders to run the affairs of the party. The Amritsar declaration which was read out by Col. Jasmer Singh, former general secretary of the Babar Akali Dal soon after Mr Barnala finished his speech, was also greeted by the public. The contents of the one-page document created confusion for newsmen who wanted to know whether the Akalis had demanded an "area for the Sikhs" within the Indian union or a separate independent state. The declaration while raising this demand castigated the Congress leaders, who at the time of the Indo-Pakistan partition had promised the then Sikh leaders a similar "independent area" for the Sikhs. These leaders had betrayed the Sikhs as they did not create such a state, Mr Jasmer Singh said while reading out the document. The document while drawing comparisons of the political and social realignments world-wide said it was only in such a Sikh state that the interests of the minorities could be protected and there would be scope for the expansion of Punjabi culture. Both Sikhs and Punjabis could feel free to profess and propagate their religion and culture in this `free zone', the document added.
