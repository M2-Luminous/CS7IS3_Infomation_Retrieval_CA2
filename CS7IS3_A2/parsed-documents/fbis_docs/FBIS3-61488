K. Ambrosimov, Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Oceanology] [Abstract] On the basis of a wide range of of data the author constructs a stochastic classification model for the characteristics of the empirical distributions of fields of various types. As experimental material he uses 15 samples from surveys of ocean temperature fields obtained on expeditions by research ships of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in various dynamic zones of the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean. By means of the criterion X[.sup]2[/] algorithms were constructed for the optimal classification of empirical histograms according to general populations. Using the results of the measurements an analysis was made of the general populations of horizontal l[.sup]+[/][.sub]-[/] scales for temperature fields in the upper layer of the ocean.
