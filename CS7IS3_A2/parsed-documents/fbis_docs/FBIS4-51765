Through a spokesman's statement, the NUB pointed out that North Korea's suspension of the MAC function and demand for replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement with the United States is a violation of Article 61 of the Armistice Agreement, which states that the agreement can only be amended upon mutual agreement between North and South Korea, and Article 5 of the basic agreement between the South and the North. The NUB stressed that until an alternative replacing the current armistice organization is provided, the agreements should be earnestly abided by and any action intended to make the current armistice organization defunct cannot be justified. The NUB pointed out that, at a time when the North Korean nuclear issue is at a critical point, North Korea's threatening of the current armistice system is intended to delay the resolution of the nuclear issue and blur the essence of the issue, and strongly urged North Korea to show a sincere attitude toward the resolution of the nuclear issue as soon as possible.
