There are two main items in the basic socialist system: One, public ownership of the means of production, and two, the Communist Party in power. One item is economic, one is political; these are the essential differences between it and the basic capitalist system. There will be no questions about establishing a socialist market economic system if we do not firmly uphold the position of the Communist Party in power and public ownership of the means of production. To firmly uphold a socialist public ownership system requires enlivening large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises because they are the backbone of socialist public ownership. The current matter is: In general, the mainstays of the public ownership system--medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises--still lack vitality. A relative number of them have suffered losses while there is flourishing growth in the non-public ownership economy. We naturally cannot clutch onto policies to control growth in the non-public ownership system economy to protect the publically-owned economy. On the one hand we must continue to encourage the growth of the non publically-owned economy. On the other hand we must enliven state-owned medium- and large-sized enterprises through deeper reforms. We may very possibly be compelled to privatize if the latter cannot be enlivened for a long time and are powerless to compete against the non publically-owned economy. Therefore, enlivening medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises is both a fundamental economic issue as well as a fundamental political issue. Overall, medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises still lack vitality. This is a fact. However, there are two opinions regarding how to treat this fact. One regards their lack of vitality as due to the public ownership system. Some believe that having medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises is in itself a mistake. A second treatment is to seek truth from facts, with specific analyses for specific issues. The lack of vitality seen in medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises is in terms of comparison with the non publically-owned economy and the collectively-owned economy. On the surface, considering vitality and competitiveness, the state-owned is not as good as the collective, the collective is not as good as the individually-owned, the individually-owned is not as good as the privately-owned, and the privately-owned is not as good as enterprises with the three types of foreign ownership. Nonetheless, this is not a material fact but purely a surface phenomenon. The fact of the matter is that they basically are incomparable. First, medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises were created under a highly unified planned economic system. They operated for several decades under the old system. Now we must undertake reform, a reform of the highly unified planned economy, transform enterprise operating mechanisms and establish a socialist market economic system. There is a switching process for enterprises to enter the marketplace as independent economic bodies. The non publically-owned and collectively-owned economy as swift-footed arrive first, reaching it in one step. For them there is no process of switching from the old to new systems. They create enterprise operating mechanisms directly according to th e needs of a market economy. Second, the developmental histories differ. Medium-and large-sized state-owned enterprises always have been pillars of the national economy. The individual economy, the private economy and enterprises using the three types of foreign investment are products arising in implementing reforms of the economic system following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee Meeting of the CPC. Because medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprise directors for a long time used a policy of unified state control over income and expenditure, the state added value on enterprises by tax profits and other methods and allocated seriously insufficient funds for the technological transformation of enterprises. This brought on the aging of enterprise equipment, backward technology, and no readjustment of the industrial mix, product mix or tecnological mix of enterprises for a long time. Under highly unified planning, this contradiction was somewhat hidden. After reforming the economic system and once enterprises directly faced markets, this contradiction immediately became clear. From the day they were set up, the individual economy, the private economy, and foreign-funded enterprises faced the market. Their industrial mix, product mix and technology mix were naturally rational. Even though certain things are irrational, small boats are easy to turn about and readjustment is relatively simple. It is relatively hard to readjust the industrial, product and technology mixes of medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises. Third, social contributions and burdens are not the same. Most medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises are old. All have made outstanding contributions to the state in terms of providing tax income and training and moving personnel. At the same time, they have constituted a considerable core of retired worker. Because social security mechanisms still are unformed, retired workers still rely on enterprises for living security and medical benefits. Retired workers account for one-third of those on the job in most enterprises. In particular enterprises, the proportion of workers on the job to those retired is one to one. This undoubtedly will increase costs, lower profit levels and correspondingly weaken competitiveness. Prior to reform, China's employment road was narrow. There also was a desire to sustain social stability. Medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises only had a responsibility to expand employment but no authority to reduce the number of staff and workers. As a result there was surplus labor on the job. Generally speaking, there was 20 percent to 30 percent surplus of workers at medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises. Speaking in terms of the needs of a market economy, this is an irrational allocation of resources. Surplus workers should be pared down to attain the best combination of the means of production and labor and improve economic results. Considered in terms of the needs of social stability, enterprises are not allowed to push surplus workers out into society. Although the "Regulations for Transforming the Operating Mechanisms of Enterprises Owned by the Whole People" stipulated that those responsible for an enterprise have this authority, practically noone responsible for an enterprise dares use it. The individual economy, the private economy and foreign-funded enteprises need not have such worries. Medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises have paid an enormous price to the state and society. This price will lead to higher enterprise costs, lower profit levels and weaker competitiveness. For a long time now, we have had enterprises run society, from cafeterias to elementary and middle schools. Some even run colleges. Although this is a contribution by enterprises, it also is a burden. The individual economy, the private economy and foreign-funded enteprises have neither such a contribution nor any such burden. It clearly is unfair if it is sweepingly and abstractly stated that medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises are not as good as the individual economy, the private economy, or foreign-funded enterprises, in terms of vitality, without differentiating these different circumstances. If medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises are allowed to smash the "three knives": One, give retired workers to the state and society, and enterprises will no longer care for them; two, pare down all surplus workers; and three, stop the running of middle and elementary schools and colleges. In this way, enterprises would immediately be enlivened by one-half. The current problem is that none of the three knives can be smashed. Enterprises still must practice exercises to benefit the internal organs and digest [workers] themselves. This requires procedure. The process of enlivening medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises also is one of economic development and reform. The "Decisions of the Central Committee of the CPC Regarding Reform of the Economic System" notes "full development of a commodity economy is a stage which socialist economic development cannot overstep. It is an essential condition to realize the modernization of China's economy." The "Decisions by the Central Committeee of the Communist Party of China Regarding Several Issues Concerning Establishing a Socialist Market Economic System" by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee note, "transform the operating mechanisms of state-owned enterprises and establish a modern enterprise system" and "a modern enterprise system with a public ownership system as the main part is the foundation of the socialist market economic system." The two meetings, two documents and their policy regulations are a summary of economic development and reform experience. They also are a deepening of reform theory reflecting that our understanding of socialism and reform have reached a new level. Nevertheless, establishing a socialist market economic system is an unprecedented pioneering undertaking that requires resolution of many extremely complicated issues. Economic system reform is a profound reform relating to the foundation of the economy and many areas of superstructure. Of course we must change various irrational interest situations inherent to the old system and those newly created in the process of transforming the system. We cannot avoid this or that difficulty or obstruction which may be encountered. Overall, we must handle well the relationship among reform, development and stability. We must handle well interest relationships in all respects, motivate all positive factors and create conditions for healthy growth of the national economy. Ths requires that we develop market economies. We cannot negate the primary position of the public ownership system. To enliven enterprises we must not create social upheaval. To rationally allocate resources we cannot create enormous armies of unemployed. Reform is a mass undertaking. The "Decisions by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Regarding Several Issues Concerning Establishing a Socialist Market Economic System" make clear stipulations regarding basic reform ideology, basic theory, basic policy, basic principles, and basic requirements. Reform theory is further clarified and the direction of reform is further defined. Whether there is success in transforming the operating mechanisms of state-owned enterprises, in establishing modern enterprise systems, in fostering and developing market systems, in changing political functions, in establishing a full macroeconomic readjustment and control system, and in establishing rational individual income allocation and social security systems, the practice of the masses must be relied on. A successful example is provided to us by overall and complete reform of the Beijing Number One Light Industry Headquarters; the secret of success lies in the two words, "overall and complete." Their method was to pull out of secondary and enter tertiary industry -- enterprises situated in urban golden areas pull out of secondary industry and enter tertiary industry; pull out of fourth and enter secondary -- enterprises situated in golden areas pull back beyond the fourth ring and develop secondary industries with high results at high starting points; added asset value -- rationally deploy resources through the direction of land use and development models to attain the greatest added value of assets; industrial shift -- on the basis of added asset value, readjust and reorganize the industrial mix; transform mechanisms -- change mechanisms and establish systems while transforming enterprises and reorganizing industries; have headquarters manage assets instead of enterprises; personnel circulation --asset redevelopment creates new employment opportunities, allowing the best arrangement of surplus personnel; industrial mix readjustment -- personnel changes and function readjustment are all deep reforms and enormous changes. While deepening reform by enormous change, economic growth was maintained and state-owned assets increased in value, while maintaining social stability. This must be called an extraordinary wonder. Of course the Beijing Number One Light Industry Headquarters has the superiority of occupying a golden area which others do not. Nonetheless it also should be seen that others have superiorities which it does not. The outcome still depends on human effort. A certain large-sized enterprise in Jiangsu has an on-the-job worker to retired worker ratio of one-to-one, with 30 percent surplus workers, long-term losses and near-bankruptcy. The threat of bankruptcy oppresses the director and workers. Oppression engenders a feeling of crisis and the feeling of crisis brought on a courageous search for a way out. After several years of struggle, they got out of difficulty. What was the general character of these two experiences, that of the Beijing Number One Light Industrial Enterprise and the Jiangsu large-sized enterprise? It is as discussed in the "Decisions by the Central Committeee of the Communist Party of China Regarding Several Issues Concerning Establishing a Socialist Market Economic System": "Respect the pioneering spirit of the masses. Give heed to the individual interests of the masses. Summarize in a timely way the practical experience of the masses. Respect the desires of the masses. Guide, protect and develop well the enthusiasm of the masses. In the process of deepening reform and developing the economy, handle appropriately the relationships among accumulation and consumption, the whole and the partial and long-term and near-term interests. Continually raise the living standards of the masses. Make reform win a broad and deep mass foundation." Establishing a modernized enterprise system with Chinese characteristics and establishing a socialist market economic system are unprecedented pioneering undertakings; thus, we especially must emphasize people's creativity and respect the masses's pioneering spirit. Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said on his 1992 southern tour: In a certain sense, firmly upholding socialism, developing the economy, reforming and the open door policy, and firmly upholding the cause of the two civilizations depend on the people. Integrating a basically socialist system and a market economy requires firmly upholding the position and leading role of the public ownership system. Firmly upholding the position and leading role of the public ownership system requires enlivening medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises. This accords with the logic of theoretical and practical developments.
