After the summit, you declared that the withdrawals from the Golan would be subjected to a public referendum. Are you not erecting obstacles to the chances for peace with Syria? [Rabin] No, I don't think so, because I believe that the people of Israel are interested in achieving peace with the Palestinians in the way that we have been pursuing since the signing of the Declaration of Principles in Washington, and with Syria because of its strategic importance and its influence in what is going on in Lebanon, and in a more limited way with Jordan. Furthermore, I believe that the Syrian leadership and people need peace. But this is not enough for Israel. The Syrian leadership is responsible for convincing the Israeli Government and people that Syria indeed means peace. I don't expect the Syrian leadership to do the same thing that President al-Sadat did to convince the Israeli people that he wanted peace. No doubt -- in my opinion -- Al-Sadat's presence in Jerusalem accomplished 80 or 90 percent of the work of former Israeli prime minister Menahem Begin in convincing the Israeli people that Egypt wanted peace. This made it easy for the Israeli Government to pay a high price for peace. We are involved in negotiations with Syria but they are not being held in the same way that we had our negotiations with Egypt. But at the same time, Syria is not making much of an effort to reduce the terrorist activities of Hizballah against Israel. Therefore, the issue is very important to the people of Israel. I believe that there is democratic life in Israel and that on certain issues the opinions of the people must be taken into account. I did not do that when I signed the Declaration of Principles document with the PLO. I do not intend to do that when the Declaration of Principles Accord is implemented with regard to the Gaza-Jericho First and then regarding the subsequent stage. As for Syria, the issue is much more important. [Shalabi] How do you expect the Syrian side to carry out confidence-building steps when at the same time you are accusing the Syrians of supporting Hizballah? [Rabin] I believe that in July, the Lebanese Government was prepared to deploy 3,000 Lebanese troops in south Lebanon, north of the security zone, alongside the South Lebanese Army, to prove that they could prevent terrorism. If, after six month of deployment, the Lebanese Army an prove it is capable of preventing terrorist activities and disarming Hizballah, I am prepared to sign a peace treaty based on the international borders that existed during the British mandate. This treaty would produce security arrangements and would confirm to the Lebanese who cooperate with us in the security zone that they will not be harmed and that no actions will be taken against them beyond those taken against the other militias, which were disarmed by the Lebanese Government over the past one and a half years. Therefore, there is no reason not to have peace with Lebanon. [Shalabi] Mr. Prime Minister, the recent incidents in Lebanon have led to calls by the Israeli right to launch a large-scale attack against the Hizballah. What is your opinion on this? [Rabin] I do not want to specify what kind of military operations we will conduct in the future. I think that the method and policy I pursued when I served as defense minister in the National Unity Government in 1985 are the same today. A new war in Lebanon will lead to nowhere. At the same time, we will maintain freedom of military activities whenever and wherever we find it necessary against Hizballah targets all over Lebanon. [Shalabi] So, do you expect the situation to remain the same in southern Lebanon until a settlement is reached with Syria? [Rabin] I believe that a solution to the problem between Lebanon and Israel is a peace agreement when the Lebanese Government, with the support of Syria, is able to prove that it is in full in control of all Lebanese sovereign areas. As I said before, let the test be six months from the time the Lebanese forces have deployed and have taken action against Hizballah and show that they are capable of doing that. Once they have proven that, you know that there is no territorial problem between Israel and Lebanon. We do not want an inch of the sovereign soil of Lebanon. We do not want one cubic meter of it. All what we want is peace and security, and to give the option to the Lebanese Government to prove its ability to control its sovereign soil and prevent the use of its territory as a springboard for attacks against Israel. [passage omitted] [Shalabi] There are reports of a decision to release about 2,000 Palestinian detainees. Is this true? [Rabin] No. We made it clear that the release of the prisoners and the detainees, particularly the detainees, will take place together with the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement, after they are separated in groups. There are groups of Palestinian prisoners who have killed Israelis, and I do not think that they will be released. Furthermore, we have our own demands to make of the Palestinians. For example, we have three soldiers who have been missing since the June 1982 war who were killed [as heard] in a clash with a Palestinian force under Syrian command. We expect the PLO to indicate their whereabouts and whether they are alive or not. We need cooperation on the part of the Palestinians. The demand cannot be one-sided. We want a responsible position from the Palestinian side regarding the missing. [Shalabi] Regarding this particular point, there are reports about hundreds of Palestinians missing since 1967 who are being held in Israeli prisons. Is there any truth in that? [Rabin] We cannot keep anyone in any Israeli prison without announcing it; our laws demand this. Anyone who violates these laws will be brought to trial. [Shalabi] Mr. Prime Minister, after the Madrid conference, everybody has been talking about a new Middle East. How do you see it from your standpoint? [Rabin] I hope that once we reach an agreement with the three neighboring states--Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon--in addition to the peace with Egypt--the 15th anniversary of which we are celebrating these days--and the start of the implementation of the Declaration of Principles with the Palestinians, there will be a better chance to check the activities of the extremist Islamic groups that are threatening the moderate regimes in the Arab world. This will lead to a new Middle East and a better climate for cooperation among the countries and peoples of the area for the benefit and progress of all the peoples and the countries of this area. [Shalabi] Thank you very much.
