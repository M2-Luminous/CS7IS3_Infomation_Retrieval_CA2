The Prime Minister stressed that although the new government was cut by 20 percent, this will not affect its performance because of the professional skills of its members. He told senior cabinet members that the government must build its relations with the Federal Assembly on the basis of cooperation, given that the cabinet and parliament were being led by "common state interests." Chernomyrdin had accepted a proposal made at the session of the State Duma that the government should make weekly reports in the house. In his view, the prime minister or his deputies do not have to appear regularly in parliament but cabinet members and ministers must keep in permanent touch with the deputies. Chernomyrdin stressed in particular that members of the reformed cabinet should not pay much attention to forecasts of "how long it will last, given that the present government is quite viable". It was decided that the government would meet in a full session on February 17, with President Yeltsin possibly attending it. Chernomyrdin warned the ministries and departments against any excessive spending while forming this year's budget.
