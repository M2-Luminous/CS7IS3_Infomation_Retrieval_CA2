[Passage omitted covered by referent item] The main theme of the Parti Bersatu Sabah [PBS] [United Sabah Party] manifesto, unveiled by party president and Chief Minister Datuk Sri Joseph Pairin Kitingan this morning, is the recurring thorny issues in State-Federal ties since PBS came into power in 1985. The key points in the PBS manifesto are similar to those used in the last three elections. They include a more equitable sharing of petroleum revenue, and safeguarding Sabah's constitutional rights. The PBS says it will pursue the proposal to set up a university and a separate TV station. It also emphasises that the party will continue to seek from the Federal Government a long-term solution to the Philippines' claim on Sabah, more effective ways to prevent the inflow of illegal immigrants and manage those in the State. [passage omitted] This time the 13-page manifesto also makes subtle references to Umno's [United Malays National Organization] presence in Sabah. In an apparent reference to Umno and Federal leaders, it says the party will seek to free Sabahans from fear of political domination and eliminate any tendency from any quarter to exert their "tyranny over the minds of man by one person or group from within or out side Sabah". [passage omitted] The 14-point economic programme outlined aims at further diversifying, adding value and restructuring Sabah's economic base and enhancing its competitiveness in the international market. It will continue to create a conducive environment for private sector growth, intensify training and development of entrepreneurship and technical skills. When pointed out that the PBS development agenda paled in comparison with the BN's plans, Pairin said the promise was not new. "If we were in the Federal Government, we would do more than that. All these promises should have been done from 1963 (the year Sabah joined Malaysia). [passage omitted] He claimed that the BN manifesto was an election ploy and that the only thing new was to "put in writing all these promises" He blamed the BN for the inferior infrastructure in Sabah and the shortage of personnel such as doctors saying that the BN's record in Sabah was poor. On the State-Federal relations, he said the PBS would seek sincere and mutual understanding towards better a political relationship with the Federal Government and enhance national integration and unity.
