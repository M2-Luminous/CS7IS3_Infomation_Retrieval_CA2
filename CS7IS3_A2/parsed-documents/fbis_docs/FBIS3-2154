This was disclosed recently by Zhu Yuli, president of the China Aircraft Industry Corporation. According to a Chinese military source, the new-model jet fighter to be developed has been named "Super 7." China is said to plan to use in principle technology it has obtained from Soviet-built MiG fighters, but it intends to introduce Western state-of-the art technology to develop it. The new-model jet fighter will be developed under the "Takeoff Plan" the corporation has drawn up as a long-term strategy through the end of this century. The plan calls for the production of both military and civilian aircraft. According to ZHONGGUO HANGKKONG BAO [the China Aviation Newspaper], the plan calls for 1) developing China's capability to develop and manufacture turbo jet engines for use in military aircraft; 2) creating a research and development system to build helicopters domestically; 3) aggressively importing loading equipment, particularly electronics technology, and 4) developing China's capability to design and build a large-type airliner. According to the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, China built a total of 256 aircraft in 1993, an increase of 24 percent from a year earlier. The production of aircraft engines grew 27 percent while the production of missiles increased 53.9 percent. China's aircraft trade in the year amounted to approximately $1 billion with imports standing at $850 million. The "Takeoff Plan" envisions China's aircraft trade at $3 billion in the year 2000.
