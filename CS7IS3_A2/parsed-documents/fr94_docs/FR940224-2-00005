Muracciole; Order Denying Permission to Apply for or Use Export Licenses In the matter of Roque A. Muracciole, 14311 Southwest 88 Street, Number 406, Miami, Florida 33186, and currently incarcerated at Federal Correctional Facility_Ashland, Inmate Number 41566&hyph;004, Post Office Box 888716, Ashland, Kentucky 41105. On April 27, 1990, Roque A. Muracciole (hereinafter referred to as ``Muracciole'') was convicted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida_Miami Division of two counts of violating the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C.A. app. §§2401&hyph;2420 (1991, Supp. 1993, and Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;10, March 27, 1993)) (the ``EAA''), by possessing a controlled U.S.-origin computer with knowledge that it was intended for export to Bulgaria, and by preparing a falsified invoice with the intent to evade the provisions of the EAA. Section 11(h) of the EAA provides that, at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce, 1 no person convicted of violating the EAA, or certain other provisions of the United States Code, shall be eligible to apply for or use any export license issued pursuant to, or provided by, the EAA or the Export Administration Regulations (currently codified at 15 CFR parts 768&hyph;799 (1993)) (the ``Regulations''), for a period of up to 10 years from the date of the conviction. In addition, any export license issued pursuant to the EAA in which such a person had any interest at the time of his conviction may be revoked. 1 Pursuant to appropriate delegations of authority that are reflected in the Regulations, the Director, Office of Export Licensing, in consultation with the Director, Office of Export Enforcement, exercises the authority granted to the Secretary by section 11(h) of the EAA. Pursuant to §§770.15 and 772.1(g) of the Regulations, upon notification that a person has been convicted of violating the EAA, the Director, Office of Export Licensing, in consultation with the Director, Office of Export Enforcement, shall determine whether to deny that person permission to apply for or use any export license issued pursuant to, or provided by, the EAA and the Regulations and shall also determine whether to revoke any export license previously issued to such a person. Having received notice of Muracciole's conviction for violating the EAA, and following consultations with the Director, Office of Export Enforcement, I have decided to deny Muracciole permission to apply for or use any export license, including any general license, issued pursuant to, or provided by, the EAA and the Regulations, for a period of 10 years from the date of his conviction. The 10-year period ends on April 27, 2000. I have also decided to revoke all export licenses issued pursuant to the EAA in which Muracciole had an interest at the time of his conviction.
