In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Saturday, Larionov said that number one problem is the location of the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy. He accused the Ukrainian side of shying away from this issue and concentrating instead on the division of the fleet. Ukraine believes that both forces should stay in Sevastopol and rules out other variants. But the Black Sea Fleet includes, apart from ships, land infrastructure, aviation, coastal guards, engineering systems and other facilities. The Russian delegation showed patience and willingness to find a common ground at the talks. But after Ukraine refused to discuss the location of the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy and sign a protocol of disagreements the Russian side had to suspend negotiations. Larionov believes, however, that there is still a chance of resolving the dispute. He called on both sides to take a responsible approach and work out a constructive position.
