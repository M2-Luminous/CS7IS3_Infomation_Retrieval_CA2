A diplomatic source in New York confirmed this on 17 February, and said that Kim Chong-su, deputy chief of the UN mission will take his place. Since the measure to replace Deputy Chief Ho Chong came right after North Korea announced that it would accept full-scope nuclear inspection, it is being presumed that this is the first step in changes in North Korea's policy toward the United States.
