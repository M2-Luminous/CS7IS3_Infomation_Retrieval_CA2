The autonomous region, which is neither a coastal area nor a border area, is actively improving its investment environment, and has established economic and trade relations with more than 60 countries and regions. Two years ago, there were no foreign-funded enterprises in Ningxia; at present, however, there are more than 310, and they have brought over $1 billion of external investment to Ningxia from 23 countries and regions. Huang Huang, who was transferred from Jiangxi to the top post of Ningxia, said that during his tenure of office in Ningxia, his objective is to enhance the Ningxia people's living standards and bring the whole region to the level of being comparatively well-off by the year 2000. Ningxia is located in the central valley of the Huang He in Northwest China. Secretary Huang Huang said: The river flows 397 kilometers inside Ningxia, and the area of the river valley accounts for over 90 percent of the whole region's area. Since the beginning of reform and opening, cadres and masses in Ningxia have made great efforts to utilize the Huang He. The river has been basically harnessed, and the natural environment of the river valley has been improved. The irrigated area has been enlarged, and the economies of the mountainous areas developed. The state and the autonomous region invested 500 million yuan in water pumping projects from Guyuan to Haiyuan and from Yanchi to Huanxian and Dingbian. The water of the Huang He is now being channeled up to the mountainous areas, and the two projects increased the irrigated area by nearly 800,000 mu. In addition, a hydropower project is being launched in Daliushu; after completion, its power generation capacity will reach 7.8 billion kilowatt-hours. The reservoir will also irrigate 20 million mu of farmland in Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, and Gansu. Huang Huang said: The situation of agricultural production in Ningxia this year is very good, and the whole region will be self-sufficient in food grain. Although the mountainous area in the southern part of the region faces serious drought, the total grain output of Ningxia may still reach or even exceed last year's level. He said that the whole region is making efforts to fight the drought. Bai Lichen, chairman of the regional government, is guiding the work of fighting drought and sowing autumn crops in the southern area of the region. Secretary Huang Huang also told reporters that the eight counties in the southern part of Ningxia are inhabited by people of the Hui nationality. That area is called the poorest of the poor areas in China. In the early 1980's, some 70 percent of the peasant households there could not get enough food and clothing. In the last 10 years, with the state's support, Ningxia allocated 30 million yuan every year to help the poor area, and allocated over 70 million yuan to develop manufacturing industries there in order to increase the local people's wealth. Financial resources were concentrated to improve production conditions and the ecological environment and to build terraced fields at an average of two or three mu per person and raise the per mu grain output to 500 jin. Thus, the peasants will have sufficient food. At the same time, through resettlement arrangements, 150,000 people have been moved from the poor mountainous areas to the plain areas, and they became rich two or three years after being resettled. So far, 85 percent of the peasants in southern Ningxia have sufficient food and clothing; and 10 percent of them have become comparatively well-off. When talking about the investment environment, Secretary Huang Huang said: Ningxia has started a number of major transportation projects. The 280-km electrified railway line between Baoji and Zhongwei was completed and put to operation on 9 June. A new airport 19 kilometers east of Yinchuan is under construction. Adding to the two old airports around Yinchuan, the capital city of the autonomous region will have air links to all major cities of the country and also to the Middle East, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia. In the field of telecommunications, 18 cities and counties of Ningxia have realized telephone dialing automation. This year, Yinchuan added 70,000 program-controlled telephone lines to its communications network, and direct diald to all major cities in the world is available. Secretary Huang Huang also said that harmonious relations were being maintained among all religious groups in Ningxia.
