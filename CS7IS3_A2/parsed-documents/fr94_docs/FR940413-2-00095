FR940413-2-00095 FR940413-2-00053 [Finance Docket No. 32474] Chicago and North Western Transportation Company_Trackage Rights Exemption_Peoria and Pekin Union Railway Co. Peoria and Pekin Union Railway Company (PPU) has agreed to grant trackage rights to Chicago and North Western Transportation Company (C&NW) over those portions of PPU trackage located between the point of connection between C&NW and PPU trackage, at Darst Street, and a point which is the clearance point of the switch of the PPU tracks and tracks owned by Archer Daniels Midland Company, in Peoria, IL. The trackage rights were to become effective on April 1, 1994. 1 1 Under 49 CFR 1150.32(b), a notice of exemption does not become effective until 7 days after filing. According to the verified notice of exemption, applicant proposed to consummate the transaction on March 25, 1994. Applicant's verified notice of exemption was originally filed on March 15, 1994. Because applicant had to submit an additional filing fee, the filed date of the verified notice of exemption became March 25, 1994. Therefore, consummation should not have taken place prior to April 1, 1994. Applicant's representative has confirmed that the correct consummation date is on or after April 1, 1994. This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7). If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Thomas F. Flanagan, 165 North Canal Street, Chicago, IL 60606&hyph;1551. As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees adversely affected by the trackage rights will be protected under Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN, 354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate, 360 I.C.C. 653 (1980). Decided: April 6, 1994. By the Commission, Joseph H.
