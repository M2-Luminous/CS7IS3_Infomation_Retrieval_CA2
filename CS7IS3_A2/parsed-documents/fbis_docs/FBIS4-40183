"We have always been in the league and, I hope, will remain there", first deputy director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Vyacheslav Trubnikov told TASS on Tuesday. He did not specify who occupies which place among the four, but said that hardly any of the secret services would have succeeded to maintain the leading positions had they been in the same financial plight as the SVR. "I am sure that had the personnel of our `competitors' been in the same conditions as the Russian intelligence is facing, hardly many of them would have tolerated that. And our men do serve and will serve", Trubnikov said. The Foreign Intelligence Service which appeared after the collapse of the notorious KGB is no longer engaged in political persecutions. According to Trubnikov, "intelligence ceased to be a semi-state and semi-(communist) party body which it was in the times of the KGB". It no longer works for any political party, advocates no ideology, acts independently and according to law and is controlled by the legislative and executive authorities. The task of the intelligence is to monitor and assess threats to Russian national interests. "In general the tendencies in world development are favourable for our country, however, the spectrum of threats remains rather wide", Trubnikov said and added that the major threat at present is the "hot spots" on the Russian borders.
