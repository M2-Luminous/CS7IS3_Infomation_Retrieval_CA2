This was announced at the news conference of the Agrarian Alliance. Laszlo Gardai reports: [Gardai] I am sincerely sorry that the election campaign is not what it ought to be, the campaign chief of the Agrarian Alliance said. He considered to be news only the information from the various parties about who concludes a coalition with whom, but party programs were not aired sufficiently. There is no forum for a true show of colors, because, for example, the three-and-a-half-minute speeches on television on Tuesdays and Thursdays [party political broadcasts] are meaningless and instead of these, debates should be staged. [passage omitted] The spokesperson for the party, (Klara Spirak), announced that four-party coordination has begun with the participation of the SZDSZ, Fidesz, the Party of Entrepreneurs, and the Agrarian Alliance on the economic, agricultural, education, and public security programs. The Agrarian Alliance also signed a cooperation agreement with the Green Alternative and the cochairperson [not further identified] voiced her criticism that during the past four years no sensible law was adopted on environment protection. If the Agrarian Alliance gets into parliament, it will ensure that environmental protection is given a much greater role.
