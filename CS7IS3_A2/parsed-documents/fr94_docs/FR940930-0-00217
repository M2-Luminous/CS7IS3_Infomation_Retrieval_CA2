FR940930-0-00217 FR940930-0-00029 In addressing the issue raised by these commenters, we are faced with balancing the railroads' and commuters' needs for timeliness with the safety needs of the motoring public. Requiring commuter trains to remain stopped until a flagger or law enforcement officer arrives will undoubtedly inconvenience the commuting public. Similarly, freight trains and intercity passenger trains will be inconvenienced, although on a smaller scale. We note however, that the requirement to flag a crossing during periods of malfunction, while not universal, is not new. Rule 138(c) of the Northeast Operating Rules Advisory Committee (NORAC) requires that if ``crossing protection devices are not functioning properly *␣*␣* trains must approach the crossing(s) prepared to stop and not proceed until protection against highway traffic is provided by on-ground personnel.'' The Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Railroad Corporation (METRA), a commuter railroad carrying 240,000 commuters daily, requires that in situations of activation failure, ``trains must be advised to STOP and flag the crossing on both sides until the entire movement has cleared the crossing.'' After consideration of the comments and implications for both safety and railroads' on-time performance, FRA is not revising the rule to provide an exception for trains operated by one person. Permitting a train to stop and then proceed through a crossing without a flagger and without properly functioning automatic gates and lights sends a confusing and potentially tragic message to a highway user. The highway user, seeing the train stop, may be encouraged to cross in front of the train thinking that he or she has the right of way. FRA believes the effect on railroads such as the LIRR will be minimal. As noted elsewhere in this discussion, FRA is revising section 105(c) to permit trains to proceed at normal speed through crossings when one uniformed law enforcement officer is present, rather than one officer for each direction of highway traffic. Due to this change, railroad or local police will be better able to respond to crossing malfunctions, even in cases of multiple crossings malfunctioning. The presence of one flagger will avoid the necessity of trains coming to a stop, and the presence of a uniformed police officer will permit normal speed operations through the crossing. The labor/management group proposed adding a provision to this section which would provide that after a train is stopped at a crossing, if a member of the train crew determines that the warning devices are in fact operating properly, a crewmember will not be required to dismount to flag highway traffic. The group proposes that the locomotive may then proceed through the crossing and normal speed resumed after the locomotive has passed through the crossing. FRA takes no exception to this procedure, although an additional regulatory provision is not needed. If a train crew, after being notified of activation failure, finds instead that the warning system is indeed properly providing warning, the train may pass through the crossing without flagging because, in essence, the malfunction, if one then exists, is a false activation. It is difficult to determine whether the situation at the crossing was in fact a false activation, since the crew does not know if the system was incorrectly warning of oncoming trains when no trains were approaching, the reality is that the warning system is in fact providing warning to the highway user. Flagging in that situation is not needed since the malfunction is not one of activation failure, but instead is, at most, one of false activation. Section 105(c)(1) (final rule_105(c)(3)) is also being revised to permit a train to resume normal speed after the flagging crewmember reboards the locomotive. This change will correct an earlier drafting oversight and will bring this section into conformity with both the remainder of this section and §234.107. Section 234.105(c)(2)␣(Final Rule_234.105(c)(1)) Paragraph 105(c)(2) (final rule_105(c)(1)) as proposed requires that if an appropriately equipped flagger or law enforcement officer provides warning for each direction of highway traffic, trains may proceed through the crossing at normal speed.
