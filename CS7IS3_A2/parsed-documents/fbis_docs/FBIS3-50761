This is the wrong approach, the elected representative of Saint-Marc claims. Deputy Picault explains that "Operation Iron Cuts Iron" [Operasyon Fe Koupe Fe], launched by the president of the Republic [in his message to the people on the Voice of America on 1 January], will only exacerbate passions. [Begin Picault recording, in Creole] Given the approach President Aristide has taken in saying that the conference should be held in Miami, in speaking of an international conference, with all due respect for him as president I can say I think the route he has taken is a demagogic one. I think the way he has taken is a demagogic way. President Aristide wants to play a stalling game just as the international community is doing, because he knows very well that it does not want to take any real measures to bring him back. I cannot support such an initiative because it offers no solution to the country's crisis. Secondly: President Aristide said in a speech, "Iron cuts iron." I think these are gratuitous, rash statements and that when he makes such statements, he just gets on people's nerves, driving those who are supposed to carry heavy weapons to commit even more repression against the people who are supposed to side with him.
