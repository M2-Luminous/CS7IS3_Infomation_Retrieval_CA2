The president made this statement at the Supreme Court, where he discussed government plans for 1994. According to the president, 1994 is a year in which much attention will be focused on the elections. He pointed out that the next president will have to face the challenge of reorganizing the government's program so that the country can be prepared to manage the interoceanic waterway once it is turned over to Panamania in 2000. [Begin recording] [Endara] These next five years will be crucial in Panamanian history. [Unidentified reporter] Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] might leave the ruling alliance. Have you made the necessary changes? [Endara] I will not get involved in political matters. I realize that what may occur in politics has repercussions inside my government, but I want it to have the minimum repercussion possible. [Reporter] Will there be political amnesty this year? [Endara] Political amnesty is granted by the Legislative Assembly, not me. [Reporter] The Catholic Church is concerned about the large number of weapons on the streets in the hands of third parties. What can the government do about this prior to the elections? [Endara] I am not aware of the Church's concerns in this regard. I believe there definitely is arms trafficking, but -- thank God -- according to intelligence reports, the weapons are only passing through Panama and do not stay here, at least not in large numbers. [Reporter] Where are those weapons going? [Endara] Usually to Colombia. [end recording] President Endara also pointed out that he has no plans to grant amnesty to Colonel Eduardo Herrera. As for his administration, he pointed out that he has fulfilled his role in a transition government.
