Diaz was the person charged with making known the unrest of the military leadership regarding a precept that reduces the officers to mere observers at the meeting, which is currently being held in Buenos Aires and will conclude on 18 March. Questions of form must also be added to this unrest, as the Armed Forces Staff received a photocopied paper informing it of the opening and conclusion of the meeting, and this was considered "more of a notification than an invitation." The military observers (or "listeners," as some sarcastically termed them) were thus in this role able to follow the discussions regarding a main point: the creation of a new continental security system, and the distrust of those countries that fear an attempt at "verticalization" under the hegemony of the United States. The Mexican delegation stated that progress in the implementation of measures of mutual confidence cannot be achieved until a "new security concept that responds to the threats hovering over the region" has been clearly defined. The comments from the Argentine ambassador to the OAS, Hernan Patino, somewhat cleared the atmosphere, which to that point had been somewhat monotonous, and his specific reference to the chicken and the egg seemed to block any further delay in discussing the heart of the problem. This problem concerns the concrete measures of a military nature that are to be taken by the armed forces of the member countries -- measures that go further than the usual exchanges of officers and goodwill meetings. For its part Brazil supports to a certain extent the Argentine position of achieving progress on this topic, although essentially on a bilateral country-to-country basis. Uruguay is concerned with the principle of non-intervention, while Peru and Venezuela give priority to the non-military problems such as underdevelopment and what they call "the crime transnationals." In sum, OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares, who arrived in the country on 16 March, will not find a panorama much different from what he has observed during his entire tenure, in other words, the beginning of a long road that will have to be taken step by step.
