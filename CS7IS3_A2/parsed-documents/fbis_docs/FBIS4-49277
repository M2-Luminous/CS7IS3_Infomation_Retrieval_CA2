Sutari is only one of over ten thousand Palestinian residents in West Bank town of Jericho who expressed their excitement over the signing of the self-rule agreement by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo. Under the Israeli-PLO Peace Accord signed in Washington last September, the Israeli troops withdrawal should have started on December 13 last year and been completed by April 13. But both deadlines were missed because of differences between the two sides on some key issues. There was no scene of large celebrations, largely due to the delay of the agreement, but still people of all ages were rushing to the narrow streets, laughing and chanting. Though traffic jams occurred sometimes, no one complained as usual. So far, a lot of Palestinian flags were already flying on various buildings, reminding people that Jericho is now a place of the Palestinians. Two young Palestinians even climbed to the top of the iron fences surrounding the Israeli police office in the town center to erect the Palestinian flags. Though the Israeli police are still in the building, they showed great restrictions and did not take any action to stop the Palestinians. "Today the world understands that after 27 years, we're feeling much better, though the happiness is a little bit late," Sutari said. He is referring to the year 1967 when Israel used only six hours to seize the West Bank of the Jordan River. Helal al-Takrorg, 23, and Monir Tanboupi, 26, both university students from the biggest West Bank town Nablus, told XINHUA that "they feel great" toward the upcoming autonomy. There was no photo of 'Arafat in the town center, except a few drawings of him on dirty walls. 'Arafat declared in April that he would come to Jericho this month. "I trust Mr. Arafat, trust everything he does very much, because he is a hero of all Palestinians," said Takrorg. When asked whether they believe 'Arafat would bring them together to build a strong economy, both Takrorg and Tanboupi gave a positive answer. "A strong economy will not come at present, but maybe at future," Takrorg said. Imad Bevahmeh, owner of a small shop, told XINHUA that he "is overwhelmed by today's signing." "I admire 'Arafat very much because he will bring democracy and a new life to our people," he said. But not all the Palestinians would like to render their support to 'Arafat. A young Palestinian, who would only called himself Mohamed, described 'Arafat as a "weak" man because he conceded a lot to Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and because he could not really bring together Hamas, Fatah and other Palestinian parties. The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, and PLO's mainstream Fatah movement, under heavy pressure from the Israeli Government, reached a cooperation accord after difficult negotiations on April 22, to pave the way for today's signing of the agreement. Hamas promised to suspend attack on the Palestinians it considers collaborating with Israel for one month after the implementation of the self-rule agreement, but declared it would continue to take violent actions against Israelis. Mohamed continued to say that "the economy will be a pretty hard task for 'Arafat" because in Jericho there is only agriculture with industry next to zero. Not all the faces we saw were joyous. The scene turned to be full of anger when a middle-aged woman cried loudly in the face of the Israeli police office building: "Why did you kill my son? Was he guilty?" Her son, though not involved in violence, was killed by Israeli police just two months ago. Whether peace and harmony will really come between the Israelis and the Palestinians remains a big question, because opposition forces on both sides are still quite strong. Sutari said, "we are not hitting Jews, we are just looking for freedom of our own state. The problem (of possible violence) does not come from the people, but from the political sides." When asked about their future, shop owner Bevahmeh said, "my business will do better, because with autonomy we will have more chances and opportunities. Life will get better, and more customers will come to my shop." "Now we are looking for a better life. There will be a new government, our own leaders, and our own life," Sutari told XINHUA.
