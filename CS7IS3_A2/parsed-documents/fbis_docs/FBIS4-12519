In connection with this, PLO Chairman 'Arafat strongly expressed dissatisfaction with the Israeli Government's attitude because it is most likely that the withdrawal of the Israeli forces will not meet the deadline of 13 April. He made the following remarks in an exclusive interview with a NHK reporter accompanying the United Nations' news gathering team for Middle Eastern affairs in the evening of 8 April, which is the morning of 9 April in Japan. [Begin 'Arafat recording] This means that he [not further identified] forgets everything concerning the 13th of April. For how long they will continue maneuvering? But I am sorry to say that they are continuing their maneuvering to prevent the implementation of what had been signed in the White House last September. This continuous delay from the Israeli side... [pauses] giving the chance for all the extremists from the two sides to damage the peace process. And because of this delay, our people have lost their candid... [corrects himself], have lost their confidence with this peace accord. [end recording] Moreover, PLO Chairman 'Arafat disclosed that to provide a breakthrough in such a deadlocked situation, ha has asked for cooperation of the nations which are involved in the peace talks, including the United States and Russia. [Begin Hashimoto recording] Chairman 'Arafat repeatedly used the phrase "the delay by Israeli maneuvering," thus strongly criticizing Israel. But it can be said that his remarks reflect the Palestinians' irritation and sense of crisis because progress -- such as the withdrawal of the Israeli forces -- in peace talks has not been clearly seen despite the agreement last September on launching negotiations on establishing Palestinian self-rule. Digesting schedules one by one toward establishing the self-rule government will not only lead to promoting mutual trust but also give impetus toward achieving peace. For that reason, PLO Chairman 'Arafat is increasingly irritated at the continuous delay. [end recording]
