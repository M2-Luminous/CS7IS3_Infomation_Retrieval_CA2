FR940922-1-00062 FR940922-1-00008 Finally, EPA disagrees with the Second Circuit's belief that Congress did not contemplate a ``split'' model year approach, differentiating manufacturers based on when each commences production. In fact, EPA's initial Advisory Circulars explaining EPA's ``model-by-model'' approach were announced in 1972, five years before section 177 was added to the Clean Air Act. Congress must have at least ``contemplated,'' if not in fact expected, that EPA would interpret ``model year'' for section 177 as it had for section 202. VII. Statutory Authority Authority for the action in this notice is in sections 177, 184, 176(A), 110, 202, 206, 209, 307(d), and 301 of the Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7511c, 7506a, 7525, 7410, 7607(d), and 7601. VIII. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis Under Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735 (Oct. 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof, or (4) Raise novel or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order 12866, since this action could result in a rule that would have a substantial impact, this notice is a ``significant regulatory action'' because the estimated range of annual costs of the California LEV program in the OTC states is between $300 million and $1.6 billion. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record. EPA has prepared an economic analysis for this rule under E.O. 12866. A copy of this analysis has been placed in the docket. Any written comments to EPA and any written EPA responses to those comments regarding this analysis will be included in the docket for this proceeding. IX. Impact on Small Entities The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601(a), provides that, whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking, it must prepare and make available a regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA). While EPA intends to follow rulemaking procedures under 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, EPA believes it is not legally required to publish a general notice of rulemaking here, and hence that it need not prepare a RFA. But even if EPA is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking here, a RFA is required only for small entities which are directly regulated by the rule. See Mid-Tex Electric Cooperative, Inc. v. FERC, 773 F. 2d 327 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (agency's certification need only consider the rule's impact on regulated entities and not indirect impact on small entities not regulated). The OTC's recommended LEV program would directly regulate auto manufacturers. Since these auto manufacturers generally do not qualify as small businesses within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA does not believe a RFA is needed for either the proposed or final rules, even if a rulemaking is required. Accordingly, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Nevertheless, the Agency has considered the effect of an OTC LEV program on new and used car dealerships as part of its regulatory impact analysis, even though such analysis is not required because these businesses would not be directly regulated under the rule. The results of this analysis, set forth in the RIA, indicate that the OTC LEV would not have a significant economic impact on automobile dealerships. X. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and implementing regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, do not apply to this action as it does not involve the collection of information as defined therein.
