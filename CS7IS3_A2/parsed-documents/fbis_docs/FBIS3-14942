This follows a statement from Defense Committee chairman Sergey Yushenkov who represented the Russia's Choice Party at the meeting. In his words, the speaker said that former prosecuter general Aleksey Kazannik had sent him a letter on Saturday asking how to implement the Duma amnesty resolution but announced his resignation later in the day without waiting for reply. Yushenkov said that as soon as the Duma reconvened on March 11, a draft resolution would be put up for discussion warning the uprising leaders that the amnesty could be withdrawn if they violated Article 70 of the Criminal Code. The article spells out punishment measures against organizers of mass riots.
