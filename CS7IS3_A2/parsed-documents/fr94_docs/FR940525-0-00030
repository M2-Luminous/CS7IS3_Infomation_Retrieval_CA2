FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Matt Plonski, (410) 966&hyph;4662. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 93) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66) was enacted. This law contains numerous provisions relating to coverage of services and payments for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. Some of these provisions are self-implementing; that is, the provisions are stated in terms that neither require nor permit exercise of discretion in implementing them. The plain wording of the law causes a conflict with several of our existing regulations; in other cases, the regulations simply do not take the amendments into account. We are, therefore, making the necessary changes to incorporate the new provisions into regulations. A discussion of the individual legislative provisions and the accompanying regulations follows. II. Reductions in Payments for Skilled Nursing Facility Services_Elimination of Return on Equity for Proprietary Skilled Nursing Facilities A. Legislative Provision Section 1861(v)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act (the Act) provides that proprietary skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) receive, in addition to payments for the costs of providing services, return on equity payments, which provide the investors in the facilities a return on their investment equivalent to what they would have earned had they invested the same amount in specified government securities. Section 13503(c) of OBRA 93 amended sections 1861(v)(1)(B) and 1878(f)(2) of the Act to eliminate payments to SNFs for return on equity capital, applicable to portions of cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993. B. Regulations Revision We are revising ยง413.157(b)(3), Rate of return related to proprietary SNFs, to limit its application to services furnished before October 1, 1993. III. Reductions in Payments for Hospice Services A. Legislative Provision Under section 1814(i) of the Act, we pay for hospice services on a daily rate basis. Payments are adjusted by a market basket percentage increase. Section 13504 of OBRA 93 amended section 1814(i) of the Act to decrease the amount of the market basket (as defined by section 1886(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act) percentage increase that will be applied in fiscal years (FY) 1994 through 1997. These decreases are: FY 1994_the market basket percentage increase minus 2 percentage points; FYs 1995 and 1996_the market basket percentage increase minus 1.5 percentage points; and FY 1997_the market basket percentage increase minus .5 percentage points. After FY 1997, the full market basket percentage increase will again apply. B. Regulations Revisions We are revising ยง418.306, Determination of payment rates, by updating paragraph (b)(2) to exclude FYs 1994 through 1997 from the application of the market basket percentage increase without modification and to add a new paragraph (b)(3) to add the statutory decreases. IV. Reduction in Part A Premium for Certain Individuals With 30 or More Quarters of Social Security Coverage A. Legislative Provision Under section 226(a) of the Act, individuals generally become entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A when they reach age 65 based on hospital insurance (Part A) taxes they paid under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) while they were working. By paying the Part A portion of the FICA tax, individuals acquire quarters of coverage (QCs), which are used to insure them for Part A coverage. Insured individuals are not required to pay monthly premiums for Part A coverage. Under section 1818 of the Act, individuals age 65 or over who do not have enough QCs to be insured for premium-free Part A may enroll in the Part A program if they pay a monthly premium. The Part A premium is determined under section 1818(d) of the Act and is based on the actuarial value of benefits under Part A. In addition, under section 1818A of the Act, disabled individuals who lose eligibility for premium-free Part A solely because they have returned to work may enroll in Part A if they pay a monthly premium, the amount of which is determined under section 1818(d). Section 13508 of OBRA 93 amended section 1818(d) to reduce, on a phased-in basis, the amount of the Part A premium for workers with 30 or more QCs and for spouses (including surviving spouses) of these workers with 30 or more QCs after having been married at least one year. The reduction also applies to divorced spouses (including surviving divorced spouses) of workers with 30 or more QCs provided that, at the time the divorce became final, the worker had 30 or more QCs and the marriage had lasted for at least 10 years. The reductions are as follows: 1994_25 percent 1995_30 percent 1996_35 percent 1997_40 percent 1998 and later years_45 percent The reduction will begin with premium payments beginning January 1994.
