FR940906-2-00123 FR940906-2-00083 4. Response Deactivation a. Each agency will discontinue emergency response operations when advised that Federal assistance is no longer required from their agency or when its statutory responsibilities have been fulfilled. Prior to discontinuing its response operation, each agency should discuss its intent to do so with the LFA, FEMA, and the State. b. The LFA will consult with participating Federal agencies and the State and local government to determine when the Federal information coordination operations at the JIC should be terminated. This will occur normally at a time when the rate of information generated and coordinated by the LFA has decreased to the point where it can be handled through the normal day-to-day coordination process. The LFA will inform the other participants of their intention to deactivate Federal information coordination operations at the JIC and advise them of the procedures for continued coordination of information pertinent to recovery from the radiological emergency. c. FEMA will consult with the LFA, other Federal agencies, and the State(s) as to when the onscene coordination operation of the DFO is no longer required. Prior to ending operations at the DFO, FEMA will inform all participating organizations of the schedule for doing so. d. The LFA will terminate JOC operations and the Federal response after consulting with FEMA, other participating Federal agencies, and State and local officials, and after determining that onscene Federal assistance is no longer required. e. The agency managing the FRMAC will consult with the LFA, FEMA, other participating Federal agencies, and State and local officials to determine when a formal FRMAC structure and organization is no longer required. Normally, this will occur when operations move into the recovery phase and extensive Federal multi-agency resources are no longer required to augment State and local radiological monitoring and assessment activities. 5. Recovery a. The State or local governments have the primary responsibility for planning the recovery of the affected area. (The term recovery as used here encompasses any action dedicated to the continued protection of the public and resumption of normal activities in the affected area.) Recovery planning will be initiated at the request of the States, but it will generally not take place until after the initiating conditions of the emergency have stabilized and immediate actions to protect public health and safety and property have been accomplished. The Federal Government will, on request, assist the State and local governments in developing offsite recovery plans, prior to the deactivation of the Federal response. The LFA will coordinate the overall activity of Federal agencies involved in the recovery process. b. The radiological monitoring and assessment activities will be terminated when the EPA, after consultation with the LFA and other participating Federal agencies, and State and local officials, determines that: (1) There is no longer a threat to the public health and safety or to the environment, (2) State and local resources are adequate for the situation, and (3) There is mutual agreement of the agencies involved to terminate the response.
