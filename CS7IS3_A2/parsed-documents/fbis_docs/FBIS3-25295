If these reported statements are true in their substance South Africa is facing a situation that can only be expressed in terms of astonishment, outrage and profound indignation. The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], as well as the Freedom Alliance, has constantly negotiated within the parameters of written documentation tabled with our counterparts. Such documentation reflected the mandates received by the respecting governing bodies of the IFP and the Freedom Alliance. At no time have the negotiators ever advanced any demands which were not contained in such documentation. Furthermore, the analysis of our documentation submitted with the South African Government since July 2, 1993 when the IFP and other members of the Freedom Alliance walked out of the World Trade Centre, clearly indicates that we constantly reduced our proposals. Our final proposals contained in the December 19, 1993 document known as the yellow paper were substantially agreed upon with government and reflected over two months of very intensive negotiations. No proposal was advanced over and above what is contained in the yellow paper. The contrary is true, for our negotiating team on several occasions showed a great deal of flexibility departing from the principles and positions contained in the yellow paper. This is particularly true with reference to the powers of the provinces set out in Section 126, the fiscal autonomy of the provinces set out in Sections 155-159, the role of the senate, the provisions of rationalisation, the entire chapter on deadlock-breaking mechanisms, the issues of provincial civil service and police, the functions of local government and many other issues covered by the yellow paper. Negotiations broke down on a clear and cynical either/or tabled by SACP [South African Communist Party] chairman, Joe Slovo. He indicated that either the Freedom Alliance had to accept two conditions or further negotiations would be futile. The two conditions were that provinces could not have any degree of power which the central government could not also exercise in its own name, and that no limit could be put on the discretion of the constituent assembly to reconsider the powers, functions and boundaries of provinces. What I do not understand is how and why our free media of communication does not challenge the repeated accusations by Minister Meyer that we have been shifting the goal posts. Why is there no investigative journalism which can analyse whether there is any merit in such an accusation? Why does nobody ask themselves how we can be more detailed and specific in our constitutional proposals after we went to the extent of drafting a complete set of constitutional amendments which were introduced in parliament? These are challenges that our media of public communication should undertake for the sake of freedom in this country.
