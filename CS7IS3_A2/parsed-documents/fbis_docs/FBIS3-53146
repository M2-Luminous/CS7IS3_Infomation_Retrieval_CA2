The Civilian Committee met under Jamil al-Tarifi for the Palestinian side and Jadi Zohar for the Israeli side. The Security Committee met under Hasan 'Asfur for the Palestinian side and General 'Uzi Dayan for the Israeli side. Palestinian sources have said that all the issues regarding the transfer of civilian authority to the Palestinian side, including water, antiquities, land registration, and other topics, could be finalized at this round of talks. Some 20 of 39 topics on the transfer of civilian authority to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho area have been finalized. The Palestinian sources said the Security Committee will discuss security details, not general topics, and that it is hoped the Security Committee will make progress similar to the progress made by the committee on the transfer of civilian authority. The sources added that the Palestinian side wants "access" to the Dead Sea so that the self-rule authority will not feel it lives in a "ghetto" among the Israelis. Palestinian sources have stated that the death of Israeli General Nehemya Tamari in a helicopter crash near Jerusalem might cause the talks to be suspended this evening. The sources said General Tamari was a prominent figure in the Israeli army and a personal friend of General Amon Shahaq and other Israeli delegation members, who might want to attend his funeral tomorrow.
