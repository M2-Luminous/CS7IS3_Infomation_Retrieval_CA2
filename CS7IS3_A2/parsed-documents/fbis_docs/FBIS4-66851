Mr. Abdul Ghafur, parliamentarian and former cabinet member, is sure that the backwards and the Muslims are not with the Janata Dal now. He said that the main reason for this change is the dramatic political style of Lalu Prasad. He says that if they run for the next election under Lalu Prasad's leadership, the future will be very dark. Seeing all this, the Bihar Janata Dal legislators are planning to establish a new party and Abdul Ghafur is one of them. Thus, history repeats in full circles! Abdul Ghafur is leading the revolt against Lalu Prasad. Two decades ago, a revolt had risen from the opposite direction. Lalu Prasad was also involved in that. The target was then-Chief Minister Abdul Ghafur! We have to call it political irony that both of them belong to the same party. They are both from the same district. The legislator from Gopalganj is dismissing his chief minister by calling him theatrical and arrogant. Is the Janata Dal breaking up? Abdul Ghafur responded that it was a historical necessary. Why? This is the only party which has no national leadership. There is no central leader left. He explains this in detail. V.P. Singh was elected president by acclaim and he declared himself a "Gorbachev" later. We know that Gorbachev dissipated the communist world with his reforms. V.P. Singh is also looking for a Yeltsin in the Janata Dal. We join him in his hope. What reaction will be in the Janata Dal over it? He said bitterly that people will go where they want to go. Abdul Ghafur is the most veteran politician in the Janata Dal. He has been in politics most of the 76 years of life. After getting his B.A. (Geography) and L.L.B (Law) degrees from Allahabad University in 1941, he jumped into the political arena as a follower of Netaji Subhash Chander Bose. He went to jail in 1942. The word, "soldier of the independence war" has heavy connotations. Abdul Ghafur has played even heavier roles than that. He has been in the legislature since 1952 and has won all the elections except for in 1967 and 1989. In 1967, the Congress Party was almost wiped out in Bihar. He also lost, however, he was elected to the Vidhan Parishad on the Congress ticket. He was the chairman of the Vidhan Sabha before being elected the chief minister. They tried to get him into the Janata Dal in 1989 and he joined it in 1991. He talked less about his past and spent more time talking about the present smoke raised by the Janata Dal. He said that the Janata Dal is finished in Uttar Pradesh and it would be beneficial to the Janata Dal leaders to join Mulayam Singh's Samajwadi Party there. If they do not like this, advised Ghafur, they should do what they think is appropriate. He said that the situation in Bihar was getting worse. Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan had started the movement of "total revolution." The present chief minister who had joined that movement as a foot soldier is destroying those values. The devoted Janata Dal leaders of the "total revolution" are becoming preys to his anger. Abdul Ghafur said that what could be worse than the fact that Lalu Prasad could not find even one candidate to run for by-election in Vaishali. He had Kishori Sinha resign from the Congress Party and made him the Janata Dal candidate. This was the first time when a chief minister himself went to nominate a candidate. The Janata Dal has taught him a lesson. The nomination was delayed for one and half hours because of protests. He says with hurt feelings that the backwards are not with the Janata Dal now. Are 100 percent backwards opposed to the Janata Dal? He said that 80 percent are definitely unhappy. What about the Muslims? Abdul Ghafur thought for a few minutes and said that they are also in the backward category. He repeated that even Yadavs among the backwards are upset with the Janata Dal. He said, "The Muslim mentality could be understood from one example. There is a medical college in Katihar and Maulana Azad Engineering College in Patna. Mufti Mohammed Sayyed, Yunus Salim, Shafi Qureshi, and I kept asking Lalu Prasad to accredit those colleges. He declined it. The case reached the Supreme Court and the decision was made in our favor. A committee was formed and it recommended giving accreditation. Recently, the chief minister tried to stop Governor Kidwai from going there." Ghafur Said that this was but one example; there were hundreds of such examples. He said that only God knew what would happen if elections in Bihar were held under the present leadership. Did he mean Lalu Prasad Yadav by "present leadership?" He replied in the affirmative. What plans are experienced leaders like you making? He replied that a decision will be made after postmortem ceremonies of Ramvilas Paswan's father. All this will be done within a week. Ramvilas Paswan, Chhedi Paswan, Nitish Kumar, and Harikishore Singh were involved in this effort. There are many others whose names will appear later. Abdul Ghafur says that the Janata Dal is at the breaking point in Bihar. All Janata Dal legislators and more than half council members will join the new party. He was confident that Ram Sunder Das will also join his party. Thus, a new political polarization is taking place. Abdul Ghafur was showing the "labor pains" of this process. Was the Vaishali by-election a reason for it? He responded that the "pitcher of Lalu Prasad's sin is full" and this is the result of it. He said that law and order, financial catastrophe, looting of government treasury, and corruption have broken all previous records in Bihar. He was reminded that during the Jayaprakash movement, he was recognized as a honest politician and that movement was about corruption. Then we asked him, "Will you certify Lalu Prasad a honest politician?" Abdul Ghafur was not comfortable with this question. He went down the memory lane for a while. His face showed agitation. He said after calming down a little, "The truth is that I wanted Lalu Prasad to continue as the chief minister. However, he will not be saved because of my wishes alone. The people are against him and the government machinery is against him. The people are tired of his histrionics. I have never seen such an arrogant leader." Ghafur does not usually employ such language. We asked him again if he would give a certificate of honesty to Lalu Prasad. He gave a clear answer this time. He said, I wish I could do that. He will wait for Lalu Prasad's reaction. There are many missiles in Abdul Ghafur's arsenal to silence Lalu Prasad.
