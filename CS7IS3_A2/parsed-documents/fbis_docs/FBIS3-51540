The minister also condemned Tuesday night's attack in Guatemala City, which included the use of so-called leaflet bombs [bombas panfleteras]. Ortiz Moscoso said there are ways to express opposition to the referendum without resorting to violence. The government minister explained that he was unable to give further details on the overall security measures to be used on 30 January during the referendum. [Begin recording] [Ortiz] Basically, we expect to carry out very thorough, respectful, nonaggressive, but sufficiently energetic security measures around the voting centers. The objective is to see that people can cast their votes in total confidence. Security inside the voting centers will be the responsibility of officials appointed by the electoral tribunal. There will be no armed military, national police, or finance police personnel inside the voting centers. These measures have worked before and have been acknowledged internationally. [Unidentified reporter] [Question indistinct]? [Ortiz] Yes, that is not our responsibility. To settle that matter it is necessary to resort to the electoral law. A summons was duly issued by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which adopted it as a rule for those days. In other words, security will be guaranteed 24 hours prior to the referendum and throughout the day on which the voting is scheduled to take place. As far as we are concerned [words indistinct]. [Reporter] [Question indistinct]? [Ortiz] No, it is very difficult identify anyone in particular. However, it is easy to infer that we are talking about people or organizations intent on blocking the internal pacification process. They are determined to prevent the Guatemalan people from experimenting with a mechanism like the referendum, which has never been used in Guatemala. The authorities and the Government Ministry in particular believe that the methods these groups are willing to use are not only reprehensible but unjustified. As I told the media a fews days, there is no sense in resorting to bombs, even it is was merely a pamphlet bomb, to try to convince the population to vote for, against, or not at all in the referendum. The media are available to any group wishing to express their opposition in a democratic manner. It really makes no sense. We could understand it somewhat if there were restrictions on freedom of expression. [Words indistinct] not only because freedom of expression is guaranteed, but also because the media has their own initiatives, which no one seeks to limit. The media can interview anyone they wish. For these groups to resort to methods such as these merely to frighten the people is depressing and reprehensible. [end recording]
