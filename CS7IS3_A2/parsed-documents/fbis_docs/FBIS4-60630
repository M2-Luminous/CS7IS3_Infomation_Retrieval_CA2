Ambassador Luqman stated that he and the Arab League secretary general discussed several issues concerning ways to resolve the Yemeni crisis and said that the Arab League has resumed its mediation efforts to resolve the crisis. He noted that efforts are being made quietly to resolve the crisis within the context of the Yemeni Constitution. He said: In Sanaa we look at the situation from the viewpoint that a state exists and there are legitimate constitutional institutions chosen by the entire Yemeni people. Hence no party has the right to declare secession. He described the current war in Yemen as one between the legitimate government and separatist rebel forces. Asked about Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's readiness for dialogue with the Aden leaders, Luqman said Sanaa has never stopped the dialogue, which continued throughout 'Ali Salim al-Bid's stay in Aden. He called for resorting to legitimacy and constitutional institutions. Ambassador Ahmad Muhammad Luqman, Yemen's new permanent delegate to the Arab League, was born in al-Hudaydah in 1948 and began his political career as deputy minister of social affairs from 1976-1980. He then became minister of state and secretary general of the Higher Council of Youths and Sports from 1981-1983, minister of municipalities and housing from 1983-1988, and minister of insurance and social affairs from 1990-1993.
