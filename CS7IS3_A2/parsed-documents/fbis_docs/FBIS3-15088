The ministry's press secretary Ivars Embrekts, who told Interfax this, said: "We hope that the Russian authorities will understand that the Latvian government never approved of such activities and will do its best to make their repetition impossible." He said that the investigation would be carried out by the criminal police and the prosecutor general's office in cooperation with officials of the Russian army and the Skrunda station. Embrekts thought that the explosion could have been "organized either by those who want to obstruct the Russo-Latvian talks or common thugs who did not even know that important strategic assets of the Russian army were nearby. In any case the perpetrators will be punished in compliance with the Latvian law." According to Embrekts, this was the essence of what Vladimir Ionkin, first secretary of the Russian embassy in Riga who handed a protest note to the Latvian Foreign Ministry, had been told.
