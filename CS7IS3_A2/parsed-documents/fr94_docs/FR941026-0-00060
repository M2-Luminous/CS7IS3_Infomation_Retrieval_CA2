FR941026-0-00060 FR941026-0-00020 The proposed rule required servicers to refund surpluses to a borrower within 30 days of the escrow analysis unless the borrower timely instructed the servicer to apply the surplus to the escrow account balance. Many commenters saw HUD's requirement as increasing their administrative burdens. Fifteen commenters pointed out that the 30-day period was unrealistic. They argued that HUD should either extend the timeframe or eliminate the requirement. HUD's proposal set no dollar threshold for refunding surpluses. Fifty-three commenters advocated that the final rule require servicers to refund automatically surpluses above a minimum threshold ($25 to $50). This way servicers would not have to wait for the borrower's instructions. Thirteen others suggested that servicers be permitted discretion to retain a surplus below a nominal amount. Forty comments opposed refunding surpluses if the borrower is delinquent or in default. Sixteen comments stated that the rule should allow servicers the discretion to refund surpluses immediately or to spread out the payments over a 12-month period. Several comments requested clarification on whether the existence of a surplus violated RESPA. Two comments specifically stated that a servicer who handles a surplus according to these rules is in compliance with RESPA. In response to these comments, the Department has revised the final rule to require the servicer to refund to the borrower any surplus that is greater than or equal to $50. This provision responds to the comments concerning timing and administrative problems in obtaining borrower instructions. At the servicer's option, the servicer may refund to the borrower or credit to the borrower's escrow account a surplus of less than $50. Again, the servicer need not interact with the borrower to handle this surplus. HUD's final rule provides that if the servicer does not receive the borrower's payment within 30 days of the payment due date, then the servicer may retain the surplus in the escrow account pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan document. It also provides that if the servicer has brought an action for foreclosure under the mortgage loan, then the servicer may retain any surplus in the escrow account according to the mortgage loan documents. If a servicer meets the provisions of this final rule, then HUD will deem the servicer in compliance with RESPA. Shortages and Deficiencies The proposed rule defined a shortage to be the amount that the servicer estimates at the time of an escrow account analysis will be needed to meet the target balance for the escrow account. A deficiency, on the other hand, is the amount that a servicer has actually advanced to pay a disbursement from the escrow account. HUD had proposed that servicers allow borrowers up to 12 months to pay shortages or deficiencies in the escrow account. Many commenters thought HUD's proposal required servicers to extend interest-free loans to borrowers. For example, Fannie Mae stated that ``*␣*␣* this requires the servicer to extend what is in essence a 12-month interest-free loan to the borrower. We believe that this financial burden on the servicer is inequitable.'' Fifteen commenters wanted servicers to charge borrowers interest at the note rate while advances for a deficiency are outstanding. HUD received numerous suggestions to change these provisions. Thirty-nine commenters suggested that the rule allow servicers to collect shortages from borrowers within 30 days to 6 months from the date of the analysis. The comments indicated that servicers could always allow borrowers more time (12 or more months) to pay a projected shortage than is required by law. Sixty-six comments recommended that the rule allow servicers to collect deficiencies from borrowers within 30 days to 6 months from the disbursement date. These comments also stated that servicers could choose to provide borrowers with more time than legally mandated. Another comment sought immediate payment of servicer advances arising from borrower-initiated changes ( e.g., additional or optional insurance). Six comments noted that there is no need for a separate servicer notice to borrowers of shortages in the escrow account, because the annual escrow statement fulfills this function. HUD sees a distinction between a shortage and a deficiency in the escrow account. In a situation where the servicer has advanced its own funds (a deficiency), HUD believes that the servicer may collect this advance quickly. In the final rule, HUD provides servicers with three possible ways of handling borrower deficiencies that amount to less than one month's escrow payment: (1) The servicer may allow a deficiency to exist and do nothing to change it; (2) The servicer may require the borrower to pay the deficiency within 30 days; or (3) The servicer may allow the borrower to repay the deficiency in 2 or more equal monthly payments over a period of up to 12 months. If the deficiency is equal to or more than one month's escrow payment, then the servicer may allow a deficiency to exist and do nothing to change it, or the servicer may allow the borrower to repay the deficiency in 2 or more equal monthly payments over a period of up to 12 months. Moreover, if the servicer does not receive the borrower's payment within 30 days of the payment due date, then the servicer may recover the deficiency pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan documents. Because a shortage is the difference between the current escrow account balance and the target balance, HUD believes that shortages warrant different treatment than deficiencies. Borrowers' escrow accounts are likely to be influenced by yearly changes in taxes, insurance, or other items that may cause a shortage at the time of an escrow account analysis. At that time, servicers may easily adjust the borrower's monthly escrow payments for the next year. Thus, in the final rule, HUD provides that if the servicer's escrow account analysis indicates a shortage of less than one month's escrow payment, the servicer has three options: (1) The servicer may allow a shortage to exist and do nothing to change it; (2) The servicer may allow the borrower to pay the shortage amount within 30 days; or (3) The servicer may allow the borrower to pay off the shortage in equal monthly payments over a 12-month period. If the shortage is greater than or equal to one month's escrow account payment, then the servicer has two options: the servicer may allow a shortage to exist and do nothing to change it; or the servicer may allow the borrower to pay off the shortage in equal monthly payments over a 12-month period. An escrow account analysis may indicate a shortage at the time of the analysis that will produce a deficiency at a later date. This rule does not allow servicers to anticipate deficiencies and collect on a deficiency in advance. However, at the time of a deficiency, a servicer may conduct an escrow account analysis and seek repayment from a borrower according to these provisions. Timely Payments In implementing Section 6(g) of RESPA, HUD had proposed that servicers make disbursements in a timely manner from the escrow account, even if the escrow account had insufficient funds for such payments, as long as the borrower was current in the borrower's principal, interest, and escrow account payments. Twenty-eight commenters opposed this requirement. On the other hand, Fannie Mae noted that ``while the proposed rule states that servicers are not required to make escrow account payments on delinquent accounts, Fannie Mae holds the servicer responsible for the timely payment of taxes and insurance premiums even in situations where the borrower is delinquent on the mortgage.'' After considering these comments and reviewing the legislative history of Section 6(g) of RESPA, the Department clarifies the requirement. Section 3500.17(k) of this rule implements Section 6(g) of the statute, by requiring servicers to advance funds to make disbursements in a timely manner as long as the servicer receives the borrower's payment within 30 days of the payment due date. HUD clarifies that a timely payment is one in which the servicer pays the disbursement on or before the earlier of the deadline for available discounts or the deadline to avoid penalties. Upon advancing funds to pay a disbursement, the servicer may seek repayment from the borrower for the deficiency pursuant to §3500.17(f). If the servicer advances payments for a borrower who is in default, however, then the servicer may recover the deficiency pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan documents. The Department expects that servicers will continue to make disbursements on delinquent accounts to protect their security interests in the mortgaged properties. Recordkeeping The proposed rule established a five-year recordkeeping requirement. Sixteen commenters stated that this requirement would be expensive and burdensome. Several suggested that two years was a more reasonable period. Seventeen commenters requested that HUD provide a de minimis standard describing the information that servicers should retain. They wanted the final rule to specify whether servicers can retain records in hard-copy, electronic, or microfiche format. Seventeen comments requested that the rule provide examples of noncompliance subject to penalties. In the December 1993 proposed rule, HUD responded to earlier comments critical of HUD's specific recordkeeping provisions in the December 1991 proposal. In this final rule, HUD adds clarifying language that servicers may maintain records in hard-copy, electronic, microfiche, or any other format that reasonably assures retrieval. The Department maintains the five-year record retention provision. It is consistent with RESPA's other retention requirements.
