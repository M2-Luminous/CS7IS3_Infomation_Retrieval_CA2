Our correspondent Jiri Halousek reports from there. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] In his speech today Franz Neubauer, chairman of the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft, rejected Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's view that Sudeten Germans might be individually granted -- in some circumstances -- the right to return to their former homeland. Franz Neubauer said this was not sufficient as the Sudeten Germans had not been expelled individually, but collectively. The congress concluded with a speech by Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber. He said relations between Germany and Bavaria on one side and the Czech Republic on the other had developed significantly in the last few years. However, a political dialogue of the Czech cabinet and parliament with elected officials of the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft was still missing. Only its introduction would make these relations really good. This is why Edmund Stoiber proposed to open such a dialogue next year, exactly 50 years from the end of the Second World War and the start of the Sudeten Germans' expulsion from our country.
