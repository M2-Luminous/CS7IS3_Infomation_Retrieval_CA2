On behalf of the party Central Committee and the State Council, I wish to extend their festival regards and lofty respects to you veteran comrades here today and all the retired veteran cadres in the country, as well as veteran comrades working on all fronts! The past year was one in which the whole party and people of all nationalities in the country fully implemented the guidelines laid down by the 14th national party congress and marched forward victoriously along the course charted by Comrade Deng Xiaoping of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The nation continued to maintain the good momentum of thriving development in reform, opening up, and modernization. New successes were achieved on all fronts -- industrial, agricultural, scientific-technological, educational, cultural, defense, and foreign affairs. Our party became stronger and better. Because of our economic growth, political stability, solidarity among people of all nationalities, and social progress, the country as a whole was full of life and vitality. The year 1994 is crucial for the development of reform, opening up, and modernization in China. The basic policy for this year's work is: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as by the basic party line, we will accelerate the process of building a socialist market economic system; maintain a sustained, fast, and healthy national economic development; maintain political stability; and expedite progress in all social sectors -- doing all this by implementing the guidelines laid down by the 14th national party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Seizing the opportunity to deepen reform, open up wider to the outside world, expedite development, and maintain stability is an assignment of overall importance for the whole party. To expedite the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must have a clear idea of this assignment, obey and serve it, proceed with our work cautiously and earnestly, firmly develop our socialist market economy, and firmly promote socialist democracy and spiritual construction. The "CPC Central Committee Decision on Issues About Building a Socialist Market Economic System" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee is an indicator of the beginning of a new stage at which China will achieve breakthroughs at major points while promoting economic reform in all areas. An integral part of our basic socialist system, the socialist market economic system we are now building will enable the market to play a fundamental role in the distribution of resources under the state's macroscopic regulation and control. The basic objective is to further liberate and develop productive forces so that China's sustained, fast, and healthy economic development can be guaranteed institutionally. Meanwhile, we must also realize that, as reform continues to deepen, we will inevitably have to restructure the existing patterns and relationships of interests, encounter deep- rooted problems, and deal with complex and unprecedented situations and issues. We are now reforming the economic system as we are having a high economic growth, we also have to maintain a high economic growth while accelerating the process of structural change; we must also attach great importance to social and political stability. To make sure that all of the Central Committee's reform decisions will be carried out, we must provide stronger leadership, know the entire situation, and correctly handle the dialectical relationship between reform and development on the one hand and stability on the other so that our reform programs and construction projects can proceed in a healthy and orderly manner. To accomplish this year's formidable reform and construction assignments, we must do an even better job in upholding the party's ideological line of emancipating our minds and seeking truth from facts; in upholding the party's basic line of work -- namely doing everything for the masses, counting on the masses in doing everything, coming from the masses, and going to the masses; and in integrating the party's ideological and mass lines. We must continue to change those ideas and concepts which are incompatible with building a socialist market economic system and firmly push reform forward. We must earnestly change our work style, go deep into the realities of life to conduct investigation and study, insist on doing things in the light of materialist dialectics, and concentrate our efforts on accomplishing all assignments and dealing with outstanding problems obstructing reform and construction. We must seriously listen to what the masses have to say, understand their feelings, care for their plight, do ideological and political work among the masses deeply and meticulously, strive to deal with those practical problems vital to their personal interests, and always pay attention to guiding and protecting the masses' enthusiasm so that they can bring their initiative into play. Our party counts on the masses for its source of strength and for winning victories. So long as we depend on the masses, establish close ties with them, rally the strength of the nation, and mobilize the positive factors in all quarters, we can surmount every difficulty in our way and our cause in all fields will be invincible. The CPC is the leading core of our socialist construction. Building the CPC into a stronger party is the basic guarantee for winning the victory in building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as by the party's basic line, we must focus on economic construction, strive to adapt to the new situation of building a socialist market economic system, consciously uphold the party's character as being the vanguard of the working class and its objective of serving the people wholeheartedly, and continue to build a stronger and better party; and we also must strengthen all party organizations' coherence, rallying power and militancy during the course of reform, development, and stability so that our party will be able to play its nuclear leading role more effectively. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics epitomizes the rich experiences we have gained from launching reform, opening up to the outside world, and carrying out socialist construction. This theory is the spiritual pillar and scientific guide leading us to continue to march forward victoriously. During this new year, we must continue to organize the vast number of cadres and party members to thoroughly study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, and accomplish the 14th national party congress assignment of arming the whole party with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Leading groups must earnestly strengthen their ideological construction and improve their work style. They must uphold and improve democratic centralism and maintain a high degree of political and ideological unity and unity in actions. We must make great efforts to train and promote outstanding young cadres in accordance with the requirement that cadres must be more revolutionary, better educated, younger in average age, and professionally more competent as well as the principle that our cadres must be ethical and capable. To meet the needs of the new situation, all leading groups must make constant efforts to improve their capabilities of leading the socialist market economy, build stronger grass-roots party organizations, and explore ways and means of establishing party organizations in all types of new economies. The anticorruption struggle is an important task for building stronger party and government organizations, and it is a task having a close bearing on the future and destiny of our party and state. We must thoroughly understand the struggle's protracted nature and formidability. On the basis of consolidating the successes that have been achieved, we must continue to wage this struggle in a sustained, deep-going, and more effective manner so that we can win the trust of the people and ensure the normal development of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. Comrades! Building an affluent, strong, democratic, and civilized socialist modern China is an ideal shared by all Chinese people, and a great goal of our party during the new period. The achievement of this great idea requires the strenuous and untiring efforts exerted by people of many generations. You veteran comrades are a precious wealth of our party and state. During all historical periods of revolution and construction, you have done all you possibly can, dedicated yourselves selflessly, and endured all hardships. The historical services you have rendered in winning the victory of the new democratic revolution; in building the socialist system; in developing the socialist cause; in promoting reform, opening up, and modernization; and in building a prosperous and strong motherland are unerasable. Your brilliant successes will go down in the annals. We will forever cherish, inherit, and carry forward the steadfastness; conviction; wisdom; experiences; lofty spirit and examples, fine traditions, and conduct which you veteran comrades have developed during the protracted struggles. During the new historical period, your important roles in developing the economy, expediting reform and opening up, safeguarding social stability, and intensifying spiritual construction will still be irreplaceable. We believe that you will continue to care for and support all projects of reform and construction, help the vast number of middle-aged and young cadres to grow up healthily, and will continue to make new contributions during the new period. The vast number of middle-aged and young cadres must humbly learn from veteran comrades; do a good job in taking over the veteran comrades' spirit of waging heroic revolutionary struggle; serve as links of the past and the future; and strive to contribute to expediting reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. An important project of the party and government is the project about veteran cadres. Currently, the nation has more than 7 million retired cadres. Party committee and governments at all levels must heighten their understanding of veteran cadres' affairs, improve their leadership over veteran cadres' affairs, earnestly study the new situations and new issues of veteran cadres' affairs, and sum up new experiences. We must care for veteran cadres politically and take care of their livelihood. While drawing up new measures for reforms, we must also gradually establish and improve the social security system and take timely steps to study, resolve veteran cadres' practical living problems, and do something practical for them so that our veteran cadres can provide and do something, learn something, enjoying life during their remaining years. Comrades! The nineties are important for the development of our party and state. Our cause cannot be more grandiose and our future cannot be brighter. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and that of the party's basic line, let us rally even closer around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, work with one heart and one soul, be determined in launching reform, take the initiative in our own hands, make painstaking efforts in doing pioneering work, and work hard to finish building an initial socialist market economic system and achieving the magnificent goal of China's socialist modernization by the end of this century. Finally I wish you a pleasant Spring Festival, good health, and a happy family life!
