Galina Sidorova, adviser to the Russian foreign minister, said that air strikes against any of the warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be justified if they prompted these sides to accept a compromise. However, she feels that in present circumstances, such strikes would only lead to a further brutalization of the conflict.
