ACTION: Withdrawal of State program amendment. SUMMARY: OSM is announcing the withdrawal of a proposed regulatory program amendment (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1260) filed by Kentucky on November 17, 1993, pursuant to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), relating to the disposal of coal combustion fly ash, bottom ash and scrubber sludge. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William J. Kovacic, Director, Lexington Field Office, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, 2675 Regency Road, Lexington, Kentucky 40503 Telephone: (606) 233&hyph;2896. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background By letter dated November 17, 1993 (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1260), Kentucky submitted a proposed program amendment that would add a new section (405 KAR 7:200) to Kentucky's Administrative Regulations. The proposed new regulation offers surface coal mining permittees the option to dispose of coal combustion waste on the permit area under the special waste permit-by-rule established at 401 KAR 45:060 Section 1(6). OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the January 13, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 1921) and, in the same document, opened the public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period closed on February 14, 1994. By letter dated April 18, 1994, Kentucky gave OSM notice that it was withdrawing the program amendment, submitted on November 17, 1993, from further consideration. The regulation, which was the subject of the amendment, completed the promulgation process and took effect on March 13, 1994. During promulgation, a letter of objection was attached to the regulation by the Administrative Regulation Review Subcommittee, with the result that the regulation expired April 15, 1994, upon adjournment of the regular session of the 1994 Kentucky General Assembly. During the same legislative session, Senate bill 266 which addresses the same issues, was enacted into law and has been submitted to OSM as a proposed amendment to the Kentucky regulatory program and will be the subject of a separate rulemaking by OSM. Therefore, the proposed program amendment published in the Federal Register dated January 13, 1994, related to the disposition of coal combustion fly ash, bottom ash and scrubber sludge is withdrawn.
