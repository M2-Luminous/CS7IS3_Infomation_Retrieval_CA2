But Only Among Themselves"] [Text] The disputes on the activity of foreign banks in Russia which were on the point of dying down seem to be about to flare up again with renewed force. It cannot be ruled out that is connected with the request of the French bank subsidiary "Societe Generale Rossiya" and the Moscow branch of the "Austria" bank for admission to the Association of Russian Banks, one of the most influential banking organizations. Let me remind you that the "Austria" bank was licensed by the Central Bank of Russia to set up a branch in Moscow without the right to provide services to Russian residents back on 5 October 1992. The "Societe Generale Rossiya," with an incorporation capital of $35 million, was given broader powers by the Central Bank of Russia, but because it did not begin working with residents before 15 November 1993 it fell under the effect of the President's "restrictive" edict and has now formally lost that right for two years. Local Russian bankers look so self-assured and respectable in their TV advertisements but almost in unison plead poverty when it comes to competing in the banking services market with well-known Western financial institutions. So far they have successfully used the banner of judicious protectionism to justify raising a solid barrier against their foreign counterparts' penetration of Russia. For example, Sergey Filatov, director of the President's Staff, has officially confirmed that there is no draft presidential edict on expanding the operations of foreign banks on Russian territory in preparation. At the same time, Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin has stated that if bilateral agreements are signed between Russia and the European Union [EU] or any other country on mutual preferences in the granting of access to each other's market, the government will ask the president to lift the prohibitive effect of his edict on those countries' banks. In A. Shokhin's words, the Russian Government will work for the "gradual extension of the national regime to foreign banks." But there are quite a few exclusions of a protectionist nature in agreements with the EU right now. For example, foreign banks' capital must not exceed 12 percent of total Russian bank capital, there is a three-year restriction on their dealing in securities, and the minimum residue in their accounts must be at least 50,000 ECU's. Russia's commercial banks have been given a considerable head start. But will they be able to use it to the benefit of their clients?
