They described the vote as unconstitutional and as a gross violation of human rights and the Tatars' right to self-determination. "The election has brought the republic on the brink of civil war", it says. Leaders of the umbrella organization including the Tatar Public Center, Ittifak Party and Azatlyk Youth Movement are challenging the voting results because of what they saw as a ban on opposition meetings and rallies in the election campaign. The letter speaks of a government-sponsored campaign of intimidation and threats of dismissals and non-payment of wages in urban areas and withdrawal of subsidies in the countryside. They accused the government of imposing censorship of the mass media and barring representatives of the nationalist groups from monitoring the election. The authors of the letter say they have appealed for international inquiry into the legitimacy of federal elections in Tatarstan and an anti-democratic environment in which they were held.
