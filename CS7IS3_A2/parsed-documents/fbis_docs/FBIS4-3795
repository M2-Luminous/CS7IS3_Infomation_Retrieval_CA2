Speaking at the American Broadcasting Company's (ABC) "This Week With David Brinkley," Christopher said latest reports from the scene indicate that the withdrawal is taking place. The ultimatum issued by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Friday [22 April] seems to be working, he said, adding that "We've been disappointed before, but so far today, it's encouraging." NATO ordered the Bosnian Serbs to immediately stop their assault and pull out their heavy weapons before 12:01 A.M. local time today from a two miles radius from the center of Gorazde. It also demanded that the Serbs allow United Nations peacekeepers and medical personnel into Gorazde, one of the six U.N.-designated "safe areas" for Muslim refugees. Had the Serbs failed to respond, the ultimatum threatened, they would risk NATO air strikes. The United States is "very carefully" monitoring the situation at the enclave, which had been under intensive Serb attacks in recent weeks, Christopher said. Before making the remarks, the U.S. state secretary talked several times this morning with the chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff and received reports from Bosnia. Despite small arms fire, there has been no shelling in Gorazde today. Some 140 U.N. peacekeepers are already in the city and about 500 more are expected to arrive this afternoon. British and French helicopters, meanwhile, are evacuating the wounded from the former Yugoslav Republic. And they hope to bring out between 200 to 300 people today.
