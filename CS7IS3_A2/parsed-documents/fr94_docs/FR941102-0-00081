FR941102-0-00081 FR941102-0-00021 TSEI and Peterson commented on the 24-month test results, and Thomas Loughran's comment is relevant to cases of premature degradation. TSEI and Peterson consider the failure of coated sample to be an anomaly, uncharacteristic of the performance of all other coated polycarbonates in their experience. In their view, the failure is due to a faulty coating. Peterson suggested that either the coating thickness or the curing process was not performed in accordance with the plastic manufacturer's specifications. The rapid surface degradation of both coated samples occurring in the period between 24 and 36 months exposure and the apparent flaking of the coating of the Arizona 18-month specimen support Peterson's opinion of faulty coating. Mr. Loughran was concerned that coated polycarbonates may not meet the 7 percent haze limit either as samples or as finished products. He cited knowledge of Arizona exposure tests in which coated polycarbonate reflectors suffered 60 percent to 70 percent losses in reflective performance, and he suggested testing of finished products as well as material. Mr. Loughran's experience appears to be at odds with the confidence of TSEI, Peterson, Trucklite, and the SAE haze task force that coated polycarbonate plastic will haze less than 7 percent in a 3-year exposure test. However, it is likely that departures from virgin material and poor coating practices can combine to cause inferior performance in products nominally made from certified materials. These data suggest the beneficent effect of coating on polycarbonate plastic will not be sufficiently durable to meet the performance certified after the material unless the material manufacturer's recommendations are followed rigorously. While the presence of some coating material does not guarantee compliance, the absence of coating seems to ensure that plastics such as polycarbonates will quickly fail the haze test. Use of coatings with a tint element visible under an ultraviolet inspection light affords a simple, practicable way for regulatory bodies such as NHTSA to discern whether relevant plastic materials have been coated. The 3-year test period appears to be unnecessarily long in those instances where test failures occur long in advance, such as samples that manifest haze at the end of an exposure of only a year's duration. Failure to tint, and premature hazing afforded a basis upon which NHTSA can determine noncompliance without having to complete pro forma the 3-year test period and unnecessarily delay the remedy of a noncompliant product. 4. Miscellaneous Issues 3M suggested that a test measuring reflective brightness before and after exposure of retroreflective devices be established as an alternative to haze testing so that sheeting material devices could qualify as reflex reflectors. No specific test procedures or criteria were included in the comment. Because this issue is beyond the scope of the present rulemaking, it could not be not considered in formulating the final rule. Rulemaking Analyses Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures This rulemaking action has not been considered under E.O. 12866. NHTSA has considered the impacts of this rulemaking action and has determined that it is not significant under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. The stringency of the haze requirement would not be changed. Further, manufacturers of plastic materials are currently measuring the haze of weathered samples by ASTM D 1003, which will govern the certification to the 7 percent haze limit. In addition, according to the agency's observation that haze not detectable by the human eye is also less than 7 percent, conformance of a reflector with the haze requirement could still be judged with the naked eye. Impacts of the final rule are, therefore, be so minimal as not to warrant preparation of a full regulatory evaluation. Regulatory Flexibility Act The agency has also considered the effects of this rulemaking action in relation to the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I certify that this rulemaking action would not have a significant economic effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Manufacturers of plastic materials are generally not small businesses within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Further, small organizations and governmental jurisdictions would not be significantly affected as the price of new motor vehicles should not be impacted. Accordingly, no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared.
