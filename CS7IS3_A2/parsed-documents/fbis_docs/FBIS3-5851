Beginning this spring, the ministry plans to begin improving the look of Japanese ambassadors and other diplomats by having them listen to advice from experts so they can present their best impressions when appearing in television interviews. As stated by a Foreign Ministry source, it is felt "there are not many diplomats who are used to the mass media." Therefore, the ministry plans to launch a campaign to promote diplomacy in a manner "which makes Japan visible" by making on-the-job improvements in its diplomatic stance, a stance which has often been described abroad as being "hard to understand." Those who are to newly undergo this "media training" program are mostly diplomats who have the greatest chance of being interviewed by the mass media, such as ambassadors and directors of overseas centers for public relations and cultural affairs. Japanese diplomatic missions overseas will sign contracts with consultants who will review video recordings of the interviews of various diplomats and check on minute details--such as their pronunciation, accents, pauses in speech, gestures, and even their tastes in neckties. In this way, the consultants will determine how the diplomats can most effectively appeal to their audiences in future interviews with the mass media.
