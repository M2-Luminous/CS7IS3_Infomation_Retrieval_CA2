Security Council urging North Korea to accept full nuclear inspections. Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a news conference, "not a single country believes it's appropriate to take measures that could escalate things rapidly to a high stage (of urgency)." Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States last week conferred privately over a draft resolution. The U.S. has proposed a resolution urging North Korea to agree to follow-up inspections of its nuclear facilities within one month. The resolution does not call for sanctions but leaves room for "further action if necessary." China, which is eager to keep open the door for dialogue with North Korea, says it is too early for such a step. China suggested Friday that the Security Council issue a nonbinding statement in the name of its president, Jean-Bernard Merimee of France, which unlike a resolution could be adopted by consensus rather than by vote. Saito said Tokyo expects the 15-member Security Council to take measures "most suitable at this point, as many members have the same awareness of the problem as we do." Noting that "the aim is to make North Korea change its policy and not to take punitive action," Saito said Tokyo does not "object" to the dialogue approach. As a permanent member China holds the power of veto, which it is likely to use if the council calls for tougher action such as economic sanctions against its longtime ally North Korea. South Korea's Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Sunday before adopting resolutions China's proposal "may be effective." Concerning direct talks between Japan and North Korea, Saito said Tokyo would positively respond if Pyongyang signaled interest in such talks, which "it does not seem to have."
