Later they visited with the president of the Supreme Court and asked that the Law on Venue Dispute not be implemented. A few hours before the Supreme Court ruled on the Law on Venue Dispute, opposition congressmen represented by Henry Peace, Fernando Olivera, Robert Caceres, Manuel Moreira, and Antero Flores, among others, presented an appeal for the protection of civil rights so the law is not enforced. The document was received by Justice Rafael Yager in his office. The appeal included a precautionary measure so that the law would not be applied to La Cantuta case. [passage omitted]
