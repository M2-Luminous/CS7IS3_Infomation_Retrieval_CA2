The result leaves a bitter taste in our mouths, and it is difficult to predict when they can recover from the aftermath, even after a cooling-off period. In reviewing the actual economic trends from a calm viewpoint, however, Japanese and U.S. industrial circles are not exchanging heavy fire with each other. In other words, heated disputes between the two governments do not actually reflect competition or cooperation in the private sector as they are. Thanks partly to the economic recovery, U.S. economic circles have toned down their "theory of the Japanese threat." Because the electronics and auto industries have completely regained their competitiveness, more people have come to feel that "Japan is no longer worthy of our attention." As an actual trend, many people expect that Japan's current-accounts surplus will be reduced rapidly. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) predicts that the ratio of the current surplus to the gross national product (GNP) will drop to around less than 2.5 percent next year from 3 percent in 1992. It is certain that imports of cars from the United States will sharply increase in the future. The auto industrial circles think that even if an import target is set, actual U.S. auto exports to Japan will exceed this target. Therefore, we should not overreact to the breakdown of the current talks because there are many factors that will duly settle various issues even if no measures are taken. Moreover, while the United States actually has achieved substantial, 3-percent growth, Japan has achieved zero growth. It is impossible to discuss matters at the same table without taking this gap in growth rates into consideration. Japan's economic recovery is the best remedy to reduce the surplus and also the best way to contribute to the global economy. If the United States should impose sanctions on Japan because of the latter's rejection of numerical targets, the sanctions will not only worsen the economic situation in Japan but also exert an adverse influence on the United States and the international community. U.S. President Bill Clinton is dissatisfied with Japan's economic stimulus package. However, the economic measures are not the final ones. Other measures such as the income tax cut scheduled for next year will be announced. The current issue is the possible increase in mutual distrust, which can be attributed to the fact that the controversy over the introduction of the yardstick known as numerical targets has become sort of a religious fervor. Japan, once stung by pressure to permit the United States to gain a "20-percent" share of its semiconductor market, has insisted on rejecting numerical targets, because these induce excessive government intervention, impede the principle of competition between markets, and run counter to the course of the deregulation policy of the Hosokawa administration. Industrial circles have also become allergic to numerical targets. Under these circumstances, the government cannot force industrial circles to accept numerical targets by issuing administrative guidance, nor does it have such power. In this connection, industrial circles are rapidly veering away from the government and are moving toward deregulation. The United States' argument that "a yardstick is needed to measure progress" is understandable. However, this depends on whether one should gauge "results," such as a "20-percent" market share, or "processes," such as cost reductions and improved services. It is impossible for the government to conclude an intergovernmental accord that employs "results" as a yardstick because this will lead to managed trade. It may be rather difficult to get used to employing the second factor, "processes," as a yardstick in the intergovernmental accord, but a compromise can possibly be reached if discussions are focused on this point. At the actual talks, however, the collapse of the negotiations was destined from the outset because the United States demanded "results" or similar criteria as a yardstick. The two countries should seek ways to achieve coexistence and coprosperity after a cooling-off period. The future of the U.S. economy depends on how deep are the inroads it can make into Asia -- and to do this, Japan's cooperation is indispensable. What Japan needs to do is to work out a long-term strategy based on changes in its economic structure. For example, it should seek an equal distribution of work with the United States.
