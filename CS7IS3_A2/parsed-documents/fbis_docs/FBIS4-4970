FBIS4-4970 "dreas066_d_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-066 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 South Korea U.S. Official on `War of Nerves' With DPRK U.S. Official on `War of Nerves' With DPRK SK0604002394 Seoul THE KOREA HERALD in English 6 Apr 94 p 1 SK0604002394 Seoul THE KOREA HERALD English BFN [Report by John Wallach] [Text] The United States may have no more than "a few days" warning of any North Korean attack against South Korea, a senior U.S. intelligence official disclosed Monday. The short warning time has led U.S. forces to employ a "vast array" of technological and human spy techniques to keep ahead in the war of nerves on the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. official said. North Korea's troops are as close to ready as any forces that we ever faced in the Cold War, he said. "With the high state of readiness that has developed over quite some time, you can't expect hopefully more than a matter of a few days" warning, he said. The U.S. official said the problem of knowing if and when North Korea plans to attack is compounded by the fact that Pyongyang has increased the numbers of "forward deployed" troops along its border with South Korea and "their general condition of readiness." Thus, if North Korea wanted to attack, "it wouldn't have to change a great deal," he said. Since the end of 1992, North Korea has increased its military strength from 16 corps or 144 divisions to 17 corps or 152 divisions, boosting the total number of North Korean troops to 1,030,000, he said. Two-thirds of North Korea's troops are positioned within 60 miles of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) at the 38th parallel dividing the two nations. Seoul, South Korea's capital, is only 25 miles from the DMZ, within range of North Korea's big artillery pieces. U.S. plans call for a combined U.S.-South Korean force of about 400,000 troops. The United States currently has 37,000 troops in South Korea. Among the techniques used by the CIA to detect changes are satellite photography, electronic or "signals" eavesdropping, aircraft and "humint," the intelligence gathered by human beings, presumably South Korean agents smuggled into North Korea. "You try to look at patterns of behavior and see if they're changing," the official said. "Our warning people have long lists of things they are particularly interested in." They include such seemingly mundane items as shipments of morphine designed to treat expected casualties and unusually large shipments of ammunition and other supplies. Other warning signs include unusual troop movements, the mobilization of reserve forces. None of these has yet showed any unusual activity, the official said. But the art of obtaining such knowledge, when your enemy goes to inordinate lengths to conceal it, is an inexact science at best, the official said. The experts divide the signs into two categories: unambiguous and ambiguous. "You're rarely lucky enough to get absolutely clear-cut signs because the other guy tries to disguise it and also tries to frighten you by doing some things that may not be genuine," he said. Such advance warning is critical to providing U.S. and South Korean troops with enough time to prepare for either a counterattack or to launch a preemptive strike, a move which Defense Secretary William J. Perry has pointedly refused to rule out.
