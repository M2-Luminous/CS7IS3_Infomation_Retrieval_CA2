An official from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) said here today that during Sutherland's stay in China, the GATT chief will exchange views with top Chinese leaders on China's resumption of its GATT membership. This will be his first visit to China since last June, when Sutherland succeeded former GATT chief Arthur Dunkel, who had visited China twice during his term. China was a GATT founding member in the 1940s, but applied for the restoration of its contracting status in GATT in 1986. The end of the Uruguay Round of talks last November has brought China's restoration of its GATT membership to a critical stage and the re- entry negotiations are being accelerated. China is making strenuous efforts to become an original member of the World Trade Organization, which is to take the place of GATT. Observers here said that therefore Sutherland's coming visit will be helpful to push forward the process of negotiations on China's re-entry to GATT. Sources said that Sutherland, together with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, will attend a May 11-15 international seminar on the development strategies of China's foreign trade in the 1990s, which is to be sponsored by MOFTEC. Some 300 experts, trade officials and entrepreneurs from both home and abroad are expected to attend the seminar and discuss a wide range of issues concerning China's foreign trade development in the 1990s, including the international trade environment, strategic choices and administrative measures.
