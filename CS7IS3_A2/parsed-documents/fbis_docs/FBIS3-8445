Vladimir Meciar, as prime minister of the Slovak Republic, has led the Slovak Republic into a political and economic crisis. By his statements, attitudes, and decisions, he has diminished the credibility of the Slovak Republic abroad; by the methods of his political work, on a long-term basis, he was unable to win over sufficient support within the minority government and in the Slovak Republic National Council. He was incapable of maintaining acceptable relations with the other supreme bodies of the state, in particular with the Slovak Republic National Council and president. It is for this reason that, in harmony with the Slovak Republic Constitution, I submit this proposal, together with the list of signatures of the necessary number of deputies, to the Slovak Republic National Council, asking for this proposal to be discussed. [end recording] [Announcer] The parliament will vote on Ladislav Pittner's proposal in a short while.
