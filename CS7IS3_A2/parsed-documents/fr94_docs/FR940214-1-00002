FR940214-1-00002 FR940214-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Part 61 [CN&hyph;93&hyph;004] RIN 0581&hyph;AB05 Revision of Cottonseed Sampler License Procedures AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) proposes to restructure the procedures for licensing cottonseed samplers to draw, prepare and submit cottonseed samples for USDA's official cottonseed grading program. The proposed revision would significantly reduce the paperwork burden involved in the licensing of official cottonseed samplers by eliminating the bonding requirement and the license fee, and extending the license period from 1 to 5 years. Under the proposed revision, official cottonseed samplers would still be required to obtain a license from USDA, and sampling equipment and procedures would continue to receive the same level of supervision from AMS Cotton Division personnel. DATES: Comments must be received by April 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments and inquiries should be addressed to Lee Cliburn, Cotton Division, AMS, USDA, room 2641&hyph;S, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, D.C. 20090&hyph;6456. Comments will be available for public inspection during regular business hours at the above office in rm. 2641&hyph;South Building, 14th & Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lee Cliburn, 202&hyph;720&hyph;2145. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has certified that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) because: (1) The proposed changes in licensing procedures will decrease the cottonseed sampler's paperwork burden; (2) the proposed change in licensing procedures will not affect competition in the marketplace; and (3) participation in USDA's official cottonseed grading program is voluntary. The information collection requirements for cottonseed sampler licenses contained in this proposed rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned OMB control number 0581&hyph;0008 under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). This proposed revision, if adopted, would significantly reduce the information collection requirements for 34 licensed cottonseed samplers. The cottonseed sampler license form CN&hyph;248 requires an estimated 0.17 hours or 10.2 minutes to complete. The paperwork burden for the 34 cottonseed samplers' license renewal each year amounts to 5.78 hours. This proposed rule, by requiring that licenses be renewed every 5 years, will reduce the paperwork burden to 1.16 hours, an 80 percent reduction. It is anticipated that the simplification of licensing procedures for cottonseed samplers, if adopted, would become effective on July 1, 1994, so that implementation could be coordinated with the start of the 1994 cotton harvest. USDA provides official grading of cottonseed under the authority of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1624), which requires USDA to supervise the drawing, preparation, and handling of samples submitted for official grading. Current regulations require that applications for initial and renewal cottonseed sampler's licenses, both of which expire in 1 year, be accompanied by proof that the sampler is bonded by an approved surety company, including a power of attorney, and a small fee ($20.00 for new licenses and $18.00 for renewals). These requirements are unnecessary for the maintenance of an acceptable level of supervision of cottonseed sampling by USDA. In addition, the licensing process would be simplified if these requirements were eliminated and the license period extended to 5 years. The licensing procedures for cotton samplers were revised similarly 15 years ago with no adverse effects to the level of supervision provided by AMS, and this revision would make the procedures for cottonseed sampler licensing consistent with those for cotton samplers. Under the proposed regulations, official cottonseed samplers would still be required to obtain a license, and sampling equipment and procedures would continue to receive the same level of supervision from Agricultural Marketing Service, Cotton Division personnel. The expected effects of this proposed revision would be to: (1) Decrease both the applicant's expense and paperwork burden required for licensing; and (2) simplify the procedures and reduce the time required by the Cotton Division employees to process the applications and maintain license records. While the effects on the cottonseed industry are expected to be nominal in both cases, justification for continuing the bonding requirement, license fee, and 1-year license period cannot be supported by experience in the supervision of USDA's official cottonseed grading program in recent years. Accordingly, §§61.26 and 61.28, which detail the bonding requirements for both newly issued and renewal cottonseed sampling licenses, would be deleted. In §61.27, the period of new and renewal licenses would be extended from 1 to 5 years. Sections 61.29 and 61.43, which set forth the designation of bond approval authority and the fees for new and renewal licenses, respectively, would be deleted.
