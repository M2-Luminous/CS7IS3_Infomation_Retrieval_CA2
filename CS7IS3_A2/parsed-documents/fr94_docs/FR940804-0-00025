FR940804-0-00025 FR940804-0-00012 40 CFR Parts 52 and 81 [TN 132&hyph;6436a; FRL&hyph;5009&hyph;3] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans and Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; State of Tennessee AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: On November 12, 1992, the State of Tennessee through the Memphis and Shelby County Health Department (MSCHD), submitted a maintenance plan and a request to redesignate the Memphis and Shelby County area (classified as a marginal nonattainment area) from nonattainment to attainment for ozone (O 3 ). The O 3 nonattainment area specifically consists of Shelby County. Under the Clean Air Act, designations can be changed if sufficient data are available to warrant such changes and the redesignation request satisfies the criteria set forth in the Clean Air Act for redesignations. In this action, EPA is approving the State of Tennessee's submittal because it meets the maintenance plan and redesignation requirements. The approved maintenance plan will become a federally enforceable part of the SIP for the Memphis and Shelby County area. On January 15, 1993, in a letter from Patrick M. Tobin to Governor Ned McWherter, the EPA notified the State of Tennessee that the EPA had made a finding of failure to submit required programs for the nonattainment area. EPA's redesignation of the Memphis and Shelby County area to attainment abrogates those requirements for this area. Therefore, the sanctions and federal implementation plan clocks begun by those findings are stopped at the time of the redesignation. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule will be effective October 3, 1994 unless adverse or critical comments are received by September 6, 1994. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to Karen Borel at the EPA address in Atlanta, Georgia listed below. Copies of the redesignation request and the State of Tennessee's submittal are available for public review during normal business hours at the addresses listed below. EPA's technical support document (TSD) is available for public review during normal business hours at the EPA addresses listed below.

Background On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) were enacted. (Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q). Under section 107(d)(1), in conjunction with the Governor of Tennessee, EPA designated the Memphis and Shelby County area as nonattainment because the area violated the O 3 standard during the period from 1987 through 1989. Furthermore, upon designation, the Memphis and Shelby County area was classified as marginal under section 181(a)(1). (See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (Nov. 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.343.) The Memphis and Shelby County area more recently has ambient monitoring data that show no violations of the O 3 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), during the period from 1990 through 1992. Therefore, in an effort to comply with the CAA and to ensure continued attainment of the NAAQS, on November 12, 1992, the State of Tennessee submitted for parallel processing an O 3 maintenance SIP for the Memphis and Shelby County area and requested redesignation of the area to attainment with respect to the O 3 NAAQS. On May 14, 1993, the MSCHD submitted evidence that a public hearing was held on the requests to redesignate Memphis and Shelby County from nonattainment of the NAAQS for both CO and O 3 to attainment of the NAAQS for these pollutants. In addition, there have been no violations reported for the 1993 O 3 season. The request for redesignation submittal was approved by the TN Air Pollution Control Board on March 9, 1994. II. Evaluation Criteria The 1990 Amendments revised section 107(d)(1)(E) to provide five specific requirements that an area must meet in order to be redesignated from nonattainment to attainment. 1. The area must have attained the applicable NAAQS; 2. The area has met all applicable requirements under section 110 and part D of the CAA; 3. The area has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k) of the CAA; 4. The air quality improvement must be permanent and enforceable; and,
