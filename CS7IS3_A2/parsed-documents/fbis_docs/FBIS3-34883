The objective behind this visit is said to be the expansion and consolidation of Iranian-Georgian relations and cooperation in all fields. In the talks that were held between the officials of Tehran and Tbilisi, the expansion of the two countries' relations, important regional problems, the current crises in the Caucasus, and other topics were discussed. Iranian-Georgian relations are rooted in the two countries' history. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, historic and cultural ties have linked these two countries more than ever before. From the political aspect, the Islamic Republic of Iran supports a peaceful solution of the problems in the Caucasus. Tehran has always stated its readiness to mediate between the conflicting sides in the various areas of the Caucasus. From Tehran's point of view, the continuation of diplomatic efforts between the conflicting sides and the neighboring countries which are playing the role of mediators is necessary in order to end the crises in the Caucasus, especially when the region's political, geographic, and ethnic fabric makes cooperation among neighboring countries for the creation of a political balance necessary. On the level of economic and cultural relations, eight agreements in various fields were signed during past visits by the two countries' officials, and the recent visit by the Georgian foreign minister to our country is actually a continuation of earlier bilateral talks and the implementation of agreements that have been reached. Currently, Iran and Georgia have started extensive cooperation in the field of light industries, machine-building, and mine and metal- ore explorations. Moreover, the Islamic Republic of Iran has extended humanitarian assistance to Georgia at the most sensitive junctures, and this shows the extent of the affection that the Iranian nation and government feel toward the Georgian people. Cooperation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Georgia as well as among other countries in the Caucasus will be better implemented when regional conflicts are solved and when tranquility and stability are reestablished. Moreover, the two countries' joint commissions as well as the joint commissions of other regional countries should become more active, and delegations in various fields be exchanged among the countries. At any rate, with the opening of the Georgian Embassy in the Islamic Republic of Iran and with the upcoming visit of our President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to Tbilisi, fundamental changes are expected in the two countries' relations and the way is expected to be further paved for expanded relations between the two countries.
