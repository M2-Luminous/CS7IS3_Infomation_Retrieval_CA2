The court ruled that Mihaly Balint, of Cristuru Secuiesc, should be released from jail. He is to leave prison within the next three days, during which the formalities will be completed. Otherwise he would have had to serve three more months of imprisonment. The other two detainees did not benefit from a similar court ruling. Over the next few days they will appeal the ruling at the Supreme Court of Justice. The argumentation of the [negative] ruling says that one of them participated in an attempt to break out of prison, while the other had committed a crime that was too serious for him to be pardoned. "This is an anomaly. First because in the prison logbook there is no word about any attempted breakout, and second because other persons who have meanwhile already been freed were sentenced for the same things," Bela Marko, chairman of UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania] told us.
