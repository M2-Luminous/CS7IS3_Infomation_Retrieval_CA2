Speaking at the congress of the South African Agricultural Union in Port Elizabeth, Mr. Meyer said access to the farming sector would be broadened with the allocation of funds and introduction of measures to assist novice farmers. Farmers, he said, would also be settled on available state land, but under no circumstances would the government confiscate or nationalize existing farmers' land.
