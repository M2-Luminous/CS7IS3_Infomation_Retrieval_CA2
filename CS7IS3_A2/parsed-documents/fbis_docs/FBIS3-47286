The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forward a proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo, a proposal of reunification in the form of confederation based on one nation, one state, two systems and two governments, as the most realistic and reasonable way of achieving the independent and peaceful reunification of the country on the three principles of national reunification, the article notes, and goes on: The proposal of reunification through confederacy based on one nation, one state, two systems and two governments is to reunify the country by founding a unified one national state while leaving the different systems and governments existing in the North and the South as they are. The DPRK's proposal for reunification in the form of confederation is one based on national unity, placing the interests of the nation above anything else. It is also based on the fact that two different systems and governments may co-exist within one national state. The difference in systems and ideas cannot be a condition for keeping one nation divided into two forever, nor can it be an insurmountable obstacle in reunifying the North and the South. The two systems can co-exist within one nation, unified one state when they are based on the national commonness which has been carried down through a five thousand year long history. The DPRK's proposal for reunification through confederacy indicates the way of reunification on the basis of the national idea placing the nation above the system, and it is the most reasonable proposal to realise the national reunification by means of forming one confederal state, taking into consideration the unanimous demand of the people who aspire after reunification and the national commonness which has been formed for a long period, under the present conditions in which the two different systems exist in the North and the South. No matter how the situation may change, we will make all efforts in the future, too, to reunify the country through confederacy on the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity in conformity with the will and desire of the whole nation.
