The group, which includes experts from the European Union, Russia, the United States and the United Nations, is attempting to define a common stand concerning Bosnia in order to press the warring factions there to end the more than two-year conflict. "If the parties involved don't want peace we will act accordingly," Juppe said. Earlier this month, foreign ministers from the contact group met in Geneva and united in a bid to put the peace process back on track, by calling for a four-month ceasefire and a resumption of peace talks. They also urged the warring parties to reach agreement on the basis of a European plan for the ethnic division of the former Yugoslavia, providing 51 percent of the territory for a Bosnian Croat-Moslem federation and 49 percent for the Bosnian Serbs. "This plan respects Bosnia's unity," Juppe said, adding that if it were rejected by the warring parties, France would consider withdrawing its peacekeeping troops from Bosnia by the end of the year. Spain and Britain have also said they may pull their troops from the war-torn country if there is no breakthrough in the peace process. Juppe said members of the contact group did not plan to wait for an answer to their proposal beyond mid-June when they are due to hold another ministry-level meeting.
