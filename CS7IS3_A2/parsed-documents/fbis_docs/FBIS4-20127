His warning came as ministers and senior officials prepared to draw up final recommendations for spending reductions in a bid to find 2.3 billion pounds savings in line with Treasury demands. Mr. Rifkind set out his stall in the annual defence white paper, which officials admitted was necessarily "bland" because the Front Line First review would not be completed until July. However, it revealed significant new cuts in the manpower strengths of the Royal Navy and RAF [Royal Air Force]. By April 1, 1995, the Navy will fall by an extra 1,500 to 51,000, while the RAF will lose a further 3,000 men and drop to 70,000. However, the Front Line First review is expected to recommend that manpower plummets to around 45,000 in the Navy and around 60,000 in the RAF by the turn of the century. The first meeting of ministers and the so-called executive group scheduled for Thursday was today postponed until next week. Mr. Rifkind repeatedly emphasised that the "fighting capabilities" of the armed forces were sacrosanct. "We have no intention of making any further reductions in the fighting capabilities of our armed forces," he said. And, in a thinly veiled warning to the Treasury, the white paper said: "Our armed forces are widely regarded -- and rightly -- as a valuable and prestigious national asset. The possession of such an asset is not a luxury; and it is not something we could surrender without grave injury to the security and reputation of this country." Strong armed forces were essential so long as Britain wanted to play an active part in international affairs. Although the end of the Cold War was welcomed, nationalism and extremism were "sadly" on the march. It would be many years before it became clear whether Russia -- with its huge arsenal of weapons -- would be able to develop into a permanent friend of the West and a stable democracy. The white paper warned that Britain will face increasing challenges and that there could be even greater calls on the armed forces if hopes for greater stability fail to materialise. "We do not intend to take risks with our security," said the white paper. "The penalties for misjudgment would be too severe." At a London briefing, Mr. Rifkind said it was the Government's intention that Britain should remain one of the world's most formidable military powers. The review, details of which will be announced in late July, had gone better than predicted. The Defence Secretary said he was "pretty confident" of not only meeting the requirements but of having savings to "enhance the fighting capabilities of our armed forces." Asked about proposals to slash around 20,000 civilian and military jobs, he stressed: "The crucial question is not overall manpower but how you use your manpower and whether they are being used in the most productive form." But Labour immediately denounced the white paper as a charade and a whitewash. David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said: "It is a transparent attempt to try to get the Tories out of a short-term political problem at the expense of the long-term security of Britain. Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind does not want to jeopardise Tory chances in the local and European elections by revealing the full extent of his cuts." Since December, 33 studies have been carried out into the entire support sector in a bid to find the necessary savings. These studies -- apart from two -- are now complete and will be discussed by the ministerial/executive group, which includes the financial director of Marks & Spencer Christopher Littmoden and senior officials from the Treasury and the Downing Street policy unit. A final package of recommendations will be put together from the various studies and presented to Mr. Rifkind in the middle of next month. Among the proposals are 20 percent cuts in senior officers and officials, a similar cut in the 11,000-strong Procurement Executive, the closure of hundreds of buildings including military colleges, and widespread privatisation of fleets of non-fighting aircraft and vehicles. One of the most politically contentious issues is the naval base at Rosyth in Fife, which the Royal Navy has recommended for closure with warships moved to Portsmouth. Mr. Rifkind insisted that if any recommendation could be shown to jeopardise the fighting capabilities of the armed forces, it would not be accepted.
