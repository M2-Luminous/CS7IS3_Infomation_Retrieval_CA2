For this, another meeting will be held on Thursday [6 January], and in this afternoon the coalition deputies will be able to acquaint themselves with the candidate ministers and their programs. In the words of the Isamaa [Fatherland] deputies, who wish to remain anonymous, the reason for the delay was the wish of the social democrats and their leader, Marju Lauristin, to listen to the program of the candidate finance minister Heiki Kranich. It is believed that Kranich will present it tomorrow, said a deputy. He was also convinced that the coalition council will approve on Thursday all the proposed candidates. The cabinet changes must be approved also by President Lennart Meri. According to an assertion by the aforementioned Isamaa deputy, Lennart Meri may be against the replacement of Minister of the Economy Toomas Sildmae. According to unconfirmed reports, Prime Minister Mart Laar does not wish to allow a situation to arise in which the president would leave some of his proposed candidates unendorsed. This might bring with it serious constitutional consequences. Today's meeting with the candidate ministers was said to have been arranged for gaining time, to hold discussions on solving this problem.
