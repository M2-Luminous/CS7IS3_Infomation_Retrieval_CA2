Pavel Grachev noted that Russia's proposals on the NATO "Partnership for Peace" program were greeted with understanding among practically all the participants in the talks during the recent visit by the head of the Russian military department to the NATO headquarters in Brussels. Only certain details remain to be elaborated. Russia will be able to join the "Partnership for Peace" program within two or three weeks, P. Grachev noted. But for this to happen, Western countries should study these proposals and draw up a document through diplomatic channels which would express agreement with Russia's proposals. The Russian defense minister's optimism is also connected with the fact that when he was in Brussels, Pavel Grachev "saw support for the Russian proposals on the part of FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe." "The greater the country the more they understand us," the head of the Russian military department noted. Unfortunately, unlike the ministers of defense of NATO countries, from whom Pavel Grachev perceived support and "a good attitude toward me and toward Russia," to use his own words, the CIS countries do not always display understanding toward the problems facing Moscow.
