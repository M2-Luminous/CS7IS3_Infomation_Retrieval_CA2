FR941007-1-00036 FR941007-1-00008 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 [Docket No. 74&hyph;14; Notice 92] RIN 2127&hyph;AF30 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Occupant Crash Protection AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. SUMMARY: This notice proposes to allow manufacturers the option of installing a manual device that motorists could use to deactivate the front passenger-side air bag in a vehicle without rear seats for the purpose of allowing them to place rear-facing infant restraints in the front seat. NHTSA research indicates that rear-facing infant restraints should not be placed in the front seat of a vehicle equipped with a passenger-side air bag. This poses a problem because manufacturers are beginning to install, and soon will be required to install, passenger-side air bags in passenger cars and light trucks, some of which have only front seats. DATES: Comment Dates: Comments must be received by December 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to the docket and notice number of this notice and be submitted to: Docket Section, Room 5109, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590. (Docket Room hours are 9:30 a.m.-4 p.m., Monday through Friday.) FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Daniel Cohen, Chief, Frontal Crash Protection Division, Office of Vehicle Safety Standards, NRM&hyph;12, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590. Telephone: (202) 366&hyph;2264. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background This notice proposes to allow manufacturers the option of installing a manual device (hereafter referred to as a ``cutoff device'') that motorists could use to deactivate the front passenger air bag in a vehicle without rear seats for the purpose of allowing them to place rear-facing infant restraints in the front seat. (``Rear-facing infant restraint,'' as used in this notice, refers to an infant restraint system (except a car bed) which is positioned in a vehicle so that the restrained infant faces the rear of the vehicle.) NHTSA is issuing this proposal because one particular type of child restraint, i.e., a rear-facing infant restraint, should not be placed in the front seat of a vehicle equipped with a passenger air bag. This poses a problem because manufacturers are beginning to install, and soon will be required to install, passenger air bags in vehicles, some of which have only front seats. On September 2, 1993, NHTSA published a final rule amending Standard No. 208, Occupant Crash Protection, to specify that manufacturers must install air bags to satisfy the standard's automatic crash protection requirements (58 FR 46551). This rule was required by 49 U.S.C. 30127 (recently codified and previously cited as Section 2508 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991). These requirements for driver and passenger air bags are phased-in for both passenger cars and other vehicles. The phase-in percentage for passenger cars is 95 percent by model year 1997, and all passenger cars beginning with model year 1998. The phase-in percentage for trucks, buses, and multipurpose passenger vehicles (other than walk-in van-type trucks and vehicles designed to be exclusively sold to the United States Postal Service) with a gross vehicle weight rating of 8,500 pounds or less and an unloaded vehicle weight of 5,500 pounds or less (collectively referred to as ``light trucks'' throughout the remainder of this preamble) is 80 percent by model year 1998 and all light trucks beginning with model year 1999. NHTSA has already released several documents and completed several rulemaking actions addressing the air bag/infant restraint interaction problem. Based on the preliminary results of the testing done regarding this problem, NHTSA issued a Consumer Advisory on December 10, 1991, warning owners of rear-facing infant restraints not to use such a restraint in the front seat of a vehicle equipped with a passenger air bag.
