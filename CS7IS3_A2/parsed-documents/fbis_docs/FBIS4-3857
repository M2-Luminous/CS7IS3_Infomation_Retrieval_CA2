London will be the first venue for the "contact group" meeting scheduled on Tuesday [26 April], British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said today after meetings with his U.S, French counterparts and Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin. Hurd said he preferred negotiation to air strikes, which were threatened if Serbs failed to comply with the ultimatum to withdraw all heavy weapons at least 20 kilometers from Moslem-held Gorazde by 0001 GMT on Wednesday. "I think there is a realization amongst most people that this war is only going to be brought to an end by a negotiated settlement," he said, "What we are doing is seeking to unify the efforts we are all making towards that end." British officials said the cast of negotiators in the "contact group" will be little changed from the previous team already working for the Bosnian peace. The list would probably contain Russian and American special envoys to former Yugoslavia, Vitaliy Churkin and Charles Redman, United Nations peace negotiator Thorvald Stoltenberg and German, French and British officials. Western officials welcomed in the new group the inclusion of Russia, widely considered as an ally of Serbs. Churkin said he expected tremendous efforts to be made in bringing peace in Bosnia. "I think the next week or two are going to be very intensive and hard work for us all in order to bring things to a peaceful conclusion in Bosnia," Churkin said after a meeting with British Prime Minister John Major. Churkin said he had been working hard to persuade Bosnian Serbs to end hostilities with the Moslems. British officials said there was a broad agreement that Serbs face "firm response" if the ultimatum to withdraw is not met. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher hailed the formation of "contact group" and said there were "good prospects" of ending bloodshed. "The contact group is the best way to try and regain the momentum that existed prior to the situation in Gorazde," said Christopher after meeting Britain's Major. "We think only through the combined influence of all the parties that I mentioned will we achieve success here. It is the combined influence that has the best prospect for a resolution of these matters," he said.
