FBIS4-54399 "dreeu083__a94013" FBIS-EEU-94-083-A Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Zhelev, FYROM's Gligorov Comment on Visit Zhelev, FYROM's Gligorov Comment on Visit AU2704093494 Sofia BTA in English 1918 GMT 26 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2704093494 Sofia BTA English BFN [Text] Sofia, April 26 (BTA) -- "This was a historic visit," President Zhelyu Zhelev said of the first official visit of President of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Kiro Gligorov to Bulgaria. Mr. Gligorov said that after four meetings with President Zhelev so far he was left with the impression that "we can encourage the further development of mutual understanding between the two states and the two peoples." President Zhelev and President Grigorov held a press conference at the end of the two-day official visit Macedonia's head of state. President Zhelev said that they discussed three groups of problems: bilateral relations, the latest developments in the Balkans and the relations of Bulgaria and Macedonia with the European and Euro-Atlantic structures. "It was established that we share willingness for a peaceful settlement of the conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and for the prevention of the conflict's expansion to Kosovo or, God forbid, to the Republic of Macedonia, which would pose a direct threat to Bulgaria as well," Dr. Zhelev pointed out. The two presidents found out that they both support the efforts of the United Nations, NATO, the United States and Russia to finally find a peaceful solution to the conflicts and their gradual settlement at the negotiating table. "Bulgaria could make a humble contribution and would gladly help the Republic of Macedonia in the process of its integration with the European and Euro-Atlantic structures: both with the CSCE and the Council of Europe, over which Bulgaria will preside from May 10," said Bulgaria's president. "We enjoy a serious and useful assistance on the part of Bulgaria in the European structures and the United Nations," said Mr. Gligorov. "Until the Kosovo problem is resolved, there will always be the danger of the war spreading into Macedonia," he pointed out. He explained that this was the reason why Macedonia was the first country to ask for the preventive deployment of UN peacekeeping forces on its territory. "Macedonia is against the forming of any alliances that would lead to a new carving up of the Balkans," he said. In response to a question whether Macedonia would join the new Yugoslavia, Mr. Gligorov answered: "Macedonia has chosen once and forever to be an independent, sovereign state." President Zhelev said that the visit of Mr. Gligorov to Bulgaria marks the end of a stage in the development of Bulgarian-Macedonian relations. He reminded that Bulgaria was the first country in the world to recognize the independence of Macedonia together with that of the other three former Yugoslav republics, Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, on January 15, 1992. He said that the present stage of the development of the bilateral relations was characterized by the efforts of Bulgarian diplomacy to gain international legal recognition for the Republic of Macedonia, by the establishment of diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and Macedonia and by the rapid development of trade and economic contacts. "The spontaneous and vigorous progress of trade and economic contacts shows, among other things, that official intergovernmental contacts lag behind the natural development process," Dr. Zhelev said. In response to a question why no documents were signed during the visit, President Zhelev said that in their capacity as presidents he and Mr. Gligorov can only sign interstate treaties, and the one with Macedonia is still in a very early stage of preparation. He added that a couple of agreements could have been signed but that did not happen because of ad hoc artificial considerations. "There was a flexible formula, saying that the documents were to be signed in the official languages of the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Bulgaria, which implied that they were two different languages. However, the Macedonian part insisted on the clear formula "Macedonian language" and because of the existing public opposition, which I believe is quite artificial, we refrained from signing anything at this stage. I believe that the problem will be settled; I am sure it will be," Dr. Zhelev explained. "Every people has the right to chose how its language is to be called," claimed Macedonia's President. "We cannot sign anything that would question our language and I am convinced that the problem will be settled soon because it is a relic of the past and we have to face the reality," he said. He said he was convinced that "democratic Bulgaria will find the inner power to take this issue off the agenda." When asked why in his address to the Bulgarian Parliament he failed to mention Bulgarians in Macedonia after he listed Macedonians, Albanians and Turks as sending their good wishes, Mr. Gligorov answered that according to the last census there were less than 3,000 Bulgarians in Macedonia. During his speech in parliament he was heckled with remarks like: "Are there no Bulgarians in Macedonia?"
