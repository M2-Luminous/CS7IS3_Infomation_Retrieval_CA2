While the list of trustworthy politicians is still topped by the "evergreens" (Michal Kovac, Jozef Moravcik, and Vladimir Meciar), it is interesting that precisely Michal Kovac and Jozef Moravcik, as well as Brigita Schmognerova, have become acceptable to broader sections of the population. It is precisely the acceptability of the sympathizers of parties other than his own that markedly distinguishes the present prime minister from his predecessor (sympathizers of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] make up 74 percent of those who trust Vladimir Meciar, while Democratic Union [DU] voters represent only about 20 percent of those who trust Jozef Moravcik). Similarly, whereas the popularity of Peter Weiss within the ranks of his own party is declining, he is becoming more acceptable to the supporters of other parties. According to the FOCUS survey, of all party leaders, Ludovit Cernak, Jan Slota, and Peter Hagyari enjoy the least sympathies in their own parties. The FOCUS survey was also aimed at ascertaining shifts in the voters' base since the 1992 elections. The slightest shift has been ascertained among Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] and Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] voters--56 percent of those who had voted for these two parties in 1992 would also vote for them in 1994. Approximately half of the original voters have remained loyal to the HZDS and the Democratic Party [DS] (which ran in the 1992 elections as the DS-Civic Democratic Party of Slovakia), while 40 percent of those who had voted for the Civic Democratic Union [ODU] in 1992 would today vote for DU. Another interesting finding concerns the structure of supporters of individual political parties. Men, citizens with only basic education, and citizens over 55 slightly prevail among HZDS supporters. Citizens working in the private sector are underrepresented among them. As much as 92 percent of HZDS supporters are determined to participate in the elections. If they were to choose a second party, HZDS supporters would opt for the Slovak National Party [SNS] and the Association of Workers of Slovakia [ZRS], while they feel an aversion for the KDH. The typical SDL voter is over 45 or 55, and citizens without religious affiliation are overrepresented among them. A total of 90 percent of SDL voters are determined to participate in the elections. Other parties acceptable to SDL supporters are the ZRS and the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia [SDSS], while they have an aversion to the HZDS and the KDH. The most typical KDH supporters are over 55 or 60, with only basic education. Some 88 percent of them are Catholics, and 91 percent would participate in the elections if they were held today. As other acceptable parties, KDH supporters name, above all, DU and the DS. They have an aversion to the HZDS, while their aversion to the SDL is declining. DU would be voted for by a disproportionate number of women and citizens under age 44. Supporters with university education are also overrepresented among them. Sympathies for DU grow with the size of the community of residence. If they were to cast a second vote, DU voters would give it to the National Democratic Party [NDS] or the KDH, while they feel aversion for the HZDS. When asked about their motives to vote for a particular party, respondents cited four reasons predominantly: sympathy and trust, the assertion of group interests, the political parties' programs, and the political parties' personalities. The following motives are important for the supporters of individual political entities: sympathy and personalities for HZDS supporters, Christian character of the movement and sympathy for KDH supporters, the assertion of workers' interests and social emphasis in the party program for ZRS supporters, and sympathy and personalities for DU supporters (the personality of Jozef Moravcik is an even bigger motive for DU supporters than the personality of Vladimir Meciar is for HZDS supporters).
