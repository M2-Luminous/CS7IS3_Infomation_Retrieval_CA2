"We'll try to do something. We hope it will be successful," Hamed Gilani, deputy chief of the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan led by Syed Ahmed Gilani, said in a special interview. The two Chinese engineers, Wang Qingpin, about 30, and Zheng Hongbao, about 40, were kidnapped while working on a project on June 21 last year at Bostan along Pak-Afghan border, some 30 kilometers from Quetta, capital of Pakistan's Baluchistan Province. The Afghan kidnappers, led by Mullah Salam Rocketi [name as received], held them in Qalat-e Ghelza'i District in Zabol Province in Afghanistan. Hamed Gilani said his cousin, 'Abdol Qadir Gilani, will go to Qalat-e Ghelza'i and get the two Chinese and other Pakistani hostages released after 'Eid, the biggest holiday for Muslims which falls on May 22. 'Abdol Qadir Gilani has recently met Mullah Salam Rocketi, and the two Chinese engineers and secured the release of two Pakistani hostages. Besides the two Chinese engineers, nine Pakistani people, including Ata Mohammad, deputy commissioner of Ziarat District in Baluchistan Province, have also been taken hostage by Rocketi's group. Rocketi has been demanding a ransom of 600 million rupees (about 20 million U.S. dollars), return of three Stinger missiles allegedly captured by Pakistani troops and release of his younger brother jailed in Pakistan. The two Chinese hostages recently wrote a letter to Chinese Ambassador in Pakistan, Zhou Gang, complaining about the inhuman treatment they received. They said they had to get up early in the morning to collect firewood. They could not even get food or would be beaten badly if they did not obey the kidnappers' order or did not finish the job. Some reports said the two Chinese engineers were sexually abused by the bandits. "We make it very clear that our talks with Rocketi are unconditional, and Rocketi has responded very positively," Hamid Gillani said. Seyyed Ahmed Gilani, father of Hamed Gilani, is an influential spiritual leader in Zabol Province as well as in whole Afghanistan. He helped secure the release of six Chinese engineers who were also kidnapped to Afghanistan in 1992. Hamed Gilani said their efforts to set free the Chinese and Pakistani hostages are based on "humanitarian value and moral obligation" as well as "private request from the family of the kidnapped deputy commissioner". It has nothing to do with Pakistan Government, he said.
