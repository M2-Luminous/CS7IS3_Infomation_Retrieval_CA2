The shelling started in the night of March 29 and repeated at 8-11am in the morning. The Karabakh units retaliated in all cases, forcing the enemy to stop shelling. A representative of the RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] Defense Army Political Department Rudolf Martirosyan rejected the information spread by the Azeri media on mercenaries from Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] groups who are ostensibly fighting at the Armenian side. According to the Political Department, such misinformation is spread in order to justify the participation of Afghan mojahedins, Russian and Ukrainian mercenaries fighting in the Azeri army.
