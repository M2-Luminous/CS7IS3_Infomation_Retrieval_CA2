Sources close to the military said similar tours were carried out as "inspections" by the inspection and assessment departments at various force commands every year before the Supreme Military Council meeting but added: "Commanders of the forces also participate in some of these inspection tours. But things are different this year. The force commanders will make nationwide tours. They will visit each and every army corps. Such visits in the military mean feeling the pulse. They are aimed at feeling the pulse and determining the attitudes of the lower echelons of the Armed Forces and if there is any disquiet, and it is obvious that people in the rank and file are rather unhappy, then to find remedies." The sources said as in all sectors of the society the economic and political problems in the country are also being discussed in the military units and that particular attention is being given to the debate between President Suleyman Demirel, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Chief of Staff General Dogan Gures on the proposed extension of the term of office of the chief of staff for another year. The sources said it was interesting that while the debate was going on Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said that she wanted the current people who are in command of the Armed Forces to remain and that it may be desirable from the point of view of national interests that these commanders stay on in their posts. They said that means the prime minister wants the extension of the terms of office of the commanders of the Air Force and Navy who are scheduled to be retired in August and that her emphasis is not only on the term of office of General Dogan Gures. The sources said if this is the case, then the Air Force and Navy chiefs will not retire and thus there will be no vacancy to fill among the full generals and admirals in the Air Force and the Navy respectively. Thus no rear-admiral or major general will be promoted this year as full admiral or general. That in return will mean some people will have to be retired as they cannot be promoted. The sources said: "The promotions in the military resemble a pyramid. If there is a vacancy at the top of the pyramid, then you can fill in the stones below with promotions and thus push up the peak. If in the Air Force or the Navy the top of the pyramid remains blocked then people cannot be promoted and thus stones start falling out of the pyramid. Thus people will be retired. Once the term of office of a general or admiral is extended then they will block the promotion of others below. The extension of the term of office of two commanders will undoubtedly block the promotion of many others and thus will create unease among the rank and file." The sources said the force commanders will conduct their "pulse finding tours" of the units all together and display unity among themselves. Only Gendarmerie Commander General Aydin Ilter will not participate in these tours and will only visit his own units. Sources said: "General Ilter's position is clear and will not be discussed at the Supreme Military Council in August. Only the tenures of the chief of staff as well as the Air Force and Navy commanders will be completed in August. The Land Forces commander will be affected by the appointments because he will become the chief of staff if and when General Gures is retired so the military council meeting interests him. So the four commanders want to act together. The controversial letter written by General Gures as well as the land, navy and air force commanders to former Land Forces chief Ret. Gen. Muhittin Fisunoglu asking him not to stir up trouble after his retirement and refrain from actions that will undermine the Armed Forces was not signed by Gendarmerie chief Gen. Ilter. The reply written by Gen. Fisunoglu to the four commanders is rather meaningful. He signs his letter telling the four commanders, `I hope in your joint letter you do not reflect mutual interests and mutual expectations.'" Sources also said President Suleyman Demirel is monitoring the developments closely and added, "The head of state is showing the necessary sensitivity over the issue." They said President Suleyman Demirel points to the previous decision of the Supreme Military Council which rejected the extension of the terms of office of generals and admirals at the Gulhane Military Medical Academy (GATA) and that he may object to the extension of the terms of office of the Navy and Air Force commanders.
