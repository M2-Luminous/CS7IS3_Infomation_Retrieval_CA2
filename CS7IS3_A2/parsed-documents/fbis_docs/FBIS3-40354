This was confirmed by Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Adelchi Pillinini at a meeting with journalists from UGAI (Italian Aerospace Journalists Association), who also stressed that "all three branches of the armed forces will be involved in the development of space programs" and that the above mentioned committee has assigned the Air Force in particular with "the management of the SICRAL (Italian Satellite for Confidential and Warning Communications) and Helios programs." SICRAL is a national satellite for government communications and Helios, which is currently under development as part of a cooperation accord among France, Italy, and Spain, will be used for strategic observation. As for SICRAL, it has been made known that COSTARMAEREO (Ministry of Defense Headquarters for Aeronautical and Space Construction) should issue the RFP (Request for Proposal) for the satellite's development in early 1994 and that this should be followed by the signing of a contract with Alenia Spazio. The overall cost of the program is estimated at 500-550 billion lire and includes the construction of a single satellite, its launching into orbit (probably using the European Ariane-4 launcher) and the TT&C (Remote Control, Telemetry, and Control) ground station. The SICRAL launch is expected to take place by 1997. A Space Activities Office divided into two sections, Space Policy and Space Programs, was recently established within the 4th Division of the Air Force Chief of Staff and will be directed by Col. Giuliano Giannone to better carry out the mandate on the management of defense space programs.
