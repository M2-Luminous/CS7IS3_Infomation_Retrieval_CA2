This was said over the national television by the chairman of the National Development Department under the Prime Minister C. Ulaan. He goes on to say that the political hunger strike is quite an ordinary event in a democratic society. But the demands referring to resignation of the government at the present time when the country is entering the decisive year of economic reforms and the government is doing its best in order to implement the programme of action for 1994 approved by the parliament is fraught with adverse aftermaths. Especially at the given moment when there is becoming transparent a tendency toward a stabilizing of macroeconomic showings, it is ackowledged by the international financial and economic establishments the government's fulfilling of its obligations undertaken, are being developed the joint programmes in the fuel and power industry and for developing the infrastructure. The transition process in Mongolia is being considered as an example of reforming a society. In today's conditions a forming of a new government and adopting of its new programme would turn out to be a useless waste of time. The political unstableness might cause to a loss of confidence in our country on the part of the world community.
