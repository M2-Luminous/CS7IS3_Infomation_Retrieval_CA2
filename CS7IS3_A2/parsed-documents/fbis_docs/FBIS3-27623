Li Peiwu, director of the province's Communications and Traffic Bureau, said Beijing would only promise to provide 300 million to 400 million yuan. He said the provincial Government would offer 3.1 billion yuan, while at least 10 billion yuan would have to be shared by county and municipal governments. The remaining money would come from foreign investors. Facing another deficit this year, analysts said the Central Government had already demanded provinces such as Guangdong to make a greater contribution to the central coffers. The sharing of tax revenue and the annual financial contribution to the state coffers by the provinces were two major issues in the tug of war between regions and the central authorities under the new tax reform programme introduced by Executive Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji. Under the tax policy Beijing regained control over much of the revenue that had been monopolised by localities in the past. Speaking to reporters while attending the continuing Guangdong People's Congress, Mr Li said the province would be able to meet its financial needs despite the lack of financial support from Beijing. He said much of the investment would come from bank credit and he did not expect the financing would lead to more taxes and levies. There were reports that many local chiefs raised taxes and imposed new fees on villagers to finance road construction. The added financial burden has been a source of confrontation in the country side. According to Mr Li, an other channel for financing came from the floating of new bonds and stocks. For example, the Guangdong Highway Company is considering issuing new stocks to the public to raise part of the investment money. Meanwhile, Mr Li admitted the traffic problem in Guangdong had been worsened by the influx of millions of migrant worker after the Spring Festival. However, the total volume attributed to the arrival of job-seekers was about eight percent down so far this year. He attributed the drop to an increasing number of migrant workers taking special coaches chartered by their employers.
