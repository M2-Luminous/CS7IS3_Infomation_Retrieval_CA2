For many observers, the action was seen as a smokescreen for the serious economic problems that the country faced as Zambia battled to extricate itself from the clutches of 27 years of a socialist economic and political regime. The fragility of newly democratic regimes was demonstrated once more with Zambia's example. Intervention by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have not softened the impact of new economic and fiscal policies on the average Zambian, who had looked up to Chiluba and the Movement for a Multiparty Democracy (MMD) for economic salvation following their 1991 election victory. For many, however, Chiluba has turned out to be a lameduck president. His opponents accused him of being unable, or unwilling, to deal with allegations of corruption and drug-dealing in government circles. And even his threat at the beginning of last year that 1993 would be the year of discipline within the party and government has done little to gain the confidence of Zambians. Chiluba had warned that "inside the velvet glove was a fist of steel", when responding to a growing demand for clean and accountable government, but the only show of steel was against opposition members. Now into his third year of power following victory on the wave of pro-democracy sentiment that raced across Africa since 1991, time is running out if the MMD hopes to be returned to power in 1996. So far, there has been very little tangible improvement in the lives of the people of Zambia. Indeed, for many, the situation has deteriorated. The price of consumer goods -- including staple foods -- has shot up, sometimes by as much as 200 percent. Inflation is racing away above 150 percent. Unemployment is rampant, and the privatisation programme that was seen as a cure-all, seems to have ground to a halt. Nobody in government seems to have fully grasped the vastness of the financial resources required to make the programme work. Health services, education and roads have deteriorated dramatically, and resistance to government expenditure on the "non-productive sector" has ensured the deterioration continues unabated. Real per capita incomes are still low, and cuts in the bloated civil service have resulted in thousands of disgruntled civil servants, used to the patronage that derives from autocratic rule. This was the unkindest cut of all -- and the opposition was quick to exploit this and other job losses and to extol the virtues of previous systems which at least guaranteed jobs and kept food prices artificially low. Chiluba assured concerned donor nations that the state of emergency would not be kept in force "a day longer than is absolutely necessary." Late last year, these donors at the Paris Club made it clear they would not deal with Zambia unless the government fired those involved in drugs and other corrupt actions. A variety of Ministers were axed or resigned. The backing by the unions helped Chiluba -- and the MMD -- into power, but now even the support of labour is doubtful. Some unionists are now opposed to continued association with the government, and one leader has even called on the unions to "stop prostituting themselves to both workers, capital and political leaders." Was liberalisation pushed too fast for such a fragile economy? It seems so, and the dangers of unfulfilled expectations are quite obvious for those -- including South Africa -- now going the path of democratisation.
