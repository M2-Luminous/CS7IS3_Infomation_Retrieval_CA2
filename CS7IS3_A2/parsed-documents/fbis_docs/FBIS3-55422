One ruble fetches 25 coupons today. For the most part, people get to work on foot -- there are few cars around, as there is virtually no gasoline to be found anywhere. These warships have not left their moorings for several months now. The vast majority of officers have remained loyal and true to the oath they swore. And every day, early in the morning, the old power's navy ensign is raised high above the warship's stern, and they salute it. It is almost all they have left. The actual purchasing power of a Black Sea naval officer's wage is five times lower than that of his counterpart in, say, the Baltic Fleet. Rubles sent from Russia are converted into karbovantsy according to the official state exchange rate, and not the market rate -- that is, at a rate of 4:1 rather than 25:1. The fleet pays customs duties on imported food, fuel, and various types of equipment -- including things brought in for the Ukrainian Navy. It pays for the use of land, roads, and test ranges. The Ukrainian Army is exempt from such taxes. What's more, according to some statistics, 40 percent of the strategic reserves in Ukraine have already been used up. Meanwhile, a Russian officer coming to serve in Sevastopol has to pay Ukrainian customs officers almost a whole month's salary. In November, 52 billion karbovantsy deposited in Black Sea Fleet accounts in Ukrainian banks were frozen. This money had been sent over from Russia to build homes for naval officers. It was finally released in December following wholesale price increases in Ukraine, only to become a pile of worthless bits of paper. Russia has long borne nigh-on three-quarters of the expenses of maintaining a fleet on the Black Sea. Ongoing talks on the future of the fleet and of Sevastopol have in practice led nowhere. Many people here in Sevastopol believe that the option of transferring the fleet's main base to Russia on a leasehold basis should suit everybody. That way, Yeltsin will not look like an occupier, nor Kravchuk a traitor.
