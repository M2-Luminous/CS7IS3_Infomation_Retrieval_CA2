FR940707-1-00031 FR940707-1-00011 Proposed Amendments New §100.305_Specifically Designed Facilities and Services New §100.305 proposes to set forth the criteria by which a facility or service will be determined to be ``specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons.'' New §100.306_Significant Facilities and Services. New §100.306 proposes to set forth the criteria by which facilities or services that meet the requirements of §100.305 (i.e., specifically designed facilities and services) will be determined to be ``significant.'' The factors listed in new §100.306 are intended to measure the relative importance of the facilities and services so that their significance can be determined. New §100.306 would approach the ``significance'' determination as an aggregate one_that is, a determination with respect to all facilities and services as a whole, rather than a determination with respect to each facility and service individually. New §100.310_Impracticability Existing §100.304(b)(2), which would be redesignated as new §100.310, would be revised by adding the following language as the introductory text to the current provisions contained in paragraph (b)(2): The provisions regarding familial status in this part shall not apply to housing intended and operated for occupancy by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit, provided that the person or entity affirmatively demonstrates through credible and objective evidence that the housing satisfies the requirements of §§100.305, 100.306, 100.315 and 100.316 or 100.310, 100.315 and 100.316. Housing satisfies the requirements of section 100.310 if *␣*␣* New §100.315_80% Occupancy Existing §§100.304(c)(1), 100.304(d) and 100.304(e) would be combined as new §100.315, and the following language would be added to the new §100.315: The provisions regarding familial status in this part shall not apply to housing intended and operated for occupancy by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit, provided that the person or entity affirmatively demonstrates through credible and objective evidence that the housing satisfies the requirements of §§100.305, 100.306, 100.315 and 100.316 or 100.310, 100.315 and 100.316. Housing satisfies the requirements of this section 100.315 if *␣*␣* New §100.316 _Intent To Provide Housing for Older Persons Existing §100.304(c)(2), which would be redesignated as new §100.316, would be revised by adding the following language as the introductory text to new §100.316: The provisions regarding familial status in this part shall not apply to housing intended and operated for occupancy by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit, provided that the person or entity affirmatively demonstrates through credible and objective evidence that the housing satisfies the requirements of §§100.305, 100.306, 100.315 and 100.316 or 100.310, 100.315 and 100.316. Housing satisfies the requirements of section 100.316 if *␣*␣* III. Appendix HUD is also proposing to publish an Appendix to the proposed rule. This Appendix is intended to provide members of the public with detailed guidance interpreting the provisions of the Fair Housing Act that pertain to the exemption for ``housing for older persons'' (55 or over housing). The Department believes that supplementing the regulatory language with interpretive guidance in the Appendix is the best way to comply with the Congressional mandate to further define the term ``significant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons.'' The Department intends for the Appendix to serve as guidance for housing providers and others in determining whether housing qualifies for the ``housing for older persons'' exemption (55 or over housing). The Appendix illustrates the application of the factors that the Department will consider in making its determination. The Department will refer to the interpretive guidance in the Appendix when considering whether there is reasonable cause to believe that a discriminatory practice has occurred or is about to occur. It should be clearly understood, however, that the illustrative examples provided in this Appendix are not dispositive of any actual case; i.e., a bare claim by a housing provider that the operation of a particular housing development duplicates the fact pattern of any example presented in this Appendix will not preclude the Department from conducting an investigation under the Fair Housing Act of an alleged discriminatory housing practice directed against an aggrieved person with familial status; nor will it preclude the Secretary from issuing a determination based upon the evidence obtained through such an investigation. The Department will apply the criteria for ``specifically designed'' and ``significant'' facilities and services on a case-by-case basis, and a determination will be based upon the totality of the factual circumstances examined. The Department may revise or supplement the Appendix from time to time in order to incorporate additional guidance, fact patterns, and relevant Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and court decisions that reflect future developments in administrative and case law. This will be accomplished through the publication of formal notices in the Federal Register .
