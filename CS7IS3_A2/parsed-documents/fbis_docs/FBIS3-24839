The peace initiative was devised by State President F.W. de Klerk and ANC [African National Congress] leader Nelson Mandela in conjunction with the Transitional Executive Council. [passage omitted] But the peace plan already seems to have hit a snag. In his statement Mr. de Klerk said discussions between himself and IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader, Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, had secured the IFP's involvement in the peace plan. But in a strongly-worded statement the IFP has rejected the initiative. It has described the withdrawal of the Internal Stability Units as a treacherous betrayal of government undertakings.
