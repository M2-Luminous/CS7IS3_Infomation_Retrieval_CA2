Laney said on Tuesday that North Korea should ease tensions by opening up its nuclear program. Laney, in a speech prepared for delivery at a dinner meeting hosted by the Korean-American Association Tuesday afternoon, said North Korea also "should begin to open its economy, and move as quickly as possible to grant its people those civil and human rights which are, after all, the reason governments are instituted among men." At the meeting held in the Hyatt Hotel in downtown Seoul, he said, "I have a personal image of the contrast between the world built by communist societies and that we enjoy in the free world... North Korea is on the sad side of this contrast. They must come to terms with this fact." He added that South Korea has to come to terms with its own new self. "I want to urge you to embrace the status you've earned as one of the world's leaders... So when I urge you to accept and believe in the Korea that you've built, I'm hoping that your acceptance will lead you to embrace the responsibilities of a world leader," he said.
