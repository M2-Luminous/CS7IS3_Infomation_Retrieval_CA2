The agenda will also include aid to South Africa and Russia, ways of controlling money laundering in connection with drug trafficking, and trade and the environment, the sources said. The agenda was agreed on at a recent meeting of representatives for leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, who will take part in the July 8-10 summit. The sources said Japan is likely to face intense pressure during the discussions to expand its domestic demand and reduce its trade surplus. To help mitigate the pressure regarding the trade surplus, Japan's ruling minority government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will have to make a hard political decision before the summit on proposed tax reforms as a pillar of measures to expand domestic demand, the sources said. Specifically, the discussions are likely to center on additional fiscal measures and a relaxation of monetary restraints in Japan and Germany, where economic recovery has been slow, the sources said. The U.S. will also be asked to cut its fiscal deficit as part of efforts to control inflation, they said. Concerning employment, U.S. President Bill Clinton is expected to propose a global jobs creation program at the summit to deal with structural unemployment. Regarding foreign aid, the summit is likely to agree to give coordinated aid to South Africa, now under black President Nelson Mandela, for its political stability, the sources said. They also said the meeting is expected to agree on increased G-7 aid to Russia to help its transition to a market economy.
