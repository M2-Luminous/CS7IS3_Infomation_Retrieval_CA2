Jezek is working in the commission as observer. He said the commission accepted the original proposal from the Interior Ministry because new division would take long. The elections to the Senate, the not-yet established upper chamber of the Czech parliament, will take place probably in the autumn, along with local elections. The commission will now have to define a mechanism according to which the order of individual constituencies will be determined, Jezek said. The order of constituencies, to be stated in a supplement to the law on parliamentary elections, will be decisive in determining in which constituencies the senator will be elected for two, four or six years in the first senatorial election. The Senate is to have 81 deputies, one third of which will be alternated every two years. Jezek said the final version of the list would be known tomorrow, the first day of the 19th session of the Chamber of Deputies of the parliament, which will deal with the bill on parliamentary elections. The bill sent to the chamber by Premier Vaclav Klaus (Civic Democratic Party, ODS) provides for a change in constituencies if the number of inhabitants of a constituency increases or decreases by 27 percent above or below the average number per mandate. In discussions on the authenticity of the bill some deputies, including coalition ones, pointed out that the document approved originally by the government mentioned a 15 percent difference which better corresponds to the equal right to vote as embedded in the Constitution.
