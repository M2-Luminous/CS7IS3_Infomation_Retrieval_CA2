FR940727-2-00080 FR940727-2-00045 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Mine Safety and Health Administration Petitions for Modification The following parties have filed petitions to modify the application of mandatory safety standards under section 101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. 1. Consolidation Coal Company [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;87&hyph;C] Consolidation Coal Company, 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241&hyph;1421 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(2) (weekly examination) to its Blacksville No. 2 Mine (I.D. No. 46&hyph;01968) located in Monongalia County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating roof and rib conditions in certain areas of the return air course, traveling the entire area would be unsafe. The petitioner proposes to establish check points 1 and 2 to monitor the methane and quantity of air in the affected area; to have a qualified person conduct these tests weekly at each check point and record the results in a book kept on the surface and made available for inspection by interested persons; and to install a door in the overcast on the mainline track haulage in order to observe the mine roof over the overcast once a day to determine whether a roof fall and possible collapse of the overcast exists. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 2. Drummond Company, Inc. [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;94&hyph;C] Drummond Company, Inc., P.O. Box 10246, Birmingham, Alabama 35202 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.800 (high-voltage circuits; circuit breakers) to its Shoal Creek Mine (I.D. No. 01&hyph;02901) located in Jefferson County, Alabama. The petitioner requests a modification of that portion of the standard that pertains to under-voltage, grounded phase, overcurrent, and ground check opening the circuit breaker. The petitioner proposes to use high-voltage contactors with an electrical rating adequate for the connected load; to use under-voltage, overload, grounded phase, and ground check protective devices that would de-energize the high-voltage contactor; to use a control circuit design for each high-voltage circuit that would preclude automatic closing of the high-voltage contactor when there is an under-voltage, overload, grounded phase, or ground check problem; to use a control circuit design for each high-voltage contactor that would preclude remote closing of the high-voltage contactor when there is an overload, grounded phase, or ground check problem; and to use a short circuit current that would trip the high-voltage circuit breaker, and a control circuit design that would preclude automatic or remote closing of the high-voltage circuit breaker. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 3. Drummond Company, Inc. [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;95&hyph;C] Drummond Company, Inc., P.O. Box 10246, Birmingham, Alabama 35202 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.803 (fail safe ground check circuits on high-voltage resistance grounded systems) to its Shoal Creek Mine (I.D. No. 01&hyph;02901) located in Jefferson County, Alabama. The petitioner requests a modification of that portion of the standard that pertains to under-voltage, grounded phase, overcurrent, and ground check opening the circuit breaker. The petitioner proposes to use high-voltage contactors with an electrical rating adequate for the connected load; to use under-voltage, overload, grounded phase, and ground check protective devices that would de-energize the high-voltage contactor; to use a control circuit design for each high-voltage circuit that would preclude automatic closing of the high-voltage contactor when there is an under-voltage, overload, grounded phase, or ground check problem; to use a control circuit design for each high-voltage contactor that would preclude remote closing of the high-voltage contactor when there is an overload, grounded phase, or ground check problem; and to use a short circuit current that would trip the high-voltage circuit breaker, and a control circuit design that would preclude automatic or remote closing of the high-voltage circuit breaker. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 4. Dynamic Recovery, Inc. [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;96&hyph;C] Dynamic Recovery, Inc., P.O. Box 25, Clarksville, Pennsylvania 15322 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1103&hyph;4(a) (automatic fire sensor and warning device systems; installation; minimum requirements) to its Lazarus Mine (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08336) located in Greene County, West Virginia. The petitioner proposes to install a low-level carbon monoxide detection system as an early warning fire detection system in all belt entries where a monitoring system would identify a sensor location instead of in each belt flight. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.
