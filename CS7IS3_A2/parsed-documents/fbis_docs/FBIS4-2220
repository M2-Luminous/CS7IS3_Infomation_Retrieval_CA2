In 1993, the per capita income of peasants in the overall agricultural development project areas was 840.40 yuan, 62.5 yuan higher than the per capita income of the total peasants in the region. The total agricultural output value in these areas reached 1.7 billion yuan, an increase of 63.5 percent over the figure before development. The newly added grain production capacity in the past five years reached 1 billion kilograms. Since 1989, when the state approved implementing the region's overall agricultural development projects, the region has increased the number of the projects from a large-sized project covered in the first-phase development project in the three leagues and one city in the eastern part of the region to five projects, including the second-phase overall agricultural development project, the experimental project for developing animal husbandry on the grasslands, the project for transforming the saline and barren land in Bayannur League, the project for raising cattle with straw in Linxi County, and the base for growing export vegetables in Manzhouli. The scale of development has been expanded from 12 banners and counties of three leagues and a city to 40 banners and counties of eight leagues and cities. The amounts of funds for development has increased from 110 million yuan annually (excluding the funds collected from the masses) to 140 million yuan. A total of 810 million yuan was invested in the past five years (including the funds collected from the masses.) So, this is the largest agricultural development project in the region since the founding of the PRC. The overall agricultural development project areas have become the region's key grain, oil, and sugar production bases. In the past five years, 4.05 million mu of low- and medium-yield farmland covered in the project areas were transformed, more than 1 million mu of uncultivated areas were developed for agricultural production, 680,000 mu of land were afforested, 580,000 mu of grasslands were improved, and more than 600,000 mu of paddy rice growing areas were newly developed. The conditions for larger areas of waterlogging and alkaline land have comprehensively been developed and improved in the manner of linking project measures and agronomic measures with biological measures. Intensity and scientific levels were noticeably improved. The output of the major farm and sideline products, such as grain, oil bearing crops, sugar beets, and meat, increased by a big margin. All this plays a gigantic role in ensuring the self-sufficiency in grain. [passage omitted]
