FR940830-1-00017 FR940830-1-00002 This rule also proposes to amend §124.311(a) concerning how the competitive threshold requirements should be applied for indefinite quantity and indefinite delivery requirements. Currently, §124.311(a)(2) specifies that ``[f]or purposes of indefinite quantity/delivery contracts, the thresholds will be applied to the guaranteed minimum value of the contract.'' This requirement has proven unworkable because of the immense differences noted between the ``guaranteed minimum'' amounts on procurements offered to the 8(a) program and the maximum amounts authorized under the procurements, and has been subject to substantial criticism. Procuring agencies can presently offer very large procurement requirements to the 8(a) program as indefinite quantity type requirements with guaranteed minimum amounts below the applicable 8(a) competitive threshold in order for contracts to be procured on a sole source basis, even though the procurement would likely exceed the applicable competitive threshold during the performance of the contract. Requirements that traditionally were procured through other contract types were being offered and accepted into the 8(a) program as indefinite quantity requirements solely to take advantage of the guaranteed minimum rule. In order to eliminate this potential abuse, SBA proposes to amend its regulations to specify that the competitive threshold requirements would be applied for all types of contracts, including indefinite quantity/delivery contracts, to the Government estimate of the requirement, including options, as identified by the procuring agency. The proposed rule would amend newly redesignated §§124.311(d), (f) and (g) (old §§124.311(e), (h), and (i)) to take into account the proposed change made in §124.308(d)(4) that would permit all eligible Program Participants nationally to submit offers in response to 8(a) competitive solicitations, other than for construction requirements. Proposed redesignated §124.311(g) (old §124.311(i)) would clarify SBA's implementation of §8(a)(1)(C) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(1)(C), which authorizes competitive 8(a) awards in limited circumstances to firms which have completed their terms of participation in the 8(a) program. Of particular note, SBA would specify in the regulations that eligibility would be determined as of the initial date specified for the receipt of offers set forth in the solicitation without regard to extensions of time through amendments to the solicitation. The date for determining eligibility would thus be firmly established and could not change during the procurement process. With such a date certain, firms know up front if their program term will expire prior to that specified date. Offers would not be prepared amid uncertainty that the date for determining eligibility could be changed. As such, firms would not be dissuaded from participating in 8(a) competitive procurements during the later stages of their participation terms. Section 124.317 would be amended to specify that only physical or mental incapacity, and not criminal incarceration or bankruptcy, could be a basis for a waiver of the termination for convenience requirement imposed by this section. In addition, this section would be amended to make clear that the burden is on the concern requesting a waiver to specify the ground(s) upon which the waiver is being sought and to demonstrate that it has met the ground(s). The Agency is not expected to raise every possible basis for waiver and to then dismiss them as not applicable. The proposed rule would add a new §124.319(c). This provision would clarify that SBA may novate one 8(a) Program Participant for another (with the consent of the procuring agency) where the first concern cannot complete performance of an 8(a) contract, without seeking the approval of the Administrator under §124.317. Section 124.321(a) would be amended to clarify that an 8(a) concern seeking to joint venture with another firm must bring something of value to the joint venture arrangement other than its status as an 8(a) concern. While the regulation would continue to state that a joint venture agreement is permissible only where an 8(a) concern lacks the necessary capacity to perform the contract on its own, it would specify for the first time that where the 8(a) concern lacks the management, technical and financial capacity to perform, a joint venture will not be approved. An 8(a) concern may be lacking in one or even two of these areas, but cannot be totally reliant on its proposed joint venture partner. The purpose of permitting joint ventures is to enable an 8(a) firm to gain experience and know-how so that it can become self-reliant in the future. If all an 8(a) concern will gain from the relationship is a profit, without developing its own capabilities in any way, the joint venture will not be approved. Proposed §124.321(c)(3) would clarify that a joint venture can be made up of two or more 8(a) concerns without any one firm receiving at least 51 percent of the net profits earned by the joint venture. In particular, a 50/50 joint venture arrangement between two 8(a) concerns would be expressly authorized, provided the other regulatory requirements were met. The rule would make minor clarification changes in §124.321(d) to recognize the possibility of a joint venture made up of two or more 8(a) concerns. Proposed new §124.321(i) would establish criteria relating to joint ventures for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) set-asides and SDB evaluation preferences. In the past, SBA has held the position that SBA could not establish eligibility criteria relating to joint ventures for the Department of Defense's SDB program. A recent decision by the United States Court of Federal Claims held that ``the power to interpret the term small business concerns .␣.␣. owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals [for purposes of DOD's SDB program] is wholly and exclusively within the sphere of SBA's authority,'' and that ``SBA has both the power and the duty to define the bounds of [that] phrase.'' Y.S.K. Construction Co., Inc. v. United States, No. 93&hyph;738 at 10, 11 (Fed.Cl. Feb. 18, 1994). This proposed rule attempts to implement that authority in a way that is consistent with the purposes of the SDB program. While the rules vary somewhat from those pertaining to joint ventures in the 8(a) program, the developmental purposes of the 8(a) program are not totally consistent with the purposes of the SDB program. In addition, the rule applies the statutory requirement that the ``majority of the earnings of [an SDB contract] directly accrue to [disadvantaged] individuals.'' Pub. L. 99&hyph;661, Sec. 1207(a)(1). Therefore, although an 8(a) concern that is 51 percent owned and controlled by disadvantaged individuals can joint venture with a 100 percent nondisadvantaged concern for a particular 8(a) contract (provided the 8(a) joint venture requirements are met), an SDB concern that is 51 percent owned and controlled by disadvantaged individuals cannot joint venture with a 100 percent nondisadvantaged concern for a particular SDB contract. In such a case, a majority of the earnings of the SDB contract could not accrue directly to disadvantaged individuals. Section 124.501 would be amended by adding a new paragraph ``(c)'' and redesignating current paragraph ``(c)'' as paragraph ``(d).'' The newly established §124.501(c) would require the submission of annual audited financial statements by 8(a) Program Participants.
