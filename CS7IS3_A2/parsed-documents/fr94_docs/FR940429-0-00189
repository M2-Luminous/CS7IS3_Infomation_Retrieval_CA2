FR940429-0-00189 FR940429-0-00015 The Secretary agrees that technical changes are needed to make these regulations conform to the requirements of the State Postsecondary Review Program in 34 CFR part 667, and has decided to provide some further explanation here of the consequences to an institution if the State in which the institution is located does not participate in the State Postsecondary Review Program. Section 494(a) of the HEA prohibits the Secretary from designating as eligible to participate in a Title IV, HEA program any institution seeking initial participation in that Title IV, HEA program, or any participating institution that has undergone a change of ownership resulting in a change of control, as determined under 34 CFR 600.31, if the institution is in a State that does not participate in the State Postsecondary Review Program. The Secretary also is prohibited from designating for initial inclusion in any institution's eligibility for participation a Title IV, HEA programs branch campus located in a State that does not participate in the State Postsecondary Review Program, even if the institution itself is in a State that participates in the State Postsecondary Review Program. Further, the Secretary may grant no more than provisional certification for participation in a Title IV, HEA program to any participating institution or branch campus in a State that does not participate in the State Postsecondary Review Program. Currently, all States participate in the State Postsecondary Review Program. The Secretary does not anticipate that any State will fail to comply with the requirements of the State Postsecondary Review Program to the extent that the State will cease to participate in the program. Nevertheless, the regulations need to incorporate these statutory provisions so that institutions may be aware of the potential consequences of a State's failure to participate in the program. Changes: A new paragraph (e) is added to provide for denial of certification to initial applicants for participation in a Title IV, HEA program and to participants that have undergone a change of ownership resulting in a change of control, if the State in which those applicants or participants are located does not participate in the State Postsecondary Review Program. Under paragraph (e), the Secretary may provisionally certify a participating institution or branch campus in that State. Section 668.13(c)(2)(ii) has also been revised to provide that the provisional certification of an institution under these circumstances expires at the end of the third complete award year following the date of the provisional certification. Comments: Several commenters voiced concern over the proposed language in the regulations that would subject institutions to provisional certification where the financial responsibility and administrative capability was being determined for the first time. Suggestions were made that schools be exempted from this provision if they had been in operation for a number of years without problems being identified concerning their financial condition or administrative capability.
