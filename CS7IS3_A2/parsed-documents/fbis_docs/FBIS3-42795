Bykov: "Siberia and China. Contemporary Geopolitical Realities and Prospects for a `Peaceful Expansion'"] [Text] The maddening glimpses of political figures, the deafening noise of their melee, the depressing setting of our daily round--all taken together leave us neither the time nor the energy to ponder problems that are not of either the day or the minute, but that quite truly exist and require our attention because tomorrow they might become the foremost problems and our main concern. The geopolitical situation of Siberia, which our newspaper has written about repeatedly, is one such "nonapparent" problem at present. The article offered to you considers one of the important facets of this problem--mutual relations between Siberia and China. We will be prepared to continue the discussion of this issue if it is of interest to our readers. The history of the relations between Russia and China is complicated and contradictory. Half a century ago, the leading political science centers of the West began to develop new geopolitical models of the world proceeding from a new global situation (the end of World War II, the spread of communist ideas in Europe, the scientific-technical revolution). For our purposes, it is interesting that the exceptional role of Siberia as a new power center in Eurasia was stressed in all of these models, regardless of their "national affiliation." Views of Siberia Are Very Different.... The prediction that in the decades to come the world would switch from a bipolar arrangement (USSR-United States) to pluralism, to the formation of new power centers, among which China and India would stand out primarily, became commonly recognized in the West beginning in the late 1950's. Thus, Fr. Shternberg stressed that the strategic significance of Siberia would increase sharply as these two states grew stronger. It would help us to know that Western experts predicted most of the problems that the Soviet leadership encountered both in the 1960's and decades later. As early as 1963 the military specialist and geopolitician F.O. Mikshe published an article entitled "Russo-Chinese War" in a German military-economic magazine, in which he sketched the possible theater of military operations and made a prediction for the next 10-15 years which subsequently came true to a considerable degree. While the Soviet leadership affirmed the enslaving specialization of Siberia as a raw material periphery with natural and human resources mercilessly exploited, Western statesmen proceeded from the geopolitical uniqueness of the Siberian region in modelling the future. De Gaulle advanced the concept of creating a third superpower, a "Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals," which presupposed a change in the role of Siberia. In his opinion, the Russians have transcended their geopolitical boundaries by penetrating at one time Siberia, which was populated by "yellow nomads, shamans, and Muslim tribes." For this reason, the Slavs would be unavoidably crowded out of these lands by the Mongols or the Chinese. Socialism was just a short historic episode which changed nothing in the "substance of an eternal Russia," which would return to the West sooner the more it was threatened by China. The need to ensure its security will compel Russia to recall its European kinship. The great reformer of France translated this idea into a plan of specific political actions. This plan called for the withdrawal of the USSR from Asia and the withdrawal of the United States from Europe. The world brought into equilibrium in this manner would rest on three pillars: the European confederation, the Anglo-Saxon complex, and China. In the process, Europe, with a new leader, France, would become the middle link of this "trinity" and, in a way, the center of the world. All of France's foreign policy, including a personal visit to Novosibirsk by de Gaulle, amounted to implementation of this grandiose plan (the development of France's own nuclear weapons, a friendship pact with West Germany, opposition to NATO and the United States, recognition of the role of China, and rapprochement with the USSR). All that remained was to await the struggle between the white and yellow races over Siberia and the Far East which had been predicted not only by de Gaulle but by many political scientists.... In the last decades of the 20th century, history unfolded according to a different scenario. However, this does not at all mean that the thoughts and predictions of the 1950's were groundless. What is happening now? Contradictions between Europe and Asia have abated. Conflicts within Europe and within Asia are mounting. However, under these conditions it is precisely Siberia that is playing the role of "buffer" between them, too. In the process, the plugging of Siberia into worldwide economic processes and the growth of its significance as a source of strategic raw materials and a recipient of capital investment continuously leads the geopoliticians of Japan, China, Korea, and some other Asian countries into the temptation of making statements about the unavoidable more "equitable" redivision of Asia. It is precisely now, in the environment of political, economic, and legal chaos in Russia, with the obvious weakening of state structures and coercive departments, that it is premature to refer to the elimination of the so-called "territorial" issue in mutual relations with China. `Master of Asia?' At present, China is a powerful state with strong central authority. Prices for the most important types of products and raw materials, as well as their production and extraction, are strictly controlled. International experts view China as the most promising region of the world for investment of capital and technology. A raw material crisis is the only problem that hampers this. Despite strict state quotas, 30 percent of capacity is idle because of an electricity shortage alone. As a result, a consumer market has evolved in China, but not a market for the means of production. This is precisely what prompts investors of the world to be oriented toward Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines for now. After this obstacle is surmounted, all the factors favorable for turning China into a superpower will be created. Let us not forget about the traditional human might of the country, which had 100 million unemployed in the early 1990's. It is no exaggeration to say that the market for the means of production is now being created to a considerable degree through the barbaric exports of machinery and raw materials from Russia effected by "business circles" of both countries. One Hundred Ways to the Same Objective Well aware that all territorial claims against Russia cannot be satisfied through the use of force, China began a "peaceful expansion" into the eastern regions of Russia, into Siberia and the Far East. Which forms of penetration have developed? First, the establishment of joint ventures. The overall trends of this process are easy to see in the case of Novosibirsk Oblast. As of 1 December 1993, 32 joint ventures with a total capital of $108,000 and 220,000 rubles [R] were registered here. These insignificant amounts are profoundly meaningful. More than two-thirds of the joint ventures are fictitious; however, even those in operation are questionable. More than 50 percent of them openly designated commercial and brokerage operations as their main line of business. However, other joint ventures registered in the sphere of material production actually engage in trade, having secured the corresponding tax relief. China has displayed an absolute lack of interest in creating research-intensive and educational joint ventures. The only venture in the area of education, Yunfa, which engages in teaching Russian to Chinese students, is on the brink of closure, having failed to secure support from the Chinese side. The size of the contribution made by the foreign party is also instructive: from 32 percent (Sib-Sheg) to 100 percent (Chzhunin). Clearly, the latter cannot be considered a joint venture, but it has been registered precisely as such with all the attendant tax relief. One gets the impression that joint ventures are springing up as outposts for the permanent establishment in Siberia. As has already been said, joint ventures are the first path for peaceful penetration. Second, there is the merchandise expansion of the PRC. The Law on the Protection of Consumer Rights applies solely to legal entities, and then to a strictly defined assortment of goods. Chinese partners use the services of "shuttle traders" in order to save the trouble of having the goods certified. Their operations are planned and controlled by state scientific centers located close to the border. Things carried by a private person are absolutely free of control. Moreover, our import certificates are issued on the basis of safety rather than quality of goods. Therefore, patently poor-quality goods have Russian state certificates. The state has fully renounced the role of guarantor and the responsibility for what its own citizens consume. The scale of this calamity is such that a separate issue might be distinguished, "On the influence of the merchandise expansion of China on the genetic pool and health of the citizens of Russia." Therefore, a consumer market has been formed in Russia which is geared towards China to a considerable degree. Third, let us note the criminal expansion of the PRC. In this instance, reaching a certain quantitative level of Chinese in a given territory is the decisive condition. In oblasts where the number of the Chinese is above the limit sufficient for the creation of their own criminal clan, the Chinese criminal underworld is capable even of engaging in clashes with law enforcement organs. Due to the above geopolitical factors and the new rights of foreign citizens, Siberia has become ideal ground for "dumping" and "laundering" the money of the Chinese mafia. Fourth, we consider it a short-sighted policy to create clustered settlements of PRC citizens, including agrarian. In a number of oblasts they have already encountered the problem of manageability of these ethnic formations. It should be understood that each such settlement is an outpost for future expansion. Fifth, we invite the attention of the readers to the spread of ideas of Oriental religions and the creation of sects emphasizing hostility to the idea of Orthodoxy and the unity of Russia. Ability To Resist How can Siberia, or more precisely Russia, counter the activity of China in the region? The government was not in the habit of familiarizing its own people with either the overall military doctrine or the regional security concept. The "Military Doctrine" that was finally released recently requires legal work.... At one point, intuitive recognition of mounting tension in Asia compelled the Soviet leadership to significantly augment the military presence, primarily that of the missile troops and the air force. However, the strategic measures of the 1960's compensated for the demographic and economic weaknesses of Siberia and the Far East only temporarily. A stagnating, deserted Siberia and an overpopulated China--such has been the reality of recent decades. It is clear that military bases do not guarantee the durability of possessing a given territory in the absence of populated rear areas, well-developed transportation routes, a stable economy, and energy resources. Diplomacy will not help in this instance. In the 1990's, the situation became even more dramatic. A linear surplus of the death rate over the birth rate has turned into an exponential, explosive surplus. The notion of "Siberian health" has been virtually wiped out. The strength of the most productive and fertile age groups is dropping, especially among men. The outflow of the population from Siberia, which is being registered, means the loss of high-quality population with superior educational and professional standards and the "accumulation" of individuals with inferior characteristics. Therefore, we have a demographically exposed Siberia with a continuously deteriorating population structure, with a social infrastructure in crisis, with ethnic variegation, and with an immense, poorly controlled expanse. Is such a Siberia capable of opposing continuous and energetic expansion? Tremendous responsibility for the consequences of a short-sighted and passive policy in the eastern regions of Russia devolves on the local structures of power and the central government of Russia alike. It is precisely to this that we would like to attract the attention of the public in publishing the present article.
