This is what Julius Toth, minister of finance and deputy prime minister, told journalists during a break in the government's meeting today. According to Toth, Slovakia's imports from the Czech Republic are clearly specified, and Slovakia is linked to our western neighbor through several commercial agreements and operations that cannot be abandoned merely because Slovakia is faced with temporary problems. Toth ruled out [the introduction of] the import surcharge. However, he went on to say that the introduction of special checks on the borders [between the Czech Republic and Slovakia], as reported by TA SR [Slovak news agency], is being considered. In the first phase, these checks should concern only foodstuffs. In the second phase, they should cover all goods en bloc.
