Gen. Charlier confirmed the anti-Belgian resentment in Rwanda. However, the Belgian troops will serve again for the United Nations if the need arises, but not under the same conditions. Gen. Charlier was interviewed by Katrin Brahy. [Charlier] I believe that this type of mission will remain essential in the future. The international community cannot ignore situations like that prevailing in Rwanda, Yugoslavia, or Cambodia; it has to be present and reduce the degree of violence in those countries. [Brahy] I assume that if the circumstances so dictate, you would like your mandate to be changed? [Charlier] Exactly. As in any military operation, the means, the mandates, and the conditions of an intervention should be adapted to the actual situation on the spot instead of being subject to the slow UN procedures. For example, the Belgian Government asked on 7 April for a modification to the UNAMIR [UN mission in Rwanda] mandate. It was told that this would take weeks! Thus, some fundamental things certainly must be changed regarding relations between UN Headquarters in New York and the theaters of operations. The rights and conditions for the blue helmets to protect themselves must be adapted to the circumstances.
