Thus, this product of China's will be completely squeezed out of the U.S. market. Before 1988, on the antidumping issue the U.S. Department of Commerce, because China was a country with a centrally planned economy, decided to levy an antidumping tax in line with a standard tax rate, on a Chinese enterprise that was ruled as exporting a commodity in a manner that constituted dumping. After 1988, changes were made in this U.S. policy: Provided that a Chinese import or export company could prove that in a given enterprise, in both law and fact, there did not exist government control, the U.S. Government could, in line with the difference in the export prices of the commodities of different companies, separately lay down different antidumping tax rates. For example, in the May 1991 electro-optical fireworks case and other cases, the U.S. Department of Commerce gave rulings according to separate tax rates. However, after Joseph Spetrini, new acting chief of the International Trade Management Office of the U.S. Department of Commerce, took his post, changes were made in this policy. The signed ruling on this states: "In the investigations and administrative reviews of the past, separate tax rates were always applicable, but the Department of Commerce has not yet differentiated on the basis of ownership and export businesses; state ownerhsip is not a barrier to the obtaining of a separate tax rate by an export company. We have now reconsidered this policy and have decided that it is improper to give separate tax rates to state-owned enterprises. We have determined that an entity owned by the central government cannot be completely divorced from the central government's control, and that state-owned enterprises provide an opportunity for the central government to control prices. Therefore, with regard to future investigative cases and administrative reviews, the Commerce Department will not consider the request of a state-owned enterprise for a separate tax rate." This ruling was filled with extreme discrimination against and unfairness toward China's state-owned trade enterprises, and it also threatened the destiny of China's export commodities on the U.S. market. In this antidumping case, the Metal Products Company under the China National Metals and Minerals Import and Export Corporation engaged lawyers, provided a large amount of evidence, and made a powerful counterplea, as a result of which the original judgement on the antidumping tax rate was much lowered. However, because the U.S. Department of Commerce, without exception, would not give China's state-owned enterprises separate tax rates, this company suffered serious adverse effects. There were two main reasons for the antidumping tax rate on nodular cast iron tubes being as high as 127.38 percent: 1) The U.S. Department of Commerce had demanded that the Chinese Government make a reply on a "standard questionnaire" issued by the department, and the U.S. Government stated that it had not yet received this reply from the Chinese side. 2) In China there are a total of eight companies that export this product to the United States, but with the exception of the China National Metals and Minerals Import and Export Corporation, there was no second company that agreed to act on behalf of the Metal Products Company and make an appeal against America's antidumping action. Therefore, the U.S. Department of Commerce, when a ruling is made, makes use of the so-called "Best Information Available (BIA)," which favors U.S. businessmen (i.e., data provided by U.S. industrial appellants). The antidumping tax rate in the U.S. final ruling was the tax level put forward by the appellant on his first appeal. The trend in this policy of the United States raises new questions for the appeals made by import and export commerce departments of China and its trading companies. At present, China's products that have been the target of U.S. antidumping actions are unsupported and unpermitted products, and their export is lacking in orderly management. Their volume is sharply increasing year by year, and enterprises are competing in exporting them at low prices; but, when there is an antidumping action, no one is willing to personally put up money to appeal the action. U.S. law demands that the length of time for an appeal be set quite strictly, and, therefore, this usually causes the U.S. Department of Commerce to use the BIA for China's export enterprises. The Western countries, including the United States, have always made antidumping a protectionist weapon to limit imports, protect domestic industry, and promote trade. China's export products have become the key targets of the West's antidumping laws. Recently America and the EC carried out an antidumping investigation of more than 20 products exported by China, including color television sets, bicycles, computer diskettes, cast iron tubes, carborundum, shoes, athletic shoes, fluorite, microwave ovens, nitro-formaldehyde, (silicasolucate) [gui er suan 8944 0059 6808], and aldose. Mexico has also made antidumping investigations on more than 4,000 Chinese products in 10 major categories (its export volume is 75 percent of China's export to Mexico). To solve the problem of foreign antidumping actions against our export products, we suggest: First, strengthen the coordination and management of export products and enhance the capability and means for import and export chambers of commerce and other societies for organiaing appeals against antidumping actions. Second, devise ways to penalyze exports at lower than cost, and put a stop to the phenomena of high-price panic buying and low-price competitive selling. Third, set up a fund for appeals against antidumping actions; enterprises that are members of chambers of commerce or other societies every year will pay a certain proportion of their export volume value into the fund. The fund will be used for appeals against antidumping actions as well as for investigation and research. Fourth, the economic relations and trade committees at all levels must attach importance to the problem of foreign antidumping actions against China's export products; and supervise enterprises so that they get a good grip on the prices and volume of export, and, after an antidumping case arises, urge the enterprise to take the initiative in making a timely appeal. Fifth, the relevant government departments must make use of all opportunities and channels, like delegation exchange visits and mixed committee meetings, to negotiate with the governments of Western countries to change their discriminatory practices against China's export products. Levying an antidumping tax on an export product is equivalent to squeezing it out of a foreign market. There are now more than 140 kinds of China's export products on which rulings have been made to levy an antidumping tax. If things go on like this, China's export potential is bound to be adversely affected, and this should draw a high degree of our attention.
