Israeli sources noted that Israel has acceded to the PLO demand to actually make it a paramilitary force, alongside the "blues." In recent days, the PLO leadership has given its permission to reinstate some of the policemen who served under Israel and who quit their jobs during the intifadah. PLO official Ziyad 'Arif met last Saturday in Khan Yunus with those policemen. He told them to be ready to return to service on 15 April and handed them their first salary. The Israeli sources pointed out that this police force will begin operating in the autonomy areas before the Palestine Liberation Army deploys its troops and will work in coordination with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] authorities until the Israeli withdrawal.
