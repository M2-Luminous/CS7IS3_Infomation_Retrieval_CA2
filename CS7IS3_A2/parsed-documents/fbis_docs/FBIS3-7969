The communique states that whenever the international community undertakes concrete steps against the Serbian policy and Serbia, such as the case of downing of four Serbian aircraft in the war in Bosnia, the Belgrade regime increases the police and military repression against the Albanians in Kosova. Alongside the repression, raids, imprisonments, and daily harassments by the Serbian police, yesterday's murder in Hani i Elezit seems to warn the escalation of organized state terror with unprecedented consequences for Kosova and the Balkan region. The LDK Presidency warns the international public that, besides the increase of police forces, movements of considerable military forces that check the unarmed population have recently been observed in Kosova.
