Following his meeting with Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid this afternoon, al-'Attas stated that the issue of reinstating south Yemen will be added to the agenda of the League's ministerial council. He added that he requested the League's support in tackling the Yemeni situation. He noted that his current tour of Arab states aims to discuss the recognition of the new situation in Yemen and returning the situation to what it was before May 1990, the date on which unity was declared between the two sectors of Yemen. Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, member of the Yemeni Socialist Party's political bureau, who attended the meeting, expects several Arab states to recognize the Democratic Republic of Yemen soon. He said Dr. al-'Attas will tour the Gulf states after his visit to Cairo. Al-Dali believes it is unlikely north Yemen will end the ongoing military battles to its advantage. He also denied that south Yemen received military assistance from any Arab or foreign state.
