The article said the DPRK achieved a successful economic progress under the rigorous international situation caused by the intensified campaign of the west to stifle it. The article continued: In the 1987-1993 period, the industrial output rose 1.5 times and the average annual growth rate was 5.6 percent. The wages of factory and office workers, the social security pensions and the scholarships for the university and college students jumped more than 40 percent. The U.S.-led imperialist forces have resorted to economic and diplomatic pressure and military threat in order to isolate and stifle the DPRK. The "nuclear issue" is a typical example. The Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has been reduced to a branch of the U.S. intelligence service, tried to make "a special inspection" of military sites of the DPRK. In Korea, all people are armed and the whole country is fortified. The DPRK Government solemnly declared its withdrawal from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. This unexpected, resolute step totally upset the camp of U.S. imperialism which boasts of being "the only superpower" in the world. In face of the brilliant wisdom, iron will and matchless grit of a great general and the singlehearted unity of the whole Army and the entire people around him, the imperialists' show of power was shattered to smithereens like soap bubbles hitting a rock. In June 1993, the United States was compelled to come out to the negotiating table. The achievements made by the DPRK in the political, economic, military and all other fields serve as a source of confidence and courage for the progressive people of the world and all people anguishing under imperialist oppression.
