We expect the international community to respect all national interests on the territories of the former Yugoslavia and to acknowledge the RSK's sovereignty, along with the right to unite with other Serbian states. We have established that the peace agreement signed in Zagreb is being implemented successfully, Dr. Milan Babic, RSK minister of foreign affairs, said on the occasion of the resumption of the peace talks with Croatia and added the following: "My proposal to the government was -- and it has been accepted -- to hold negotiations on the border crossing between the RSK and the Republic of Croatia in Turanj. The Croatian side also does not want to negotiate in some world capital, because that would involve a great cost and require the engagement of a large number of accompanying services. We may have resumed the talks today, but we adjourned them until after the Easter holidays. We shall offer the Croatian side, as well as the international factors, a list of priority economic and humanitarian issues that will make a more suitable basis for successfully realizing the third round of talks on solving the political issues."
