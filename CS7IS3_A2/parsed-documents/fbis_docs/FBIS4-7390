FBIS4-7390 "dreas083_n_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 2 Apr 1994 Vietnam Anticorruption Campaign Result Reviewed Anticorruption Campaign Result Reviewed BK2804132594 Ho Chi Minh City SAIGON GIAI PHONG in Vietnamese 2 Apr 94 p 2 BK2804132594 Ho Chi Minh City SAIGON GIAI PHONG Vietnamese BFN [Article by Phong Lan: "Carry on the Anticorruption Struggle: New Requirements, Strong Measures"] [Text] The activities of the city people's court in 1993 indicate that although the percentage of corruption cases that have been discovered and brought to trial remains low compared with the actual situation, more severe measures have been taken against corruption cases than before. Topping the list of corruption cases is the "embezzlement of socialist property" category (46 cases that account for 52 percent). A total of 19 cases involving 37 defendants have been brought to trial with one life imprisonment sentence, three 20-year imprisonment sentences, and 22 imprisonment sentences being handed down by the court. The "deliberate attempts to act at variance with state economic management regulations" category often causes serious consequences. There were very few cases that caused losses less than 100 million dong. Furthermore, most of those cases were motivated by personal interests. Therefore, the punitive measures against this kind of crimes is quite strong in nature in many cases, even though violators were state management cadres, they had to serve imprisonment sentences ranging from 10-12 years. Regarding the "embezzlement of socialist property through fraudulent means" and "abuse of power to misappropriate socialist property" categories, the city people's court has brought to trial 14 cases and imposed life imprisonment sentences on five cases and handed down imprisonment sentences of more than 10 years on most of the remaining cases. Only six percent of those who had been tried for these kind of crimes received suspended sentences thanks to the less serious nature of their wrongdoings. As for the "bribe-taking" category, in 1993, the city people's court conducted hearings only on two cases, completed the trial of the case involving the Tan Binh District public security service, and forwarded the case involving Truong Van Nghia of the Inspection Committee on House Sales at Prices Set by the State under the House and Land Service to the city people's organ of control for further investigation. Regarding the six major cases in 1993 corruption cases that the city had reported to the government, the city people's court so far has completed the trial of only four of them, namely the case involving Xacogiva in which Vo Thi Thay,(wife of Pham Cong Tuoc, director of Xacogiva, was sentenced to life imprisonment; the case involving Ho Hoang Nam, who was sentenced to a 20-year imprisonment for having used falsified documents to misappropriate Villa No. 53 on Tran Quoc Thao Street; the case involving an investigation and search team of the Tan Binh District public security service taking a bribe in the form of 116 taels of gold and four Honda motorcycles (four of the accused were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from 15-20 years); and the case involving the director of the Cu Chi District Import-Export Corporation being sentenced to an eight-year imprisonment for his deliberate attempts to act at variance with state economic management regulations. Regarding the remaining two cases involving Sapexim, an import-export joint venture with Cambodia, and the Overseas Vietnamese Services and Import-Export Corporation (Cosevina), the documents have already been forwarded to the city people's court for trial. In addition, another major corruption and smuggling case has also been tried at the preliminary and also final hearing of the Supreme People's Court. The case took place in the city and involved Phan Anh Tuan, former director of the city customs services. Through investigation, the agencies concerned have discovered and clarified the wrongdoings of a number of cadres of the city customs and house and land services. Some Outstanding Problems Concerning Corruption Cases [subhead] The national renovation cause is making its presence felt in all domains of social life. The transition from the economic policy based on the system of bureaucratic centralism and state subsidization to the market-oriented mechanism under state management has recorded marked results. Nonetheless, during this "transitional period," old work styles are not yet been fully overcome whereas new ways of doing things have taken shape but still need to be perfected. In addition, socioeconomic life is still rife with many difficult and complicated problems. Furthermore, violations and crimes, especially corrupt practices, have developed at a fast-breaking and alarming rate on the economic front. The inevitable shortcomings and weaknesses in policies and implementation measures to effect changes in the mechanism have created loopholes for criminal elements to "slip through and perform tricks." Realities indicate that corrupt elements design their own schemes to reach their goals. Yet, they all have one thing in common, namely trying by all means to take advantage of loopholes in policies, laws, and management principles to slip through and carry out criminal activities. Though corrupt practices take place on all economic fronts, they often occur in the banking, trade, import-export, building, transport and communications, and industrial sectors (as many as 80-85 percent of cases involving corruption, attempts to act at variance with state economic management regulations, and bribe-taking occured in the aforementioned areas). Over the past years, more and more "collective crime" phenomena have taken place. There have been cases in which the number of defendants reached dozens of people, including leading cadres (there were 22 defendants in the Thanh Huong Perfume case and 12 defendants, including 10 state officials, in the case involving Phan Anh Tuan). In addition, there have been cases in which different corrupt elements "met one another" at the same trial session. From the starting point at which bribe-giving and bribe-taking are performed, corrupt elements often move to the next step by making deliberate attempts to act at variance with state economic management regulations and by creating conditions for the embezzlement of socialist property (as seen in the cases involving Le Mai Ninh, Truong Ngoc Tai, Trinh Dong Tac, and others). Due to the fact that corrupt practices often take place in areas where there are large amounts of assets, goods, and money and where corrupt elements collude with one another, the degree of seriousness of the losses incurred is very high. According to the statistics released by the Supreme People's Organ of Control, in the 1990-91 two-year period, the losses caused by 980 corruption cases that 31 provinces and cities have initiated legal proceedings against or brought to trial reach nearly 1,000 billion dong. Also noteworthy is the fact that in the recent past, the number of cases involving corruption, bribe-taking, and deliberate attempts to act at variance with state economic management regulations had the participation of private parties. Worse still, in some cases, it was those very private parties who were the masterminds and organizers. Those elements have "employed" the pleasure-seeking psychology of a number of influential cadres to pay the way for their criminal activities. Some Problems That Need To Be Addressed [subhead] The incident involving the loss of nearly 1,000 billion dong due to corruption is a very alarming fact, indeed. Nonetheless, what is more serious is the fact that corruption is now aiming its offensive spearheads directly at our personnel to undermine our party and state policies and lines and hinder our national renovation and development process. Therefore, the anti-corruption struggle constitutes an uncompromising front and calls for many uniform and resolute measures. Regarding trials, the court sector has adopted more severe measures against corruption cases. The enforcement of economic punitive measures against corruption cases must be carried out in a more resolute, thorough, and effective manner to ensure full recovery of lost state property while at the same time eliminating all causes leading to criminal activities. (As for the city alone, so far, only less than 20 percent of lost state property has been recovered). Regarding those corruption cases involving the participation of private parties, it is necessary to study and evaluate correctly the latter's role as well as take appropriate action against them. This move will help reduce the causes leading cadres to get involved in criminal activities. In addition to severe action against violations, it is necessary to formulate an appropriate mechanism to overcome shortcomings in state control over all aspects of social life, especially over targeted economic sectors (because these serve as the most suitable breeding grounds for corruption). At the same time, steps must be taken to build and develop an appropriate and uniform legal system. These moves constitute part of the necessary factors for "destroying down to the root" the causes leading to the birth and growth of corruption. The problem concerning personnel training and cadre assignment is also of great importance and requires that cadres possess both ethics and professionalism in order to undertake their tasks in the new situation.
