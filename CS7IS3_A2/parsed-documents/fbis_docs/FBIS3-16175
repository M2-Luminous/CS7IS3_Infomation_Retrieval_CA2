The state delegations for withdrawal talks voiced the probability during mutual consultations, Andrejevs noted. The next round of talks is scheduled to open Monday in Moscow. As reported, Russia offered Latvia 2 million USD per each year of the operation of the radar after the troop withdrawal is completed. The Latvian counterproposal was 400 million U.S. dollars per year. Chief Russian negotiator Sergei Zotov has no authority to alter the Russian proposal but Latvia also cannot make that large concessions, said Andrejevs. In addition, Andrejevs said that Russia has drafted a timetable for the withdrawal of troops from the Baltic country. The command of Russia's Northwest Army group only needs a signed interstate agreement to start implementation of the timetable, Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh has told Andrejevs. The issue of social guarantees for Russian military pensioners could be tackled jointly with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe experts if the delegations fail to reach an agreement by themselves, the minister said. As reported, Russia has promised to withdraw the remaining troops by Aug. 31 if Latvia allows it keep the radar station for five and a half years.
