Chaired by the URP honorary chairman, Levko Lukyanenko, the sitting considered and coordinated lists of the bloc's candidates in separate Ukrainian regions. Rukh was accused of destructive activity in that some local NRU organizations, in particular the one in Kharkov, in spite of prior arrangement had composed lists of candidates of their own. People's Council Chairman Ivan Zayets brushed aside these accusations saying that this situation was the result of the sluggishness of other organizations who had not made up their mind yet exactly in which districts to nominate their candidates. It was decided to organize regional tours by leaders of the bloc's parties to settle contentious issues locally. The second part of the sitting discussed the name of the bloc and its pre-election slogans.
