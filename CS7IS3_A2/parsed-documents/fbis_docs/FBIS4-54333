Visiting an Air Force fighter wing, he stressed that the Armed Forces can exert all their strength only after winning the people's confidence. Accompanying the Armed Forces' commander-in-chief on his visit to the Air Force unit just four days before his state trip to Russia were Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Yi Yang-ho, Senior Presidential Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Security Chong Chong-uk and Presidential Spokesman Chu Ton-sik, among others. Arriving at the wing headquarters, the president was met by Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Kim Hong-nae. After the wing commander gave a briefing on his missions, Kim emphasized the Air Force's importance to national defense, exhorting both the officers and men to do their utmost in discharging their duties. Explaining about North Korea's severe food and oil shortages and corruption in officialdom, he said, "This is a very dangerous time... I know how important a role the Air Force played and how strong a power it exerted in the Gulf war... I trust you all." While touring a room for stand-by pilots, he personally pushed the scramble bell to see how fast the pilots could take off and then observed a display by F-5E fighters and Apache helicopters. Visiting the wing's maintenance shop, he presented a watch to the shop manager. From the Air Force wing, he boarded a helicopter and flew to an Army infantry division on the central front line to check the division's troops deployed along the front, guided by Army Chief of Staff Gen. Kim Tong-chin. After the Army division, he visited a Naval fleet headquarters to inspect the fleet, guided by Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Kim Hong-yol. After planting a tree in the headquarters compound, President Kim went on board the "Kyongbuk" and posed with sailors for a photograph, then lunched with them in the ship's mess hall.
