The heptanucleotides containing an aliphatic amino group at the 5'-terminal attached in the desoxyuridine 5-position through L-spacers of various length were synthesized according to Zarytova, Komarova, et al. The phase conjugation chromatography (OFKh) pattern of the reaction products after the derivative synthesis and an electrophoresis pattern of the target alkylation products are plotted. The 4-(N-methyl-N-2-chlorethylamino)benzyl radical (RCl) was added with the help of a derivative benzaldehyde reaction with the heptanucleotide amino group. A new type of alkylating derivatives of oligonucleotides which carry the RCl group in the C-5 desoxyuridine radical and ensure a high degree of DNA target modification is produced. U[.sup]LNHRCl[/]CCACTT reagents (L is -CH[.sub]2[/]-, -CH[.sub]2[/]OCH[.sub]2[/]CH[.sub]2[/]-, or -CH[.sub]2[/]NHCOCH[.sub]2[/]CH[.sub]2[/]-) are synthesized and then used to modify the target with an 80-90% effectiveness. The findings show that the third reagent with the L=-CH[.sub]2[/]NHCOCH[.sub]2[/]CH[.sub]2[/]-spacer ensures an almost quantitative modification of the target at one particular point which is usually not observed for oligonucleotide derivatives with the RCl radical attached to the terminal phosphate of ribose's 2',3'-cis-diol group.
