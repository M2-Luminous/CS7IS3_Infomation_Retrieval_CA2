Using a familiar diplomatic formula that it cannot take a stand on the issue because it has not received Moscow's "official" proposal, Paris has clearly shown its restraint in the matter and thus concealed its reluctance to leave the initiative in former Yugoslavia's crisis to Russia. French sources maintain that such a summit would be "premature", alleging that the choice of the countries to attend the summit is debatable. After all their mediating efforts aimed at resolving former Yugoslavia's crisis which have not been very successful so far, the European Union believes that it has every right to attend the summit. French daily Le Figaro refers to Russia's initiative as "spectacular" and goes on to say that its goal is "clear and ambitious" and directed to putting even more emphasis on the "Dalin aspirations to re-establish its status of the indispensable great power." French commentators say Sayosin's undoubtedly successful diplomatic initiative around Sarajevo has enabled Russia "to take its place (?in) the international [word indistinct]," but Moscow, they claim, now insists on "playing the first violin in that orchestra." Last week NATO was ready to launch air strikes in the Sarajevo area, which was in line with the ultimatum set to warring sides in Bosnia, requesting them to demilitarize Sarajevo. However, the ultimatum practically referred only to Bosnian Serbs. Moscow, which severely critized the ultimatum set by the Western military alliance, guaranteed to Bosnian Serbs that Russian peacekeepers would be located in a buffer zone between Bosnian Serbs and Moslems in the Sarajevo area. It was only after they received these guarantees that the Bosnian Serbs pulled back their artillery.
