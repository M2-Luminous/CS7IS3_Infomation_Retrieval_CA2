And it is continuing: the solidarity surcharge as of 1995, the petroleum tax as of 1996. Where else do you want to cash in? [Waigel] It is true that we have reached the climax of the tax quota, and the overall burden must not rise any further. By the way: I have never talked about the petroleum tax. [Oppermann] Thus, there will not be any additional burdens on car owners? [Waigel] It was clear from the very start that the railroad reform would produce deficits that must be covered. The raising of the petroleum tax in January was a first step toward paying the debts of the railroads. I do not accept that, despite the privatization of the railroads, there will still be an 8-billion-mark [DM] deficit each year as of 1996. Here the transportation politicians must make proposals to cover this deficit. For instance, one could think of privatizing the highway net. But this is possible only if fees can be levied for private road construction. This is the point. [Oppermann] Fees for using roads instead of higher petroleum taxes? [Waigel] I do not commit myself to that. The proposals must come from the transportation politicians. On the other hand, I have always taken care that taxes also have a guiding function in the spirit of environmental protection. [Oppermann] Thus, the only way that remains is once again putting your hands into the taxpayers' pockets? [Waigel] Right after reunification many people who now criticize me advised me to raise taxes. There would be readiness to make sacrifices for a national task, they said. This was one of the biggest lies of life that have been repeatedly invented in Germany. There has never been any such solidarity. Man makes sacrifices only if his own existence, his own job is at stake. [Oppermann] There are also other tax sources that you could tap much more strongly than in the past. Inheritances, for instance. [Waigel] I warn against tapping inheritance taxes as a source of income. The people would consider this as cold expropriation. [Oppermann] There will be no raising of the inheritance taxes with you? [Waigel] I have always said that we need a differentiated, constitutional adjustment of the basic values, which date back to 1964.... [Oppermann] ...which automatically means higher inheritance taxes.... [Waigel] ...not necessarily. This depends on the tax credits and the rate of taxation that would be valid then. Raising inheritance taxes would have disastrous effects on medium-sized companies, in trade, and in agriculture. [Oppermann] And what have been the results of taxes on interests? Are you happy with that? [Waigel] No one asks whether the finance minister is happy. Here, too -- as I feared -- there was capital flight.... [Oppermann] ...with the help of the bank, which advised you for the draft. [Waigel] Everyone tries to make a profit -- also the state banks, allegedly because otherwise they would suffer disadvantages in competition. Even though a large amount of the money is coming back to Germany via investment funds, the topic of tax flight is so unpleasant that we must find a European settlement with the inclusion of some OECD states, such as Switzerland. During the second half of 1994, when we take over the presidency of the European Union, I will turn this into a focal issue. [Oppermann] You want to put an end to Luxembourg as a paradise for capital flight? [Waigel] Quite certainly. Luxembourg must come to understand that, in the end, nobody benefits from that. [Oppermann] Tax on interests does not yield what you have hoped. You need money and you must save. The state quota is 50 percent, in 1989 it was only 45 percent. How is it supposed to go down? [Waigel] In 2000 we want to be back at the level of 1989, that is, the year before unification. The state's share in the people's income has not been raised just out of fun or because of a policy of excessive expenditures but because an entire national economy was grafted onto ours. After the transformation of the eastern state economy into a private economy and through consolidation and limitation of expenditures -- the federal budget must not grow more quickly than the GNP, that is, it may increase by 3 percent at the most -- the state quota will go down again. [Oppermann] Why do you not tackle subsidies and abolish, for instance, half of the subsidies for the coal mines? [Waigel] I admit that more should have been done regarding the reduction of subsidies because of economic reasons and that too much time has been taken and too many social considerations were made. If North Rhine-Westphalia had had the same amount of money available for restructuring instead of for coal, everyone would probably be better off. Coal subsidies remain on the agenda. Displeasure is growing in the Bundestag. The southern laender no longer have any understanding for the special role of North Rhine-Westphalian coal mining and already last year they wanted to abolish the coal pfennig. The eastern laender do not understand why their mines are restructured with small financial subsidies while those in the west get billions. [Oppermann] And what about the billions in subsidies to industry? [Waigel] Just a moment. In the west we have reduced financial subsidies by one-quarter. The total of subsidies have increased only because we are spending more in the east to guarantee economic reconstruction. [Oppermann] Does Germany not urgently need further reductions of the interest rates to get out of the economic crisis? [Waigel] Reductions of the interest rate must be achieved by hard work. This is possible only if the public sector does not use the capital market so much. In 1995 we will have a year of consolidation, in which the raising of loans on the capital market will go down by one-third. This is a decisive step to safeguard the stability and the exchange rate of the German mark. The course set by financial policy and the moderate wage agreements give the Bundesbank leeway for lowering the interest rates.
