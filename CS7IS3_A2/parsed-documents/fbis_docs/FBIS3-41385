The EDU is the first step in the creation of a European Police Office--Europol--which will be a central coordinating body for the exchange and analysis of intelligence on all forms of serious crime. The EDU and Europol will not have any operational powers. Home Secretary Michael Howard hailed the move as a success for European police cooperation. He Said: [subhead] "The drugs problem is an international one, and needs to be tackled at an international level.'' "Criminals show no respect whatever for the frontiers between countries, and our efforts must be directed to the widest possible fields of cooperation.'' "The EDU is a sign of Member States' determination to cooperate closely and effectively crack down on the growing menace of drug trafficking and organised crime in Europe.'' "I believe that Europol can play an important role in providing information to assist national police and customs services in tracking down and arresting the criminals involved in these activities.'' "The Drugs Unit is an encouraging start. We have two liaison officers in post, from the police and customs services who will be linked into the UK via the National Criminal Intelligence Service." The EDU Will: [subhead] -- exchange and analyse intelligence on drug trafficking and money laundering in the European Union and the criminal organisations involved in these activities -- give national law enforcement agencies a wider, more coordinated view of these activities across all Member States -- help these agencies target their action more effectively against drug traffickers and other criminals involved in serious organised crime. National liaison officers have been posted to The Hague from all Member States . Each Member State must set up a unit to act as a two-way link for the exchange of information between EDU and its own police and customs services. In the UK this will be the National Criminal Intelligence Service. Europol was first proposed in 1991 by Chancellor Kohl. An existing UK-led initiative for a European Drugs Intelligence Unit was absorbed into the proposal. Europol will be established on the basis of a full Convention signed and ratified by all Member states. The draft Convention is currently under negotiation, and a deadline for completion has been set for October 1994 by the European Council. Notes To Editors [subhead] 1. The EDU was formally opened in the Hague by Dutch Justice Minister Mr Hirsch Ballin and Interior Minister Mr van Thijn. 2. The EDU will operate under the terms of a Ministerial Agreement signed by EU Interior and Justice Minsters in Copenhagen on 2 June 1993. Within the EDU the treatment of information will be governed by Member States' own national data protection legislation. 3. Europol will be an intergovernmental organisation within the framework of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union. Work towards its establishment is the responsibility of an intergovernmental working group under Title VI, which reports to the Council of Interior and Justice Ministers. The European Council has set a deadline of October 1994 for completion of the Europol Convention. 4. Formal interviews for the senior management of EDU will take place in Brussels on 22 February. Ministers of the Interior and Justice will consider recommendations on 23 March. The UK will be bidding for one of the three posts. 5. The national liaison officers will work under the interim management of Mr Storbeck of Germany, and Colonel Bruggeman of Belgium.
