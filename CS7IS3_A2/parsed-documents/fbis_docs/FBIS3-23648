What is more, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov has already managed to visit both Kiev and Moscow and to make quite a few ambiguous statements. It's not an exaggeration to say that each of his words have been heeded, first of all, because he spoke about the Crimea --"the peninsula of discord". The nature of the contradictions there have long ago exceeded the bounds of the diplomatic. It's no secret for anyone that there are men and equipment on the peninsula that are capable of resolving the dispute, alas, not only in words. And the "sortings out" of late are a sufficiently convincing confirmation of that. Analysts warned that arms could start "talking" already during the course of the election campaign. That was the kind of picture that was drawn. And although fortunately the gloomiest predictions were not realized, a potentially explosive situation remains on the peninsula. The Crimea is becoming increasingly saturated with Ukrainian troops, weapons, and armed formations. The following facts attest to that. A more than 650-man Ukrainian naval infantry battalion has been deployed near Sevastopol (that, as we know, is the Black Sea Fleet's primary naval base) near the village of Tylovoye. It has up to 40 BTR-70's [armored transport vehicles], 120-mm mortars, mount-type antitank grenade launchers, and portable surface-to-air missile systems in its inventory. Even though it is called a naval infantry battalion, this formation has an imaginary tie to the sea. No one is undergoing naval training here. In fact, it is not even being tasked with that mission. And the servicemen are first and foremost being trained based upon the spetsnaz [special forces] program. It is also remarkable that the battalion has been manned primarily with conscripts from Western Ukraine. Incidentally, these "naval infantrymen" have already displayed a curt disposition with regard to the local population on more than one occasion and have completely lived up to their sleeve emblems in the form of a gray predator-wolf. A mechanized brigade is located in the area of Perevalnyy, northeast of the main Black Sea Fleet base. It consists of two mechanized infantry battalions, two tank battalions, and artillery, antitank and air defense battalions. The authorized strength is 1,800 men. But today there are actually 2,100 men. For comparison: The Black Sea Fleet naval infantry brigade, which recently appointed Ukrainian Navy Chief of Staff Rear-Admiral Aleksey Ryzhenko called a "foreign formation", is actually much smaller in strength. A full-fledged spetsnaz [special forces] brigade that is training saboteurs has been deployed in Staryy Krym [Old Crimea] (the western portion of the peninsula). It numbers approximately 900 men. The brigade is organizationally part of the 32nd Army Corps which is currently commanded by Major-General Aleksandr Kuzmuk who came here from the Carpathian Military District. A 350-man traffic control service battalion has been deployed within the city limits of Sevastopol itself. There are approximately 15 BTR's in its inventory. This battalion, like the one located in Tylovoye, is continuously growing and being augmented by equipment which, according to some data, is arriving from a storage base near Dzhankoy. A patrol-postal service regiment is also deployed here. Its commander is Aleksandr Kostyukov. The regiment, just like yeast, literally grew from a recent battalion. Incidentally, the famous "Berkut" [golden eagle] subunit has also become a part of it. Right now it is small -- 15 men, but we anticipate that it will be brought up to a company strength of 60 troops. A Ukrainian Armed Forces PVO [Air Defense] regiment with the well-equipped Belbek airfield is located to the north of Sevastopol. It can receive any aircraft, including reserved [liternyy] aircraft. The regiment itself has Su-27 fighter-interceptors in its inventory. Incidentally, fully-graded emplacements were recently dug at Belbek. It's possible that someone has undertaken to prove the need for these and other units and large formations on the peninsula. As we know, you can find the advisability in everything. Let's note only that in the recent past they planned to reduce the Ukrainian armed forces on the peninsula. Meanwhile, the strength of the Ukrainian Armed Forces formation has increased from 15,000-18,000 to 51,000 men during the last 1-2 years. It is curious that Ukrainian Minister of Defense General of the Army Vitaliy Radetskiy responded with the following to Yuriy Meshkov's statement on the initiation of demilitarization of the Crimea precisely from the withdrawal of Ukrainian units: He said that this issue is not within Meshkov's competence. Therefore, it seems the opposite reaction has also not been excluded -- not demilitarization but a further, drastic reinforcement of the Ukrainian troop formation in the Crimea. One spark is sufficient to start this "mechanism". And it's good that the verbal attempts of Rukh [Popular Movement of the Ukraine] leaders (we must recall at least Aleksandr Lavrinovich's recent statement that the results of the elections are a step toward the initiation of a confrontation in the Crimea and in Ukraine), and that also the threats of certain representatives of official Kiev and the leaders of the Crimean Tatars' mejlis to begin the countdown toward a new cycle of tension have not been carried out. Predictions with regard to a nearly automatic annulment of the results of the presidential elections in the Republic of the Crimea by Leonid Kravchuk and also the shipment of a "punishing expedition of the Ukrainian Army" to the "disobedient" peninsula have also not been confirmed. The events of recent weeks in the Crimea have occurred under the banner of the widely known but somewhat differently interpreted sentence in reality: "Everything flows but nothing changes". The experience of recent years, when the replacements of some political leaders by others or some reformers by others have introduced practically nothing, indicates that we have become accustomed to the replacement of the decorations in the "political theater" and that we can already relate quite calmly to them. That calm in the Crimea can, at first glance, appear to be strange. But political tension did not erupt immediately here once again for several reasons. We think that one of the main ones is that this is an attempt of certain prestigious experts to prevent the possible development of the situation. It is clear, even to a devil-may-care person, that warnings about careless steps that could simply transform the Crimea into a "hot spot" similar to Karabakh would have to take effect. One more reason is Kiev's unexpected reaction, for some people, to the events in the Crimea. It becomes quite understandable if you look intently at the internal problems of Ukraine itself. The Republic of Crimea's independence attempt is already not that original. If you recall, Donetsk Oblast was the first to set out on that path. And the principle of "don't shake up" is not the most appropriate with regard to people who are striving for a better life. It seems that they understood that in Kiev. Furthermore, there are also concerns that are somewhat more important than the Crimean presidency -- elections to the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet. Today the distribution is as follows: Here for the time being no one can provide guarantees that events will not follow the "Belarus scenario". The population of Ukraine is now judging its leaders based upon specific matters. And there aren't many of them... It is no accident that Ukrainian Parliament Speaker Ivan Plyushch said that if Yuriy Meshkov manages to do anything at all for the residents of the Crimea, he will "be green with envy of him". A very important reason for the relative calm in the Crimea is the fact that the political activity of the residents of the Crimea, who invested the last, so to speak, political forces in the elections of their president, has "petered out". It's as if the peninsula's population has become frozen in anticipation, having dwelled for the time being on one, let's state it frankly, "delicate" question: Where do we go from here? But meanwhile Meshkov himself, -- and we need to admit this -- has become involved, in the opinion of many people, in a hopeful political game with quite a deceptive economic result. At least his first steps on the political scene did not give trump cards to the radicals from both camps. The meeting in Kiev and the constructively conducted negotiations in Moscow open quite real prospects to the Crimea. And, if nothing interferes, the "unsettled peninsula" could become a unique bridge for the establishment of closer economic cooperation of the two states. Partial support on the Russian ruble is a more than obvious advantage for the people of Crimea themselves. And the main aspect. We all know: Weapons are quiet where money "works" and where a mutual economic interest is being realized. In a word, there aren't grounds to incite passions for no reason but still it is impossible not to state the obvious. The Ukrainian nationalistic wing that finally lost in the Crimea and part of the Crimean Tatars will hardly reconcile themselves to defeat and will stand in fierce opposition to the president. At a low level of general and political culture, it is quite probable that this confrontation will be far from constructive. This will certainly add to Yuriy Meshkov's problems since it will be easy to find inadequacies in his first steps, especially while considering the inheritance he received. We can predict with a slight margin of error that the opposition will throw "its" mass media into the struggle with Meshkov and will attempt to utilize its ties with Ukraine's supreme authorities. In a word, today the residents of Crimea should in no way succumb to euphoria. They must understand that rapid changes are simply impossible. The hottest heads are still attempting to accelerate the process. Neither the methods nor the consequences are important. A blockaded Sevastopol and Black Sea Fleet with their "oxygen cut off" in all directions will appear on the maps. Red and blue lines will appear -- the axes of someone's proposed strikes... But nothing better will become of this for anyone. Therefore, the highest responsibility, thoughtfulness and care in making decisions and the ability to resort to compromises are required from the politicians and from the leaders of various levels, including of the military departments. We need to finally understand that we should in no way cut the Crimean knot. We need to patiently and painstakingly untie it.
