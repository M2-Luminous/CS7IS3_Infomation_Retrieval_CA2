FR940302-0-00030 FR940302-0-00015 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AB75 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Determination of Endangered Status for the Plant Auerodendron Pauciflorum AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Service determines Auerodendron pauciflorum (no common name) to be an endangered species pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended. This evergreen shrub is endemic to Puerto Rico, where only 10 individuals are known to exist in the limestone hills of Isabela in the northwestern part of the island. The primary threat to the species is habitat destruction from development. This final rule will implement the Act's protection and recovery provisions for Auerodendron pauciflorum. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: The complete file for this rule is available for inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours, at the Caribbean Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 491, Boquer√≥n, Puerto Rico 00622; and at the Service's Southeast Regional Office, 1875 Century Boulevard, Atlanta, Georgia 30345. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Susan Silander at the Caribbean Field Office address (809/851&hyph;7297) or Mr. Dave Flemming at the Atlanta Regional Office address (404/679&hyph;7096). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Auerodendron pauciflorum was first discovered by Mr. Roy Woodbury in 1976 in the limestone hills of Isabela in northwestern Puerto Rico. It was later described by Alain Liogier in 1982. This was also the first record of this genus in Puerto Rico. Auerodendron pauciflorum is an evergreen shrub or small tree which may reach up to 5 meters in height. The leaves are opposite or subopposite, ovate to ovate-elliptic, 6 to 15 centimeters long and 3.5 to 6 centimeters wide, glabrous, and with minute black glandular dots. Paired ovate-triangular, ciliate stipules, 1.5 millimeters long, are present at the base of the petiole. The peduncles vary from 5 to 7 millimeters in length. Two to three flowers are borne in the leaf axils. The calyx tube is broadly campanulate, 2 millimeters long and 3 millimeters wide. The fruit is unknown at the present time (Proctor 1991). Auerodendron pauciflorum is restricted to the semi-evergreen forests (subtropical moist forest life zone) of the limestone hills of Isabela in northwestern Puerto Rico at elevations of less than 100 meters. Only 10 individual plants are known from the edges of these limestone cliffs (Proctor 1991). Hills in the area were destroyed for the construction of the existing Highway 2. The area is privately owned and presently under intense pressure for rural, urban and tourist development. The construction of a resort development, including 7 hotels, 5 golf courses, 36 tennis courts and 1,300 housing units is proposed for the area. Auerodendron pauciflorum was included as a Category 1 species (species for which the Service has substantial information supporting the appropriateness of proposing to list them as endangered or threatened) in the February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6184) notice of review. A proposal to list Auerodendron pauciflorum as endangered was published on March 18, 1993 (58 FR 14541).
