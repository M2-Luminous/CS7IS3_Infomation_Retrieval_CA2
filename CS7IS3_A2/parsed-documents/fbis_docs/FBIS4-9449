The first issue of the magazine, a bi-monthly which already appears in EU member states and is a forum for debate about EU issues in all spheres, comes out in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary in their national languages for the first time today. Reflecting upon the reasons which have prevented Europe from becoming a continent of peace, cooperation and equal chances for all and from establishing the feelings of certainty, trust and peace after the fall of communism, Havel says that the dramatic changes of the past years and the resurfacing of spectres of the past challenge some not much direct and sometimes cheap optimistic concepts. But Havel says he still believes there is a chance for Europe to gradually become a large community based on the principle of "unity in diversity." It is natural that there are also skeptical moods and disappointment over the pace of changes and that the new democracies even feel "abandoned" by the others, he says. In conclusion, Havel stresses that he personally supports European integration which he sees as the only road not only for Europe, but for the whole of the world. Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec says in an interview for the magazine that Europe would not be complete without the Czech Republic. He points out that Europe has been living together with the other nations (now EU members) for centuries. "I do not think that Germany should be Europe's border," he says. Zieleniec says that European integration is sometimes viewed as a historical opportunity to build Czech-German relations, which have always been close, but from time to time tragical, on new bases as was the case of other small nations such as the Netherlands and Belgium. The Czech Republic's integration into the EU together with free movement of people and capital could make a full stop after some problems at last. "Both countries have re-evaluated their own history and searched for a new future," Zieleniec stresses. He says that the Partnership for Peace plan is much more interesting from the political than military point of view. Zieleniec says that it would not matter if the Czech Republic was the first Central European country admitted into NATO, but it does not want to be left alone. "It is in our best interests that our neighbours be in the same military bloc as we. It would be unfortunate if Slovakia, Austria or any-one else became part of another security grouping than we," Zieleniec stresses.
