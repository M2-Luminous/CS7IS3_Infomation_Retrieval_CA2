The latest measure to keep the market in order will be the promulgation of a decree aimed at curbing excessive profits gained through unfair means. This would add to the existing laws and codes aimed at consumer protection. "But these existing laws were not easily enforced because they are far too general and abstract. What's more, few of them address the new realities of the market economy because they were made when the State controlled the prices of most commodities," said Kuai Ming, of the State Planning Commission, which drafted the decree. "The decree will be one that suits the market economy. The first draft of the regulation has been completed and the formal version is expected to go into effect around July." The decree is being prepared against a background of continuous price hikes. In February, the price index of consumer goods in 35 cities rose 25.9 per cent over the same period last year. And in January and February, growth of the retail sales index across the country was 3 per cent higher than over the same period last year. Such rapid price rises have lowered the living standards of workers in loss-making firms, as well as hitting retired people, students and farmers in poverty-stricken areas. The imminent decree is just the latest in a series of government moves to regulate market prices. The State Council has previously urged strict control of the scale and growth of investment in fixed assets. It has also sought increased commodity supply, strengthened price management and the establishment of a risk fund for growing grain and other foods. A watchdog will be established to monitor the prices of over 20 daily necessities and basic services. Regulations on labelling have also been issued. "The government has decided to relax controls on consumer goods, allowing them to be priced according to market demands. But this does not mean the government should let prices go adrift," said Jiang Runyu, from the former State Administration of Commodity Prices, which was recently merged with the State Planning Commission. The government needs to maintain overall macro-control of the market, he said. Speaking at a meeting earlier this month, Chen Jinhua, Minister of the State Planning Commission, said the government should adopt new measures to prevent unlimited price rises and drastic fluctuations, while at the same time preserving the vitality of the market. "The State should take legislative, economic and if necessary, administrative measures to stabilize market prices," said Jiang. The socialist market economy now taking shape is far from perfect and the market pricing system needs standardizing. Besides, the consumers themselves are not mature and don't know how to protect their interests. Dealers often arbitrarily and unreasonably raise their prices-- and that seldom occurs in a mature market economy, he said. In February, vegetable prices in 35 cities rocketed by 53.5 per cent. In Beijing, the price rise was even higher. Many former State-subsidized vegetable stores in the city turned to other businesses when their subsidies were abolished. The business volume of the State-run vegetable shops now only accounts for 10 to 15 per cent of the total market. The market has now been collared by private traders. According to the PEOPLE's DAILY, the retail price of vegetables used to be only 10 to 20 per cent higher than the wholesale price. But in spring this year, vegetables were selling on the street for twice the wholesale price. In many cases, the prices hikes were due to vegetables being sold by one retailer to another before reaching customers. Vegetable producers and transporters benefited little from the price hike, while vegetable wholesalers and retailers gained and the customers suffered. "In the West, a profit margin of 30 per cent is considered very high," said Kuai. To further illustrate arbitrary pricing, Kuai cited an example from the fashion business. Some new and renovated department stores in downtown areas sell 100-yuan ($11.5) garments at 1,000 yuan ($115). Stores also charge high fees for renting their counters. They set a bad example to other stores, inciting them to also impose high prices, which results in an inflated market. "They expect to recover their investment in too short a time and they shift the burden to customers--it's not right," Kuai said. Kuai said he once spotted a book priced at 180 yuan ($21) in the Lufthansa Shopping Centre. Yet in State-run bookstores, the same book could be bought for only 45 yuan ($5). Kuai dismissed such arbitrary pricing as incomprehensible and deemed the practice as rank profiteering. The excessive profits gained through unethical measures will be curtailed when the new decree comes into effect, he said. "At present, we are soliciting opinions on the draft from localities so the decree can reflect the demands of different regions," Kuai said. He hopes the decree will help the healthy development of the market economy and that it will be improved by amendments. According to Kuai, the forthcoming decree is in many ways similar to "the Temporary Code against Price Cheating and Excessive Profits" that was issued in Shanghai earlier this month. The Shanghai code stipulates that dealers should not sell shoddy products, short-measure, or cheat customers through dishonest advertising and deceptive labelling. Neither should dealers spread false market information or force customers into buying. According to the decree, profit margins must be in line with general price standards on any given commodity. The "proper" standards are decided by the local price administration departments. Those who violate the decree face fines. And their illegal profits must be returned to customers or confiscated.
