The summit's final communique restricted itself to inviting the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] command in Bosnia to "urgently draw up plans to ensure the rotation of the UN forces at Srebrenica and to examine how to reopen the airport at Tuzla," without referring to military action that NATO might undertake to achieve these goals. The document reiterated last August's reference to air strikes that may be undertaken by NATO -- at the request of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali -- to prevent the "strangulation" of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo and the other Muslim safe areas in the former Yugoslav republic. Reports from Sarajevo said Serb bombardments had ceased this morning after the newly raised NATO threat of air strikes in Bosnia.
