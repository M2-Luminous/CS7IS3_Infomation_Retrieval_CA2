Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the rear engine mount struts, which could subsequently result in reduced structural integrity of the nacelle and engine support structure, accomplish the following: (a) Within 50 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, perform a visual inspection to detect cracking in the rear engine mount struts, part number (P/N) 87110016&hyph;003, in accordance with Canadair Alert Service Bulletin 215&hyph;A3040, dated September 2, 1992. (1) If no cracking is detected, repeat the visual inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 50 hours time-in-service, until the requirements of paragraph (b) of this AD are accomplished. (2) If any cracking is detected, prior to further flight, replace the engine rear mount strut with a new strut, P/N 87110016&hyph;009 or -011, in accordance with the service bulletin. (b) Within 2 years after the effective date of this AD, replace all engine rear mount struts, with new struts, P/N 87110016&hyph;009 or -011, in accordance with Canadair Alert Service Bulletin 215&hyph;A3040, dated September 2, 1992. Such replacement constitutes terminating action for the inspections required by this AD. (c) As of the effective date of this AD, no person shall install a rear engine mount strut, P/N 87110016&hyph;003, on any airplane. (d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, New York Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, New York ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the New York ACO. (e) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (f) The inspections and replacement shall be done in accordance with Canadair Alert Service Bulletin 215&hyph;A3040 dated September 2, 1992.
