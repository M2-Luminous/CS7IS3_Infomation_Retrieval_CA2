This document also contains a technical amendment to the final regulations under section 2702 pertaining to short taxable years of trusts. Changes to the applicable law were made by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (the 1990 Act). The final regulations provide needed guidance for taxpayers to comply with the 1990 Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act The collection-of-information requirements contained in the final regulations under sections 2701(e)(6) and 2702 have been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under control number 1545&hyph;1273. The estimated average annual burden per recordkeeper attributable to these final regulations is two minutes.

Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be sent to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503. Background Proposed Regulations Proposed ยง25.2701&hyph;5 (relating to adjustments to mitigate double taxation) was published in the Federal Register on February 4, 1992. This document adopts final regulations under ยง25.2701&hyph;5. Mitigation of Effects of Double Taxation Section 2701 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) provides special valuation rules to determine the amount of the gift when an individual transfers an equity interest in a corporation or partnership to a member of the individual's family. For section 2701 to apply, the transferor or an applicable family member must, immediately after the transfer, hold an equity interest having liquidation rights or distribution rights that are preferential to the rights of the transferred interest (an applicable retained interest). If section 2701 applies to a transfer, the amount of the transferor's gift is determined using a subtraction method of valuation. Generally, in determining the value of any applicable retained interest held by the transferor or an applicable family member, liquidation rights and certain distribution rights in a controlled entity are valued at zero. Section 2701(e)(6) provides that if there is a subsequent transfer or inclusion in the gross estate of any applicable retained interest that was valued under the rules of section 2701, appropriate adjustments are to be made, pursuant to regulations, to reflect the increase in the amount of any prior taxable gift made by the transferor or decedent by reason of such valuation.
