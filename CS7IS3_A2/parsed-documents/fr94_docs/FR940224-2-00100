FR940224-2-00100 FR940224-2-00057 Background On November 8, 1993, the Department of the Interior received a ``petition'' to certify the People's Republic of China and Taiwan under the Pelly Amendment to the Fishermen's Protective Act for undermining the effectiveness of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is the agency responsible for the implementation of CITES in the United States. Both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan were previously certified by the Secretary under the Pelly Amendment on September 7, 1993 for undermining the effectiveness of CITES for trade in rhinoceros and tiger parts and products. The November 8, 1993 letter requesting certification was submitted by the following organizations: Environmental Investigation Agency, Earth Island Institute, Animal Welfare Institute, Society for Animal Protective Legislation, Defenders of Wildlife, International Primate Protection League, and World Society for the Protection of Animals. The letter provided information on the alleged illegal international trade by nationals of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan in the following species: Asiatic black bears, Asian brown bears, Malayan sun bears, sloth bears, clouded leopards, leopards, snow leopards, gibbons, and orangutans. Although the November 8 letter focusses on the certification of China and Taiwan, international trade in other countries with respect to these species is also alleged in the materials appended to the letter. Public comment is requested on the international trade in each of these species, including, but not limited to, trade by nationals of the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, and other countries mentioned in the appended materials. The Service has reviewed and analyzed this supplemental data, in combination with other information in the Service's files on trade in the species mentioned in the November 8 letter (Asiatic black bears, Asian brown bears, Malayan sun bears, sloth bears, clouded leopards, leopards, snow leopards, gibbons, and orangutans). All of the species mentioned in the letter are listed in CITES Appendix I, and are therefore considered to be species threatened with extinction which are or may be affected by trade, among other factors. Because the species are listed in Appendix I, any primarily commercial trade in these species is generally in violation of the Convention. The letter provided information to support the allegation that illegal trade is continuing in specimens of these species, particularly involving nationals of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. The Service is aware that habitat loss and fragmentation is a major factor threatening these and many other endangered species. In addition, and in the context of the Pelly Amendment, the supplemental information alleges that these species are also threatened with extinction by international trade, either as live animals or as parts and products. All of these species have declined significantly in recent years, with some populations entirely extirpated and others on the verge of extinction. The November 8 letter provides detailed information on both the internal and international trade in parts and products of these species, involving nationals of both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. The letter provides information alleging that these species are threatened with extinction by the following types of international trade, either as live animals or as parts and products: Bears: Asian brown bears ( Ursus arctos ), Asiatic black bears ( Selenarctos thibetanus ), Malayan sun bears ( Helarctos malayanus ), sloth bears ( Melursus ursinus ): The trade in their gall bladders and extracted bile for use in traditional Chinese medicines is a major threat to the survival of these bear species, combined with the trade in paws, liver, fat, and meat as a gourmet delicacy. Malayan sun bears are believed to be traded as pets as well. Leopards: Clouded leopards ( Neofelis nebulosa ) are poached and traded illegally mostly for their skins, although some use in traditional Chinese medicine is reported. Leopards ( Panthera pardus ), particularly the Amur leopard ( Panthera p. orientalis ), and snow leopards ( Panthera uncia ), are poached and traded illegally for their skin, bones, and other parts; their bones are used for the Chinese medicinal market. Supplemental information is provided on both the internal and international trade in leopard parts and products, involving nationals of both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. Primates: Gibbons ( Hylobates spp. ) are traded illegally mostly as pets, particularly to Taiwan. Limited supplemental information is provided on the trade in gibbons for traditional medicine markets as well. Orangutans ( Pongo pygmaeus ) are traded illegally as pets, particularly to Taiwan. The information included in the November 8 letter does not explain the degree to which the alleged biological injury posed to these CITES species is properly attributable to trade. Public comment is specifically sought on the existence of a causal connection between trade and alleged adverse effects posed to the CITES species discussed in the November 8 letter.
