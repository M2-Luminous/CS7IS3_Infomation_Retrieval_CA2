The ceremony took place in the diplomatic lounge of the National Palace. Jean Luckenson reports: [Luckenson] The big rendezvous on the afternoon of Monday, 16 May, a few minutes before 1600 was at the diplomatic lounge of the National Palace where attorney Emile Jonassaint, provisional president of the Republic, was to present his six-point government plan. He gave each of the ministers of his cabinet a document symbolizing their commitment -- or their taking office. The six major, priority, points of the Jonassaint government are: to eradicate criminality; to guarantee safety and peace in the nation's homes; to enforce Justice; to halt the boat people phenomenon; to lower the cost of living; and to increase the public revenues. Jonassaint did not forget the students who will take baccalaureat exams this year, nor the arrangements he will set up for the electoral deadlines. [Jonassaint] I have identified six essential priorities for a program of action. The first will have to do with buttressing order and security in Haiti within respect for the fundamental rights of the citizens. Concerned with eradicating criminality in Haiti and thereby establishing a true social peace based on a rule of law, my government is willing to firmly ensure the protection of lives and property. To that end, a national commission to guarantee the safety of the citizenry will be created. My government commits itself to strengthening the structures of Justice to [word indistinct] to halt the boat-people phenomenon. [Luckenson] Jonassaint wants the private sector to cooperate with his government, and [says] they can count on his commitment and determination to protect their interests. [He explains that] he will manage to perform, in keeping with the possibilities of the moment. [Jonassaint] As for the private sector, I would like its active cooperation in the process begun in the country. It can already count on my deep determination to protect its interests. [Luckenson] Thanking the audience, the provisional president praised the courage and determination of the ministers who make up his cabinet. He asked the ministers to work hard, for the job is not easy, while the national and international communities are expecting much from them. Although the national soul is wounded, the cabinet must work for the people and the nation. [Jonassaint] As members of the cabinet, well, I [word indistinct] salute your courage and your high sense of civic responsibility and patriotism. From now on, the country would like to be able to look upon us with pride. The nation's too often wounded pride, its so often endangered and even mortgaged sovereignty....[changes thought] Let us, then, go and work for the Haitian people, for the nation. If someone has something [words indistinct] against our lives, then, let us die. [Luckenson] In his speech, which lasted about 10 minutes, Jonassaint presented himself as an apostle, a prophet who will guide those under him toward the path of progress for the future. In concluding, Jonassaint said: To die for one's homeland is fine; let us dig with pleasure. After his speech, the unofficial Office of the Senate of the Republic -- which is presided over by Bernard Sansaricq, a member of the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion and the family of contested senators [issuing from] the [contested] 18 January [1993] elections -- paid its respects to Jonassaint; then came the turn of Chamber of Deputies delegation made up of Deputies Denis Saint-Fort, Emmanuel Reyme, Pierre Francois Vital, Jacques Lafleur, and Laguerre. Next, the Armed Forces High Command, headed by Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras, gave the provisional president a military salute. Respects were then paid to Jonassaint by the president and vice-president of the Supreme Court of Accounts and Administrative Litigation, the chairman of the board of directors of the Banque Nationale de Credit, and members and representatives of various opposition parties. In the opinion of attorney Mireille Durocher Bertin, the provisional president's principal private secretary, Article 149 is a partial solution to the crisis the country is experiencing. This is a process of national rescue, [she said, and] we are moving forward. [Bertin] This process...[changes thought] We are looking for a national rescue solution and, as you know, Article 149 is (?obviously) a provisional solution. Thus, we are moving forward, and with the grace of God, Haiti will be saved. [Luckenson] From what we managed to see, Emmanuel Constant, head of the neo-Duvalierist party Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, was not present, nor was engineer Franck Pierre, head of the Capois Lamort Organization. Professor [Hubert] de Ronceray was absent as well. According to what we saw, the government is not headed by a prime minister. It is made up of only 12 ministers: one woman and 11 men. Many observers following the crisis in Haiti are very worried, in view of the Haitian people's alarming situation: power outages, a high cost of living. In the next few days, the international community will strengthen the economic sanctions against Haiti, while threats of [military] intervention are hanging over the country's head. The question, which remains without an answer, is the following: Has Haiti become Hollywood? Is it a two-headed country? Two senate presidents are fighting for a single chair; there are two presidents of the Republic, and two governments of the Republic for a small population, a single nation. This is Jean Luckenson for Signal FM.
