The top government official has said Venezuela is not pressuring Panama to pay the debt but, rather, is simply requesting the renewal of talks. [Begin recording] [Linares] We have just received an official communication from the Venezuelan Government stating its interest in resuming the talks; therefore, we cannot talk of pressure. What does exist is a response to our request as a responsible government in order to pay to the debt. [Ortega] To pay in what type of manner? This involves many millions. The budget was cut, and there is no money. [Linares] The formulas we have proposed to the Mexican Government and the one we could reach with Venezuela if we agree to resume negotiations allow the government to pay its debt within its capabilities in the long term. There are no short-term formulas, to be sure. [end recording]
