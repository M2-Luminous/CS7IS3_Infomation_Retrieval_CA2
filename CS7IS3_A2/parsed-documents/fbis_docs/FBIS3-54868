Having discussed the organization's election platform, participants in the congress came to the conclusion that regional organizations should independently determine the strategy of their electoral campaign, in light of local conditions and following guidelines drafted by the forum. The Civil Congress is a leftist-centrist organization ready to cooperate with political forces fighting against nationalist extremism and advocating Ukraine's equal membership in an economic union with other former republics of the USSR. The delegates adopted a political declaration urging the formation of a close economic, diplomatic, military, and humanitarian union on the basis of the CIS; a resolution on the religious situation in Ukraine, and a statement regarding celebrations of the 340th anniversary of Ukraine's unification with Russia on 8 January 1994.
