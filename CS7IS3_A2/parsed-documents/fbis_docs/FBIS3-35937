In an interview to ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYE VEDOMOSTI (this Russian-language daily newspaper of the Russian Defense Ministry is published in Tbilisi), Artem Azirov, a leader of the Alliance, said that communists favor the preservation of Georgia's territorial integrity and condemn separatism and nationalism. "We maintain that disruption of links with Russia and other fraternal republics is unnatural. It is unacceptable to oppose, as some politicians do, the closest and the most powerful neighbor, Azirov said. The course of the present Georgian leadership toward the rebirth of economic links within the CIS and the joint use of the potential built by the joint effort is worthy of all-round support."
