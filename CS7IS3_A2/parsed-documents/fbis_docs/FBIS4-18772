I have never been an optimist, but this time I tend to be one. If we can agree on the federal state, the rest will follow, and I believe some people are beginning to see our point, perhaps even some of our friends in the MSI [Italian Social Movement]...." Speaking over the phone, Gianfranco Miglio, the League supporters' constitutionalist ideologue, explained his idea of federalism, during a pause inbetween his tours of the Domaso vineyards in the Como province. Democracy is in danger in the sense that "we are running the risk of an authoritarian involution," not through any fault of Berlusconi's "but because people who are disappointed with democracy tend to say: `Then it is better if only one person is in charge,'" and Berlusconi fits the bill. There is a great craving for authoritarianism, especially among young people. During the election campaign, Berlusconi gave himself airs as the fatherland's savior, and Italians would be capable of giving him all the power in the world, stripping themselves of their rights -- "they have already done so before in the past." The professor was in a good mood, predicting a turn for the better. "What we need now is a constituent government which will reform the Constitution, have the amendments approved by the houses, and submit the text to the people through a referendum." [Ventura] Is therefore an agreement taking shape within the pole for freedom.? [Miglio] I will not tell you everything that is cooking in the pot, but the First Republic's conservatives, those who are hoping to salvage it, and the whole lot, are going to be outsmarted. We will see who wins. [Ventura] You will also have to make some concessions. [Miglio] Yes, of course, without, however, renouncing federalism. [Ventura] Do you accept national unity and indivisibility? [Miglio] Indivisibility can go fly like a kite, if my idea of two or three cantons wins the day. The whole idea of indivisibility is outdated anyway, as is that of sovereignty, which in the federal model has a dual nature, belonging both to the state and the cantons. Unity is guaranteed by the directly elected premier, who governs via a directorate made up of the canton governors. [Ventura] Would National Alliance's [AN] coordinator Fini accept federalism in exchange for presidentialism? [Miglio] The head of state is a useless encumbrance of which we must get rid ourselves. The chairman of the Constitutional Court could do so, but the strong power would be in the hands of the prime minister, elected by the various peoples of the federation. [Ventura] Who would be in charge of public education and internal affairs? [Miglio] The cantons would be responsible for public education, and the central state for universities and scientific research. The cantonal police forces would be complemented by a federal FBI. [Ventura] What about fiscal autonomy? Would a certain percentage of the taxes levied go to the center? [Miglio] Yes, but this proportion would be decided by the cantons, coordinated by the directorate. [Ventura] Are you thinking in terms of a Belgian or U.S. model? [Miglio] Closer to the U.S. system, but rather like the original structure of the Philadelphia Constitution, before Roosevelt's welfare-state conception curtailed the states' prerogatives in favor of the federal government. True federalism is what you have in Switzerland, which is 700 years old, as many years as my family has witnessed since it established itself here at Domaso. [Ventura] In an interview with LA REPUBBLICA, parliamentary relations minister and constitutionalist advocate Paolo Barile stated that "Miglio-type federalism is unrealizable." You can change the form of government but not that of the state. [Miglio] Nonsense! Barile has been fighting a losing battle for the past 30 years. He, Matteucci and other liberal-democrats, including well-known figures like Galli Della Loggia and Panebianco believe that everything that has happened to us was solely due to the malevolence, incompetence, and dishonesty of politicians, and that, once the latter are removed, the "new" guys will appear on the scene, and everybody will live happily ever after. [Ventura] Whereas.... [Miglio] Whereas this is not the case! The Constitution must be amended. We have the right tool for doing this, no doubt. It is enough to read articles 138 and 139. Everything can be changed, except the republican form, by means of a majority plus one of the deputies, and the other half just have to accept it, whether they like it or not. Constitutions have never been made by the people as a whole for the people as a whole, but by the winners against the losers, as in 1956 by the antifascists, who in fact did not even have it ratified through a referendum. [Ventura] Forza Italia economist Antonio Martino is proposing moving beyond the regions by means of a structure comprising 25 to 50 "counties," somewhat larger than provinces. [Miglio] Bringing together the local governments into a single body is an old idea, even the papal government's constitutionalists discussed it in their time. It is an attractive and elegant model, but it does not fit reality in Italy, nor federalism, which requires greater units, large enough to counterbalance the central power. We must set out from the regions, not destroy them.
