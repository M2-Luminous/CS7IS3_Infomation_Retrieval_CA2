He pointed out: In recent years, nongovernment exchanges between the two sides of the strait have become increasingly active. Exchange activities of various kinds and forms have taken place constantly on both sides of the strait. Those exchanges and contacts have enhanced understanding and affection [gan qing 1949 1906] between people of the two sides. They are conducive to developing relations between the two sides, and the good results will benefit both sides. He said: In past exchange activities, a small number of officials among the Taiwan authorities had come to the mainland to take part in exchange activities in a private capacity. We have always taken a attitude welcoming such activities. According to a recent report by Taiwan newspapers, the Taiwan authorities will relax restrictions and allow Taiwan officials to go to the mainland for cultural and educational exchange activities in the name of academic or mass organizations. We express our welcoming of this decision by the Taiwan authorities. Meanwhile, we hope that officials of the Taiwan side, when they come to the mainland for exchange or other nongovernment activities in a private capacity, will first contact the Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation and the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits so as to let concerned departments on the mainland provide necessary asssitance. This will enable such exchange activities to be conducted in a smooth and proper manner and to achieve good results. The spokesman of the Taiwan Affairs Office said: We hope the Taiwan authorities will adopt a similar attitude to promote exchanges between the two sides of the strait, further relax restrictions, and allow mainland officials to go to Taiwan to take part in exchange activities in a personal or private capacity.
