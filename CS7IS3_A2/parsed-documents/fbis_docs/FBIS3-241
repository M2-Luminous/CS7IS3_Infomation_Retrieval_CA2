This meeting is "part of necessary consultations with various national political actors with a view to reinforcing democracy," a communique published by the government daily L'UNION stated. The government blamed the main opposition party, the National Lumberjacks Rally [RNB] and its leader, Father Paul Mba Abessole, for the violence that erupted in several districts of the capital, following a general strike called by a labor union close to the opposition. The labor union was demanding wage increases in the aftermath of the 11 January CFA franc devaluation. The RNB has not yet made a decision either to participate or not in the 7 March meeting. Its general assembly is slated for tomorrow, a party spokesman disclosed.
