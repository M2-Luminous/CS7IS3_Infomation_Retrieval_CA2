One of the suspects, named K'a-hsi-mo, was shot in the calf by police for resisting arrest and attempting to flee. The wound, however, posed no major obstacle, and after being bandaged in a hospital the man was bound over to the bureau for interrogation. Police had received tips that several foreigners residing in the Li-ti Building, located at Number 27, Lane 63, Liaoning St, had smuggled narcotics into the country in order to sell them. So at about 6:00 this morning, an assault group comprised of 10 officers, including six from the bureau's International Section and four from its rapid-strike and police-network groups went to the scene to investigate. Upon arrival, the police found the behavior of two black males, K'a-hsi-mo and Hsueh-jui-k'o, who had come downstairs, to be suspicious and so arrested and led them back upstairs to ascertain whether or not they possessed drugs and to search for accomplices. The police first searched Apt 603, located on the fifth floor. It was occupied by four or five foreigners, who turned out not to be what the police were seeking. The police then led the suspects down a floor to continue the search. Next searched was Apt 508, which the suspects had suggested was suspicious, but no one was found there. The suspects then indicated that 506, next door, might be the place. Thereupon, they were left, under guard by two officers, in 508, while the rest of the police went to search 506. As the police entered that apartment, three black males inside immediately threw a plastic bag like the kind used to store narcotics out a window, where it landed on the balcony. After subduing the men, the police discovered that the bag did indeed contain drugs, many pellets of heroin and morphine. According to the initial count, there were 56 pellets of heroin, 40 of morphine, and several of the latter loose or crumbled, with a total weight of 1,300-plus grams, worth nearly NT$100 million. After finding the drugs, the police led the three men, K'a-wen, Ao-k'u Ssu-ting, and Na-wa Ch'u-k'a, out of the apartment, which they then searched, discovering two more black men, Ya-mai-hsi and Ou-ni Pu-hsi, hiding under a bed. Including the first two detainees, Hsueh-jui-k'o and K'a-hsi-mo, seven suspects were apprehended. As the police led the seven downstairs, suspect K'a-hsi-mo suddenly broke free and dashed downstairs. The police fired shots in the air to halt him, but he continued his flight. The police then fired at him, striking his right calf, which was pierced by the bullet. Even so, the suspect continued to flee, but the police finally subdued him after a chase of about 500 meters. The police surmised that the suspects had smuggled the drugs into Taiwan by swallowing them or inserting them into their anuses. However, the suspects denied involvement in trafficking and are still being questioned as of this noon. Nigerians reportedly now comprise a major force in international trafficking. In Thailand alone, nearly 800 are in prison for the offense. The seven suspects in this case did not have any passports in their possession, so efforts are still under way to verify their identities.
