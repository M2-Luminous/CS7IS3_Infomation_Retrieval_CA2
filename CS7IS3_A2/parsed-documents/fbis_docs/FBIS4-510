Coetzee Zietsman and cameraman Cedric Muller filed this report: [Begin recording] [Zietsman] Trouble broke out in Katlehong early this morning. Two people died in a shootout between the defense force and residents of the Buyafuti hostel. Soldiers raided the hostel in search of weapons. They were allegedly fired upon and returned fire. Jeff Sibiya of the IFP Youth League died here and according to the SADF [South African Defense Force] he was caught in the crossfire. Troops urged upset residents to remain calm, but the message wasn't well received. The situation remained tense and soldiers kept a strong presence. Later Mr. Themba Khoza, the Transvaal organizer of the IFP, arrived on the scene to assess the situation and to talk to hostel dwellers. Weapons were carried openly. Mr. Khoza rejected the SADF's version of the incident. [Khoza] It is not just untrue, but lies. [Zietsman] Colonel C.P. du Toit, defense force commander in the area does not agree. [Du Toit in Afrikaans] My facts are that shots were fired on troops and we returned fire in a disciplined manner. [end recording]
