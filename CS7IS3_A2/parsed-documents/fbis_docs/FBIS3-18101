Today the Austrian Temelin delegation returned from Washington. The Greens want to continue intervention in Washington, while the federal chancellor is against the so-called permanent lobbying by the Austrian side. There is, however, agreement that the Austrian efforts in Washington have had a positive effect. [Vranitzky] They have objectively become better, even though one cannot yet say anything for sure at the moment. [Czoeppan] What will happen next? Will Austria pursue a kind of permanent lobbying strategy on Temelin? [Vranitzky] Well, it will probably not be permanent lobbying, but we will certainly take advantage of the chances that we still have, which is why Professor Heindler stayed there. As new information comes in, I will decide whether or not we will engage in other activities. [passage omitted]
