It has now reached Thailand and China. Isolated a short time ago, Vibrio cholerae 0139 appears particularly toxic and virulent. Unlike the other colonies, it threatens the population as a whole, and in particular, adults from Asiatic countries where cholera is endemically rampant. The French General Directorate of Health's weekly epidemiologic bulletin's prediction that the new strain would probably spread among the ``most indigent'' populations, has in fact materialized. On Monday 16 August, according to the AFP, Chinese health authorities reported some 100 cholera cases due to Vibrio cholerae 0139 in Sinkiang, in the western part of the country. As of last month, the Chinese minister of health had already reported atypical cases of cholera in the southern part of the country. The emergence of this new strain and its rapid spread worry international epidemiologists. In a commentary published in the British weekly THE LANCET dated 14 August, Doctors David L. Swerdlow of Boston, and Allen A. Ries of Atlanta, fear that this phenomenon will result in the eighth pandemic of cholera. Each of the previous pandemics resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality rates, notably in Africa and Latin America. [passage omitted] ``Although we may not be able to foretell where and how fast this new strain will spread, countries must surveil it closely and permanently,'' the American specialists stress in THE LANCET. This surveillance requires, in particular, that the third world's health officials in their entirety institute indispensable hygienic measures as soon as possible by supplying the populations at risk with only high-quality water and with covered sewage systems, without which the undertaking of a fight against cholera remains but a dramatic utopia.
