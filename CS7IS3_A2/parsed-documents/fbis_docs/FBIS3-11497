Representatives from Argentine laboratories, the Argentine Industrial Center of Pharmaceutical Laboratories (CILFA), and foreign laboratories, the Chamber of Pharmaceutical Specialties [Camara de Especialidades Medicinales] (CAEME) have agreed in rejecting the possibility that the U.S. Government will apply sanctions against our country if an official bill, scheduled for discussion in Congress, is not promulgated before 30 April. In remarks to NA, Felix Rozanski of the Studies Center for the Development of the Argentine Chemical-Pharmaceutical Industry [Centro de Estudios para el Desarrollo de la Industria Quimico Farmaceutica Argentina] (CEDIQUIFA), a CAEME member, noted: "Argentina will faithfully abide by the agreements signed before. Therefore, it is totally out of context to talk about sanctions -- which are the last step in negotiations, not the first." Rozanski stressed that Gore "is coming to build, not to fight." He added that he does not believe "in the magic 30 April deadline." In remarks to NA, CILFA President Pablo Challu emphasized that he does not believe the United States will place sanctions on our country. He accused the foreign laboratories of "formally" asking the U.S. Government to apply measures against local manufacturers. Challu noted that the Clinton administration's sanctions might involve limiting exports from other sectors not involved in the controversy. Challu believes the selected deadline is not imaginary because the 117 countries that approved the GATT agreement will sign it in April. The definition by the U.S. organization UCTR [expansion unknown] of the implementation of trade pressure measures also becomes due in April. In this exchange of accusations, Rozanski stressed that "a small group of families and courtly entrepreneurs ill advise" government officials and legislators and prevent the official bill, scheduled for discussion in Congress, from being approved. Nevertheless, Rozanski expressed hopes Argentina's current policy will remain faithful to all the bilateral negotiations and agreements achieved with the U.S. Government. He stressed: "The delay is inconsistent." Rozanski charged: "The parties benefiting from the current system, namely a few families, are distributing unclear information and implementing a strong lobby [preceding word in English] to prevent the bill's approval." Rozanski noted that the bill's approval will encourage exports. He pointed out that CILFA "is passing the ball, ignoring treaties already signed." Rozinski emphasized that even though the patents law "represents a precondition for Argentina's entry into NAFTA and urges the patents law's discussion, it is important for our country to respect commitments entered before." CILFA prepared itself for the possible "onslaughts" that may be prompted by Al Gore's arrival this week with a paid advertisement that was published today by our country's main morning newspapers. In it, CILFA asks U.S. Ambassador James Cheek "not to invalidate signed agreements." In this exchange of accusations of lobbies [preceding word in English] and influences, Challu indicated that 117 countries reached agreement on intellectual rights within the Uruguay Round of GATT. He pointed out that these measures "are the ones we must respect." Challu stressed: "There are two basic differences: First, the GATT guidelines establish a 10-year transition period for the implementation of any rules and regulations." Despite all these urgent considerations, Congress has not yet decided on this issue and not even the most optimistic believe the official bill will be discussed before 10 April. Both Ambassador Cheek and Foreign Ministry sources admitted that the approval of this law represents a basic step for Argentina's entry into NAFTA.
