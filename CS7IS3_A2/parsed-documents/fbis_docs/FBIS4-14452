At his news conference today, Fedorov made his views known concerning the current government's economic policies: [Begin Fedorov recording] I think that not a single economic action was carried out over the past three months that could be called reformist, even in the conventional sense of the word. At the same time, nothing bad was done either, or almost nothing, save for the abrogation of the decision on excise duties on alcohol, and for the adoption of strange import tariffs, under which the budget revenue from import tariffs is declining while prices are rising. The government is, in essence, on course and, as for me, I will support the budget, because given the quality of the current political situation I think that this budget can be the best possible one, at any rate where expenditure is concerned. It is clear that the government and the Finance Ministry endeavored to keep in check the swelling expenditure we have experienced. However, attempts to keep the situation under control are not tantamount to any real forward movement and that is why my views are as follows: In the first place, the government must be given a further two or three months and we must take a look at how the situation develops in reality, how inflation shapes up in May and June. I think that in principle, things have so far been going much better than could have been expected and in this context, again, I will broadly speak in support of the government and will not enter any opposition.
