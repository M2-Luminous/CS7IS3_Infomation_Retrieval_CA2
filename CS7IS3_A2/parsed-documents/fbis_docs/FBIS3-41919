Schwenk Named Director for Development''; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] [Text] Zurich, 20 Dec (ATSA) -- Aircraft manufacturer Pilatus based in Stans (Nidwalden demicanton) has appointed a new director to replace Walter Gubler, who was fired last March. Oerlikon-Buehrle, the group to which Pilatus belongs, announced that Oscar J. Schwenk will take up duties on 1 January 1994. Ernst Thomke, who temporarily managed the company after Mr. Gubler left, will resume his responsibilities as president of the administrative council. Oscar Schwenk has been working for Pilatus since 1981, most recently as a member of the board of directors responsible for the division ``operations.'' His predecessor had been dismissed with immediate effect on 26 March 1993. Mr. Gubler was blamed for having authorized a second delivery of aircraft to Burma, although he knew that the planes in the first delivery had been equipped with arms. With this dismissal, Pilatus wanted to start anew. At the time the company declared that in the future it wanted to avoid at all costs the possibility of its planes being equipped with arms. Pilatus wants to establish itself more strongly in the small civil airplane market. For instance, during the summer, the manufacturer had tried to take over the American company Piper. This past summer, Ernst Thomke together with Hans Widmer, head of Oerlikon-Buehrle, had strongly committed themselves to exporting training planes to South Korea and Nigeria. At the end of September, the federal council had agreed on the delivery of 20 PC-9 planes to South Korea and to seven PC-7 planes to Nigeria. Ernst Thomke, a Swiss manager, had left the board of SMH [Swiss Corporation for Microelectronics and Watchmaking Industries Ltd.] on 1 June 1991. He had played an important role in the success of Swatch. One year later he became manager of operations for the group Motor-Columbus. Mr. Thomke, who lives in Granges, is a member of the administrative councils of ATEL, SAEG Refindus, Studer Revox, and Swissmetri. Rumour has it that he might succeed the director of Ascom, Leonardo Vannotti. He himself denies being contacted by Ascom.
