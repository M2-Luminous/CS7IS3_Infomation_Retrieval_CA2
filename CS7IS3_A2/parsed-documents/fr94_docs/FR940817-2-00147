FR940817-2-00147 FR940817-2-00080 Under the automated cash ``sweep'' arrangement, a Plan may participate in the ``sweep'' program only with the initial written approval of the Second Fiduciary and only after certain disclosures have been provided by the Bank. If such approval is given, cash balances of the Plan held from time to time thereafter pending other investment or distribution are invested automatically in shares of one or more of HighMark's Money Market Portfolios selected by the Second Fiduciary on behalf of a Plan at the time of the initial authorization. It is represented that the automated cash ``sweep'' arrangement would not involve shares of HighMark's Non-Money Market Portfolios. After the Money Market Portfolios have been selected by the Second Fiduciary on behalf of the Plan, otherwise uninvested cash down to the last $1.00 balance of the Plans may be invested automatically on a nightly basis. It is represented that the Bank has no discretion with respect to the timing of the ``sweep'' either into or out of HighMark. Under the automated cash ``sweep'' arrangement, the Bank's computerized cash management system automatically scans the accounts of the Plans, as of the end of each business day to determine whether such accounts have positive or negative net cash balances. Based on this information the system automatically invests the cash of the Plans having positive balances in shares of the selected Money Market Portfolios. In the case of a Plan having a negative cash balance, the system automatically liquidates HighMark shares as necessary to eliminate such negative balance. It is represented that Plans may terminate their participation in the automated cash ``sweep'' arrangement and withdraw at any time by notifying the Bank. Such termination will be affected by the Bank selling the shares of HighMark held by the Plan requesting termination within one business day following receipt by the Bank, either by mail, hand delivery, facsimile, or other available means at the option of the Second Fiduciary, of the Termination Form or any other written notice of termination. However, if due to circumstances beyond the control of the Bank, the sale of shares of such Plan cannot be executed within one business day, the Bank shall have one additional business day to complete such sale. It is represented that no fee, charge, or penalty of any kind is charged in connections with a termination by a Plan of participation in the automated cash ``sweep arrangement'' in HighMark or in any of the Funds. It is further represented that the Bank does not charge separate or additional fees to Plans in order to participate in the daily automated cash ``sweep'' arrangement, nor is such additional compensation contemplated by the proposed exemption. 12 12 The Department in a letter, dated August 1, 1986, to Robert S. Plotkin, Assistant Director, Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, addressed the application of section 408(b)(2) of the Act to arrangements involving ``sweep services.'' In that letter the Department set forth several examples to illustrate various circumstances under which violations of section 406(b) of the Act would arise with respect to such arrangements. Conversely, the letter provided that, if a bank provides ``sweep'' services without the receipt of additional compensation or other consideration (other than reimbursement of direct expenses properly and actually incurred in the performance of such services), then the provision of ``sweep'' services by the bank would not, in itself, constitute a violation of section 406(b) of the Act. Moreover, including ``sweep'' services under a single fee arrangement for investment management services which is calculated as a percentage of the market value of the total assets under management would not, in itself, constitute an act described in section 406(b)(1), because the bank would not be exercising its fiduciary authority or control to cause a plan to pay an additional fee. In addition, the letter also discusses the applicability of the statutory exemptions under section 408(b)(6) fees for ``ancillary services'' and under section 408(b)(8) for collective trust funds maintained by such bank of the Act to such ``sweep'' service arrangements. 15. In summary, the Bank represents that the proposed transactions meet the statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) Neither the Plans nor the CIFs have paid or will pay sales commissions or redemption fees in connection with the in-kind transfer of assets to the Funds in exchange for shares of the Funds or in connection with purchases or sales by the Plans of shares of the Funds, including purchases and sales handled through daily automated cash ``sweep'' arrangements; (b) The Plans or the CIFs have received and will receive shares of the Funds that are equal in value to the assets of the Plans or the CIFs exchanged for such shares, as determined in a single valuation performed in the same manner and at the close of business on the same day in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 17a&hyph;7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended from time to time or any successor rule, regulation, or similar pronouncement;
