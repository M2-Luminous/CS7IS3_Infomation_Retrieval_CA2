Sahay: "India, Iran Agree on Human Rights"] [Text] Tehran, March 5. In an hour-long meeting between the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, and the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati, India and Iran today agreed that human rights should not be used as a political ploy against countries. In a separate development, the Chinese Foreign Minister, Mr. Qian Qichen, who is also currently here noted that his country believed that issues such as human rights should not be used as a weapon to exert pressure on countries because, every country was ruled according to its own social and religious systems. The identity of views thus emanating from three foreign ministers of leading Asian states appears to indicate growing political conversions on critical political issues in the international context. The Indian and Iranian foreign ministers also agreed today that India and Pakistan should sort out their problem in Kashmir through bilateral negotiations. These developments have led to interesting speculations here whether Iran would not abstain on the Pakistani resolution in Geneva, and go a step further and canvass...............[sentence as published] Setting out the perspective for his two-day visit to Iran, the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, told THE HINDU before landing at the Mehrabad airport here that "India, Iran, China, the Gulf and ASEAN could form a tremendous basis for Asian cooperation." While Mr. Singh is here for the seventh meeting of the Indo-Iran Joint Commission at the Ministerial level which would focus on enhancing economic and commercial ties to a prominent new level, it is difficult to miss the warm political undercurrents with which the External Affairs Minister's visit is awash. The Indian and the Chinese Foreign Ministers are slated to discuss substantive bilateral and regional issues tomorrow. This would only be their second one-to-one interaction, the last being at the session of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Mr. Singh is expected to suggest to his Chinese counterpart that the process of establishing peace and tranquillity on the line of Actual Control (LAC) between the two countries be speeded up with a view to relatively early realisation, rather than be allowed to languish like the earlier boundary talks. On Kashmir, India could tell the Chinese dignitary that so far human rights had been a tool employed by the West for political purposes against developing countries. It was ironical that Pakistan should seek to exploit the same route at Geneva against India. The Chinese anxiety naturally centres on Tibet, and Mr. Qian could take the opportunity of his meeting with Mr. Singh to convey his worries over an international conference of Parliamentarians on Tibet in the Indian capital later this month. It is expected that the External Affairs Minister would inform the Chinese dignitary that the Government of India had no role in the proposed conference. Contrary to earlier belief, Mr. Singh would deliver a letter from the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao to the Iranian President, Mr. Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, whom he calls on tomorrow. Mr. Rao is understood to have invited the Iranian President for an official visit. His letter may be expected to adhere to protocol norms of wishing more fulsome bilateral ties. Mr. Singh told this correspondent that "There is tremendous possibility of close economic cooperation between Iran and India, and this could enhance prosperity in the whole region." After a lull, India and Iran picked up the threads of their relations once again with a visit to India in March, 1992 by the Iran Foreign Minister. This was at Mr. Velayati's own initiative. Since then the pace of strengthening ties has been very quick. Mr. Velayati had urged taking bilateral relations to a higher level, and also cooperation with India at the Nonaligned Forum, clearly in view of the pressures brought against both countries by the U.S.
