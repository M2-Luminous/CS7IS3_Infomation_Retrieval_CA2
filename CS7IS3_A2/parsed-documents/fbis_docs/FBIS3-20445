First they worried about the Chinese merchandise wholesalers. In the past, China controlled foreign trade mainly through the China Resources Company which in turn sold its products through local wholesalers. After reform and opening up, the foreign trade system was restructured in steps, and MOFERT allowed some products to be managed directly by various ministries and commissions, provinces and municipalities. Once again the localities rushed to find managers and agents for their own products, jeopardizing the profit of the original Chinese merchandise wholesalers. This had to be changed; it was inevitable. To the Hong Kong merchants, although the original wholesalers were hurt, some new agents in Hong Kong benefitted, because the provinces and municipalities, ministries, and commission still had to operate through the Hong Kong market; overall, it was a win-some, lose-some situation, a situation not entirely avoidable. The Working Committee discussed the situation internally and determined that the original wholesalers should be looked after as much as possible. For example, they should be introduced to various provinces and municipalities, ministries and commissions to get new sources of merchandise. They also asked China Resources Company to come up with new businesses and pay some kind of compensation and so on. The launching of Chinese-funded businesses was based on diversification. At first, many Hong Kong people worried that the mainland Chinese-funded organizations had state funds, and so whether they were making money or not, they could go on, making it impossible for the Hong Kong people to compete with them. Such businesses existed, but they were the minority. There were rumors circulating in Hong Kong that the Chinese-funded businesses had brought this much or that much money to invest in Hong Kong. Some estimated the amount to be $8 billion, others suggested $10 billion. Looking at the Chinese-funded organizations' total investment, those numbers obviously were exaggerated. Those who said that the money had come from the mainland obviously did not know what they were talking about. Back then, Mainland China was making every effort to absorb foreign funds. How could they have brought so much money to invest in Hong Kong? This was what Li Xiannian and Chen Yun were worried about. Li Xiannian once said, "We need money. We cannot take money from the mainland to invest in Hong Kong to make the British look good." As far as I know, there were two types of funds being invested in Hong Kong. The first was state or local government appropriations. Such funds were limited in amount. The few fairly large sums, as I understand, came from the following sources: One was funds the state allocated to the several large corporations such as China Trust and Investment Company and Everbright; they could not have been more than $300-500 million. Another was the $100 million allocated to XINHUA SHE's Hong Kong branch. Individual provinces and municipalities could not have appropriated anything close to $100 million, and even though some central government ministries and commissions might have more money, they could not have reached $100 million. Thus, if we add them together, the sum would be around $1 billion. Another type was funds some pertinent provincial and municipal departments had earned and kept while doing business elsewhere and which they invested in Hong Kong. China Resources Company and Bank of China handed over some of their profits each year, but they also retained a percentage. That was normal. We could not rule out some corruption and irregularities with respect to the retained profits of the provinces, municipalities, ministries and commissions; but it could not have been a huge amount. It was estimated at that time that retained profits came to about $1 billion, and adding the $2 billion or so appropriated by the state, the sum would be $3 billion at the most. Thus, if the Chinese-funded organizations did indeed invest $8-10 billion in Hong Kong, then most of the money was Hong Kong money, or we could say that it was money borrowed from Hong Kong banks. The development of Mainland Chinese-funded organizations in Hong Kong was in some ways facilitated by the mainland, and on that basis, they also learned from Hong Kong's market experience in order to grow. Back then, the Chinese-funded organizations in Hong Kong grew fairly rapidly and played an increasing role in the Hong Kong market. But based on the general estimate that they had $10 billion invested, it was still not much compared to society's total investments, and they could not begin to threaten or replace Hong Kong's British or Chinese capital. Thus, Mainland Chinese capital's growth in Hong Kong was basically healthy. Practice proved that the general principle of developing and strengthening Chinese capital was a positive move. It contributed to the mainland's reform and opening up and to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity; they helped and benefitted each other. V. Consolidating Hong Kong's Chinese-Funded Organizations (Part 1 of 3) Chinese-funded organizations in Hong Kong became somewhat chaotic in 1987 and 1988. There were complaints from the public. For example, some units did not know what they were doing and were making some wrong decisions; they were defrauded and suffered loses. Some set up parent companies, subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries, thus over-expanding themselves. Some management personnel were involved in corruption, bribery, and fraud, and to some extent, things got out of control. [End of Installment No. 79] [23 Jul 93 p 4] [Text] Consolidating Hong Kong's Chinese-Funded Organizations (Part 2 of 3): Ji Pengfei Suggests Checking Out Everbright and China Trust; Zhao Ziyang Instructs Everyone To Leave Everbright Alone The State Council, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and MOFERT wanted to consolidate the Chinese-funded organizations in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong and Macao Working Committee pointed out that the overall development of the Chinese-funded organizations was basically healthy, but there were some problems, and some rectification was necessary; however, the consolidation process should not obstruct their development, and we must not use the same measure across the board but should deal with different situations in different ways. For example, Guangdong and Fujian provinces had a fairly large number of businesses in Hong Kong. Guangdong not only had provincial and municipal companies but even its counties and townships had set up businesses in Hong Kong. They had many connections, and most people came to Hong Kong on personal connections, and it was impossible to estimate the actual figure. In those situations, some companies could be abolished or merged. But other mainland provinces and municipalities had few organizations in Hong Kong, and for the sake of opening up, they had asked to set up new businesses, which was fair. Upon checking and registering, we had approximately 2,000 companies in Hong Kong, and after consulting the provinces and municipalities, ministries and commissions, we decided to keep more than a thousand. Meanwhile, some necessary adjustments were made to their business operations. On the matter of corruption and irregularities within the Chinese-funded organizations, there were many complaints. Someone made a speech at a Beijing meeting and wrote to the newspapers about the serious situation of corruption and malpractices within the Chinese-funded organizations. I asked the person to provide some facts and expressed our sincerity in seriously investigating and remedying the charges. He only gave us some information on some minor matters, in sharp contrast to what he had described in his speech and article. There were other merchants complaining to us about similar situations, but when I asked them for specifics, they could not deliver. It is my guess that there could be two possibilities: First, someone was blackmailing or bribing them, and they did not want to provide any information, fearing that it might jeopardize future businesses. Another possibility may be that it was all hearsay, and so they could not substantiate their charges. No matter what, we did not ignore the matter. We knew that there was a serious problem in certain units, and certain famous personalities in some large companies were deeply involved. Yet, it was difficult to conduct an investigation; we needed evidence before we could deal with the matter. Reportedly, a certain manager had a large bank account. Hong Kong banks are bound by law to keep their clients' business confidential. It made investigations impossible. At a related meeting in Beijing, Ji Pengfei suggested the State Council sent people to investigate Everbright and China Trust. I agreed and seconded his suggestion. Everbright was founded after Wang Guangying [3769 0342 5391], CPPCC vice chairman, paid a visit to Hong Kong and submitted a report to the State Council, and with Zhao Ziyang's approval, funds were allocated by the state and the business was started in Hong Kong. Wang was given permission to manage real estate and stock. Zhang Jingfu [1728 0513 1133], secretary general of the economic leading group, was put in charge and was in direct contact with Wang Guangying. When Wang Guangying arrived in Hong Kong, he drummed up a lot of publicity; it was sensational. He boasted that his special rank put him above that of a minister, that he was one of the nation's leaders, and that he was making investments on behalf of the State Council. The company name, "Guangda" ["Everbright"], was approved by Zhao Ziyang. Wang said that at first they had thought of naming it "Ziguang," but Zhao thought that it was inappropriate, and they chose "Everbright" instead. At the beginning, Wang Guangying was very ambitious. Back then Hong Kong's real estate market was in a slump. His dealings with Li Ka-shing [2621 1367 2052] regarding Garden City created quite a stir in Hong Kong. He said that it was a move based on his optimism in Hong Kong's future. But then he backed out of the contract soon after. There were objections to Wang Guangying's management style and internal administration in the pertinent departments in Beijing and within Everbright itself. Everbright's cadres were handpicked by Wang himself, and after arriving in Hong Kong, those who agreed with him were trusted, but those who disagreed with him were discriminated against and alienated. When Wang was still a target of the Tianjin City Party Committee's united front, a united front cadre had looked after him and had thus won his trust. He was later transferred to Everbright, but because he disagreed with Wang on something, he was immediately rejected. Subsequently, cultural revolution-like measures were adopted inside the company; criticism sessions were held, and he was accused of wrongdoings. The cadre reported to the relevant units in Beijing and to the Hong Kong-Macao Working Committee. We tried to get a handle on the situation and asked questions. For that reason, Wang Guangying was upset with the Working Committee. I went to Beijing to discuss the matter with Zhang Jingfu. He said, "He is beyond my jurisdiction." He told me to go directly to Zhao Ziyang. I did. Zhao said, "From now on you should leave Wang Guangying alone." I told Zhang Jingfu what Zhao had said. He shook his head, "You should get Zhao to put it in writing." How was I doing to get anything in writing? Soon thereafter, Zhang Jingfu told me, "I won't touch the Everbright matter either. There is nothing I can do." A 29 year-old wealthy businessman, Zhang Shaohuang [1728 1421 4106], who claimed to be an Overseas Chinese from South America suddenly showed up in Hong Kong and dove deep in the real estate business. There were all sorts of speculations about him. Zhang opened a company in Hong Kong and invited me to the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The company had the support of Beijing's Song Jingling Foundation. Song Jingling Foundation's chairman was Kang Keqing [1660 0344 3237], Marshal Zhu De's wife; its vice chairman was a deputy director of the General Office of the Central Committee whom I knew well, because whenever I visited Beijing, I was received by him. He personally told me that elder sister Kang had asked for my support. He said, "This Mr. Zhang is very patriotic. He is enthusiastic about mainland affairs and has donated HK$2 million to the Chinese Children's Welfare Fund." So I agreed to attend the opening ceremony. Zhang Shaohuang advertised his company's opening, saying that yours truly would take part in the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

The registered capital was over HK$10,000, but actual upfront money was only HK$2. I sensed something was wrong. When the deputy director of the General Office came to Hong Kong to participate in the opening ceremony in the capacity of vice chairman of the Song Jingling Foundation, I did not meet him but sent Qiao Zongzhun [0829 1350 0402] instead. When he came back, I questioned him, and he too felt that something was wrong. Reportedly, Zhang Shaohuang had sent out invitations to many business tycoons, but none showed up. Further investigations conducted by a pertinent department revealed that Zhang was Wang Guangying's future grandson-in-law and was getting financial support from Wang and led an extravagant life. Soon thereafter, Zhang Shaohuang's fraud case was exposed: A Liaoning company in Hong Kong thought that because both Song Jingling Foundation's elder sister Kang and Wang Guangying supported Zhang, this man had to be trustworthy and therefore lent him HK$200 million. Upon getting the loan, he donated HK$2 million to the Chinese Children's Welfare Fund and used the rest of the money to speculate in real estate. When the Liaoning company became suspicious and wanted to get the money back, Zhang had vanished. Negotiations through lawyers and some of Zhang's cohorts helped recover some of the money. The State Council's restructuring of Everbright took place after "4 June." I don't know the details. There were also many complaints about China Trust. According to rectification and improvement information released by Beijing, China Trust was meddling in illegal foreign exchange management. Most people believed that there was more to it. The Working Committee alone received many complaints. The "rectifications" of these two large companies were handled directly by the State Council, and despite the Working Committee's reports to Beijing on the public's complaints, the State Council failed to follow up. As far as I know, nearly 200 sons and daughters of high-ranking cadres were doing business in Hong Kong. I had Qiao Zongzhun keep in frequent touch with them and work on them, hoping that they would not get into trouble; otherwise it would have an adverse effect internally and externally. Qiao Zongzhun introduced me to some of them, and I told them that I would support their normal business activities in Hong Kong as much as I could and hoped that they would abide by the laws and regulations of the Hong Kong market and keep personal and business matters separate. Indeed many of them were able to do that. The person making the best impression and displaying the most upright workstyle was Wan Li's son, Wan Zhongxiang. Those making the worst impression were a certain person's son-in-law and a certain person's son. The two mixed their public and private lives, made lots of money, and led extravagant lives. One has already emigrated to Australia. The central authorities were going to transfer him back to the mainland, but he had already gone. The other is still in Hong Kong, making money. The Working Committee had no evidence and could not conduct an investigation, and the reports went unnoticed. There was nothing anybody could do. At the beginning, Xue Wenlin [5641 2429 2651] was in charge of the Xinlong Company, a XINHUA SHE subsidiary. He had been a vice president of the Bank of China's Hong Kong-Macao Administrative Office. The Beijing headquarters wanted him to retire, and I asked to borrow him and kept him in Hong Kong, making him CEO and general manager of the Xinlong Company. Xue Wenlin was in charge of Bank of China's Singapore branch at one time. He was familiar with situations in Singapore. After he went to work for Xinlong, he and a Singapore businessman got together to form a company, dealing with leather and herbal medicines. He was swindled: He hired a cadre, a transferee from Shanghai, who delivered a letter of credit and paid out $2 million before the other side had delivered the merchandise. An investigation revealed that possibly it was part of a setup. The Shanghainese cadre's wife and the Singapore businessman together owned a company, but we had no proof. The Xinlong Company lost nearly HK$10 million with its stocks in the market crash of 1987. Adding the money defrauded, it lost more than $10 million--more than HK$100 million. Under the circumstances, we decided to replace the company leaders. On Zhou Ding's [0719 7844], secretary of the Working Committee's Macao branch, recommendation, we replaced Xue Wenlin with Sun Kaifeng [1327 0418 7364], general manager of a Shenzhen company. The person in XINHUA SHE also in charge of business in Xinlong Company was deputy director Zheng Hua [6774 5478]. He often inquired about the company's detailed business, but he also missed some opportunities. For example, when Xue Wenlin was still in charge of the company, the owner of Hong Kong's Qingfeng Theater wanted to sell the property and was asking for a little more than HK$200 million. They sounded out Xinlong. Since Qinglung was one of the major movie theaters, Xue Wenlin was eager to buy; the Cultural and Education Department was enthusiastic too. They sought out Zheng Hua who brought up the matter for discussion at a meeting. I supported the move, but since Zheng Hua took no position, out of deference for him, I said, "detailed business matters are up to your CEO and general manager. We need not discuss the matter. It is your decision." Two months later, I read in the newspaper that they had not bought it. They missed a good opportunity. We certainly paid a price in the reform and development of the Chinese-funded organizations in Hong Kong, but business-wise, some progress was made. More importantly was that they learned a lot about management and business administration in the capitalist world market and made and unified a lot of friends.

The book enumerated the characteristics of Hong Kong's accelerated economic development and discussed each in brief. Those interested should indeed get hold of a copy of the book. Hong Kong is very small in area. Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories together measure only a little over 1,000 sq m. Hong Kong has few natural resources. But in the 40-some short years since World War II, Hong Kong has developed from a poor, backward colonial city into a world-renowned financial, trade, ocean shipping, information, and tourist center, becoming an international metropolis founded on the service industry. There is no denying that it was a miracle. Today, Hong Kong is among the richest cities. A few years ago, Mr. Lin Hang-chih [2651 5887 2972] of HSIN PAO said, "Based on total wealth, every person in Hong Kong is a millionaire." I am afraid they have far exceeded that today. Whether based on Chinese statistics or Western statistics, Hong Kong's per capita GNP is approximately $15,000, catching up with Japan's. A recent newspaper report said that Hong Kong ranked 90th in population but 10th as an economic entity in the world, surpassing many large countries. In 1992, it exported $40 billion's worth of goods. Amazing. While many regions around the world are in an economic slump, how come Hong Kong is still growing? The reasons are very interesting. People say heaven, earth, and men are working in Hong Kong's favor. Indeed, Hong Kong may be small in area, but it is perfectly situated geographically, with mainland China at its back while facing the main Pacific and Indian ocean shipping lanes head on. Whether one is going from east to west or north to south, Hong Kong is a midway station. Victoria Harbor is wide and deep; it never freezes, and it is one of the world's best natural harbors. Hong Kong may lack natural resources, but after World War II, for geographic reasons, it became a political and economic buffer zone between the two major camps. It became the political and economic safe haven for mainland China and even some Southeast Asian countries and regions, which brought Hong Kong new resources, that is, cheap labor, valuable talents, and ample funds. Hong Kong may be a colonial city, but in the post-war era, England has slowly changed the way it ruled and has adopted a policy of control through conciliation. Instead of absolute dictatorship, it gradually adopted a smart policy known as consultative democracy. On economic matters, they actively pursued a policy of nonintervention, creating a fairly good investment environment, including "hard" environment and "soft" conditions, in Hong Kong. The so called "soft" conditions refer to the set of laws and policies, especially the low and limited-scope tax policy, drawn up by the Hong Kong government, as well as the subsequent setting up of the Independent Commission Against Corruption [ICAC] that ushered in an honest government policy. "Hard" environment refers to the set of planned modern municipal constructions, including financial, transportation, telecommunications, and other service facilities, so that the Hong Kong people are brought into full play in a great investment environment. After the founding of New China, Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai decided not to take back Hong Kong immediately. They removed all interferences and resolutely adopted the general policy of "long-term planning and full utilization" to stabilize Hong Kong, and only with that was Hong Kong able to maintain a long-term stable political environment. China's reform and opening up created a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Hong Kong's economic development. Thus, China was a determining factor in Hong Kong's development. The first time I went to Hong Kong, a local capitalist said something that made a very deep impression. He said, Hong Kong has emerged from a narrow crack by utilizing every opportunity. I admire the Hong Kong people's vigor in taking advantage of every opportunity. Wherever there is an opportunity, they will seize it; not just opportunities in Hong Kong or in the mainland, but worldwide. They have become increasingly skillful at seizing opportunities; they have set increasingly higher standards. This in fact is a positive spirit of adapting to changes, a spirit of holding on to every opportunity and not letting go. This is an important reason behind Hong Kong's development. We can say that Hong Kong takes full advantage of every political and economic opportunity in the international domain. It took advantage of the Korean war and the Vietnam war to become not only one of the U.S. military supply and reconnaissance bases, but because China broke the blockade, Hong Kong in fact became a base for smuggling foreign products into the mainland. Many Hong Kong entrepreneurs who eventually prospered had started out as smugglers. It not only benefited them personally but also benefited Hong Kong. When the world economy evolved, the well-developed capitalist nations' economy changed from being labor-intensive to capital-intensive and technology-intensive, and in the process, Hong Kong seized the opportunity and used its cheap labor to sell its low-cost products to other nations, especially the United States. Back then, Hong Kong had a large quota. It became a major export center for textile goods in the late 1970's by taking advantage of that transformation of the world economy.
