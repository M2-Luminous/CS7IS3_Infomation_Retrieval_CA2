FBIS4-1192 "drafr079_c_94025" FBIS-AFR-94-079 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Three ANC Supporters Killed Three ANC Supporters Killed MB2404132594 Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network in English 1100 GMT 24 Apr 94 MB2404132594 Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network English BFN [Text] The death toll in yesterday's attack on ANC election canvassers at Ulundi has risen to three. A spokesman for the KwaZulu Police says the latest victim was among the 10 canvassers who had sought refuge at the police station. He said he died after being shot, apparently as the refugees were being taken to safety. A search for eight ANC supporters missing since the incident has so far proved fruitless. It's still unclear what exactly happened at the police station after the arrival of IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi to deal with the problem. One of the ANC members who escaped to the police station said he was rescued by white policemen from almost certain death. ANC provincial election candidate, Welcome Mthimkulu, alleges that the KwaZulu policemen were ready to hand the ANC members over to the mob outside. He said a number of white policemen, however, had taken them in armored vehicles to a place of safety until they could be transferred to Eshowe.
