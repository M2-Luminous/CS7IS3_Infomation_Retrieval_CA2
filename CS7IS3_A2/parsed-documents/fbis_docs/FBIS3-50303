By its actions, Bulgaria shows clearly it is in favour of friendly relations with Macedonia, Mr. Daskalov said, commenting on a statement this week by Greek Minister for European Union Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos that "the borders of Albania, Bulgaria and Serbia with Macedonia are not safe." Bulgarian-Macedonian economic contacts are on the fast track, Mr. Daskalov also said. Recalling that the presidents of the two countries have met twice and that Prime Minister Lyuben Berov has visited Skopje, Mr. Daskalov said "political dialogue is on a satisfactory level." Asked about Bulgaria's foreign policy priorities in 1993, Mr. Daskalov said they were prompted by its main objectives, "to create conditions guaranteeing Bulgaria's national security and economic development." He listed last year's priorities as follows: Integration into the European and Euro-Atlantic structures, the Balkan scene and relations with the Balkan countries, relations with the United States and Russia, the Yugoembargo which, in his view, has inflicted serious damage on Bulgaria.
