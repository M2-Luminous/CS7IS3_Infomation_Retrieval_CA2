FR940414-0-00072 FR940414-0-00028 Comments and Responses 1. Quota Allocations Comment : Given the need for stock-rebuilding, allocating 301 mt to the purse seine category is unjustified. Response : Within limits and guidelines arising from recommendations of ICCAT, as required by U.S. law, NMFS allocated a limited resource to the various categories according to historical catch shares. This allocation based on historical share was established in 1992, following the 1991 ICCAT-recommended reductions in quota for the western Atlantic. Comment : NMFS needs to establish a set-aside for the traditional NY Bight recreational fishery. Response : The total quota of school bluefin tuna that NMFS has at its disposal (99 mt or 8 percent of its national quota) was determined by ICCAT at the November, 1993 meeting. Therefore, as required by the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act, NMFS has no discretion to raise or lower that amount. A 52.5 mt subquota of school bluefin tuna is reserved for recreational fishermen in the area from New Jersey north and is based on average catches from those areas in recent years. Given the difficulties of monitoring recreational catch and the interannual variability in bluefin migration patterns, a further fractioning of quotas would result in quota management areas that would be impossible to administer on a real-time basis. Comment : Deducting 13 mt from the reserve to maintain fishing category quotas at 1993 levels does not reduce fishing mortality nor does it prepare the industry for future quota reductions. Response : With respect to fishing mortality, maintaining allocations by reducing the reserve will achieve the same results as reducing all categories proportionally. The reserve is used only to make up for overharvest in any category. NMFS believes a reserve amount of 18 mt is sufficient for the intended purpose of maintaining total harvest within the U.S. quota. Recent improvements in quota monitoring procedures (e.g., faxing dealer reports) reduce the risk of commercial categories overharvesting the annual quota. Further, the industry is aware of the future quota reductions recommended by ICCAT in 1993. 2. Boundary Adjustment Comment : Adjusting the boundary line between the northern and southern management areas will do little to reduce mortality. Response : Since the quotas for the two Incidental category longline management areas would remain the same, there would be no adverse impact on the ICCAT stock recovery program. 3. Minimum Landings Requirement Comment : The change in minimum landing requirement will not reduce bluefin mortality. Instead, NMFS should create an experimental fishery requiring specialized gear such as break-away leaders. Response : Such an experimental fishery requires a substantial analysis of environmental and economic impacts and considerable research is needed to develop an enforceable definition or criteria for breakaway gear. Therefore, provisions for an experimental fishery could not be included into this interim final rule without violating notice and comment requirements. However, NMFS does plan to consider fully the management alternative of the suggested experimental fishery in the proposed rulemaking for the 1995 fishing season and will analyze this alternative in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) to be released in May 1994. In the interim, NMFS will continue to gather information (anecdotal and scientific) and encourage the use of specialized gear and fishing methods to reduce bluefin mortality. Fishermen are encouraged to contact NMFS to discuss alternative means of avoiding bluefin hook-ups. To the extent that bluefin discards are reduced through shorter trips, total fishing mortality may decrease. Comment : The Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council recommended that NMFS require a minimum number of days between landings of bluefin tuna and that NMFS develop special break-away gear. Response : A minimum number of days between landing a bluefin, in the absence of other restrictions, would allow for an intermittent directed fishery, contrary to the ICCAT recommendation. NMFS agrees with the industry that a minimum number of days between landings in conjunction with a minimum poundage requirement would be too restrictive for Gulf longliners and would only result in additional discards. NMFS will continue to research break-away gear.
