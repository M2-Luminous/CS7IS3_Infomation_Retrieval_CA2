Judging from statements he made during the campaign, this internationalization will stress a strong policy to promote exports, and this policy will undoubtedly be based on a rectification of the policy on currency exchange. To this effect, working in coordination with the board of directors of Banco de la Republica will be necessary. The new president will appoint two new members of the seven member monetary board in addition to the finance minister, totaling three out of seven people. The new president will need to have the concurrence of at least one additional board member in order to adopt the necessary currency exchange modifications to strengthen exports. It will be, therefore, a policy of opening up to international markets.
