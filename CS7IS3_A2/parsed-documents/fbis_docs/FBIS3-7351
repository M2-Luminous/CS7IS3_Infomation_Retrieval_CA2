In a telephone conversation with the Japanese foreign minister that day, he "confirmed time and again the maintenance of the international cooperation system". His remarks vividly show that the base intrigues of the South Korean puppet clique to stifle the fellow countrymen in the North have run into extremes. He cried that the North "must change its attitude," not uttering a word about the fact that the South Korean puppet clique had broken up the North-South dialogue and driven the situation of the country to a phase of crisis. This is a stereotyped method of the puppet clique to commit crimes and shift the blame on to others. Han talked something about "dialogue". But this was a ruse to evade the responsibility for the collapse of North-South dialogue and a camouflage for the puppets' sinister intention to do harm to the North. He revealed the invariable intention of the puppets to isolate and stifle the North when he prattled again about "effectiveness of pressure" by the "international cooperation system". Facts clearly show that the Kim Yong-sam group is, indeed, a never-to-be-condoned group of traitors who do not want either North- South dialogue or peace and peaceful reunification of the country but are trying to plunge the nation into the scourge of a nuclear war with the help of outside forces.
