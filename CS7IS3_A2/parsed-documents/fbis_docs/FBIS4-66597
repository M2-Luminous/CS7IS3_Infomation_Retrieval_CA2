FBIS4-66597 "jpnea021___94028" JPRS-NEA-94-021 JPRS Near East & South Asia 26 February 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA Joint Naval Exercise Held With Singapore Joint Naval Exercise Held With Singapore 94AS0255P Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA in English 26 Feb 94 p 6 94AS0255P Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA English CSO [Text] New Delhi, February 25. India and Singapore commenced a four-day joint naval training exercise in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) manoeuvres in the Andaman Sea from Wednesday. The training exercise, which is scheduled to end tomorrow, is being held on the specific request by Singapore which had formally approached the Indian government last December. The visiting Singapore ships had arrived India last Monday on a seven-day official visit. The participating ships of the Singapore Navy are RSN Victory and RSN Valour, both missile Corvettes. These two corvettes, designed by a German firm, were built in Singapore as recently as in 1991. The participating Indian naval vessels are INS Taragiri, an indigenously built Leander class frigate of British design and INS Kursura, a Soviet made Foxtrot class submarine. The joint naval exercise has been described by defence ministry sources as a "naval exercise of significant training value for the Singapore navy". The ASW manoeuvres being taught to the crew of the Singapore navy ships include that of sonar operator training, and sharpening skills at detection and designation of oceanic and underwater targets, especially submarines. This is the first time that a submarine of the Indian navy is participating in bilateral joint naval exercises involving the sensitive ASW operations. Significantly, Singapore has shown interest in seeking India's help for specialised training of its naval officers. The Singapore navy chief who is arriving in New Delhi early next month on his first visit in recent years has specially sought to visit naval facilities at the Eastern Naval Command in Cochin. Although a few vacancies for foreign trainees at the Indian training establishments are being availed by the Singapore navy, the Indian navy expanding the scope of training officers of the Singapore navy in the near future is thus emerging as a strong probability. This is the second time that India and Singapore are holding bilateral naval exercises. The two sides had held a four-day tactical joint naval exercise off the coast of the Andaman Islands in February last year. The exercises, which were elementary in nature, had included surface shooting and screening apart from other manoeuvres.
