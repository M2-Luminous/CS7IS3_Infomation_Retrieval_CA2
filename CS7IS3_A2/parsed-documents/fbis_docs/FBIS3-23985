Did they not waste the first work week of the year--scholars and practitioners in jurisprudence, staff of various protection services, and finally, entrepreneurs, who, as one may guess, have an extremely high stake in this--by gathering in the conference hall of the Russian Academy of Management? Of course, skeptics will also have something to comment on in the seminar. First, the thesis "two jurists--three opinions" has not been refuted by a long shot. Differences of opinion sometimes produced a heat akin to rally frenzy. Second, is there a guarantee that in this debate, contrary to the experience of thousands of others like it, the truth indeed will be born? Finally, was it worthwhile to convene this gathering in order to once again state the obvious: business is being overrun by crime? As an objection to the hypothetical skeptic, I will probably begin with the latter: stating the obvious. There are different ways to state things. One can stun the audience with murderous (frequently in the literal sense) statistics and "finish off" the listener with the eternal question: What are they doing about it--the procuracy, or the militia, or anyone else except the critic's own agency. Or one may calmly present the same figures on the basis of a scientifically validated analysis. One can, on the basis of the same analysis, produce a clear forecast; or, finally, propose a package of well-considered measures. For the sake of fairness I want to say that this approach was the prevalent one. Thanks to a large extent to the fact that the presidium, headed by the association President Azaliya Dolgovaya, tactfully but firmly nipped attempts at rally style in the bud. Now the main point. Despite the divergence of opinions that is traditional for the legal profession, the seminar participants practically agreed on the definition of three, if one may put it this way, "predicaments" of modern business in our country. A useless legal base of reforms; obvious shortcomings in the practice of privatization, banking, and other strategic directions of economic renewal; and finally, a corrupt bureaucracy--this is what accompanies the current, to put it mildly, adverse situation. A special topic was the hasty and unreasoned reform of the law enforcement system. Does this mean then that the seminar was a complete success? I would wait before answering this. I would wait, despite being fully convinced that this seminar was necessary, despite all the respect for the work the organizers have put into it. One will be able to call it a success only when the alarms rung by criminologists are heard in the power structures; when people who do professional research in criminology are brought into norm-creating work (which, I should note, in civilized countries is altogether unthinkable without the expert opinion of criminologists). As to the discussion at the seminar per se, today we are publishing its principal sections. We are publishing it, of course, without smoothing out the sharp aspects in the dialogue, without retouching the sometimes polarized viewpoints. Despite all this, we hope that the reader will get an objective picture of not only the proceedings at the seminar, but also (and this is most important) an idea of the crime situation in the sphere of business.
