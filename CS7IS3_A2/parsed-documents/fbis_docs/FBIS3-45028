These remarks were made by Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee, at a meeting here today with Chinese correspondents who are going to cover the event. He said the upcoming visit shows that China places great importance on its cooperation with Germany, Switzerland and Austria in the fields of politics, economy and trade, science and technology as well as culture. It is also a symbol that China desires to develop its long-term and stable friendly ties with the three countries, based on the principles of seeking common ground while reserving differences, mutual respect, non-interference in each other's internal affairs and equality and mutual benefit. Qiao is scheduled to pay an official goodwill visit to the three countries from January 16 to 30 at the invitation of the Presidium of the Bundestag of Germany, President Gert Haller of the National Council of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland, and President Heinz Fischer of the National Council of Austria. Qiao is China's first NPC chairman to visit West European countries, Cao said. He noted that the diplomatic work of the NPC and its Standing Committee is an important component part of China's entire diplomacy. To conduct friendly contacts in a planned way between the NPC and its standing committee on the one hand and foreign parliaments on the other, according to China's foreign policies and principles, is of great significance to deepening mutual understanding and friendship, promoting the state-to-state relations and creating a better international environment for the country's modernization drive and reform and opening to the outside world, he said. Cao said between July and August last year, Qiao paid a successful visit to the five ASEAN nations of Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines, which strengthened bilateral relations and regional economic cooperative ties. The visit also pushed forward the friendly ties and cooperation between the NPC and the ASEAN countries' parliaments, contributing to safeguarding the regional peace and stability, he said. Cao disclosed that during his visit, Qiao is expected to exchange views with the parliament and government leaders of the three countries on bilateral relations, exchanges and cooperation between the NPC and the those parliaments as well as international issues of common concern. Qiao will also visit some enterprises, scientific and research institutions, schools and ports and make wide contacts with personages from all walks of life, he added. Cao said China has enjoyed a long history of friendly contacts and traditional friendship with Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The recent years have witnessed sound growth of bilateral relations in political, economic, cultural, scientific and technological fields. The exchange of visits between the NPC and the parliaments of these countries has increased, thus bringing their relationship closer, Cao said. He said the NPC is ready to further its relationship with the parliaments of the three countries, maintain its frequent exchanges of visits with their parliamentary leaders. He expressed the belief that QIAO's visit is bound to give an impetus to the promotion of the ties between China and these three countries and exchanges and cooperation between the NPC and the parliaments in these countries.
