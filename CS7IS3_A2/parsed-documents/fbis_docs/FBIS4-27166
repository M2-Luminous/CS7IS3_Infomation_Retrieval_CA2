About 20 blue-eyed members of the "Russian team" join in this apartment complex' soccer team practice at 0530 every morning. The "Russian team" is merely a pet name given by the residents of this apartment complex, not a real soccer team representing Russia. They are high- level Russian technological brains who have been invited to and are working at the Samsung Space Aeronautical Research Institute. [passage omitted] After an hour of exercise, they come to the office each morning on a 45-seat bus provided by the institute. They are researchers from the SDC [expansion unknown], a company specializing in engine design located in Moscow, Russia. The SDC is a private company formed in 1989 by former researchers of "Soyuz," Russia's state-run engine designing bureau, with a total of 1,500 employees. A total of 28 came to ROK, including seven doctorate-degree holders. Most of them are from the Moscow (?Mollini) University, which is called "Russia's MIT," and from the Moscow Aviation College. They came to this research complex last June under a one-year contract, and live in apartments ranging from 30-pyong [one pyong is equivalent to 3.954 square yards] to 45- pyong in size, provided by Samsung. They participate in debates with researchers from Samsung and in joint research projects, and sometimes offer advice. Their specialized fields are mainly design and manufacturing of industrial gas turbine engines, as well as technological support for production. Samsung Aviation Company has intensively researched this field for several years, according to its long-term development plan. This being the case, the 28 Russians are providing technical training to the Samsung side in a person-to-person basis under a tight schedule in their three respective specialized fields-- combustion, turbine, and compression. Kim Chae-chol (47), director of the company and head of a research and development team, said: The United States and Japan, which have ultramodern technology in these fields, have built thick barriers to protect their technology. Under this situation, cooperation from Russia's technological camp, which competes with the United States for the summit position of the world, is of great help to us. In the event that we obtain a broad range of technology, ranging from basic technology to high-level applied technology, including aircraft engine, the ROK will be able to enter into the rank of 10-top aviation industry states before long. According to the materials of the Ministry of Science and Technology, since scientific and technological exchanges began on a full scale between the two nations in December 1990 when the ROK- Russia agreement on science and technology was concluded, the number of Russian scientists and technicians, who came to the ROK and stayed for over a month, was 95 in 1992 and 116 in 1993. This number is expected to reach 150 this year, thus showing nearly a 25 percent increase each year. [passage omitted] The areas in which Russian scientists have remarkably advanced are ultramodern technology fields including space aeronautics, new materials, machinery, semiconductor, and chemistry, where the domestic technological foundation is relatively weak. Government-supported research institutes, including the Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Atomic Energy Research Institute, Energy Research Institute, Machinery Research Institute, and Standardization Research Institute; civilian enterprises that are in true need of basic and ultramodern science and technology; and even universities, competitively employ Russian scientists and technicians. Thus, they are accelerating the development of new technology. In particular, practical joint research results have appeared in succession in certain research project domains. Such results are being accepted as a "green light" for strengthening the nation's competitive power in industrial fields. [passage omitted] In 1992, the ROK and Russia, for the first time, jointly applied for patents for automobile oil filters; carbon pellicle coating equipment, and natural gas engines. This is regarded as an example of the achievements attained with the support of Russian scientists. Civilian business firms are inviting Russian scientists more actively than government-supported research organizations, thus attracting the people's attention. This trend is being led by large business groups such as Samsung, Daewoo, and Lucky-Gold Star. Samsung was the first business group to employ Russian scientists under long-term contracts. In April 1992, Samsung employed Mr. (Georgiy Park), a Moscow University doctorate degree graduate with a major in semiconductors, under a one-year contract basis. He has been in charge of the joint research development of optical electronics at the Samsung General Research Institute in Kihung, Kyonggi Province. He is known to be a third-generation Korean in Russia. He worked as senior researcher at the (Ioepe) Research Institute and (Polius) Research Institute, renowned as authoritative research institutes in Russia. In addition, the Samsung General Chemical Company invited four technicians from the (Kalkin) Research Institute, which is reputed for its development of new ultramodern materials of synthetic chemistry, to work in its chemical research institute at the Taedok Research Complex, starting in November 1993. [passage omitted] What interests the people is that the Russian technical teams' activities have even extended to the domestic "beer war." On 20 May, the Chillo Group's "Kas Beer" challenged "Hite Beer" and "OB-Ice Beer." [passage omitted] The Russian scientists actively responded to the request for participation in long- and short-term joint projects by major universities including the Seoul University, Inha University, Catholic University, Kyongbuk University, Kyonghui University, and Hongik University, and the number of Russian scientists participating in domestic projects ranges from 20 to 50 each year. The Russian scientists' advance to the ROK has been prompted by the increasing demand for them by our domestic business groups. A ROK business firm can acquire high-level technology, which cannot be obtained from any other advanced country, by paying a low salary of between $1,000 and $2,000 a month. This being the case, the increase in demand is quite natural. On the other hand, the Russian scientists are paid three times more in the ROK than in their home country. However, relevant officials from business circles point out that since the treaty for the prevention of double taxation between the ROK and Russia and other CIS countries has not been concluded, Russian scientists are subject to pay over 20 percent higher tax- rate. As a result, instances in which Russian scientists have refused our side's employment proposals are increasing. Besides, precise materials concerning the background of Russian research institutes and scientists are not available at home, thus causing difficulties in choosing Russian scientists. Yi Chin-kyu, secretary at the technical cooperation section in the Ministry of Science and Technology, pointed out that "Russia has recently emerged rapidly as a source for our nation to import ultramodern technology, pushing aside the United States, Japan, and the European Union. With a view to invigorating the exchange of scientists between the ROK and Russia, the government will abolish various restrictions, including the ratification of the treaty for prevention of double taxation and the simplification of the visa issuance procedure, and will work out plans for the active inducement of Russian scientists."
