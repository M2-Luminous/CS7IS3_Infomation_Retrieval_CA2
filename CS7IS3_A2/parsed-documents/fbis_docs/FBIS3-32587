For 12 days, the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry kept the biggest enterprises in Port-au-Prince closed and will enact new protests if the Armed Forces and Aristide do not restart negotiations, warned business sector spokesman Bernard Craan. "We attained our objective. We have caused a psychological shock, and now everyone understands that we must find a solution quickly," said Craan. In a joint resolution signed by the leaders of several powerful business associations, Haiti's big businessmen asked that everyone sacrifice. The businessmen urged Aristide, overthrown by a military coup on 30 September 91, to appoint as soon as possible a new prime minister to replace Robert Malval, who resigned on 15 December. They also demanded the lifting of economic sanctions imposed by the international community, as well as the resignation of Army Chief General Raoul Cedras, leader of the coup. If these demands are met, the Caribbean country will be close to a solution of the crisis, said the businessmen. Democracy in Haiti was almost reestablished last October, in accordance with an agreement sponsored by the United Nations, but the military prevented Aristide's return, which had been scheduled for 30 October. Until January, when the petroleum embargo began forcing several industries and other enterprises to close their doors, the business sector had been reticent about participating in the political debate on the country's situation. Several business leaders said many businessmen who were doing very well before the 1991 military coup are now in danger of going bankrupt, whereas the new businessmen with ties to the Army are getting rich through preferential treatment from the Customs Department, among other advantages.
