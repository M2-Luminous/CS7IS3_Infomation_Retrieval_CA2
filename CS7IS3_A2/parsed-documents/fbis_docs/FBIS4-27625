In the second day of insurance talks under a restarted bilateral trade "framework," the American side was expected to respond to Japanese complaints that state-by-state licensing arrangements hinder the entry of foreign firms to the U.S. market, the officials said. U.S. officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Japanese officials have said their demand for more uniformity in the U.S. insurance market was their only request in the insurance talks. A unified U.S. licensing model would thus open the way for compromises by both sides. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii vowed "utmost efforts" Wednesday to reach agreement in the talks in time for a July summit of major industrial nations. In the agreement that got the talks back on track after three and a half months, both sides said they would seek to improve access to both markets. Before the breakdown of the framework talks in February, U.S. negotiators avoided specific discussions of U.S. market access problems, saying they were willing to "consult" on U.S. market conditions but not negotiate on them. Indeed, the Japanese officials described the expected U.S. unified licensing model as being for reference. Each U.S. state supervises its own insurance industry, unlike Japan's nationwide standards. Tokyo has called this a barrier to foreign entry, citing cases in which Japanese nonlife insurers required nearly 30 years to receive licenses in all 50 states. The U.S. wants Japan to go slow in deregulating the foreign-dominated "third sector" of its insurance market -- including nursing care and disease coverage. The insurance talks, the first in the framework's three priority areas, began Wednesday in Tokyo. Talks on automobiles and auto parts are to begin Thursday in Washington, and talks on Japanese Government procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment are to begin Friday in Tokyo.
