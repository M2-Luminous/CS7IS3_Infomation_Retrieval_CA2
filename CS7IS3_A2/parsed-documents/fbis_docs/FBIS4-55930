Walesa told reporters after the session that he had asked the prime minister and the cabinet to transfer discussion on topics that "are very important and must not breed conflicts between us" to the KOK forum. The president also described the topics contained in the document, drafted by the National Defence Ministry, as delicate and requiring in-depth discussion. Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak noted that KOK members include the Sejm and Senate speakers, along top representatives of the executive branch. According to Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk, the document was very mature and there was no need for changes in it. He also said that the document concerned very important matters and its final elaboration should not be done under the pressure of time. Kolodziejczyk acknowledged the right of the KOK to deal with the matter. The document provides for the establishment of command centres for the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. The joint commander of all three kinds of Armed Forces would report to the minister of defence. An earlier version of the proposal envisaged that he would report directly to the president.
