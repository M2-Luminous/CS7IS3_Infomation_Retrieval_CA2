Speaking last night in Athens, Kouris also stressed that Turkey's provocations in connection with challenging Greek airspace over the Aegean has caused tension that could erupt into violent incidents at any time. If the violent incidents increase, he added, they could lead to a huge clash. Kouris also said that Turkey's direct military threats, with actions and plans against Cyprus and Greece, come from Ankara's intention to change the balance of power in the region. He said that Greece also faces medium- and long-term threats in relation to Macedonia and North Epirus.
