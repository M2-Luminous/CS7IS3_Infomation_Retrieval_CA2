Tadahiro Sekimoto, chairman of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan, said, "Japan's muse system has been completed and we have no idea of giving up the HDTV system." Sekimoto's comment was in response to the recent widespread misunderstanding that the muse system may be replaced by the "MPEG" system of the United States. The view was triggered by a posts ministry official's remark in February discussing the digital and analog formats for the future HDTV system in Japan. "Analog-or-digital discussion is nonsense. That is based on lack of technological knowledge. In the core part of the muse, signals are digitally processed and the data can be output digitally," Sekimoto said. Sekimoto, also president of NEC Corp., made the remarks at a press conference. Even in an era of multimedia, which need to digitally operate data via optical networks, the muse system will be fully applicable to the next generation high-tech world, Sekimoto said. For instance, Japanese manufacturers have already developed a digital videocassette tape recorder for the muse-HDTV set, Sekimoto said.
