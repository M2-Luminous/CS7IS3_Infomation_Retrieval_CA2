Each new day reveals new hotbeds of social tension. Miners, oil-field workers and gas-field workers are striking. A pre-strike state has been declared by textile and light industry workers and those of a number of other sectors. VUZ [higher educational institution] teachers and students have been pushed to the limit. What can be said about those who, through the actions of the stepfathers of reform, have long since found themselves to be in dire poverty? And they amount to no less than a third of the population! So what now -- a global wave of protest capable, just like a tsunami, of destroying, once and for all, the foundations of stability and burying forever the hopes for economic and social revitalization? "No!" declare commodity producers from a number of Russia's central and northwestern oblasts. A strike is not the way out of the situation. It just aggravates the situation. Having combined their own efforts with the trade unions and drawn up a number of common urgent demands, they are proposing as the last civilized step a constructive dialog with the government and the president on steering the reforms into a creative channel. And so -- the regions have spoken! The government must respond by acting!
