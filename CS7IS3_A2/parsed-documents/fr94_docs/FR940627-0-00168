FR940627-0-00168 FR940627-0-00019 In summary, manufacturers qualifying for small business special provisions for their baseline and non-baseline products (having less than $50 million annual sales) are excused from both Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements, while small manufacturers qualifying for special provisions for their atypical products (having less than $10 million annual sales) are excused only from Tier 2 requirements for these products. Since small business provisions are based on both the annual sales and the product category, the possibility exists for a manufacturer to have some products excused from program requirements while having to comply with testing requirements for others. For example, an additive manufacturer having both baseline and atypical products and annual sales of $30 million can use the special small business provision for the baseline additives, but not for the atypical products. Pursuant to CAA section 211(b), F/FAs which are excused from any program requirements under these special provisions may still be subject to testing under Tier 3 at EPA's discretion (on a case-by-case basis). The Tier 3 testing might include (but would not be necessarily limited to) information which would otherwise have been required under the provisions of Tier 1 and/or Tier 2. XI. Timing and Compliance Requirements The timing and compliance requirements for the F/FA registration program are dependent on the type of product and the registration status of the product. As discussed in Section III.A of this preamble, both Tier 1 and Tier 2 are mandatory requirements for all F/FAs (or groups), except as may be modified by any applicable special provisions. Special provisions affecting the content and/or timing of these requirements are discussed in Sections VII.A.3, VIII.D, and X of this preamble. For F/FAs registered as of the effective date of this rule, Tier 1 data and evidence of a suitable contractual arrangement for satisfactory completion of Tier 2 requirements must be submitted to EPA within three years of the effective date. The results of Tier 2 must be submitted to EPA no later than six years from the effective date. The schedule for completion of any Tier 3 requirements which EPA may prescribe will be determined based on the nature of the particular requirements. The general reporting format for submittal of all of these requirements is described in Section XII. For registrable F/FAs, i.e., F/FAs not registered as of the effective date of this rule but meeting the criteria for grouping with a currently registered fuel or bulk additive in the same fuel family, the content and timing of requirements is essentially the same as for the currently registered F/FAs. Thus, manufacturers of these products will be granted registration and be permitted to market registrable F/FAs upon EPA's receipt of basic registration data for such products. In contrast, for manufacturers of new F/FAs (i.e., F/FAs that are not currently registered and do not meet the registrable criteria), all testing requirements must be completed prior to registration and introduction into commerce, including Tier 3 when prescribed by EPA. After receipt of Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 data, EPA will determine whether the submitted information is in compliance with the specified guidelines and whether further testing of a particular fuel or fuel additive is required under the provisions of Tier 3. For registered F/FAs, EPA intends to determine the adequacy of the submitted data within two years after receipt. However, if EPA is unable to inform the registered manufacturer of the adequacy of the Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 data within two years after submittal, EPA retains the authority to require that satisfactory data be submitted if, upon subsequent review, EPA finds that the original submittal was inadequate for compliance. In such a case, EPA will not hold the manufacturer liable for penalties for violating this rule from the time period between the date on which the data were due and the date on which EPA informs the responsible manufacturer of a violation. Regarding new F/FAs, EPA will send a notification of compliance within six months after submission of Tier 1 and Tier 2 data. If the manufacturer of the new F/FA product does not receive a notification of compliance with Tier 1 and Tier 2 within this time frame, then the manufacturer should assume that the Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements have been satisfactorily met. EPA's determination of the need for Tier 3 testing for new F/FAs will occur within six months after EPA notifies the manufacturer of satisfactory compliance with Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements or within twelve months of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 submittal, whichever occurs first. If Tier 3 testing is deemed necessary, EPA will notify the responsible manufacturer (or group) by certified letter of the specific Tier 3 requirement(s) along with a schedule for compliance and a deadline for submittal of the Tier 3 report to EPA (see Section IX.A). This final rule gives the responsible manufacturer (or group) 60 days to comment on the prescribed Tier 3 requirements, compliance schedule, and submission deadline. In the event that EPA receives no comment within the given period, the manufacturer will be assumed to have consented in full to the prescribed Tier 3 requirements. Compliance with Tier 3 requirements is not optional.
