Garmize: "Reform Will Not Be the Shock Kind--Promises Deputy Social Protection Minister Pavel Kaminskiy"] [Text] The squabble on the pages of the mass media is mild, but the complaints against one another are serious--this is the way the relationships that developed last week can be characterized, but the question concerns only this temporary segment, between the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Social Protection of the Population. The publication by some newspapers on 11 and 12 April of information about an increase in the scale of pensions of separate categories of pensioners starting 1 May, based on the data of Saturday's news conference at the Ministry of Social Protection of the Population, evoked an immediate "refutation" on the part of the [Pension] Fund. But already on Wednesday, 13 April, the ministry came out with a denunciation of the Fund's announcement and with government guarantees. Interested readers have very likely already become familiar with the text of this announcement and the arguments of the ministry on the pages of MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA. Without a doubt they have also read the specifically addressed advances: To whom, when, and to what extent earnings from which the pensions are calculated will be recounted. But although it is infinitely important today and tomorrow, a pension does not exhaust either the depth of the problem of pension security as a whole, or, what is more, urgent reforms in this sphere in the more distant future. Meanwhile, confusion, turmoil, and other unpleasant consequences of haste accompany even the most charitable cause in our country--social protection of the population. Subsidies, indexation, the right to benefits, and nullification or changes in such rights follow one after the other like ball lightning on a graph, and with the same speed. Social security people are unable to calculate, and pensioners and persons with privileges are unable to grasp the text; therefore, they do not tire of complaining. Thus, the taste of victory perhaps goes to Hershey Cola, and not to the state, which is really continuously indexing the scales of pensions and benefits from a meager budget (the reasons for its meagerness are a separate discussion). It is pleasant to report to the readers that the drawback of haste, it seems, is understood in higher governmental echelons. And although, to use army vocabulary, it is still far from an ideal societal structure, no "all hands on deck" jobs and false alarms are expected in the near future in the cause of social protection. Evidence of this is at least the order of priority of the recalculations of earnings from which pensions are estimated. The oldest pensions are subject to recalculation first of all, at least for the purpose of correcting mistakes committed in determining the scale of coefficients in bringing "old" wages up to date. Sociological forecasts even in our society, given the conscientious approach to their compilation, are beginning to gain respect and enjoy serious attention. In speaking about forecasts of this type in relation to the need to change pension legislation, recognition should be given to their futurological value especially. One of the main reasons for reform, for example, is the very complicated, to put it mildly, demographic situation in the country. No offense intended, it is simply a reality: Today there are 360 pensioners and about 400 other social dependents for each 1,000 workers. Until the years 2000-2003, the increase in the proportion of pensioners will be insignificant. But by 2010 such a sharp worsening of the demographic situation is forecast that from 2015-2020 the establishment of a new age pension standard is practically inevitable. The ministry, of course, did not set, nor will it ever set, the task of a barbarous, rapid destruction of the system that has developed. But there is a program that was stringently calculated and reasoned out, and it has to be implemented. It is not necessary to be a Solomon to estimate how the demographic burden will grow on the workers of the 21st century; moreover, a burden not on some kind of Martians, but on today's youngsters. "We hope society will understand us." Commendable foresight. After all, all these liberalizations cause the confusion that literally manna is being strewn from heaven...but on unprepared soil. Well, that is what the harvest is like, from the "pot revolt," to putsches, to the results of elections. Social policy is a system of two communicating vessels. Under current conditions there can be no question of any kind of smooth transition of time. On the contrary, at least the demographic elderly burden table in some countries of the world in 1990, which was presented for review by journalists, guarantees a seething of passions. The column "Russia," with its colossal dubious leadership in this respect, is higher than the United States, the Netherlands, and Spain together with France. And this, you will note, is in the year 1990! But given the birthrate in 1992-1993... It appears we will not cede first place to anyone for a long time yet. Of course, we have heard enough about the reasons for longevity and, as a consequence, the possibility of "prolonged success in the work" of our Western intellectual fellow-beings The ecology, the quality and accessibility of food products, relaxation, everyday amenities... To this, which, by the way, is his own personal reminder, Kaminskiy is ready "to throw up his hands..." But to assert such a significant state of affairs in the country and "to drop one's hands" when the state of affairs is corrected is incompatible. Thus, now is also exactly the time to reason out a smooth transition to a new age qualification, to the retention of justifiable benefits, including age benefits, when going on pension, and the proportion of pensions and wages of working pensioners. And what is more, without draconian measures, and in accordance with common sense and public opinion. Incidentally, public opinion right now does not diverge from common sense with respect to the tendency of the minimum and maximum scales to come closer together. It is now 1:4, but sociologists fear a proportion of 1:2, which for the many who have worked years longer than required for the assignment of a pension, or who were stuck in harmful production, is really unacceptable. What is more, no one plans to cancel compensation payments, and, in addition, the current indexation keeps them at a scale of 19,000 rubles [R]. As for the proportion, the ministry is inclined to a ratio of 1:3. But for the present, according to a statement by P. Kaminskiy, the minimum wage, which has remained unchanged for a rather long time, does not allow him to "change" the scale of recalculations. Thus the minimum pension today of R34,000 (with compensations) is really going nose to nose with the maximum... Seasonal troubles have also not been ignored--camp vouchers for orphaned children, invalids since childhood, and children from poor and large families. According to a decree of the government of 4 April, parents pay only 10 percent of their cost, and the rest is handled by social insurance, trade unions, and local funds for protection of the population. Vouchers for invalid children from incomplete families and orphans are even cheaper. The attitude toward pension funds was expressed. There should be no objection, of course, to nonstate, supplementary forms of protection of the population. The ministry even held a seminar with the participation of representatives of almost 160 funds that underwent expert analysis in this ministry. At the same time, concern was caused by the promises of some funds of guarantees that were almost state guarantees, which does not correspond to reality! But, Kaminskiy repeated, these are nonstate funds, and there can be no question of state guarantees for fund obligations. Public opinion causes, accompanies, and mutually also helps or preserves any reform. The pension fund, like no other, must be optimally reasonable in order that old people and newborns can nevertheless survive together with all of society under conditions of changes that for us are necessary and perhaps even historic.
