The great motherland is ushering in 1994, a year with plenty of struggles and plenty of hope. With deep feelings, we are extending New Year congratulations to the people of all nationalities of the country; to our compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao; and to compatriots living abroad. In the year which has just gone by, the entire party and the people of all nationalities throughout the country -- continuing to firmly and resolutely implement the guidelines of the important talks made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping during his south China tour and those set by the 14th CPC National Congress -- have seized the opportunities and deepened reform, thus making an important stride toward establishing a socialist market economic structure. Throughout the country there is a bumper harvest, industry grew, foreign trade was active, the market was brisk, and the people's living standards improved further. Taking a broad view of the great motherland, we saw the economy develop rapidly; social and political stability was achieved; unity and harmony among nationalities was achieved; and new progress was made in various fields of undertakings, all of which presented a scene of vitality and vigor. Initial results were achieved in the fight against corruption. The building of a spiritual civilization was constantly strengthened. Marked results were achieved in diplomatic work. Successful visits to foreign countries by Jiang Zemin and other party and state leaders enhanced China's friendship with the governments and peoples of various countries and created a more favorable international environment for China's modernization construction. These achievements have further enhanced the prestige of the party and the government, the prestige of our people's republic, and the prestige of socialism in China; they have strengthened the confidence of the people across the country in advancing victoriously along the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The year 1994 will be a crucial year for us to advance on the crest of victories to accelerate reforms and development. In the new year, we must implement in an all-round manner the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; while focusing on the central task of economic construction, we must advance the socialist market economy, socialist democratic politics, and the building of a socialist spiritual civilization. This year we should accelerate the pace of building a socialist market economic structure and open wider to the outside world. Party and government leaders at all levels must make meticulous arrangements for implementing the plans of the central authorities. In the process of reform, it is necessary to earnestly grasp two important matters. First, it is necessary to strengthen the position of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy in order to ensure the steady growth of agriculture and the rural economy as a whole. Second, it is necessary to improve state-owned large and medium enterprises as well as increase their vitality in order to enable them to play the dominant and leading role in economic development. It is necessary to strengthen and improve macroeconomic control; vigorously adjust the economic structure; and heighten economic results in order to maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. This year our tasks of reform and development are very arduous. We should allow reform to promote development and allow development to support reform. The increasingly stronger integration of these two principles is very important to the realization of our objectives by the end of this century. In order to fulfill the tasks for 1994, we must first make greater efforts to arm all party members, particularly leading cadres at all levels, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Theory comes from practice, and it also guides practice. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a powerful ideological weapon to guide the Chinese people to realize their grand ideal of invigorating the Chinese nation. In the new year, leading cadres at all levels must conscientiously study volume three of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" to have a more thorough understanding of basic points of view contained in the volume, particularly those on emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. They should vigorously promote the revolutionary spirit of exploring new paths and putting forward new ideas which was seen in the past decade or so; they should improve their leadership skills in carrying out reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. We must build a contingent of cadres capable of going deep into the realities of life, maintaining ties with the masses, putting the general interest above all else, and honestly performing their official duties so the vast ranks of party cadres will serve the people wholeheartedly and be good pacesetters in accelerating reform and development. The interests of the people and their happiness are the starting point and foundation for all our work. Reform and construction are the cause for thousands upon millions of people. As long as we steadfastly rely on the vast number of workers, peasants, intellectuals, and cadres at various levels; mobilize all positive factors; and unite with all forces which can be united with, then there will be no difficulties which cannot be surmounted. In the new year we must carry forward in a better manner the fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses and do a good job in guiding, protecting, and utilizing their zeal for reform and construction. When new reform measures are introduced, we must do a good job in publicizing and explaining them. We must pay attention to methods of work and be good at analyzing and handling various kinds of contradictions arising within the people under the new circumstances. We must always care for the people, do everything within our power to protect their interests, and do more practical things for them so their living standards and initiative will keep rising. Acceleration of reform and construction represents a grand and complex feat of social systems engineering. We must be good at grasping and applying Marxist materialist dialectics; we must correctly understand and handle various evolving relationships, especially those between reform, economic growth, and stability as well as between local and national interests. Reform and development furnish a solid foundation for social and political stability, while the latter in turn provide a major guarantee for the former. As reform and opening up increase the pace, we must firmly bear in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important idea that "stability is of overriding importance," persist in the policy of attaching equal importance to both the material and spiritual civilizations, and be careful not to emphasize one and neglect the other. While continuing to increase the establishment of a socialist democracy and legal system, as well as the socialist spiritual civilization, we must constantly consolidate and promote a political situation marked by stability and unity. As reform deepens by the day, it is even more important to take the overall situation into account and properly handle the relationship between local and national interests. In a large country like ours where conditions vary in a thousand ways from region to region, difficulties and contradictions are multitudinous. It is not easy to run such a country well, and we must depend on the entire nation and the entire party to work together with one heart. This is also one of our major advantages. In thinking over a problem or in undertaking work, leading comrades of all localities and departments must take the overall situation into account and conscientiously subject local interests to national ones. The future of our motherland is splendid; the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation have heavy responsibilities on their shoulders. The new year beckons us to create more brilliant successes. The entire party and the entire nation must unite more closely under the leadership of the Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core; must uphold Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line; and must work hard with a pioneering spirit of the new period so as to achieve new progress and greater success.
