FR940719-0-00065 FR940719-0-00021 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 48 CFR Part 231 Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Indirect Costs of Institutions of Higher Education AGENCY: Department of Defense (DOD). ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Director of Defense Procurement has issued an interim rule amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to prohibit limitation on reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher learning under DoD contracts. DATES: Effective Date: May 5, 1994. Comment Date: Comments on the interim rule should be submitted in writing at the address shown below on or before July 18, 1994, to be considered in the formulation of the final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: Defense Acquisition Regulations Council, ATTN: Mr. Eric Mens, OUSD(A)DP, IMD 3D139,3062 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301&hyph;3062. Telefax number (703) 604&hyph;5971. Please cite DFARS Case 93&hyph;D317 in all correspondence. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Eric Mens, (703) 604&hyph;5929. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background Section 481 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;160) prohibits DoD from placing any limitation on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher learning. For most such educational institutions, contract cost allowability is determined under FAR 31.3 which imposes Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A&hyph;21, Cost Principles for Educational Institutions. OMB Circular A&hyph;21 imposes a 26 percent ceiling on indirect administrative costs of educational institutions. Section 841 abrogates that limitation for DoD contracts unless the institution requests that DoD waive the prohibition in order to simplify the institution's management of cost reimbursements for DoD contracts. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The interim rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. The revisions flow directly from section 841 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;160), no variation from the statute is allowed, and the regulations impose no independent economic impact on small entities. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) has not been performed, however, comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS subpart will be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite 5 U.S.C. 610 (DFARS Case 93&hyph;D317) in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) does not apply because the revisions do not impose any new recordkeeping requirements or information collection requirements or collection of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. D. Determination To Issue an Interim Rule A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defense to issue this rule as an interim rule. Urgent and compelling reasons exist to promulgate this rule before affording the public an opportunity to comment. The statutory prohibition against the capping of otherwise allowable indirect costs of higher institutions under DoD contracts was effective upon enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;160) on November 30, 1994. Therefore, it is essential that guidance be issued as expeditiously as possible. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 231 Government procurement. Claudia L. Naugle, Deputy Director, Defense Acquisition Regulations Council. Therefore, 48 CFR Part 231 is amended as follows: 1. The authority citation for 48 CFR part 231 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 41 U.S.C. 421 and 48 CFR part 1. PART 231_CONTRACT COST PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES 2. Subpart 231.3 is added to read as follows: Subpart 231.3_Contracts With Educational Institutions 231.303 Requirements. (1) Pursuant to section 841 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;160), no limitation may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher education under a DoD contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless that same limitation is applied uniformly to all other organizations performing similar work under DoD contracts. The 26 percent limitation imposed on administrative indirect costs by OMB Circular No. A&hyph;21 shall not be applied to DoD contracts awarded on or after November 30, 1993, to institutions of higher education because the same limitation is not applied to other organizations performing similar work. (2) The cognizant administrative contracting officer may waive the prohibition in 231.303(1) if the governing body of the institution of higher education requests the waiver to simplify the institution's overall management of DoD cost reimbursements under DoD contracts.
