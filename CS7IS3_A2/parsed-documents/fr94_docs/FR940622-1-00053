FR940622-1-00053 FR940622-1-00018 40 CFR Part 180 [OPP&hyph;300348; FRL&hyph;4871&hyph;3] RIN 2070&hyph;AC18 Amended Tolerance Exemptions for Encapsulating Polymers AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This document proposes that the tolerance exemptions for three encapsulating polymers, poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-eicosene), poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-hexadecene), and vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer be amended to removed language not directly related to the inert ingredient exemption and to replace the specific tolerance exemption listings in 40 CFR part 180 for these polymers with general listings under 40 CFR 180.1001(c). This change was requested by International Specialty Products. On its own inititative, the Agency is also deleting similar language in the tolerance exemption for cross-linked polyurea-type encapsulating polymer. DATES: Written comments, identified by the document control number [OPP-300348], must be received on or before July 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: By mail, submit written comments to: Public Response Section, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Tina Levine, Registration Support Branch, Registration Division (7505C), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: 2800 Crystal Drive, North Tower, Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-308-8393. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: International Specialty Products (ISP), 1361 Alps Rd., Wayne, NJ 07470, has submitted petitions to amend the exemptions from tolerance for poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-eicosene), pesticide petition (PP) 4E4307, poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-hexadecene), PP 4E4304, and vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer, PP 4E4306, to remove the specific exemptions in 40 CFR part 180 for these polymeric encapsulating agents and list them in 40 CFR 180.1001(c). The changes would eliminate the following statement which was included in each separate exemption from tolerance: ``Registration of each new pesticide formulation incorporating this dispersing agent must be supported by residue data for the active ingredient(s).'' The petition notes that it is EPA's policy that the data requirements for registration are associated with registered pesticide products, not inert ingredients. Data may be required on a case-by-case basis for a registered product when substantial changes are made in the inert ingredients included in the product's formulation, but such data requirements are not triggered universally by the addition of a specific inert ingredient to the formulation. The addition of this language to the tolerance exemption was triggered by concern that the nature of the inert encapsulating material may affect the residue levels of active ingredients and, therefore, the Agency needed a mechanism to ensure that each formulation of this type be evaluated for this possibility. However, the Agency agrees that including this language in the exemption from tolerance expression is an inappropriate way to obtain such assurance. In August 1993, the Agency issued to product managers internal guidance entitled, ``Data Requirements for Formulations and Translation of Residue Data between Formulations.'' The document informed product managers that any new food-use pesticide product which is considered a microencapsulated or controlled-release formulation should be reviewed by residue chemists to determine ``if there has been a change in the inert ingredients (especially the encapsulating polymer) that could affect residues of the active ingredient.'' This internal guidance should address the concerns which led to the inclusion of the objectionable language in these tolerance exemptions. In addition to the three polymers of these petitions, the Agency has noted that there is a specific exemption for cross-linked polyurea-type encapsulating polymer (40 CFR 180.1039) that contains the same language as the three polymers for which petitions were submitted as well as additional language on quality control procedures to ensure predictable release characteristics and relatively uniform toxicity of various production lots. This language also refers to data requirements for the encapsulated pesticide product formulation and is not appropriate to the tolerance exemption for the inert ingredient. Therefore, the Agency has also decided to amend this exemption to delete the second sentence of the tolerance exemption. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [OPP-300348]. All written comments filed in response to this document will be available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the Virginia address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Food additives, Pesticides and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: July 13, 1994. Stephen L. Johnson, Acting Director, Registration Divison, Office of Pesticide Programs. Therefore, it is proposed that 40 CFR part 180 be amended as follows: PART 180_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 180 continues to read as follows: Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346a and 371. 2. Section 180.1001(c) is amended by adding and alphabetically inserting the inert ingredients, to read as follows: §180.1001 Exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance. *␣␣*␣␣*␣␣*␣␣* (c) *␣*␣* ␣ 1Inert ingredients 1Limits 1Uses ␣ *␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣* Poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-eicosene) (CAS Reg.

Section 180.1039 is revised to read as follows: §180.1039 Cross-linked polyurea-type encapsulating polymer; exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. The cross-linked polyurea-type polymer formed by the reduction of a mixture of toluene diisocyanate and polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate is exempted from the requirement of a tolerance when used as an inert encapsulating material for pesticide formulations applied prior to planting. The inert will constitute no more than 10 percent by weight of any pesticide formulation. §180.1104 [Removed] 4. Section 180.1104 Poly(vinylpyrrolidone/1-eicosene); exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is removed. §180.1105 [Removed] 5. Section 180.1105 Poly(vinylpyrrolidone/1-hexadecene); exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is removed. §180.1106 [Removed] 6. Section 180.1106 Vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer; exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is removed.
