The British foreign secretary declared that particular attention was paid to the situation in Crimea during his conversation with the Russian president. He said that the Russian side occupies a clear and precisely expressed position, considering this issue to be Ukraine's internal affair. The Crimean peninsula is a part of Ukrainian territory, therefore disputes arising around it must be resolved through dialogue between Kiev and Simferopol. Overall, Douglas Hurd summed up, complete understanding was reached on the whole range of problems discussed during the visit. The Foreign Office head confirmed that Queen Elizabeth II has accepted an invitation from the Russian president to visit Russia, and that this visit could take place before the end of this year. The same day the British minister left Moscow for Kiev.
