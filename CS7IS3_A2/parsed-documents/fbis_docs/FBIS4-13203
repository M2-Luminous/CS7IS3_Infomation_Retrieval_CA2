FBIS4-13203 "drnes075dd_94003" FBIS-NES-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas Activist Says Ready for `Genuine Peace' Hamas Activist Says Ready for `Genuine Peace' TA1904111094 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English 1000 GMT 19 Apr 94 TA1904111094 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el English BFN [Text] The security forces this morning arrested about 50 Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists from Gaza city, Rafah, and the Jabalyah refugee camp. The arrests follow an earlier sweep over the weekend, when more than 50 Hamas activists were also arrested. [A report by military correspondent Yariv Ben-Yehuda on Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1000 GMT on 19 April adds: "It appears that 10 of those arrested are former deportees who returned to the Gaza Strip from southern Lebanon a few months ago. Tension in the strip is high since the arrests were carried out. Arab sources warned today that retaliatory terror attacks by Hamas are to be expected in the wake of the arrests which, according to them, seriously harmed the organization."] Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, one of the Hamas deportees who returned from south Lebanon and acts as a spokesman for Hamas in the strip, denied the people arrested were senior activists. Speaking to reporter Mark Weiss, al-Zahhar also puts the number of those arrested at up to 200: [Begin recording] [Al-Zahhar] The number, up to last night, ranged from 150 up to 200, and the people who were arrested are not activists. They were previously under detention or had already been sentenced. There is no reason for arresting any of them because they are well known as Islamic people. They have no participation in the process carried on in the area. [Weiss] Do you think this is an Israeli crackdown following the 'Afula and Hadera bombings? [Al-Zahhar] Do you think the people who were arrested in the Gaza Strip are involved in what happened in 'Afula and Hadera? [Weiss] An interview was published in Jordan this morning from Musa Abu-Marzuq, the head of the Hamas politburo, and he said that Hamas may be willing to make peace with Israel if Israel pulls out of the occupied territories and dismantles the settlements. Do you see this as a change in Hamas policy? [Al-Zahhar] I actually until now did not read the statements thoroughly, and after its discussion, I think after that I will be ready to give my personal idea. [Weiss] Would you support peace with Israel if they withdrew from the territories and pulled out of the settlements? [Al-Zahhar] This actually should be thoroughly studied, because about what we are going to negotiate? What will be the relation of the occupied territories, and what will be the contradiction between this implementation of policy with the Cairo and Oslo agreements? So, what type of peace Israel are going to give? If they are ready to give a genuine peace, a permanent peace, a justice peace, I think nobody will refuse. [end recording]
