Emphasizing the significance of an adequate opening toward the private sector and toward market forces, she said: "We are speaking about a figure that will be five times larger than the accrued investment reported up to 1993." In this respect, she said she is pleased to note that the government, businessmen, academicians, and politicians agree on "a guiding approach to the country's development model that should be followed in the short and medium term." Canale noted that China has become the third leading investor in our country. She added that there is great demand in China for products and raw materials that we could sell them if we had the adequate scale of production. During a lecture at the Peruvian Center for International Studies (Cepei), the industry minister again called upon businessmen to redouble their efforts to reach other markets and the various trade blocs existing in the world. She emphasized the need to reach Asian and European markets with competitive prices. Commenting on Peruvian relations with Pacific Rim countries, Canale said efforts are being made to promote relations not only with China and Japan, but also with other countries because the most dynamic economies are located in that area. Regarding Peru's geographic location, she said: Our geographic, economic, and labor conditions will enable us to rapidly win those major markets.
