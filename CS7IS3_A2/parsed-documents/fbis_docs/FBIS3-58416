NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner described the Partnership for Peace program, which was devised in Washington and is intended to let the reform states that emerged from the rubble of the former East Bloc lean on NATO but deny them direct access, as a "historic turning point." In less pretentious words, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl spoke of a "decisive step," which would have to be followed by intensive contacts not only with those countries that are seeking NATO membership but also with those countries, such as Russia and Ukraine, that are not among the group of candidates. That is balsam on the wounds of the disappointed; one will talk to them, but one will not embrace them -- not yet. This is not contradictory to the fact that on his visit to Prague and Moscow, Bill Clinton will go further than just shaking people's hands and take one or the other Partner for Peace into his arms; after all, it is mainly the U.S. President's policy not to extend NATO toward the east at the current stage and to prevent an "over-commitment" in Europe. This position is not at all merely determined by the intention not to provoke Russia, to strengthen its reform forces, and not to provide their nationalist opponents with any new arguments; behind it is also the understanding that East and Central Europe has not yet settled down and that it still harbors a considerable dangerous potential. This potential is not only the result of the sometimes strong ups and downs of Moscow politics but it is somehow locally rooted. Nothing shows that more clearly than the competition between the Visegrad countries (Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic), as to which of them is more worthy of NATO membership. These four primary membership candidates neither follow a single course nor can it be said that they have already settled all the problems between them. It is not only a "gray area of security," as Kohl put it, but also a gray area in a political respect. That is quite natural and it is reflected in the differing intensity of the feeling of insecurity, which is stronger in Poland than, for example, in Hungary. This is why Polish President Lech Walesa stands in the first rank of critics of NATO's cautious position; for him it is a consequence of Russian blackmailing. However, his severe verdict fails to take account of the fact that, apart from Slovakia and Lithuania, Poland is the only would-be NATO member with a government in which neo- or reform-communist forces play a significant role. This would also have to be taken into consideration if NATO were to begin defining membership criteria for East and Central European members. Nevertheless, Walesa's proposal to accept even Russia as a NATO member to control its arsenal of nuclear arms does retain its humorous fascination. In the light of NATO's stance in the conflict in Bosnia it has turned out that the Western alliance is not at all able to prevent all wars or to end them in time; it is, thus, all the more surprising that the Visegrad states and even the Baltic countries assume that NATO might have this very power. The Clinton Administration has drawn different conclusions from the experience of helplessness: since the transatlantic alliance basically has no longer any enemies (not even Russia), security has to be defined differently today. For Washington, a security policy of a new kind must focus on the control of arms of mass destruction and the prevention of new conflict situations and in the creation of stability. It is more of a development program than a strategy of military containment. And there are no plans for security guarantees, as requested by the East and Central Europeans as a substitute for direct NATO membership. To cover the "gray zone" with security guarantees should deter all those who are now requesting them: Poland had such guarantees in 1939, but they became effective only six years later, six years too late.
