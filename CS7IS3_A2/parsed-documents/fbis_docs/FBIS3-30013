It is the first scale capable of absolute submicron-level calibrations, a senior company researcher said. The researcher, Kenichi Mizuishi, chief of Hitachi's Advanced Technology Development Department, said the microscale is graduated in 0.2 microns (a 5,000th of a millimeter), and may be used in measuring the accuracy of, for instance, scanning electron microscopes (SEMs). SEMs are used in measuring the line width -- 0.2 to 0.25 micron -- of circuits of a 256-megabit memory chip believed to come into practical use at the end of the current century. The National Research Laboratory of Meteorology has cooperated with Hitachi in the development of the microscale. The development will be reported by Hitachi at a conference of the Society of Optical Engineering to be held in the United States starting February 28, Mizuishi said. He said the chemical etching and laser interferometer lithographic processes, used in the production of semiconductor memory chips, has been employed in the development of the microscale. Interferometer is an instrument that utilizes the interference of waves of light for precise determinations of distance or wavelength. In the case of the microscale, if electron microscope electron beams collide with the scale, it hardly causes distortions in the scale, and the microscale is suited for quantity production, the researcher said. He said the company hopes to commercialize the microscale within a couple of years.
