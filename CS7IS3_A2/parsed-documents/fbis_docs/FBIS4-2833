They discussed and reached three points of common understanding on the pleasure-boat fire incident in the Qiandao Hu. They are: First, at present, it is necessary to make all efforts to speed up the investigation of the Qiandao Hu incident and to publish the cause as soon as possible; second, the two organizations agree in principle that they exchange opinions on incidents involving the lives and damage to property of compatriots of the two sides; and third, both organizations should do all they can within their respective authority to clear up the negative effects of the incident. According to a briefing, Tang Shubei told Shi Qiping: While contacts and exchanges between compatriots of the two sides are growing daily, we are profoundly saddened by the Qiandao Hu incident, which, to our great sorrow, resulted in the deaths of 24 Taiwan compatriots, who had come to the mainland for sightseeing, and eight mainland compatriots. On behalf of the ARATS, he grieved for the victims and asked Mr. Shi to once again convey deep condolences to their families after he went back to Taibei [Taipei]. Tang Shubei said: Leaders of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have paid close attention to the incident. They promptly instructed the Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee and the provincial people's government to rush to rescue victims, to properly deal with the aftermath, and to step up efforts to investigate the cause of the incident. The State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, the Public Security and Communications Ministries, the National Tourism Administration, the Zhejiang provincial and Hangzhou city governments, and other relevant departments went into action immediately. Recently, leaders of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council again ordered the Zhejiang CPC Committee and the government to make all efforts to speed up the investigation of the cause while earnestly dealing with the incident's aftermath. Should the involvement of external forces be discovered and verified, it is imperative to harshly punish them regardless of who was involved. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council also instructed the perimeter provinces and cities to actively cooperate with the work conducted in Zhejiang. Tang Shubei said: In the course of handling the incident, the Zhejiang departments concerned did all they could to respect the wishes of the bereaved families and to provide them with all kinds of help; and explained to them why some things could not be done because of the limitation of local conditions. We should say that the mainland has paid close attention to promptly dealing with the aftermath. Tang Shubei said: In the process of handling the incident, ARATS, in the spirit of assisting relevant departments to deal with problems arising from exchanges between compatriots of the two sides and of safeguarding the lawful rights and interests of compatriots of the two sides, has actively cooperated with and assisted the competent authorities to promptly deal with the incident. It also dispatched its deputy secretary general, Liu Gangqi, to visit the incident site to help deal with relevant matters. ARATS immediately contacted the SEF to inform it of its handling of the incident, and did so in the capacity of a nongovernment organization. Tang Shubei emphatically said: Taiwan compatriots' lives, property, and security are safeguarded on the mainland. State law protects Taiwan compatriots the same way as mainlanders, and there is definitely no such problem as discrimination. The unfortunate mishap [shi gu 0057 2399] on Qiandao Hu was an unexpected incident in the contacts and exchanges between compatriots of the two sides of the strait, and it cannot possibly, and should not, influence the development of relations between the two sides; still less should it be turned into an incident of a "political nature." We hope that Taiwan compatriots and concerned departments in Taiwan will look at the mishap objectively and calmly. As soon as the truth of the case is found, ARATS will inform the SEF as quickly as possible in an appropriate way. Tang Shubei said: Incidents that harm the normal rights and interests of compatriots of the two sides of the Strait, including incidents that cause serious threat to lives and property of compatriots of the two sides, have happened in the past. ARATS always holds that those incidents should be solved promptly through negotiations between the ARATS and SEF. Concerning the SEF proposal on "discussing matters on safeguarding people's lives, property, and security," Tang Shubei said that, through preparations, the two organizations could and should exchange opinions on the issue of harm to lives, property, and security of compatriots of the two sides of the Strait. Tang Shubei also said: The economic and trade exchanges and contacts between people of the two sides are good things that are beneficial to the development of relations between the two sides, because compatriots on both sides will benefit through those exchanges and contacts. We do not want the development of relations between the two sides to be obstructed by the Qiandao Hu mishap, still less let one side use this unexpected incident to limit and stop contacts between the two sides and put pressure on the other side. ARATS noticed that in the course of handling this unexpected incident, some of the views in Taiwan tended to go to extremes and we are understandable in regard to this matter. However, it should be pointed out that a very small number of people attacked and even slandered the mainland in an unbridled way. This will only increase distrust between compatriots of the two sides and deteriorate the hard-earned relations between the two sides of the strait. Regarding this point, it is hoped that the SEF will ask concerned departments in Taiwan to pay attention to the matter. Tang Shubei also pointed out: Prior to clearly finding out and announcing the truth of the mishap, using guesswork to spread rumors that the mainland is hiding the truth is totally groundless. As to dependents of Taiwan compatriots who were killed in the mishap and concerned departments in Taiwan holding different views regarding the handling of the mishap by the concerned local departments, a responsible person of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office said in his talk on 9 April that it is believed that the broad masses of Taiwan compatriots will understand the measures taken and efforts made by concerned departments on the mainland in handling the mishap. Meanwhile, we are also willing to hear positive suggestions and opinions from all sides, including those from Taiwan compatriots. In yesterday's meeting, Mr. Shi Qiping also expressed the SEF's opinions to Tang Shubei.
