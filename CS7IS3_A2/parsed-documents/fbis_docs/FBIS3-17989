The policemen managed to get into the buidling and it was Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze who came out to talk to them. They said that Kviraya is an "unworthy and incompetent man suspected of corruption and mafia links". Shevardnadze succeeded to bring the passions down and explained to Zeikidze and his policemen that their behaviour was incorrect. The group left the building after that. Kviraya was appointed the interior minister by the parliament.
