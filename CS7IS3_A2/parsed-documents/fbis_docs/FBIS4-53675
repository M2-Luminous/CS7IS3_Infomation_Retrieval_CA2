"As the Northern Territories are Japan's inherent territory (Japan) should not authorize any Russian intervention, including joint fishing ventures," said Sato, who is director general of the Hokkaido and Okinawa Development Agencies. Nikolai Pokidin, head of the South Kurils Administration, earlier this year proposed that both sides strike a commercial deal on fishing in the area. But Tokyo has rejected the proposal out of concern that such a step could be taken as an indirect recognition of Russian sovereignty over the territory. Sato visited the city of Nemuro on the eastern tip of Hokkaido to view the Russian-held islands from Nosappu Point. Japan has long demanded the return of Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai group of islets, known in Japan as the Northern Territories, which were seized by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. Russia has voiced protest over hundreds of border violations by Japanese fishing boats in the area over the last year.
