In a meeting between the prime ministers of both countries this morning, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin denied reports that Russia is going to sell arms to Syria. IDF Radio's correspondent Qobi Meydan reports from Moscow: [Begin recording] [Meydan] Israeli sources described the meeting between the Russian and Israeli prime ministers as good, even excellent. The highlight of this meeting was Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's proposal for military and defense cooperation with Israel. At the same time, Mr. Chernomyrdin denied that Russia is about to sell arms to Syria. When the issue came up, the Russian prime minister, after denying such reports, turned to Rabin and suggested that Israel purchase weapons from the Russians. Rabin, for his part, raised some additional issues. [Rabin] I raised several issues in the hope that Russia, which is currently resuming its activity as cosponsor [last word in English] of the negotiations, will help us reach agreements first with the Palestinians and Syria -- which of course are the two key issues -- and then with Jordan and Lebanon. We also hope that Russia will use its connections with Iran, Syria, and other Arab countries to create an atmosphere conducive to peace. [Meydan] Viktor Chernomyrdin said that Russia will remain an active mediator in the Middle East peace process, just as it has been active in other areas of conflict, such as Yugoslavia. The two men also discussed the recent tension surrounding Russia's uncoordinated involvement in the peace process. Both sides preferred to withhold comment on this. As for economic issues, a series of agreements, from agriculture to culture and science, were signed at the meeting. The trade agreement between Russia and Israel has still not been signed. The Russians are pressing to sign the trade agreement in the course of Rabin's visit, perhaps by tomorrow. Experts are currently at work formulating the agreement. The problem is Israel's fears of Russia flooding the local market with cheap products. Prime Minister Rabin, who realized how important this is to the Russian officials, instructed the Israeli team to step up its efforts to find an acceptable formulation that will allow the agreement to be signed. At the Jewish Agency building in Moscow, Rabin met with Russian immigrants due to fly to Israel tonight. He also met with a group of Hebrew teachers from various CIS republics. Rabin told everyone that despite all the difficulties, their place is in Israel.

The report adds that "Rabin told his host that Ron Arad is being held either by Iran or by an Iranian element in Lebanon" and that "Chernomyrdin promised that Russia will do everything in its power to come up with information on this matter. Another issue discussed was the sale of a Russian power plant to Iran. The Russian prime minister promised that the plant would supply only electric power and plays no part in Iran's attempts to attain nuclear capability." Qol Yisra'el notes that "the Russians continue to support sanctions against Iraq, a fact that was also welcomed by the Israeli delegation."]
