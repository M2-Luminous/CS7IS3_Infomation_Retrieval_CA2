Specialists from various Ukrainian scientific and state structures and from research institutions of NATO, Russia, Moldova, Great Britain, the United States, and Italy participated in it. Ukraine was represented by one of the organizers of the conference -- the IGRSI. Its director Dmytro Vydrin comments upon the course and results of the conference. [Vydrin] It was one of Ukraine's first conferences on "conflictology." We are pleased that we managed to hold it, as it seems to me, there is one major shortcoming in Ukraine, namely, its introvert political mentality: Almost all political problems that Ukraine deals with, directly concern Ukraine alone. From the viewpoint of common sense and pragmatism, this might seem normal. However, we profess a different idea: We believe that a state may only become a normal one if it shows interest in problems that go beyond its geographical borders. That is why it was, perhaps, the very first conference where Ukrainian specialists analyzed not only internal problems, but also those of the Dniester Region and of the "hot spots," such as those in Belfast, Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and so on. As a matter of fact, our task consisted of reviewing all such spots in order to determine whether, today, mechanisms exist that are capable of helping in the resolution of such conflicts. God forbid the need to use this experience in Ukraine. We hope that Ukraine will avoid this danger, but if, to our greatest pity, we fail in this, we would not like to be "naked" both intellectually and psychologically when confronted by it. [Skachko] Was there a specific result of the conference? [Vydrin] As is normal for initial conferences, it took us half of the time to unify the terminology and to begin to understand one another. Then we tried specifically, for example, to determine the limit of resorting to military force in conflicts and the limit of using peacekeeping forces and actions, as well as their possibilities and limitations. For the time being, we have just addressed this theme. At the next conference, we will get closer to elaborating specific recipes and recommendations, which we will be able to offer to politicians. [Skachko] Did the conference result in comprehending the fact that interregional conflicts are perfectly possible in Ukraine? [Vydrin] Our scientific community became divided into "pessimists" and "optimists." I belong to such "optimists" and believe that, unfortunately, conflicts are virtually unavoidable, although our colleagues, in particular, the British ones, believe that it is quite easy to avoid conflicts in Ukraine. However, I am convinced that it is hardly possible to outsmart history, which teaches us that fragments of empires become arenas for conflicts. There have been almost no exceptions in history.... [Skachko] Isn't the situation in the Crimea and in the Donetsk-Luhansk Region the reason for your optimism in inverted commas? [Vydrin] Yes, we gave much of our time to discussing the situation in those regions and, unfortunately, discussed it in the context of situations analogous to those in the Dniester Region and in Karabakh. Unfortunately, for us, the Crimea is a potential Dniester Region or Karabakh. We gather in advance in order to prevent it from becoming an actual situation. [Skachko] D. Vydrin also added to this that the IGRSI plans to hold such conferences twice a year, and this week, the conference on "Interethnic Conflicts in the Post-Totalitarian World" was in progress in Kiev. The subject matters are related, because not infrequently, interethnic strife becomes that same internal factor that generates interregional conflicts and even wars. It is, indeed, better to prevent conflicts than to resolve them.
