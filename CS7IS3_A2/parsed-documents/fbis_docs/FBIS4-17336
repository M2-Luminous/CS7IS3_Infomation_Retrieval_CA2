This was the edict issued on 6 October 1993, enabling Presidential Administration Head Sergey Filatov and a special commission to draw up a list of 151 deputies to be deprived of the payment of one year's salary based on the salary they were paid in their final month as deputy. This sum amounts to about 3-4 million rubles and is being paid to each black listed deputy from the state budget. The issue of whether they should be allowed to keep the Moscow flats they were allocated when working for the Supreme Soviet is also still being debated. But on the eve of the signing of the treaty on civil accord, the president has decided to meet the opposition half way in order to achieve civil peace in Russia.
