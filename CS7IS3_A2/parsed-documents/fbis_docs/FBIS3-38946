Otherwise, NATO is threatening to destroy Serb positions with air strikes. Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told the press in Bonn today that everything must be done to end any further bloodshed: "There has to be an end to the siege of Sarajevo." Kinkel spoke of "decisions with very far-reaching implications." However, a political solution still has priority over a military one, he said. NATO hopes that there will be no need to implement the decision it has made. A peaceful solution cannot, however, be achieved against the wishes of the three warring parties -- the Moslems, Serbs, and Croats. He therefore appealed urgently to the three warring parties to do their utmost for a peaceful solution.
