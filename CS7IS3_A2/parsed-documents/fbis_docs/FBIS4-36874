FBIS4-36874 "drnes114dd_94019" FBIS-NES-94-114 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Official Condemns Alleged Kuwaiti Aid to Likud Official Condemns Alleged Kuwaiti Aid to Likud JN1306160894 Baghdad INA in Arabic 1150 GMT 13 Jun 94 JN1306160894 Baghdad INA Arabic BFN [Text] [No dateline as received]--Muhammad Subayh, Palestinian permanent representative to the Arab League and secretary of the Palestine National Council [PNC], has said some Kuwaiti elements have met with Zionist party figures, and are providing huge financial assistance to the racist Likud Party. In an exclusive statement to the INA correspondent in Cairo, Subayh added that extending aid to the racist Likud Party is a serious issue, particularly since this party advocates the establishment of greater Israel extending from the Nile to the Euphrates; calls for expelling Arabs from occupied Palestine; is striving to annex Jerusalem, the Golan, and southern Lebanon to the Hebrew state; and is engaged in instigation against Iraq. He noted that such Kuwaiti conduct is condemnable and unacceptable. Subayh went on to say: If aid is to be extended, then Arab and Muslim peoples everywhere, and in occupied Palestine in particular, are in dire need of Arab aid. Extending aid to Arabs and Muslims in general, and to the Palestinians in particular, would be better than extending it to the fascists who are occupying Arab lands. He described this development as strange and unacceptable. The PNC secretary urged Kuwaiti rulers to settle the Palestinians' dues, as well as deductions estimated at some $70 million, which they are still holding. The Palestinian official noted the statements made by Ari'el Sharon, a key leader of the Likud Party, who has announced that it is the Zionist authorities alone who will protect Gulf oil, and that they will not allow any Arab country to develop and progress and build a scientific base. Concluding his statement, Subayh said the Palestinian people condemn and denounce these Kuwaiti elements for supporting the racist Likud Party and other parties at the expense of the Arab nation and Palestine.
