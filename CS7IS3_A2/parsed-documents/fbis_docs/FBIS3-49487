The meeting resulted in the adoption of declarations which call for solving ethnic problems and establishing relations between Slovaks and Hungarians on new principles. "The government's previous steps contributed to the worsening of mutual relations," the declaration writes. The meeting asked to embody the collective rights of the Hungarian minority in the Slovak Constitution. It deemed necessary for the development of the Hungarian entity the use of the Hungarian language in administrative contact at any place where Hungarians make up at least one-tenth of the population. Hungarian should become, along with Slovak, the official language in locations with a Hungarian majority. The representation of Hungarians in state bodies and public institutions should be in line with their number. The Hungarian entity should be allotted a relevant share of state budget. The political existence of the minority should be expressed in the election of its own representative bodies. The meeting expressed a claim to the "attribution of special legal status for territory with a large number of Hungarians." The implementation of ethnic rights in places where they constitute a minority should be based on the principle of mutuality. Only two meeting participants voted against the declarations. The crowded arena applauded them because of their courage. The meeting also passed an open letter to the Slovak president and Slovak citizens, asking them to open a dialogue based on equality, and an appeal to Hungarian parents to send their children only to Hungarian schools.
