The parties which collected the largest number of votes during the elections are forming factions, conducting publicized and unpublicized talks, elaborating scenarios, and sharing out power. The creation of a faction (or a group -- it is being given various names) of independent deputies elected in the regions in one-seat districts has come as a surprise event to many people. Our correspondent Sergey Brusin talked to Gennadiy Kalistratov, acting coordinator of this new deputies' association, who, as he stressed, expressed his own personal viewpoint. [Brusin] Gennadiy Stepanovich, why has the association of regional independent deputies been formed? [Kalistratov] The reason is simple; it has moral and civil roots. The main tasks facing all of society are to give economic reform a social orientation, to create a federative state in reality and not just on paper, to develop local government, to create the political conditions for fruitful work by the government, to combat crime, and to ensure the political and economic integration of the CIS countries.... Without them we will not achieve political stabilization in the country. However, the way the State Duma has started work may turn out to be such that a solution to the aforesaid problems will not be brought nearer but, conversely, will be delayed. Such a turn of events is the potential outcome of employing a purely party-based principle in forming the Duma's working mechanisms. That is why a special role has been given to the independent deputies, who have from the outset been outside the influence of Moscow (as we know, the parties mainly represent Moscow), outside party struggles, and outside party discipline. The independent deputies are responsible to the electorate and the electorate alone. By uniting to coordinate their actions on the basis of pragmatism and realism, they can stabilize the parliament's work. They will have to fight against both narrow party interests and the ambitions of individual deputies. For instance, the parties will first and foremost try to use the rostrum and the opportunities presented by the Duma to prepare for the next elections. Private agreements between leading party factions are also possible, leading to scenarios whereby all of the deputies will be forced to vote for packages of proposals. Then the Duma's leading organs will be formed practically solely from the parties. Another scenario is also being elaborated: to offer to post of speaker to a faction representative from a small party, in order to put an end to arguments. This is a good intention as long as there is no hidden maneuver here to have the speaker pursue the line of a specific leading party later on. The independent deputies should uphold temporary regulations which would enable people who are professionally trained to enter the leadership of the Duma -- people unconnected with party discipline. The speaker should not be an isolated figure (let us learn the lessons of the past). The number of his deputies should most probably not be equal to the number of leading parties, otherwise an exclusively party-based principle will prevail in the Duma's work. The formation of the Duma apparatus should also be seen from this angle. The party principle in the division of the mechanisms of power is also a "minefield" because the party coalitions are not mature but were created in an ad hoc way and will scarcely withstand the tests of unity to which life itself will soon subject them. Processes of division and collapse within parties are inevitable. And the Duma, if formed on the basis of the party principle, will find itself drawn into them. Then, before we even have time to deal with Russia's problems, we will drown in behind the scenes squabbles. It appears that, in this situation, only a strongly unified political center, organizing cooperation among all constructive forces, can preserve the Duma's viability.
