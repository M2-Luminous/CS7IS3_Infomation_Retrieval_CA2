On the night before publication V.P. Leontyev, director of the "Pressa" publishing house, decreed that SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA should be suspended. Why? Old debts, we were "eating" other people's paper.... Excuse us, but this has been said dozens of times -- in court, in arbitration, in the government, in the committee for the press, with the publishing house leadership.... The debts were formed mainly as a result of the newspaper's illegal (as the court established) closure in October 1993 for two and one-half months on orders from the Ministry for the Press and the Mass Media headed by V.F. Shumeyko. Even then they amounted to the astronomical sum of 1.2 billion. We could have settled debts with the "Pressa" publishing house three times over. But neither Shumeyko nor anyone else wants to settle debts for their illegal actions.... The question of subsidies for the press remained hanging and only what are called "state" publications close to their hearts were generously subsidized. After the spring quarantine established for it by the publishing house SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA appealed for help to readers and other newspapers. The received the most vigorous support from the people -- tens of millions of rubles. With this money we are buying paper, paying for the production and transportation of current issues. This survival probably seemed too impertinent to the publisher and he remembered his old debts and suspended the newspaper. In their speeches State Duma deputies protested this treatment of the opposition people's newspaper. Chamber deputy chairman A.N. Chilingarov was instructed to conduct the necessary talks on resuming publication. The committee for information and communications under the chairmanship of M.N. Poltoranin suggested forming a commission including representatives of the State Duma and government to resolve this unusual conflict. The publishing house agreed to publish a few issues of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA if, it said, there was money to back them up.... We backed them with your hard-earned rubles, dear friends. We take this opportunity to express to you, dear friends, our heartfelt thanks for the newspaper's support. The preliminary results of subscription for the second half of the year have just become known. All similar publications have substantial losses compared with January, with ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI restoring only 7.6 percent of its subscription, losing 484,000 subscribers. SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA has no losses -- it has restored 128.6 percent of its January subscribers. The money submitted by readers would be enough to settle its debts and to publish the newspaper regularly. The state organizations only have to put it at the editorial office's disposal. We hope for effective aid from deputies. At any rate today it is thanks to the deputies that we are with you again!
