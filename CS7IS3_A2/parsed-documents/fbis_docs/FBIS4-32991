In 1992, the PRD spearheaded the group that foiled the government's hopes, and in particular the Christian Democratic Party's hopes, of approving amendments to the Constitution that included the elimination of the concept of an army and almost 100 other changes. Gonzalez said that those amendments to the Constitution were discussed months before the 1992 referendum and were rejected. Now, the Executive Branch is introducing amendments similar to those rejected in the referendum. "I personally reject what was already rejected, by vote, by our people," Gonzalez said. When asked if his rejection contradicts what President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares has said about these amendments, Gonzalez said that Perez' words have been misinterpreted. "It is one thing for the president-elect to say that he is interested in seeing the Constitution adjusted to eliminate all reference to the National Guard (Army) and create a law for the National Police (thus solving the lack of protection experienced by our people) and another to put something over on someone [meter gato por liebre] leaving this country a colony," Gonzalez added. According to the PRD president, what is sought is to eliminate from the Constitution the duties that the members of the Public Force have and the duty of the Panamanian citizens to defend their country, including the protection of the Canal as well as our borders. Gonzalez explained that if an international incident should occur along our borders, incidents that could involve unconventional forces, the policemen would not be obligated to take action because their duty is restricted to maintaining public order. "The constitutional reform is clear in stating that the police will have Dobermans [former Panama Defense Force riot squad] to repress demonstrations and units to capture thieves and investigate crimes, and that is it." In light of a suggestion presented by Legislator Milton Henriquez to form a Constituent Assembly that will completely change the Constitution, Gonzalez said "those defeated Christian Democrats are always setting little traps for the future," because a Constituent Assembly would solve nothing. Following the idea of a Constituent Assembly, Gonzalez said that a solution to the problem would be to give the next Legislative Assembly a six-month period, or as long as it needs, to act as a Constituent Assembly and make the necessary changes to the Constitution, changes that all the political forces will have agreed on.
