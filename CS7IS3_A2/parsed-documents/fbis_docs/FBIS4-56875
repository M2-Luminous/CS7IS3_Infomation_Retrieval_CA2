[Words indistinct] once a meeting with the top transportation and communications authorities. In the country there is a climate of social unrest and dissatisfaction resulting from the economic crisis, said Government Minister Ramon Escovar Salom at the presidential building. He said that, despite the partial transportation sector strike, there is calm in the country. [Begin Escovar recording] The people are fed up with the interruption of normal life in Venezuelan cities. The people want peace, calm, and work. They want to be able to work in peace. Hence, all movements aimed at stopping normal activities in the country are doomed to fail sooner or later. The people repudiate these alterations of public order. And this will be clearly demonstrated in a few days. The government enjoys the nation's trust because strikes will not resolve the current difficulties. These interruptions only aggravate the economic crisis and prevent the country from concentrating its resources to overcome the crisis. Those who can aggravate the crisis can declare strikes but they are resisted by the country's majority. This is what I have to say today. The reports I have received is that the country is calm.
