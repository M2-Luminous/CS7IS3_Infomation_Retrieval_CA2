The first military personnel changes by Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, the Army reshuffle will likely involve the discharge of three- and four-star generals who were members of the defunct Hana- hoe, a private politically motivated club of some Korean military academy-graduated officers once led by Former Presidents Chon Tu- hwan and No Tae-u. Of the one- and two-star Hana-hoe members, some major generals will be discharged from active service and the remaining major and brigadier generals will be dismissed from important staff and division command posts. The scope of the Army reshuffle will depend on whether Gen. Kim Chae-chang, deputy commander of the combined ROK-U.S. Forces Command, is discharged for his links with Hana-hoe, the sources said.
