On this very day, the invading and aggressive forces continued their desperate attacks on all fronts. Our brave Armed Forces intercepted them, and inflicted on them further losses in lives, vehicles, and other military equipment. In the Tawr al-Bahah zone, our forces succeeded in mopping up the infiltrating hostile forces, which were engaged in acts of looting, robbery, and rape. Our forces are in the process of imposing their control over the situation, after combing a number of villages and towns for the routed remnants of the hostile forces. On this front the enemy's losses were four tanks, two Katyusha launchers, and hundreds of dead and wounded. A large number of the enemy's men surrendered, including numerous members of the infamous and disreputable jihad elements. Our forces continue, in the provinces of Radfan and al-Dali' -- after thousands of people joined them from the province of Yafi and other provinces -- to cleanse the villages of the filth of the routed remnants of the hostile forces. In the Abyan zone our forces destroyed three Katyusha launch vehicles and seized two hostile tanks. The combat actions of our forces were characterized by determination, death-defying action, a firm defense, and high combat morale. The enemy's acts were characterized by barbarousness, randomness, and desperation, especially after they realized that the ruling military regime in Sanaa insists on continuing to challenge the international community, and on shedding the blood of thousands of the sons of the central areas, who have no control over their fates and are pushed toward the holocaust of war and death. God is great, God is great.
