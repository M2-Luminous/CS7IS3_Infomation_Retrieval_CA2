FR940902-1-00086 FR940902-1-00012 Friday September 2, 1994 Part V Department of Education 34 CFR Part 645 Upward Bound Program; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 170␣/␣Friday, September 2, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 34 CFR Part 645 RIN 1840&hyph;AB65 Upward Bound Program AGENCY: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations governing the Upward Bound Program. These regulations are needed to further implement statutory changes made to the Upward Bound Program by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, and to clarify and simplify certain requirements governing the program. The selection criteria, prior experience criteria, and grantee accountability provisions are affected by these proposed changes. The purposes and allowable activities of the Upward Bound Program support the National Education Goals. Specifically, the program funds projects designed to increase high school graduation rates, increase competency over challenging subject matters, encourage more students to pursue programs in mathematics and science, and help gain parental participation in the social, emotional and academic growth of their children. DATES: Comments must be received on or before October 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: All comments concerning these proposed regulations should be addressed to Richard T. Sonnergren, U.S. Department of Education, Room 5065, FOB&hyph;6, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20202&hyph;5249. A copy of any comments that concern information collection requirements should also be sent to the Office of Management and Budget at the address listed in the Paperwork Reduction Act section of this preamble.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Upward Bound Program provides grants to institutions of higher education; public and private agencies and organizations; combinations of institutions, agencies, and organizations; and secondary schools under special circumstances. The purpose of the program is to generate the skills and motivation necessary for success in education beyond high school. On October 1, 1993, the Secretary published revisions to the Upward Bound Program regulations to implement changes required by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (58 FR 51520&hyph;21). This NPRM proposes program improvements that were not covered by the October 1, 1993 regulations. The major provisions of these proposed regulations include the following: • Definitions (§645.5). The proposed regulations revise or add definitions to clarify certain terms used in the regulations, including definitions of ``participant,'' ``independent student,'' and ``organization/agency.'' • Kinds of Projects (§645.10). The proposed regulations will define in general the three types of Upward Bound projects supported under the program, i.e., Regular Upward Bound projects, Math and Science Upward Bound projects, and Veterans Upward Bound projects. • Upward Bound services and activities (§§645.11&hyph;645.14). Section 645.11 of the proposed regulations lists the services that all Upward Bound projects must provide. Section 645.12 describes the manner in which services are provided in Regular Upward Bound projects. Section 645.13 lists additional services that the Math and Science Upward Bound project must provide and the manner in which services are provided. Section 645.14 lists additional services that the Veterans Upward Bound project must provide. • How does one apply for an award? (§§645.20&hyph;645.21). Section 645.20 of the proposed regulation describes the condition under which the Secretary will accept more than one application from an eligible applicant. Section 645.21 describes the assurances an applicant must include in an application. • Selection criteria (§645.31). The proposed regulations revise the order, weighting, and content of application selection criteria. The purpose for this revision is to simplify and clarify the review process and increase grantee accountability. In addition, the proposed regulations clarify and strengthen the requirements for a grantee's evaluation of a project. • Prior experience (§645.32). The proposed regulations revise the criteria for the evaluation of a grantee's prior experience to focus on project outcomes. • Project size (§645.43(a)). The proposed regulations establish a minimum number of participants residing in the target area who must be served by a project in each budget period, and permit that number to be reduced if the grant amount for the budget period is less than $190,000. The proposed regulations require that Veterans Upward Bound projects serve at least 120 participants during each budget period, and that all other Upward Bound projects serve at least 50 participants in each budget period. Coupled with the new definition of ``participant'' in §645.6 and the new recordkeeping requirements for participants in §645.43(c), this provision is intended to ensure that projects provide a reasonable level of services to a significant number of recipients. This intended result is consistent with section 402A(b)(3) of the HEA, which establishes a $190,000 minimum grant level for awards beginning in fiscal year 1994, unless the applicant requests a lesser amount. • Project period (§645.34). The proposed regulations implement a statutory provision that expands the project period to four years_or five years in the case of applications that receive peer review scores in the highest 10 percent of all scores for approved new projects.
