The MSZP's three vice chairmen and the party's parliamentary group leader were also present at the consultation. According to our information, the discussion focused on finally clarifying the possibilities that exist in the event that Miklos Nemeth returns home. Our paper was informed that Horn and Nemeth agreed to announce the former prime minister's decision shortly in a joint communique. In connection with the decision, we learned that Nemeth does not want to break the contract he has until 1996--that is, he wants to stay on in the position of vice president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and will not return in the spring to take part in the Hungarian election campaign. This finally puts an end to the uncertainty concerning the former government chief's acceptance of a political role at home, because, according to our information, we can also exclude any possibility of Nemeth's coming to Hungary after the elections and, depending on their outcome, filling a position offered to him. It also became clear that Nemeth was not thinking of working out any kind of Christian-Socialist alternative and that, as far as he was concerned, only a possible invitation from the MSZP could have played a role.
