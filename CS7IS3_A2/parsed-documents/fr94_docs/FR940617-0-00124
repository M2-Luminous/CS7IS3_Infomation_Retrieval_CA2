FR940617-0-00124 FR940617-0-00026 EPA is adopting the engine family definition as proposed. EPA had expressed some concern in its proposal that, should it adopt HC, CO and PM emission standards in the final rule, it was uncertain whether manufacturers should be allowed to include engines with different numbers of cylinders or cylinder orientations in the same engine family. EPA argued that it was uncertain whether deterioration of HC, CO and PM emission performance would proceed at different rates in-use for engines with different numbers of cylinders. One commenter expressed a strong desire to be able to consolidate engine families as much as practicable. The commenter also reminded EPA of the substantial enforcement liability program in this rule that would provide adequate incentive to ensure a manufacturer makes reasonable use of the engine family flexibilities. The Agency is aware that additional built-in safeguards such as the manufacturers' burden to define engine families in such a way as to ensure all engine configurations have similar emission characteristics, and the manufacturers' recall liability if all engine configurations are not as durable as expected. The Agency has no additional data at this time to address its original concern. However, the Agency does believe that the enforcement provisions in this rule will provide incentive to manufacturers to ensure that their engines are properly grouped so that they can be appropriately represented by the selected test engines. 2. Exhaust Emission Test Procedures The smoke test procedures are adopted as they were proposed. The gaseous emission 8-mode test procedures are finalized as proposed with minor revisions. These procedures apply to HC and CO emissions as well as NO X . For PM emission measurement, EPA is adopting the California test procedures finalized in Sections 2420&hyph;2427, Title 13 of the California Code of Regulations, ``California Regulation for New 1996 and Later Heavy-duty Off-road Diesel Cycle Engines,'' as amended by California Air Resources Board Resolution 92&hyph;2, described in CARB mailout # 93&hyph;42 dated September 1, 1993. These procedures are incorporated by reference in the regulations. Manufacturers of engines that are not able to operate properly over the 8-mode or smoke test cycles (such as engines with constant speed governors) may petition the Administrator prior to certification to allow use of an alternative test procedure. Upon adequate demonstration of need, the Administrator may allow use of alternative procedures. If an engine is unable to be operated over the smoke test procedure, the manufacturer must submit an alternative test plan to the Administrator for approval in advance of any testing performed for certification purposes. Use of alternative test procedures to demonstrate exhaust emission compliance is discussed in Section VI.H.
