The residents have taken advantage of that calm to bury the dead. Radio Angola reports that 48 people were killed and another 62 seriously wounded during clashes on 5 February. A spokesman for Cuito-based government forces told Radio Angola yesterday that his forces had not been caught by surprise and had in fact expected such clashes to occur at any time. Radio Angola also reported that the UNITA forces were using weapons and mortars to, quote, decimate the residents of Cuito and reduce the city to ashes, unquote. Jorge Araujo, a BBC reporter, has been in touch with UNITA Information Secretary Jorge Valentim, who has confirmed that there were fierce clashes in Cuito, adding however that the government was to blame and that it had attacked first. [Begin recording] [Valentim] It was the government that started the clashes. In the wake of orders they received from Luanda, the government forces began the fighting. This was in line with recent remarks by General Joao de Matos, Angolan Armed Forces chief of General Staff. The clashes began at 0745 [0645 GMT] and continued until about 2000 in the evening. The situation remains critical at this stage. We, in the UNITA negotiating team, have one position: we lay the responsibility for the clashes at the door of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] government. We blame the MPLA government solely and completely for the start of the clashes. Such behavior is in complete contradiction with the Lusaka peace talks. [Araujo] What do you view as a critical situation? [Valentim] It is a critical situation because the clashes assumed absolutely maximum dimensions. The government took certain UNITA positions. There were successive waves of bombings against military positions and civilian targets. This is a very serious threat to peace in Angola. [Araujo] Are the clashes continuing at this point? [Valentim] I cannot give you any more details but, seeing that this was in line with government plans, it is possible that clashes are continuing. For instance, the observers and mediators here in Lusaka are deeply concerned about the situation and believe these clashes must cease because they can be harmful to the search for peace in Angola. [end recording] Meanwhile, Aldemiro Vaz da Conceicao, spokesman for the Angolan Government team to the Lusaka peace talks, has granted an interview to the Portuguese Radio Broadcasting Corporation, RDP, in which he rejected UNITA's version of the events. He added that the government had the duty to respond to UNITA attacks on civilians and on territorial integrity. Today, AFP quoted UNITA's Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel, Vorgan Radio, as saying that the UNITA leadership had held a special meeting in Huambo and that it had decided unilaterally to reestablish the cease-fire in Cuito.
