The political autonomy Fujimori enjoyed until just before the referendum has been curtailed. The truth is that Gen. Hermoza has positioned himself in the government and together with Vladimiro Montesinos, presidential adviser for intelligence affairs, is making decisions about the country's Armed Forces from the top of the pyramid. The two have decided that the three general commanders -- from the Army (Hermoza himself), the Navy, and Air Force -- cannot be removed from their posts. The police director also was included in this decision. This decision has deeply irritated officers in each military branch because it bars the normal development of officers' professional careers and their promotion to the highest military positions. It is well known that within military circles there is a principle called "the cart principle" by which those in higher positions drag behind them those they trust. It seems that the commanders now want this cart to remain still without changing wheels annually, as occurred in the past. The generals who were approaching the post of commander or chief of the various military institutions today are considered dangerous. For this reason, they have been assigned duties abroad or placed in posts called "bones" because they are not operational or trusted administrative posts (defense minister, CCFFAA [Joint Command of the Armed Forces], and CAEM [Advanced Military Studies Center]). "The manipulation" still continues within the Army because Gen. Hermoza's command had been planning to replace some important division generals by sending them into retirement, among them General Valdivia (currently a military attache in far-away Ukraine). This high-ranking officer has been strongly criticized for his performance as military-political chief in Ayacucho, but he enjoys sound prestige within the Army, especially in the promotion of Vladimiro Montesinos, whom he instructed. The plan to send more than 10 division generals into retirement had to be ruled out, at least until the middle of the year, because it might have caused too many problems within the Army. The situation of General Robles has caused sufficient problems. According to military sources, Robles might report to the nation another irregular military operation in the central region. We should not forget that Robles was the Army's third-in-command before they tried to get rid of him by sending him abroad; in his post he handled a large volume of secret information. Another hot issue is the case of General Salinas Sedo, who is the best candidate according to many people. It will be possible to close ranks behind him in case of a possible attempt to reelect President Fujimori. Many people have demanded his release through presidential pardon, but so far there are no indications this will happen. The risk is that if he stays in jail, an adverse process might emerge in the middle of the elections because political parties might decide to abstain on the grounds that elections are not free because a citizen who might be the winner is imprisoned. This is how things are in our Army. There is still another issue: Ten division generals have just been promoted, and irregularities have continued because among the promoted generals is Guido Guevara Guerra, who is a brigade general in the Army Legal Service and may not -- by law -- be promoted to division general, because his rank has been adjusted. However, now he is a division general. Do you know why? Guevara was designated president of the Military Court Supreme Council because he is the top-ranking general (division general), and considering that the other council members will never reach that rank, he will always be (at least until July 1995) the council president. Last week he announced a life imprisonment penalty for four Chileans on "high treason" charges. Can a Chilean commit "high treason" against the fatherland, that is, against Peru, which is not his fatherland? We will comment on this penalty later.
