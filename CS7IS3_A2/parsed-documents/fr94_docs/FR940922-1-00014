FR940922-1-00014 FR940922-1-00005 4. Demonstration Moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit a demonstration (including air quality modeling) showing that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 (see section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Act). The General Preamble sets out EPA's guidance on the use of modeling for moderate area attainment demonstrations (57 FR 13539). Alternatively, the State must show attainment by December 31, 1994 is impracticable. The 24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS is 150 micrograms/cubic meter ( m g/m 3 ), and the standard is attained when the expected number of days per calendar year with a 24-hour average concentration above 150 m g/m 3 is equal to or less than one (see 40 CFR 50.6). The annual PM&hyph;10 NAAQS is 50 m g/m 3 , and the standard is attained when the expected annual arithmetic mean concentration is less than or equal to 50 m g/m 3 (id.). As indicated in the General Preamble, 57 FR 13539, EPA has developed a supplemental attainment demonstration policy for initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. This policy provides additional flexibility in meeting the PM&hyph;10 attainment demonstration requirements. An earlier April 2, 1991 memorandum titled, ``PM&hyph;10 Moderate Area SIP Guidance: Final Staff Work Product'' contained ``Attachment 5'' describing the same policy. IDEQ conducted an attainment demonstration based upon WYNDvalley, a non-guideline dispersion model that EPA recommended be used in the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area. WYNDvalley is applicable in light and variable wind scenarios in regions influenced by complex terrain. Cold temperatures and light winds with limited vertical mixing create stagnant weather conditions in the Boise River Valley. All of the PM&hyph;10 exceedances observed in the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area have occurred during stagnant wintertime conditions. The attainment demonstration indicates that the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area will be in attainment of the 24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS during the entire period of 1993 to 2000, with the maximum predicted 24-hour concentration of 147 m g/m 3 occurring in 1995. The demonstration also addresses the quantitative milestone requirement (discussed below) by showing that the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS will be maintained after December 31, 1994 by predicting a 24-hour worst case day design concentration of 144 m g/m 3 for the year 2000. According to EPA's review, which corrected for the use of non-reference PM&hyph;10 data in 1986 and 1987 (i.e. Hi-Vol SA321A gravimetric PM&hyph;10 sampler), the Ada County/Boise area has never violated the annual arithmetic mean PM&hyph;10 standard. The highest valid three-year annual average in the nonattainment area is 43 m g/m 3 during 1987&hyph;1989, while the lowest three-year average is 39 m g/m 3 during 1990&hyph;1992. The control strategy used to achieve these design concentrations and demonstrate attainment of both the 24-hour and annual PM&hyph;10 standards, however, relies on mandatory wood smoke control programs in Eagle, Garden City, Meridian and unincorporated Ada County. As discussed above in the section titled ``Control Measures,'' the State has not adopted these ordinances as part of the SIP and submitted them to EPA. Accordingly, EPA proposes to disapprove the attainment demonstration. More detailed description of the attainment demonstration is contained in the TSD accompanying this document. 5. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) The PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every three years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP, as defined in section 171(1) of the Act, toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the CAA). Although section 189(c) plainly provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved until an area is redesignated attainment, it is silent in indicating the starting point for counting the first three-year period or how many milestones must be initially addressed. In the General Preamble, EPA addressed the statutory gap in the starting point for counting the three-year milestones, indicating that it would begin from the due date for the applicable implementation plan revision containing the control measures for the area (i.e., November 15, 1991 for initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas (see 57 FR 13539)). As to the number of milestones, EPA believes that at least two milestones must be initially addressed. Thus, submittals to address the SIP revisions due on November 15, 1991 for the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must demonstrate that two milestones will be achieved (1st milestone: November 15, 1991 through November 15, 1994; 2nd milestone: November 15, 1994 through November 15, 1997). For areas that demonstrate timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS, the second milestone should, at a minimum, provide for continued maintenance of the standards. 7 7 Section 189(c) provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved ``until the area is redesignated attainment.'' However, this endpoint for quantitative milestones is speculative because redesignation for an area as attainment is contingent upon several factors and future events. Therefore, EPA believes it is reasonable for States to initially address at least the first two milestones. Addressing two milestones will ensure that the State continues to maintain the NAAQS beyond the attainment date for at least some period during which an area could be redesignated attainment. However, in all instances, additional milestones must be addressed if an area is not redesignated attainment. For the initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas that demonstrate attainment, the emissions reduction progress made between the SIP submittal (due date of November 15, 1991) and the attainment date of December 31, 1994 (46 days beyond the November 15, 1994 milestone date) will satisfy the first quantitative milestone. The de minimis timing differential makes it administratively impracticable to require separate milestone and attainment demonstrations (see 57 FR 13539). In implementing the quantitative milestone and RFP provisions for this initial moderate area, EPA has reviewed the attainment demonstration for the area to determine the nature of any milestones necessary to ensure timely attainment and whether annual incremental reductions should be required in order to ensure attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. The SIP purports to demonstrate attainment by 1994 and maintenance through 2000, which would satisfy three milestones. However, as discussed above, the maintenance demonstration and, therefore, the quantitative milestones directly depend on mandatory wood smoke control programs in Eagle, Garden City, Meridian and unincorporated Ada County. As discussed above in the section titled ``Control Measures,'' the State has not adopted these ordinances as part of the SIP and submitted them to EPA. Accordingly, EPA proposes to disapprove the quantitative milestone requirement (see General Preamble, 57 FR 13565 and July 9, 1992 EPA memorandum regarding ``Processing of State Implementation Plan (SIP) Submittals''). 6. PM&hyph;10 Precursors The control requirements which are applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors unless EPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels in excess of the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act). The General Preamble contains guidance addressing how EPA intends to implement section 189(e) (see 57 FR 13539&hyph;13540 and 13541&hyph;13542). Because the emission inventory for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area did not reveal any major stationary sources, including any major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors, EPA is proposing to grant the exclusion from control requirements authorized under section 189(e) for major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors. 7.
