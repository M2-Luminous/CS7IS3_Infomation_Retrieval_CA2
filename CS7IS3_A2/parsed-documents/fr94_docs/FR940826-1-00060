FR940826-1-00060 FR940826-1-00009 I. Proposed Designated Entity Provisions for MTA and BTA Auctions A. Introduction 1. In the Budget Act, Congress recognized the novelty of auctions as a licensing method and encouraged us to experiment with a variety of techniques to ensure that small businesses and those owned by women and minorities have an opportunity to participate in spectrum-based services. While we believe that measures taken with respect to the regional narrowband PCS auctions will provide substantial opportunities for designated entities to participate in narrowband PCS, we seek comment on whether it may be necessary to adopt alternative provisions such as entrepreneurs' blocks or higher bidding credits to encourage investment in minority- and women-owned businesses in future auctions. As we have learned, narrowband PCS licenses may be auctioned for large sums of money in the competitive bidding process. It therefore may be necessary to do more to ensure that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in narrowband PCS than may be necessary in other, less costly spectrum-based services. In our view, we must consider whether these steps and any others we may adopt are required to fulfill Congress's mandate that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in the provision of PCS. We believe that the measures we propose today would increase the likelihood that designated entities will win licenses in the auctions and become strong competitors in the provision of narrowband PCS service. We also will review the results of the regional auction in making our decision on the rules proposed in this Further Notice. 2. As we noted in the Fifth Report and Order , by instructing the Commission to ensure the opportunity for designated entities to participate in auctions and spectrum-based services, Congress was well aware of the difficulties these groups encounter in accessing capital. 1 Indeed, less than two years ago, Congress made specific findings in the Small Business Credit and Business Opportunity Enhancement Act of 1992, that ``small business concerns, which represent higher degrees of risk in financial markets than do large businesses, are experiencing increased difficulties in obtaining credit.'' 2 Because of these problems, Congress resolved to consider carefully legislation and regulations ``to ensure that small business concerns are not negatively impacted'' and to give priority to passage of ``legislation and regulations that enhance the viability of small business concerns.'' 3 1 Fifth Report and Order at Â¶97, in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, FCC 94&hyph;178, adopted June 29, 1994, released July 15, 1994, 59 FR 37566 (Jul 29, 1994), ( Fifth Report and Order ). 2 Small Business Credit and Business Opportunity Enhancement Act of 1992, Section 331(a)(3), Pub. Law 102&hyph;366, Sept. 4, 1992. 3 Id ., Section 441(b)(2),(3). 3. Congress also recognized that these funding problems are even more severe for minority and women-owned businesses, who face discrimination in the private lending market. For example, Congress explicitly found that businesses owned by minorities and women have particular difficulties in obtaining capital and that problems encountered by minorities in this regard are ``extraordinary.'' 4 A number of studies also amply support the existence of widespread discrimination against minorities in lending practices. As we noted in the Fifth Report and Order , in October, 1992, the year prior to passage of the auction law, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston released an important and highly-publicized study demonstrating that a black or Hispanic applicant in the Boston area is roughly 60 percent more likely to be denied a mortgage loan than a similarly situated white applicant. 5 The researchers measured every variable mentioned as important in numerous conversations with lenders, underwriters, and examiners and found that minority applicants are more likely to be denied mortgages even where they have the same obligation ratios, credit history, loan to value and property characteristics as white applicants. The lending discrimination that occurs, the study found, does not involve the application of specific rules, but instead occurs where discretionary decisions are made. Based on the Boston study, we found that it is reasonable to expect that race will affect business loans that are based on more subjective criteria to an even greater extent than the mortgage loan process, which uses more standard rules. 4 Id ., Section 12(4); 331(a)(4). 5 Mortgage Lending in Boston: Interpreting HMDA Data, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Working Paper 92&hyph;7 (October 1992). 4. Similarly, evidence presented in testimony before the House Minority Enterprise Subcommittee on May 20, 1994 indicates that African American business borrowers have difficulty raising capital mainly because they have less equity to invest, they receive fewer loan dollars per dollar of equity investment, and they are less likely to have alternate loan sources, such as affluent family or friends. Assuming two hypothetical college-educated, similarly situated male entrepreneurs, one black, one white, the testimony indicated that the white candidate would have access to $1.85 in bank loans for each dollar of owner equity invested, while the black candidate would have access to only $1.16. According to the testimony, the problems associated with lower incomes and intergenerational wealth, as well as the discriminatory treatment minorities receive from financial institutions, make it much more likely that minorities will be shut out of capital intensive industries, such as telecommunications. This testimony also noted that African American representation in communications is so low that it was not possible to generate meaningful summary statistics on underrepresentation. 6 6 Testimony of Dr. Timothy Bates, Visiting Fellow, The Woodrow Wilson Center, before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Small Business, Subcommittee on Minority Enterprise, Finance, and Urban Development (House Minority Enterprise Subcommittee), May 20, 1994. 5. We also stated in the Fifth Report and Order that inability to access capital is also a major impediment to the successful participation of women in PCS auctions. In enacting the Women's Business Ownership Act in 1988, Congress made findings that women, as a group, are subject to discrimination that adversely affects their ability to raise or secure capital. 7 AWRT documents that these discriminatory barriers still exist today. Indeed, AWRT reports that while venture capital is an important source of funding for telecommunications companies, women-owned companies received only approximately one percent of the $3 billion invested by institutional venture capitalists in 1993. Citing a 1992 National Women's Business Council report, AWRT further argues that even successful women-owned companies did not overcome these financing obstacles after they had reached a level of funding and profitability adequate for most other businesses. 8 7 Pub.
