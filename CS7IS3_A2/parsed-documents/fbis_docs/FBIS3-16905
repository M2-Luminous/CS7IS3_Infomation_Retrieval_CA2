It wants to be an equal partner, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told a news conference in Lvov, western Ukraine, on Monday. The minister made a stopover in Lvov on his way from the Czech Republic to Poland where he will discuss the Partnership for Peace Programme. Zlenko pointed out that Ukraine is interested in expanding regional and sub-regional cooperation, particularly with the Carpathian region, and joining the Visegrad group which unites Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. The minister said that the opinion that Ukraine is not welcome in Europe is wrong, adding that after Poland he will fly to Brussels to sign an agreement on cooperation with the European Union. "Ukraine can and will cooperate with Western states. It has a potential for equal cooperation. There is also a reciprocal interest among the European powers," he said.
