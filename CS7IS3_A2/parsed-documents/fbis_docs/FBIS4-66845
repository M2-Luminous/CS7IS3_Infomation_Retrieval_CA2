Sahay: "RSS To Stress `Swadeshi' Move"] [Text] Patna, April 18--The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has decided not to give top priority to the agitation against the Dunkel draft in its programme of action for the present. Instead, it plans to accelerate the pace of the swadeshi movement in the country, the national RSS chief, Mr Rajendra Singh, told a crowded news conference here today. He described the signing of the Dunkel draft as a symbol of economic slavery but said the RSS did not want to deploy its full strength to oppose it as the country was passing through more serious crises which warranted urgent solutions. Growing corruption and a marked deterioration had been causing immense harm to the country. The RSS would confront these problems at all levels in public life and the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch was educating the masses against these evils as well as helping to counter the dangers of economic slavery of the multinationals, he maintained. Mr Singh reaffirmed RSS support to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) for the liberation of Ayodhya, Kashi and Mathura. He, however, opined that the agitation for Kashi or Mathura should be taken up after the commencement of the temple construction work at the Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya. It would not be strategically befitting to open three fronts at a time. He said that even the socialist leader, the late Ram Manohar Lohia, had advocated the liberation of all these religious places while addressing the Ramayan Mela at Chitrakut in 1967-68. Mr Lohia, he recalled, had called for launching a civil obedience movement if the situation so warranted. Replying to a question, Mr Singh denied that the RSS was opposed to Muslims. The RSS, he claimed, had always been trying to enthuse Muslims to join the shakhas but the response was very poor. Even those who joined shakhas had to withdraw themselves under pressure from leaders of their community. He, however, admitted that a handful of Muslim youths who had joined the shakhas at various places for a brief period were not attracted by the ideology of the RSS but by the morning drills and physical trainings. Replying to another question, he alleged that Pakistan's Inter Service Intelligence (ISI) with the support of some traitors was trying to consolidate its foothold in different parts of the country. In Kashmir, the ultras had the support of some local disgruntled elements and hence the situation was explosive despite the best efforts from the Indian security forces, he said. Mr Singh denied that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had been distancing itself from the RSS. But at the same time the RSS did not try to inject any political ideology into the BJP. Both the organisations were like-minded so far as the Hindutva and Swadeshi approach were concerned. The BJP, he said, was free to plan any action to confront the national issues including the Dunkel draft. The party looked upon the Ayodhya controversy as a national issue and never as a religious issue, he added. The pradesh RSS chief, Mr Krishna Ballabh Prasad Narayan Singh, was also present at the conference. In Jammu, the RSS general secretary, Mr H.V. Sheshadri, today said his organisation will lend full support to the Dharam Sansad for starting a satyagraha if the Centre failed to hand over possession of the disputed land at Ram Janambhoomi site in Ayodhya soon. Addressing a press conference here, Mr Sheshadri blamed the Narasimha Rao government for delaying a decision on the issue and of playing "vote bank politics."
