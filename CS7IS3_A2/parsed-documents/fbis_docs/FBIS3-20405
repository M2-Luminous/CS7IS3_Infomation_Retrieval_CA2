The main issues remain the scope of reconstruction needed to put the devastated region back on its feet and the maps that must still be drawn for peace accords reached this month under combined U.S.- Russian diplomatic pressure. "The pattern is encouraging, but now the crucial thing is the map," European Union negotiator Owen told journalists after a meeting of the steering committee of the Geneva Peace Conference on former Yugoslavia, which groups around 30 countries and organisations. Owen, just back from weekend talks in Belgrade, said Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was showing flexibility. Serbia wanted to reach agreement on an effective ceasefire, restoration of economic relations with neighbouring countries and the lifting of the international blockade against its rump state of Yugoslavia, he said. The consultations came as the peace process received a boost after Bosnian Croats and Moslems signed a federation agreement in Washington on March 18 and Croatia and Serb separatists from the breakaway Krajina enclave signed a ceasefire accord early Wednesday. "One of the most fundamental things is not to get much delay. This momentum is very, very important," Owen said at a press conference, praising the involvement of the two superpowers in the peace process. The Bosnian Serbs are now considering whether they should join the Croat-Moslem entente, which they feared "could be an anti-Serb alliance," explained Owen. U.S. special Envoy Charles Redman, who helped conclude that agreement, should visit the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale Wednesday or Thursday, said Owen, who thought the problem should be resolved jointly by the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia. Members of the Geneva steering committee, speaking about the mammoth task of rebuilding the war-ravaged region, said it was important that international aid efforts did not substitute for the efforts of the countries concerned, leaving them free to arm themselves once more. The United States has made some aid promises but there is little doubt that the European Union will have to shoulder the main burden, members said.
