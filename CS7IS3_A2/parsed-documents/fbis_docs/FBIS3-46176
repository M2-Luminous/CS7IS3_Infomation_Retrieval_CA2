The Russian foreign minister arrived here Wednesday [26 January], taking with him quite a number of officials and business people from various parts of the country, indicating that Russia is ready to further its economic and trade cooperation, including border trade, with China. Sino-Russian trade volume in 1993 hit a record 7.68 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of some 30 percent over the previous year. Of this, Russia's import from China amounted to 2.69 billion U.S. dollars and its export to China was 4.99 billion U.S. dollars, remaining the seventh biggest trading partner of China. China mainly exported to Russia grain, food, light industrial goods and textiles, household electrical appliances and raw materials, and imported Russian power plant equipment, vehicles, steel, chemical fertilizer and electronics and machinery. The economies of China and Russia are mutually complementary, and economic and trade exchanges between the two countries, which is in the interest of both, will cater to the needs of each other's economic development and life of the two peoples. China supports, as always, positive development of Sino-Russian cooperation in trade, economy and technology based on equality and mutual benefit and encourages its companies and enterprises to cooperate with Russia in various fields, a trade official said. At present, bilateral economic and trade cooperation are being diversified to cover traditional barter trade, over-the-counter trade and compensation trade. During the first 10 months of 1993, China signed 420 contracts with Russia for providing labor services, involving 470 million U.S. dollars. China also invested some 82 million U.S. dollars in nearly 500 joint ventures in Russia. China and Russia agreed at a meeting held in March last year that the two countries would cooperate in the fields of building materials, information technology, instrument making, metallurgy, agriculture, chemicals, and micro-electronics. By the end of last June, China had imported a dozen Russian technological projects for aviation, power and metal processing, with a total value of 400 million U.S. dollars, while exporting to Russia some 50 technological projects valued at 120 million U.S. dollars. However, there are some snags in the Sino-Russian trade, such as poor transportation facilities. A trade official with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said that China is willing to make concerted efforts with Russia in 1994 to consolidate what had been achieved in trade and cooperation between the two countries. He hoped that both China and Russia would take some measures to strengthen management of each other's enterprises dealing with foreign trade and improve investment environment, so as to further bilateral co-operation.
