The addition of Cr increased the amount of TiAl (_g_) phase in the binary Ti-Al alloy and changed the _a_[.sub]2[/] lamellae into block shaped particles. Cr accelerated the discontinuous coarsening process of the lamellar _a_[.sub]2[/]+_g_, by which the finer new-growing lamellar grains were formed. Therefore, addition of Cr and long-time heat treatment at 1150ï¿½C are an effective way to refine the large lamellar grains of _a_[.sub]2[/]+_g_ in as-cast alloy. Cr promoted the formation of an ordered bcc _b_[.sub]2[/] phase.
