Attending the conference were provincial leaders He Zhukang, Wang Jinshan, Zhang Yueqi, Feng Ximing, Liu Yazhi, Xu Zhongtian, Wang Guofa, Quan Zhezhu, and (?Liu Xilin) as well as principal responsible comrades of various provincial departments and principal responsible comrades of city, autonomous prefectural, and county party and government organs. Wang Jinshan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, presided over the conference. He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, gave an important speech. He Zhukang first emphasized: We should correctly estimate the situation and enhance the sense of urgency toward the endeavor to make agricultural and rural work successful. The current overall rural situation is developing well, but we should never be unrealistically optimistic. We should remain clear-headed to understand that our current capacity for agricultural production is still low, that improving agricultural level is a task that takes time, that great efforts are needed in increasing the strength for sustained development, and that we must never lower our guard to neglect or slacken efforts in agriculture and rural work. Based on the guidelines of the central conference, the provincial party committee put forward eight demands on Jilin's agriculture and rural work for this year. First, party committees and governments at all levels should conscientiously put agriculture and rural work in the first place of economic work and devote great efforts to them. This year is the last year for us to attain the target of promoting the economy to a new height in three years. According to the requirements of this target, grain output should exceed 19 billion kg, agricultural output value should increase by 6 percent, township enterprises' output value should grow by 33.3 percent, and peasants' per capita income should exceed 1,000 yuan. These tasks are very arduous. All levels must step up efforts to implement them in a down-to-earth manner, pay attention to key issues, and add impetus to work. Second, we should adhere to the principle of developing the rural economy in all sectors. The general requirements are as follows: In grain production, we should concentrate efforts on per-unit yields, increase total output, tap potential, and reduce production cost; and in animal husbandry and other diverse production, especially township enterprises, which are currently the major ways to lead peasants to an increased income and affluence, we should regard them as the strategic priority of the rural economic work and accelerate their development. Proceeding from the specific local conditions, all localities should fully develop their advantages to comprehensively develop the agriculture and rural economy that reflect their own characteristics. Third, we should strive to raise agricultural productivity. 1) We should map out ways to enable surplus laborers to have work to do and peasants to [words indistinct] all the year round. 2) We should study ways to develop Jilin with the application of science and technology and the promotion of education, the ways to rely on scientific and technological advance to upgrade peasants' quality, and the ways to carry out extensive and in-depth activities to develop agriculture with the application of science and technology and the promotion of education, accelerate the dissemination and application of scientific and technological achievements, achieve success in the rural vocational and technical education, and improve the peasants' ability and level in making the best of rural resources. 3) We should study ways to restructure agriculture and rural production setup more rapidly in line with specific local conditions and develop high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture. Fourth, we should add impetus to reform to particularly address the difficulties in rural economic development. In the current endeavor to deepen the rural reform, we should give particular attention to stabilizing the relations in land contracts, clarifying ownership, stabilizing the rights to contract, relaxing control on land use rights, and establishing a reasonable mechanism for transfer. We should step up efforts to build markets, develop rural markets, connect urban and rural markets, accelerate the establishment of the socialized service system, and actively lead peasants to markets. We should develop the collective economy to expand the collective economic strength. We should continue the good job in the experimental zone for rural reform and development to blaze a new road for deepening the rural reform. Fifth, we should devote earnest efforts to the implementation of various policy and measures. At present, we should particularly supervise and urge the implementation of the policies on supporting the rice sacks and vegetable baskets, the policies on reducing the burdens on peasants, the policies on the production and marketing of the means of agricultural production, the policies on service by increasing agricultural funds, and the policies on supporting the farm machinery, irrigation, and agricultural science and technology service systems. Leaders at all levels should not merely pay lip service to their effort to attach importance to agriculture and rural work. They should let this effort be manifest in their specific work. Strengthening agriculture and rural work is the major work for the entire party and entire society. We should establish effective systems for inspection, supervision, and guidance and regard implementation of policies as an important criterion for appraising the work styles and performance of cadres. Sixth, we should ensure stability in rural society. Leaders at all levels should be aware of hardships and resolve well the hot issues with which the masses are much dissatisfied in a timely manner. The focuses are 1) to continue to successfully reduce the burdens on peasants, 2) to conscientiously strengthen rural public security work, and 3) to improve party style and administrative honesty. We should be firm in reducing the burdens on peasants. Based on the central guidelines, the provincial party committee reiterated the following work. 1) It is not permitted to continue collecting fees that should be canceled as stipulated in explicit central and provincial orders and to continue the activities for attaining certain targets and levels that should be canceled as stipulated in explicit orders. 2) It is not permitted to collect unwarranted funds from peasants this year, and those who do so should be held accountable. 3) Wanton collections of fees, donations, funds, and fines should be resolutely dealt with and banned. 4) All levels and all departments should inspect how they have implemented the regulations of the party Central Committee and the State Council and strictly deal with those who violate the regulations. Regarding the departments in charge which fail in this work, their leaders should be held responsible. Resolute efforts should be made in the comprehensive management of rural public security. Meanwhile, we should resolutely check the unhealthy trends within the party and in society, that the masses have many complaints, especially the healthy trends of extravagance, extortion, and exaggeration. We should resolutely oppose fraud. Those who resort to improper means to gain fame and cheat higher level should be investigated and have their responsibility affixed once discovered. Seventh, we should succeed in improving rural grass-roots organizations. Party committees at all levels should attach importance to improvement of rural grass-roots organizations and achieve success in improving party branches, villagers' committees, villagers' collective economic organizations, and youth, women, and militia organizations so that they will continue to play their role in rural reform, development, and socialist construction. Eighth, we should strengthen the rural spiritual civilization. We should conduct extensive education on socialism, patriotism, collectivism, and scientific and general knowledge, eliminate numerous bad feudal and superstitious customs and habits, and establish good social practice. We should strengthen family planning, raise the quality of the population, and develop the two civilizations in a coordinated manner. In conclusion, He Zhukang emphasized: We should firmly embrace the idea of serving peasants and agriculture and maintain close ties with the masses. It requires the concerted efforts of all fields to achieve stable agricultural development and promote rural work. However, the most important thing is to rely on the vast number of peasants and fully stimulate their enthusiasm and creativity. With the issues on peasants resolved and agriculture promoted, we will have a reliable foundation for the development of all our undertakings. We should give heed to the views of peasants. In particular, leading cadres at all levels should often go deep into the reality of life to directly listen to the voice of peasants and learn about what they think, what they expect, what they support, and what they oppose. We should increase the transparency of rural economic management. With regard to financial management, in particular, we should make systems public and publish revenue and expenditure accounts for the scrutiny of the masses so that (?democracy in rural areas will be strengthened). We should protect the legal rights and interests of peasants. At present, we should earnestly address the hot issues which peasants are concerned about. We should adopt effective measures to solve the problem of usurious loans in rural areas. We should support and protect peasants' entrance into the market and create a market environment for competition on an equal footing. Any deeds that damage the interests of peasants, such as wanton price rises in the means of production, marketing of fake and inferior commodities, and forcible purchases and sales, should be strictly investigated and handled and resolutely corrected. We should show concern for peasants' hardships. All localities should conscientiously do a good job in helping those ridden by poverty and difficulties, with the focus on helping the areas with concentrations of poverty-stricken towns and townships, and mobilize and organize the masses to win a success in supporting the poor and achieving affluence. All levels and all departments should further change their work styles and improve their work methods. After this conference, major leading comrades of the provincial as well as city and county party and government organs should all devote a certain period to investigation and study activities in rural areas. They should hold heart-to-heart talks with the masses, pay attention to the opinions and expectations of grass-roots cadres and peasants, and clearly understand to what an extent the central and provincial policies have been implemented, the true conditions in rural reform, economic development, and peasants' life, and the major problems that dampen peasants' enthusiasm and affect rural economic development. They should look for effective ways together with the cadres and the masses to solve these problems. Spring farming will begin soon. Party committees and governments at all levels should concentrate efforts on spring farming to lay a good foundation for this year's bumper harvest. The provincial party committee is convinced that as long as party committees and governments at all levels in the province attach great importance and devote earnest efforts to implementation of the guidelines of the central and provincial rural work conferences, Jilin's agriculture and rural work will be promoted to a new level. Comrade Wang Jinshan pointed out at the end of the conference: Party committees and governments at all levels should conscientiously organize cadres and the masses to study Comrade He Zhukang's speech, comprehensively understand its guidelines, implement them in doing their specific work, and strive for practical results. After this conference, all levels should put forward, as soon as possible, the specific opinions on implementation of these guidelines and submit them to the rural work office of the provincial party committee in the near future.
