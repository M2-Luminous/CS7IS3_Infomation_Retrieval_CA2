In response, Takenori Kanzaki, minister of posts and telecommunications, issued on the morning of 16 February a statement saying, "Japan has scrupulously observed an agreement concluded between Japan and the United States, and I regret the U.S. Government's decision." In the statement, the minister also said, "If the United States imposes sanctions on Japan, Japan will deal with the sanctions in accordance with GATT's rules." In this way, he indicated that Japan will not hesitate to take its case to GATT. Meanwhile, the U.S. Government is reportedly studying the possibility of slapping more sanctions on Japan following the breakdown of the Japanese-U.S. framework talks. In his statement, Mr. Kanzaki expressed his vigilance about the move by the U.S. Government, saying, "Although I cannot clearly anticipate what sort of sanctions the U.S. Government is planning to impose on Japan, the U.S. Government will undoubtedly take a tough stand on trade toward Japan." The posts and telecommunications minister in his statement stressed that the Japanese Government has fulfilled its side of the Japanese-U.S. agreement on mobile phones by taking the necessary steps, including allotting frequencies to U.S. firms, and he said that the U.S. Government's reason for imposing sanctions on Japan is not justified. A government source indicated on the morning of 16 February, "Japan has been doing what it has to do, and I believe that U.S. firms' business efforts probably have been inadequate." The Japanese Government is poised to wait and observe future developments for the time being, saying, "It is hard to take any action until the sanctions to be imposed on Japan by the U.S. Government come to light." The Japanese Government, however, intends to take Japan's case to GATT if the U.S. Government imposes sanctions on Japan. Some government officials take the view that "If the Japanese Government takes Japan's case to GATT to argue with the U.S. Government at the GATT's arbitration panel, it is clear that the U.S. Government has no justified counterarguments and that the U.S. Government may not actually impose sanctions on Japan."
