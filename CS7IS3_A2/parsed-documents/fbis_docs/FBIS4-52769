It is neither liberal nor non-communist. We have made this complaint because the king -- the revered shade of the people -- still hesitates to dissociate with the Khmer Rouge [KR] communists. Therefore, our internal policy seems to be in the middle point between liberalism and a killing field. This is similar to being on the abyss of death. The formula that the king has proposed, such as allowing the KHmer Rouge to share power in the government, is not one to bring about peace. Neither is the formula for dividing Cambodia into three parts. The one on for reelection to seek the winners in order to establish peace is a formula that will only lead to a more serious war. The failure of the war against the Khmer Rouge, which control only 10 percent of the territory, was caused by His Majesty's indecisive policy. The only formula for achieving peace is to be decisive toward the communists, to stand firm on the side of the enemies of communism who are always ready to help us. If we stand firm on just one side, we will not regret even death. If we agree to let the Americans help us sincerely, like good friends, Thailand, which also depends on the Americans, will certainly not dare help the Khmer Rouge. This will be a chance for the Khmer Royal Armed Forces to totally crush the Khmer Rouge. It is better to take just one side than both. In this matter, former Marshal Lon Nol was very brave. He resolutely sided with the Americans. It is better to take just one side than wavering, which only causes endless misery to the people. Observers of internal politics say that if we reject the Khmer Rouge, stop recognizing them, and turn to the free world countries for help in strengthening our army, the war will certainly end very quickly. By being indecisive, one cannot be a leader and the war will not end.
