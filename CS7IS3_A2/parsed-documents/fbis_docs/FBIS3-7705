Japan's Foreign Ministry was greatly criticized for that. What do you think about it? [Okazaki] Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990. I was the Japanese Ambassador to Thailand then. On that date, Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama had stopped over in Bangkok for a night on his return trip after attending an ASEAN meeting. As I was listening to a news program, I learned that Iraq was likely to invade Kuwait. The reason was because, for one thing, there was information that Iraq was amassing its troops along the border. Since it is difficult to supply needs when you come to the forefront in a desert, assembling at the border means that the troops are on the offensive. For another, what Iraq had been demanding from Kuwait was far from acceptable to it. That night Mr. Nakayama and I had dinner with the foreign minister of Thailand. If Washington had known about the possibility of war, there was a possibility that it would have already discusses it only with the top leaders of the world. So I briefed Mr. Nakayama on the subject, just in case, but it was not brought up during the dinner. Later we learned that the United States had not imagined that the war would break out. So, Thailand did not know about it as a matter of course. When Mr. Nakayama returned to Bangkok after the incident had occurred while he had been staying for a night in Laos, he immediately came to my residence, (the official residence of the ambassador) and asked my opinion. I said at that time, the point was, first, to what extent Saudi Arabia would cooperate [with the United States], and whether Egypt was going to support [the United States]. If Saudi Arabia and Egypt supported the United States, it would be all right. Also, [we thought] the first thing the United States would do was to block Iraqi economy, and it was better for Japan to join the United States immediately. In fact, Japan supported imposing economic sanctions at once, and that was before the UN resolution on sanctions. Up to that point, I was very satisfied with Japan's judgment and actions. However, they were not good thereafter. What happened after that is as you know. Stubbornly adhering to the postwar pacifism without regard to its practicality, Japanese assessments and policies were terrible. I was in Japan from the beginning to the end of September on annual leave. Japan's views on the situation while I was there were so terrible. I learned how bad the Japanese are in assessing the situation. The president of a top leading company asked me what would happen next. And I answered that the United States would of course intervene and a war would break out. Then he said, "the dispute should be solved by peaceful means." Also, a prime minister-level politician said, "If there is going to be a war, oil prices will skyrocket, and [the economy] will get mixed up. War should be avoided because the world economy will be thrown into great disorder." I thought this opinion was wrong in terms of not only its economic outlook but also its view in which war could not be started because oil prices would increase. [GAIKO FORUM] You mean economics is not the only thing that influences human society. [Okazaki] While I was paying attention to the U.S.-Saudi Arabia negotiations, they ended in almost no time, and on 9 August a formation of F-15's arrived in Saudi Arabia from Germany. This meant that oil was all right because the 300 km stretch from Kuwait to Saudi Arabia's oil fields is a desert without trees, grass, or even clouds. You cannot do anything unless you have air supremacy. Therefore, the moment the U.S. fighters arrived in Saudi Arabia the safety of large oil fields in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, whose supply is enough to meet the world's demand, was assured. I said this to the politician. I also told him not to worry. Oil prices may rise for the first week after a war starts, but they will drop steeply afterwards. The politician did not want to think that oil prices would not surge. That was why everybody made a wrong judgment. [GAIKO FORUM] That is a question [of prerequisite] before discussing information itself. [Okazaki] In September, I met many people, including Kissinger, who was visiting Japan, and a rough outlook of the situation became apparent. I returned to Bangkok late in September. From then on, there was no information. So I made a decision. There is a British division called the "Desert Rats." It is a glorious division which fought Erwin Rommel at the Libyan front. In short, it is England's most powerful division. This division was heading for the Gulf from the riverside of the Rhine. In Bangkok, I decided to occasionally ask the British ambassador to Thailand where the Desert Rat division was. So I got such information as the division was in the Mediterranean Sea, it had landed, or it was under training. The United States would not start a war alone. So, when the deployment of the British division was completed and it was ready to fight, it meant the beginning of war. The deployment was completed in late November. The last notification was issued at the United Nations on 30 November. The notification period was originally one month, but this was extended to 45 days after the Soviet Union asked for an extra 15 days. The war then began in mid-January. So, my prediction was correct. If you look at the world as it is, you can get the answers. If you do not grasp the situation, you must be considering something irrelevant. In other words, you start to understand the world once you stop thinking about unnecessary things. The Collapse of Eastern Europe Predicted a Year Earlier [GAIKO FORUM] Besides the Gulf war, did you find the collapse of Eastern Europe impressive? [Okazaki] When the Berlin Wall fell, every newspaper described it as "a situation no one would ever have imagined." Thanks to those who started the talk, I do not know who, no one can be blamed for not predicting the event. The fall of Eastern Europe, however, was a clear possibility about a year earlier. I met a great many people in 1988. Each of them, including Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, said Eastern Europe was in trouble. Brzezinski made the best point when he said, "the current situation of Eastern Europe is similar to that of Europe in 1848." It was in 1848 that Metternich fled after revolutions occurred in chain reaction across Europe. As I did not know a lot about that period I studied and learned that the situation was taking the same course. I reported this to senior Foreign Ministry officials. From that time Vice Minister Murata repeatedly said Eastern Europe would soon be chaotic. In a speech made to presidents of Japanese firms in Bangkok at the beginning of 1989, I said there was the possibility of the Soviet Union intervening if the situation in Eastern Europe erupted. I explained that if the Soviets intervened, it would lead to a near state of war. At such a time the value of the yen would drop. On the other hand, if there was no intervention, and the situation moved in a direction favorable to the United States, leading to victory for the West, then the value of the dollar would rise. Investment in Southeast Asia is very sensitive to the value of the yen. A certain company [in Bangkok] told me, "if the yen goes over 180 to the dollar, then the head office in Japan will not take care of goods manufactured there. They will have to be sold locally." Everybody fears a weak yen. At the end of 1989, I told firms to beware a weaker yen, and the dollar turned out to be slightly stronger thanks to the victory of democracy in Eastern Europe. You can even predict these kinds of things. [GAIKO FORUM] I see. Is there anything else? [Okazaki] What is more strange are the discussions surrounding the current recession. In February 1993, Fred Bergsten [director of the Institute for International Economics] came to Japan. He made speeches at various places. He also met then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, and they apparently found in each other a kindred spirit. What Bergsten said is that the issue of Japan's trade imbalance could be settled by an appreciation in the yen rate. I think he said that if the value of the yen increased by 1 percent, it would bring down Japan's trade surplus by $5 billion. It would not happen immediately, but in two to three years. A 10-percent increase in the yen's value would cut $50 billion, eliminating almost entirely the trade surplus with the United States, Bergsten said at various different times. I knew the U.S. Government would try to guide the value of the yen upward, and the Japanese Government could not resist it. Since I am not an expert on economics, I asked my friends in the business world what they would do if the yen reached the level of 100 to the dollar. Everybody said Japanese economic growth would be zero, and the economy would fall into a recession comparable to that in Europe. This means everybody knew the yen would become stronger, and that the yen's appreciation would halt economic growth. That was in February and March of 1993. Nevertheless, newspapers and economic forecasts expected a recovery in the summer. When, by the summer, it had not recovered, they blamed it on the cool summer. I do not think the cool summer caused a business slowdown, except perhaps in one or two industries. The cause was the strong yen. In short, the government had to encourage industry to carry out drastic restructuring while implementing a large-scale economic stimulus package in February. But both politicians and government officials appeared frozen into inaction. Strategic Thinking and Secret Funds Enable Positive Diplomacy [GAIKO FORUM] You also believe Japan-U.S. relations will be at stake in February. [Okazaki] The United States urged Japan to set numerical targets in July 1993, and Japan agreed on condition it be a reference index, thus postponing a real settlement of the issue. I think such a solution was, at the time, a success because it put a stop to the Japan-bashing then taking place. However, in February, six months later, the two countries will have to pay for putting off a real settlement. The discussion on the Japanese construction market in November was handled all right, so the issue now will center on whether to set a numerical target for the auto parts market. This time Japan will not make concessions because even at last July's talks it had no intention of compromising to that extent. It agreed to the compromise in word, with no thought of putting it into action. However, the U.S. approach has been very demanding and has come in for criticism even within the United States. It has continually urged Japan not to exercise administrative guidance; now it wants Japan to meet targets through the use of administrative guidance. This is quite wrong theoretically. That is why all economists oppose the idea. But the United States has its reasons. It concentrated on promoting deregulation in the past, urging Japan to abolish all sorts of regulations. However, the trade imbalance would not go away. It thought Japan might be exercising administrative guidance out of sight, so the United States thought that if Japan was set a target to achieve, it would use its discreet administrative guidance to that end. This is very coercive reasoning, but there is about 30 percent of truth in the suppositions behind it. Many economists, though, disapprove of the idea. In addition, the United States has rapidly regained its confidence. So now there is a possibility the U.S. Government will stop making unreasonable demands on Japan if we can wait for another six months. If Japan judges that the grounds on which the U.S. argument are based are about to collapse, it will never compromise. At such a time the two nations are on a collision course. It will be all right if the United States softens its stand by February, but, if not, Japan and the United States will collide. If there is going to be a head-on collision between the two countries, there is the possibility of a revival of the Super 301. If the Super 301 is reinstituted, the situation will become more problematic. There will be no place for negotiation or discretion. This must be avoided or there will be disastrous consequences for years to come. At the moment neither side has any intention of making concessions. Instead, they are playing "a game of chicken," in which two cars run at each other on course for a head-on collision, and the one who turns the steering wheel first is the "chicken." February will be like that. One way Japan can avoid such a situation is to persuade U.S. economists and open-minded legislators one by one, by mobilizing many people, including scholars, and anyone else in a position of influence. If Japan can relax feelings in the United States it may be able to reach a compromise at some point. Such diplomacy would succeed now if it could be carried out, but I do not think it can be done. Let me explain why. Basically, diplomacy is passive administration. In other words, a problem occurs first and then diplomacy comes in to solve it. The best example of passive administration is policing. You arrest a thief if there is one. You do not set a target, for example, to catch 2,000 thieves next year because 1,000 were arrested this year. Traditional ministries such as foreign and home affairs are passive administrations. They do not think it is their job to carry swords and make raids on enemies. You may have an ambassador, with the knowledge and eloquence of a first-rate economist, who is able to persuade his opponents, but that is not always the case. In the past, both the Foreign and Home Affairs Ministries had the means of positive administration. That is, secret funds. Nowadays, there are no such funds. For instance, suppose you hire economists, and ask each of them to win at least three people over to your side, by giving them 10 million yen each. If you use 10 economists, the you will need to pay out 100 million yen. It is difficult today to freely spend an amount like 100 million yen. So, the two countries will be moving fast on a collision course before anything serious can be done. [GAIKO FORUM] Is not strategic thinking a positive means? [Okazaki] Yes, it is. And if you had a strategic mind and secret funds, you could carry out positive diplomacy. Developments in the Crisis-Ridden Korean Peninsula [GAIKO FORUM] You have written a book called Tonari no kuni de kangaeta koto [My Thoughts on a Neighboring Country], and you are familiar with the situation in the Korean peninsula. What are the important developments in North Korea (the Democratic People's Republic of Korea), that we should watch. [Okazaki] Everybody feels in their hearts that the government of North Korea will collapse. We do not know whether this will happen tomorrow or 10 years from now, but there is always the possibility. A more immediate problem is the issue of nuclear inspection. By February 1994, the matter will be reaching its final stages. The administration of the United States has changed from Republican to Democrat. The appointment of the new administration's officials was completed around June and July 1993. Since then, the issue of nuclear inspection has moved toward a negotiated settlement. This means, the United States will try to stop North Korea's development of nuclear weapons by offering a series of concessions to North Korea's liking, such as the cancelation of the joint Team Spirit exercise with the South. This kind of approach itself has met opposition from the conservatives. For one thing, they feel that rewarding North Korea for violating the treaty sets a bad example. For another, if the negotiations are slow, North Korea's nuclear arms development will continue to progress. But despite such opposition, the United States is determined to solve the issue by diplomatic means. The question is how long this resolution will hold. The Democratic administration is dove-like compared to the Republicans. It is the Republicans who can conceive of things like pinpoint bombing. The Democratic Party, however, is characteristically peaceable and believes in principle-oriented diplomacy. Principles such as human rights. Among them is the principle of not allowing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. If the United States permitted North Korea to arm itself with nuclear weapons, then it would be forced to allow Iraq and Iran the same right. That is the last thing the Democrats can allow. In that respect, Democrats do not think in terms of power politics. There is no room for the Democratic administration to think nuclear armament is inevitable, so why not accommodate the country as a new nuclear nation and treat it accordingly. Nevertheless, it seems difficult to maintain a policy that nuclear armament should never be allowed while saying the issue must be settled by diplomacy. As a result, it is negotiating with North Korea by offering a lot of compromises, but is determined to impose sanctions if talks break down. This is U.S. policy. However, South Korea cannot follow it. As a result of the fact it has its first civilian government in a long time, there were antiestablishment, left-wing liberals in the Seoul administration until a recent reshuffle. Because of them, the South Korean Government was not able to show determinedly that it would not tolerate North Korea pushing things too far. However, there is an extreme sense of crisis among the military and the conservatives in South Korea because of the antiestablishment figures in the administration. Their opposition is so strong that the South Korean Government again cannot support the U.S. negotiation tactics of offering good concessions to North Korea. The South Korean Government was unable to announce the suspension of Team Spirit. It may do so eventually, but Seoul cannot take any action. The reason why South Korea does not face criticism, even though it is doing nothing, is because it keeps saying that diplomatic talks are underway. For example, at the meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Kim Yong-sam, they concluded that diplomatic negotiations would be continued. As long as they maintain that line there will be no contradiction. Of course, there are contradictions behind the scenes. It will be about February when these contradictions come to the surface. [GAIKO FORUM] Does the Korean peninsula face a crisis in February too? [Okazaki] Here is the reason. There are surveillance cameras which constantly monitor North Korea's nuclear facilities. However, the cameras are about to run out of film and batteries. So the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) says they have to be changed soon or the status of North Korea's nuclear weapons development cannot be monitored. The IAEA will, in the near future, ask the UN Security Council to do something about the issue. As circumstances stand at the moment, it is currently constrained. Even if North Korea yields and accepts inspection of its nuclear sites, the suspicion that North Korea is developing nuclear arms will not go away. And there will be allegations that North Korea is buying time and that it is continuing to develop nuclear weapons. Talk of adopting a resolution to impose sanctions will once again emerge unless people are prepared tacitly to allow North Korea to develop nuclear weapons. It is inevitable. If sanctions are adopted, which North Korea has been saying it will take as almost a declaration of war, Pyongyang could take any kind of action. This is approaching. However, there is also the possibility of the matter coming suddenly to a peaceful settlement. The United States is ready to make concessions until the issue is solved. The problem will be settled when North Korea is satisfied with the deal. There is also the possibility that North Korea's nuclear weapons development is not nearly as advanced as we thought, and that it has been blocked by technological hurdles. This, then, would provide a marvelous opportunity for North Korea to strike a bargain. So there is a chance the situation could improve very quickly. In either case, February 1994 will be the turning point. In addition to all this, people also feel the government of North Korea could collapse at any time. [GAIKO FORUM] A fearful thought. [Okazaki] North Korea's reaction to economic sanctions, if they are imposed, is a fearful thought too. It is especially frightening to South Korea and Japan. We do not know what North Korea will do. A missile may be fired or, like the Rangoon incident, a bomb may be planted somewhere. [GAIKO FORUM] Will China cooperate in imposing sanctions on North Korea? [Okazaki] Yes, I think so. If food and oil to North Korea are stopped, it cannot exist. However, since China was North Korea's ally in the Korean war, it cannot strangle North Korea to death by its own hands. China will cooperate in enforcing sanctions to a certain degree, but it will not be possible to rely on that to ruin North Korea. North Korea would be destroyed if China seriously imposed effective sanctions. [GAIKO FORUM] The issue of Hong Kong's democratization is now being given a great deal of attention. [Okazaki] The return of Hong Kong to China will be in 1997. There are four more years. Before then the issue of Deng Xiaoping's successor will emerge. Also, we do not know what Taiwan and Tibet will do. Taiwan has already applied to join the United Nations, and that is virtually a declaration of independence. Moreover, the outside world will start to realize that Taiwan has become a free democratic country. When Taiwan is recognized as a democratic nation, the United States will not be able to neglect it. As it becomes clear the Taiwanese are taking a different course from Mainland China, people in Hong Kong will envy them. This issue will come up around 1995. Comparing 19th Century Europe With Asia [GAIKO FORUM] Lastly, let's take up the issue of historical vision, which you have been stressing. What do you think is the most important thing as we look toward the 21st century? [Okazaki] I wrote an article for a magazine about the similarities between 19th century Europe and Asia at the moment. After the Napoleonic war, ethnic nations emerged all at once. These countries had been in chaos in the 30 or so years from the Napoleonic war to the revolution of 1848, but all of them suddenly started to grow economically from about 1848. In Asia today, China, for example, became independent around 1950, and it was about the time of the Gang of Four in 1978 that its economic growth started. Other Asian nations also declared their independence about 1950, and their growth began from about the time of the Plaza Accord in 1985. In short, growth is attributed to the emergence of ethnic countries. Consider the following. By holding an international exposition, countries change the entire look of their cities. First in London, then in Vienna, Chicago, New York, and... the change in Tokyo took place exactly at the time of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Osaka at the Osaka Expo 1970, and Seoul at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Expos or the Olympics have changed the faces of cities completely. I wrote this thesis in the summer of 1993. After that, the former Beijing Bureau Chief for THE NEW YORK TIMES, Nicholas D. Kristof, wrote an article in the latest issue of FOREIGN AFFAIRS [Volume 72, No. 5]. He says the rise of China definitely changes the balance of power and it is dangerous. In addition, he says, because China has been subjected to various humiliations in the past, it is dangerous for such a country to gain power. In other words, Prussia was humiliated by the Napoleonic invasion, but it won in the end. He compares Bismarck to Deng Xiaoping. While Deng Xiaoping is in power it is all right, but when a person like Wilhelm II takes power, it is dangerous. In sum, he compares the rise of 19th century Germany to the current rise of China. This line of thinking is almost the same as mine. In my essay, I tried an analogy between the present age and the 19th century in terms of strategic theory. First, England's manufacture of the Dreadnought made every existing warship obsolete. Then Germany, on the rise, tried to catch up with Britain by making a lot of Dreadnought-class warships. Although the United States currently places nonproliferation of mass destruction weapons as its first-priority objective, it does not have much effect. The high technology of the United States during the Cold War was always 10 years ahead of that of the Soviet Union, and at the same time it was preventing the proliferation of its technology under Cocom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] regulations. But no matter how it controlled the spread of technology, by the 10th year Soviet technology had always reached the same level of U.S. technology 10 years before. By the time the Soviet Union caught up to that level, of course, the United States had further developed its high technology again, and won the Cold War in the end. However, the United States has now started to reduce investments in high technology. Controlling the proliferation of weapons is not enough, because the technology is only 10 years away for other nations. So the level of military technology possessed by the United States and Japan in the Far East at the end of the Cold War--in other words, technology not so different from that used in the Gulf war--will be attained by China. And in terms of quantity, China will have more. What happened at the time of the Dreadnought will be repeated. So the comparison between 19th century Europe and modern Asia is significant. [GAIKO FORUM] Very interesting. But, is there any solution to this situation? [Okazaki] There will never be a solution. [GAIKO FORUM] We have had a valuable opportunity to listen to you and how, using concrete examples, to analyze information. Thank you very much.
