The spokesman said Brittan, due in Ukraine Thursday and Friday, will stress the urgent need to close the facility, the site of the world's worst civilian nuclear accident, in April 1986. In Paris, French Environment Minister Michel Barnier said Thursday his government would submit a proposal to its European Union [EU] allies within 10 days for a concrete timetable for closing the two reactors still operating at the plant. Barnier said France would seek approval for the project from both the EU and delegates at the G7 summit of leading industrialised nations in Naples in July. Both he and the European Commission spokesman stressed the need to help ensure Ukraine has stable alternative sources of energy. Western nuclear energy experts believe Chernobyl could fall victim to a second disaster if the plant is not shut down. Energy-starved Ukraine says Chernobyl provides seven percent of the former Soviet republic's electricity and that it would need three billion dollars in financial compensation for shutting it down.
