The Ukrainian Government group was headed by Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov and the delegation from the G-7 countries by Antonio Puri Purini, authorized minister and head of the seventh department's working group on nuclear safety. This meeting was of a consultative nature, dealing mostly with issues of nuclear safety in Ukraine. They discussed cooperation by donor countries of the fund for nuclear safety, the EBRD, and other influential international organizations with Ukraine in technical, economic, and financial aspects. The sides, therefore, expressed readiness for joint action in the area of the safe exploitation of atomic energy and improving the state of the environment. However, the word Chernobyl was often heard because one of the main conditions for all-round help from the G-7 countries to Ukraine is not only in resolving the problems of nuclear safety but also in strengthening the economy and the gradual closure of the Chernobyl AES [nuclear electric power station] generating sets.
