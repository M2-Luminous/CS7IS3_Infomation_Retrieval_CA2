A Government Source Comments on a Presidential Edict Abolishing Export Quotas and Licensing"] [Text] After the edict canceling export quotas and licensing has been adopted, the role of special exporters will increase substantially, a government source who asked not to be identified said in an interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. Because even now the oil pipeline is operating at full capacity, the abolition of oil quotas and licenses without abolishing the special exporter status effectively gives the advantage of "getting into the pipe" to those companies which have benefited from their status in the past. However, considering that the oil pipe does not stretch like rubber, it can be assumed that if special exporters were also abolished, bribes and connections would be used, which would lead to a civil war over the oil pipelines. Experts are rather critical of the edict on cancellation of duties and quotas. Thus, some politicians believe that the edict is nonviable. Others (including NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's source) point to the edict's equivocal wording which will lend itself to different interpretations by specialists. In fact the presidential edict annulled Appendix 1 to last year's government resolution "On Liberalizing Foreign Economic Activity" which laid down procedures for quantity regulation and licensing. Commenting at NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's request on the new trade scheme, the source noted that it is clear already: Military equipment, dual-purpose goods, gold, and precious stones will be subject to licensing and quantity regulation. Furthermore, under the presidential edict, international delivery quotas, established from outside, will remain on aluminum and textiles. "Much will depend on the interpretation which the government puts on the edict in its resolutions," the source said. "At present it is difficult to say definitely what the edict's implications will be or how they will impact on the business climate in Russia and foreign investments." Earlier, Deputy Foreign Economic Relations Minister Andrey Dogayev said that the state will regulate trade through six to seven domestically produced goods, including deliveries within the framework of "external quotas" under international agreements. Incidentally, a joint statement by the government and the Central Bank provides for the cabinet's obligation to lift restrictions on all commodities with the exception of crude oil, diesel fuel, electricity, nickel, aluminum, and copper, restrictions on which, according to the statement, will be lifted at the end of 1994.
