Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, who is also the central bank governor, told a national financial work conference which closed Saturday [15 January] in Beijing that all the banks must observe the "rules and discipline" enforced since July 1993 and control the credit line as planned. He said that every bank must limit its lending to fixed assets investment projects and loans for major projects in infrastructure and basic industries will be arranged in a unified manner by the new state development bank. Zhu said that banks will not provide loans to unauthorized projects or projects beyond the credit line. "The planned total credit line must not be exceeded even by one yuan," the vice-premier stressed. Zhu said that the macroeconomic control measures adopted by the central government are "appropriate", helping avert an excessive fluctuation of the national economy. He said the over 99 percent of the key national projects have got the necessary funds; there have been no IOU's in purchasing agricultural produce; and the strained situation in the working capital of major production enterprises and foreign-funded firms has been eased. At the same time, Zhu said, the over-issue of money has been curtailed; money supply has been controlled within bounds; the market exchange rate has been stable; and the state foreign exchange reserves have increased. However, Zhu said that the macroeconomic control measures have eased some of the problems only to some extent and problems in the deeper part of the economy remain unsolved. "We are still far from setting up a risk mechanism to effectively restrain investment in fixed assets and the inflationary pressure is likely to build up at any time." Zhu said. He warned banks against inter-bank lending in violation of banking rules, raising interest rate without authorization or in disguise or running economic entities. The central bank governor asked the specialized state banks to take a big pioneering step this year in their transition to commercial banks. He said that the branches of the People's Bank of China should concentrate their efforts on stabilizing the currency and supervising operations of financial bodies. The bank governor called for particular attention to the current task of preventing a resurgence of unauthorized lending and raising of funds, saying that only by so doing, is it possible to ease the inflationary pressure.
