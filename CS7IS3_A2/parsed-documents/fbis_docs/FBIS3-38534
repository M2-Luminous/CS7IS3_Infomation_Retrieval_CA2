This reform must have the objective of giving more flexibility to the wage formation process in order to reduce labor costs and preserve competitiveness without large job losses and to proceed with overdue structural reforms in social security to put fiscal consolidation permanently back on course. After noting that Belgium's short-term economic prospects are bleak and that the country is faced with difficult choices, the OECD observes that one of the overriding priorities of public authorities must be to redress public finance. Additional corrective measures are necessary to reassure investors, eliminate the "snowball effect" (i.e. the self-sustaining increase in the debt/GDP ratio as a result of interest payments), put fiscal consolidation back on a path consistent with the Maastricht targets and start making room for the increase in social expenditure that population ageing will likely cause. These corrective measures will have to center on the social security system and its growing deficit and all social security schemes should be reassessed along these lines. The OECD also recommends: - In the context of the federalization of the country, a reorganization of the public sector to avoid duplication of work between the different levels of administration, leading to a reduction in the overall number of civil servants; - Preparation for the pressure on social spending that demographic trends are likely to cause as the population ages; - More flexibility in wage indexation; - Given the extent of unemployment, positive actions in the form of retraining and job placement programs, especially for persons over 46 or unemployed for less than nine months who are not covered by the present "personal" plan. The OECD notes that the Belgian economy has entered into a cyclical downturn: Real GDP is likely to fall by around 1.25 percent this year, more than the EC average. This downturn in activity is due to external developments, high real EMS [European Monetary System] interest rates and a deterioration in international competitiveness as a result of exchange rate changes in Europe. Regarding the economic situation in Luxembourg, the OECD concludes that the outlook is mediocre. Economic growth is likely to decelerate in 1994 and labor costs are expected to increase more rapidly than in partner countries. Although the public finance situation compares extremely well with that of other European countries, its recent sharp deterioration illustrates the risks of a continued buoyant expenditure growth policy in the medium term. The high expenditure growth reflected the government's ambitious investment programs and the rapidly growing government wage bill and transfers to the business and household sector. The 1993 and 1994 budgets maintain this policy stance. The OECD nevertheless notes that the cyclical downturn in 1992 and 1993 and the only modest rebound projected for 1994 could have a sharper negative impact on revenues than foreseen in the budget, resulting in a serious downward risk on the government balance for 1994. Lastly, the OECD recommends building in more flexibility in public expenditure and gaining better control over it.
