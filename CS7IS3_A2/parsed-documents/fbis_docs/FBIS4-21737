The number of SL and MRTA terrorists arrested between June 1992 and December 1993 amounts to 6,300, which shows the effectiveness of the anti-terrorist strategy implemented by the government because in only 18 months the security forces arrested more terrorists than during the previous 12 years: Between 1980 and 1991 a total of 5,403 terrorists were arrested. So far this year, during January and February, the number of arrested SL and MRTA terrorists amounts to 1,367. Moreover, according to statistics from the Special Prosecutor for Terrorist Crimes, 4,099 terrorists have benefited from the repentance law (Decree Law No. 25499), promulgated in May 1992. The new anti-terrorist law, which has been in force for more than 18 months, has allowed the trial of 1,104 terrorists, a significant number compared to the 1981-1992 period during which 576 rulings for terrorist crimes were passed down. The military court has sentenced 451 terrorists for treason, of which 288 were sentenced to life imprisonment. Civil courts sentenced 653 individuals for terrorist actions, 19 of whom were sentenced to life imprisonment. The Armed Forces Joint Command disclosed that during the past 14 years 26,000 Peruvians died as a result of terrorist actions. Of this total, 2,075 were members of the Armed Forces and PNP. The number of terrorist actions dropped noticeably in 1993. Only 1,306 terrorist actions were registered last year while in 1992 2,049 were registered. According to official reports, the harsh blows struck by the security forces against the Shining Path have caused it to reduce its activities throughout the country. [passage omitted] The MRTA's situation is similar. Eighty percent of its leadership is being held under arrest in high-security prisons while 85 percent of the so-called Popular Revolutionary Army has been fully dismantled. The MRTA also has serious organization and leadership problems as well as logistic and economic difficulties that have prompted an incredible number of its members to defect. Many of its members have deserted and are now stealing, carrying out holdups, or are involved with drug traffickers. [passage omitted]
