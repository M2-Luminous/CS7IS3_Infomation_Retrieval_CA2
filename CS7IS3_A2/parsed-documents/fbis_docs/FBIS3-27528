Monory, the highest French leader to visit China since the normalization of Sino-French relations last month, is the 24th foreign parliamentary leader which the National People's Congress (NPC), the Chinese version of parliament, has received since last March, when the Eighth NPC Standing Committee was formed. Also touring China at present are the Italian Senate President, the chairman of the Turkmenistan Grand National Assembly and the chairman of the Vietnamese National Assembly. It is rare for so many foreign parliamentary leaders to converge on China at a time just before the NPC annual session. Involved in the policy of expanding influence and making friends, the NPC Standing Committee has carried out considerable contacts and exchanges with its foreign counterparts, which have led to its busy diplomacy, said Yin Zuojin, an official of the NPC General Office in Charge of Foreign Affairs. In the past year, the standing committee sent out 17 delegations to visit 27 countries and regions and attend seven international conferences, while receiving 37 groups from foreign parliaments, including 24 headed by parliamentary speakers or chairmen. According to Yin, the number of delegations -- sent out and received -- is larger than any previous year. Observers here said that 1993 saw the congress's diplomacy with four characteristics. First, as a part of the country's diplomacy, the congress paid much attention to strengthening relations with parliaments of neighbouring countries. NPC Chairman Qiao Shi's visit last July to the five Southeast Asian countries marks the first trip there by a Chinese NPC chairman. Meanwhile, other senior NPC leaders toured the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, five countries in middle Asia and Japan. Parliamentary leaders from Russia, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, India, the Republic of Korea and other neighbouring countries came to China at the same time. Second, the congress exerted more efforts to increase its contacts with parliaments of Western countries. In January, 1994, Qiao Shi became the first Chinese NPC chairman to make a trip to Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Other NPC delegations' visits to Sweden, Norway and Denmark, restored China's association with these countries' parliaments. In the past year, the NPC received five delegations from the U.S. Congress, more than it did in any previous year. Last year also found the speaker of the European Parliament, the delegation of 19 members from nine countries of the European Parliament and a delegation of the French National Assembly as well as parliament delegations from eastern European countries treated as guests in China. Increasing exchanges with parliaments in the Third World countries was another feature of the NPC's diplomacy in 1993. The NPC's delegations visited Mexico, Cyprus, Syria, Egypt and other Third World countries, including Paraguay, which has no formal diplomatic ties with China. The congress was also active in taking part in multilateral diplomacy, with several delegations attending various international conferences. Yin pointed out that the parliamentary diplomacy not only built closer relations between China's national congress and foreign parliaments and promoted friendship and cooperation, but also provided foreign experiences for China to learn in its economic construction and legislation. He expected that with further reform and opening-up, the congress's diplomacy will gain even stronger momentum in future.
