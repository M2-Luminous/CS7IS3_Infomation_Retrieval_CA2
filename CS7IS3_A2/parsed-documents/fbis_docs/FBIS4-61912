After the pullout of Russian troops from the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, a new stage of national reconciliation will begin between the two countries, said Boris Yeltsin today at Vnukovo airport before his departure on an official visit to Germany. According to Boris Yeltsin, he will start the Russian-German summit with "the most difficult question": the procedure of the withdrawal of the Russian troops. There is no disagreement with the German side as to the timetable for the pullout. The president said it will be completed by 31 August. However, there are still differences on the procedure. The Russian side maintains that the last Russian troops will leave Germany from Berlin, while the German side says that they should leave from Weimar. "This is not the same thing," Boris Yeltsin stressed. [sentence as received] Boris Yeltsin stressed particularly that in the social sphere Germany had met all its obligations with regard to construction of settlements for the military and accommodation for officers. "It is the only country to have taken this approach; moreover, additional social commitments worth 550 million German marks have recently been adopted." Boris Yeltsin revealed that during the visit a wide-ranging package of documents on economic cooperation would be discussed and that a mutual return of cultural valuables would not be raised as a separate issue.
