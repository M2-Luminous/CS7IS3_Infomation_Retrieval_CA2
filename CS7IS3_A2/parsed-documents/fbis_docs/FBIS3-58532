In exchange for a small porcelain figure showing Clinton as a saxophone player, Yeltsin received a belated Christmas package -- consisting of four sizable presents. One was a personal gift from Bill to Boris: The demonstrative hug for the Russian president by the U.S. president, designed to signal to the whole world: Yeltsin is our man. Secretary of State Warren Christopher made it clear to Moscow prior to Clinton's trip that Yeltsin "is by far the best advocate of the democracy progress and thus the best guarantor of stability." Whereas Clinton met three times with Yeltsin, his rivals -- old communists and neorightists -- were put off with a few friendly words during the reception. The other three presents were not intended for the leader but for the population. The first was dispatched long before the Moscow trip and merely approved by the Europeans at the NATO summit in Brussels. Its name is Partnership for Peace and it contains -- with Western approval -- a Russian right of veto concerning the military relationship between NATO and Moscow's former satellites in East Europe. The Partnership proposal is full of sweet words, and includes some attractive offers for the reform countries, but excludes membership in the alliance. As a result of noisy Russian warnings, the terms "maybe/sometime" and renewed discussion were used in connection with the questions as to who will be accepted when. The second present consisted of Ukraine's nuclear weapons. The United States and Russia had already reached agreement on what Clinton described in the following way in Moscow: The "clear opportunity" has come "for us to be able to draft a new security structure for Europe." When Ukraine's President Kravchuk signed the treaty on elimination of the inherited Soviet nuclear missiles, he did that because of joint pressure by U.S. and Russian leaders. He was bribed by Clinton and blackmailed by Yeltsin: Ukraine will receive money from the United States -- $1 billion -- and Russia will resume its supply of oil and gas, which it has suspended systematically over the past few months. New Structure The third present was more symbolic but still quite valuable. The two presidents announced that Russian and U.S. nuclear missiles will no longer be directed against one other but at the sea. This will not really decapitate the hydra-headed monster, because the United States can reprogram the targets within a few minutes, even while the missiles are in flight. Yet, symbolism is politics and, for this reason, Yeltsin was right when he stressed: "We have met to settle the final point of the last problem of the Cold War." Thus, the Cold War has been declared as ended. What will follow now? In fact, in their enthusiasm and relief over America's return to the old continent, the Europeans have not really realized that Clinton showed them in a friendly way who dominates world politics. The Partnership for Peace concept was developed in Washington, and the Ukrainian nuclear potential was not brought closer to the scrapping sites by Kohl and Mitterrand but by Clinton and Yeltsin. If a "new security structure for Europe" is to be built, the architects will be the United States and Russia. For a country that "lost" the Cold War, this is an honor that would have made Talleyrand envious after 1815 and Adenauer after 1945. However, can one blame Bill Clinton for that? He may indeed be influenced strongly by Russia's ardent supporter, Strobe Talbott, the new deputy secretary of state. However, who else could he have chosen as "hero of the continent?" France? De Gaulle has always been governing there, no matter whether under a socialist or conservative flag. The French made life a perfect hell for Clinton during the GATT talks. They seem to be dreaming of a neo-Napoleonic "continental system," designed not to fend off England but the United States. "European Concert" What about Germany? Washington considers this country too unpredictable to assume the part of first violin. Germany is for free trade and for France; it is for Europe (Chancellor Kohl) and against Europe (Bavarian Minister President Stoiber); it is for NATO expansion (Defense Minister Ruehe) and against it (Foreign Minister Kinkel); for out-of-area missions (Christian Democratic Union) and against them (Social Democratic Party of Germany and -- occasionally -- the Free Democratic Party of Germany). German foreign policy is playing too many instruments -- it is trying to safeguard too many interests -- to be able to set the tone in the "concert of Europe" (as the club of major powers was called after 1815). Maybe it does not even want to, which need not necessarily be a sign of false modesty with a view to its nervous neighbors. Thus, the U.S.-Russian junior partnership has been established partly for want of something better. Yet, it is also in Europe's interests if it is subjected to the right rules. Just as after 1945, at this point in time, Russia is Europe's most urgent problem. Yet, it is not the external strength of the giant but the internal weakness that makes the country dangerous. Moscow must not become a Weimar raised to the third power. The conclusion is that Russia's fear of "isolation or encirclement" must not be fanned, as Chancellor Kohl demanded in his government statement on the NATO summit. Yet, as in medicine, the doctor's task is to determine the right dose here, too. A Russian right of veto over East Europe, that is a diplomatic "Brezhnev doctrine" with NATO approval as it were, was not the first wrong signal. It followed the West's roaring silence when Moscow restored its predominance in the neighboring Caucasus region. In spite of the required sensitivity on this issue, it is clear that Kohl was right when he added that "hegemonic efforts" are incompatible with partnership. Clinton also gave the right answer -- rather in passing -- to the question of whether the West would do nothing -- as on the eve of World War II -- if an East European country were attacked. Clinton stressed that this lesson has not been forgotten, and thus he "doubts" that nothing would happen. A "Russian Weimar" would be a disaster, but so would a "Polish Weimar". Those who want to help Yeltsin because they are afraid of a weimarization must grant the same aid to Presidents Walesa, Havel, and Goncz. They are as close to our hearts, and even closer to our borders. Sorting out the entire legacy of Soviet communism will be more difficult than its containment. Yet who ever claimed that foreign policy is easy? Bill Clinton has made a good start, and the Europeans should not be concerned about his star performance. Left to their own devices, they would have been as successful as in Bosnia.
