FR940328-2-00009 FR940328-2-00006 The comment period on the DSEIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA publishes the notice of availability in Federal Register . The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 533 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed by the courts. City of Angoon v. Hodel, 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final statement. To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments on the DSEIS should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the DSEIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points. After the comment period ends on the DSEIS, written comments will be analyzed and considered by the Forest Service in preparing the final supplemental environmental impact statement (FSEIS). The FSEIS is scheduled to be completed by September 1996. The Forest Service is required to respond in the FSEIS to the comments received (40 CFR 1503.4). The Forest Supervisor will consider the comments, responses, and environmental consequences discussed in the FSEIS, and applicable laws, regulations, and policies in making his decision regarding amendment of the CMP. The responsible official will document the decision and rationale in the Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to appeal under 36 CFR 217. Dated: March 22, 1994. Joellen J. Keil, Acting Forest Supervisor. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;7191 Filed 3&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;11&hyph;M
