FR940928-2-00103 FR940928-2-00067 The deletion of Surveillance Requirement 4.1.3.1.4.b, requiring proper float switch response by verifying float switch actuation after a scram does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Design changes have enhanced the SDV design and provide a redundant and diverse means of monitoring SDV level. Also, a 92-day surveillance (S.R. 4.3.1.1) ensures the operability of the float switch. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Osterhout Free Library, Reference Department, 71 South Franklin Street, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania 18701. Attorney for licensee: Jay Silberg, Esquire, Shaw, Pittman, Potts and Trowbridge, 2300 N Street NW., Washington, DC 20037. NRC Project Director: Mohan Thadani (Acting). Southern California Edison Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50&hyph;361 and 50&hyph;362, San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Unit Nos. 2 and 3, San Diego County, California Date of amendment requests: December 30, 1993, June 3, 1994, and August 25, 1994. Description of amendment requests: The licensee proposes to replace the current Technical Specifications (TS) with a set of TS based on the CE Owners Group Improved Standard Technical Specifications issued by the NRC staff as NUREG&hyph;1432 in September 1992. The adoption of Owners Group-approved TS is part of an industry-wide initiative to standardize and improve TS. San Onofre, Units 2 and 3, is the lead plant for adoption of the CE Owners Group standardized TS. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? The proposed change relocates requirements and surveillances for structures, systems, components or variables which did not meet the criteria for inclusion in Technical Specifications. The affected structures, systems, components or variables are not assumed to be initiators of analyzed events and are not assumed to mitigate accident or transient events. The requirements and surveillances for these affected structures, systems, components or variables will be relocated from the Technical Specifications to the Licensee Controlled Specifications or the UFSAR [updated final safety analysis report]. These operability requirements and surveillances will continue to be maintained pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59. In addition, the affected structures, systems, components or variables are addressed in existing surveillance procedures which are controlled by 10 CFR 50.59. The reformatting and rewording process involves no technical changes to plant design or operations. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? The proposed change does not necessitate a physical alteration of the plant (no new or different type of equipment will be installed) or changes in parameters governing normal plant operation. The proposed change will not impose any different requirements and adequate control of information will be maintained. Thus, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. Does this change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? The proposed change will not reduce a margin of safety because it has no impact on any safety analyses assumptions. In addition, the affected structure, system, component or variable requirements and surveillances are the same as the existing Technical Specifications. Since any future changes to these requirements in the Licensee Controlled Specifications or UFSAR in the surveillance procedures will be evaluated per the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59, no significant reduction in a margin of safety will be allowed. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration.
