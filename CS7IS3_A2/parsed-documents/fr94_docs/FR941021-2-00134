FR941021-2-00134 FR941021-2-00087 Based on the above evaluation, the staff finds there is reasonable assurance that the containment leakage-limiting function will be maintained and that a forced outage to perform Type B and C tests is not necessary. Therefore, the staff finds the requested temporary exemption, to allow the Type B and C test intervals to be extended to the end of the 12th refueling outage which began on October 1, 1994, to be acceptable. IV Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), the requested exemption is authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common defense and security. Further, the Commission finds that the special circumstances required by 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) are present. Application of the regulation in these particular circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule in that, as discussed in Section III, the containment leakage-limiting function will be maintained. An exemption is hereby granted from the requirements of Sections III.D.2(a) and III.D.3 of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50, which require that Type B and C tests be performed during each reactor shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals greater than 2 years until end of the current refueling outage. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this Exemption will have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 50928). This Exemption is effective upon issuance. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 12th day of October 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Walter R. Butler, Acting Director, Division of Reactor Projects_I/II, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26142 Filed 10&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M
