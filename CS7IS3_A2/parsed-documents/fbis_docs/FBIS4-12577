In an arrival statement to the Iraqi News Agency, 'Abd-al-Ghafur said Russian party chiefs are impressed by the pace of Iraq's renewal, led by President Saddam Husayn, who has turned into a symbol of the fight against imperialist hegemony. 'Abd-al-Ghafur said he hoped that when the UN Security Council next reviews Iraq's compliance with Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 calling for lifting the sanctions, Russia will adopt an even more postitive attitude. Iraq, he noted, had fulfilled the obligations stipulated by the council resolutions, unfair as they are. Russian Government officials and party leaders emphasized that retention of the sanctions hurts not only the Iraqi people but Russia as well. They reiterated Russia's willingness to maintain excellent relations with Iraq, 'Abd-al-Ghafur added. [passage omitted]
