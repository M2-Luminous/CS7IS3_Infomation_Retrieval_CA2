Certainly, there has been a demand among top echelons of the nation's aviation industry that the Air Corporations Act be scrapped as it had ceased to have any relevance. But, the question being asked today is will its removal mean that Indian civil aviation will really begin to take to the skies? According to them, for the industry to take off in a big way the outlook of the large militant aviation work force has to undergo a big change. Otherwise, scrapping of the Act will simply have no meaning at all. Though Air-India and Indian Airlines executives described Saturday night's Presidential promulgation as a new chapter in the history of Indian civil aviation, the unions predictably have opposed it. "We are opposing it," was the response of the general secretary of the Air Corporations Employees Union (ACEU), Mr R. Ramanathan. Mr Ramanathan said that when the matter was before Parliament there was absolutely no need for the Presidential proclamation. He also said that there was a public interest litigation before the Calcutta high court challenging the validity of the licenses given to air taxi operators. The matter before the Calcutta high court would now have no meaning on account of the Presidential Ordinance, he regretted. While most of the aviation unions have been against the Act being scrapped for fear that their jobs would be at stake, only the Indian Pilots' Guild (IPG), the representative body of Air-India pilots, has adopted a broad-minded view on this controversial issue. Said the IPG president, Captain V.M. Mayadev: "With the economic scenario in the country undergoing a change, I feel reforms have to be accepted." It may be recalled that it was only this organisation--the IPG--which stated with some amount of reservations of course, that it would not oppose changes when its members deposed before the Mahajan Commission in New Delhi last year. The Act's repeal undoubtedly marks a major setback for the unions who have all along tried to retain it. They organised strikes, lunch-hour demonstrations and walk-outs, all of which proved futile. To convince them that under the liberalised economic scenario, the Act had no place proved a herculean task. Now the unions have lost their battle. It is felt that they should gracefully accept defeat and tell their members the need to accept reforms in their own interest. The message is that from now on they have to think big and not be bogged down by narrow personal interests. Otherwise the Act's repeal will have no meaning. The unions have really nothing to fear because when the process of disinvestment begins they too would be given a share. Which means that they too would have a say in the functioning of both airlines and thus their interests would be fully protected. Right now, the two new companies Air-India Limited and Indian Airlines Limited--whose offices are registered in New Delhi will be cent per cent government-owned. [sentence as printed] Functionally, therefore, one cannot expect any significant changes at the moment. For the changes to start, the process of disinvestment would have to be initiated in the next few months. As a prelude to the Presidential ordinance, the Air-India and Indian Airlines boards were reconstituted a fortnight ago. Some of the new A-I board members are, apart from the chairman and managing director, Mr Yogesh Deveshwar, Mr P.K. Banerjee, Mr Brijesh Kumar, Mr Vijay Madan and Mr R. Krishnamurthy. Speaking to TOINS this morning, Mr Deveshwar said that he was happy that the Act had been repealed and he "looked forward to a new era in civil aviation." "I would welcome this change," said Mr M.R. Pai, who has been championing the cause of air passengers. But, he added that it should have been done through an Act passed through Parliament rather than a Presidential Ordinance. "At the moment the scenario in Indian Airlines was such that it was run 50 per cent by politics, 25 per cent by bureaucracy, there was 15 per cent staff militancy and only 10 per cent professionalism," Mr Pai regretted. The repeal of the Act has at last legitimised the operations of the air taxi operators. From last night following the promulgation of the ordinance, they ceased to be "air taxi operators," but full-fledged "airlines." Among the benefits they can now enjoy is that they would be able to publish their schedules. "We now enjoy a legal status and we are all very happy," said the managing director of East West Airlines, Mr T.A. Wahid. With the operations of these new private airlines having a legal sanctity, the much-publicised "Open Skies" policy would have some significance from now on. On the other hand there is understandable apprehension in some quarters whether the `Open Skies' policy means a sellout of our skies to foreign multinational air carriers. Aviation experts feel that while any form of liberalisation is welcome, the country's aviation industry should not be taken over by foreign airlines.
