I. The Features of China's Macroeconomic Control of Export Tax Rebates Since 1991, China has rigorously strengthened its planned control over export tax rebates in the following detailed ways: We have linked tax rebate plans to export plans, with those without export plans not to be approved in principle for tax rebate plans; we have linked tax rebate plans to exchange-earning plans, with those not fulfilling exchange-earning duties having their tax rebate quotas reduced; we have broken down tax rebate plans to all regions and export enterprises; and we have made local revenues responsible for the excesses when tax rebate plans are exceeded. These provisions show that China's macroeconomic control over export tax rebates is characterized as follows: 1. Treasury rebates are mostly the responsibility of central revenues. The criteria for treasury-rebate division are tax rebate quotas, with central revenues being completely responsible for those within quotas, and local revenues completely responsible for those beyond quotas. 2. Export tax rebate operations are dependent mostly on tax rebate plans, not on fixed laws and regulations. 3. We exercise overall control over export trade, with all exports, both those that exceed and those that do not fulfill export plans, subject to restrictions and constraints without respect to particular conditions. We lack individual regulation and correct guidance of export trade. II. Existing Problems in China's Macroeconomic Control Method for Export Tax Rebates 1. Our Control Method Has Mutual Conflicts with Export Tax Rebate Legalization. Article 3 of the "PRC Tax Collection Management Law" states clearly that: "Tax impositions and cancellations, as well as reductions, exemptions, rebates, and make-up payments, are enforced according to legal provisions; State Council provisions authorized by law are enforced according to the provisions of the administrative laws and regulations drawn up by the State Council." So export tax rebates, just as tax collections, should have legal mandates and permanence. While China's export tax rebate legislation is still very inadequate, lacking the legal norms of our supreme organs of power, the pertinent Ministry of Finance provisions approved by the State Council similarly do have a certain legal standing, so should be regarded as a component part of China's tax law system. As matters, such as export tax rebate scope, tax rebate rates, and tax rebate calculation methods, are clearly set forth in our pertinent legal documents, certainly not varying because of the amount of export turnover or exchange earnings, all export products that conform to China's external economic laws and regulations should enjoy tax rebate qualifications and rights. But in our current control method, whether export products win tax rebate qualifications depends on whether there are export plans and export tax rebate quotas, with above-plan exporters subject to local government constraints as to whether they will get tax rebates, and the future tax rebate treatment of export enterprises that do not fulfill plans subject to restrictions, etc. Such a control mechanism operating on planning grounds adds many artificial factors to China's export tax rebates, largely diluting the proper permanence, solemnity, and force of laws and regulations. 2. It Puts a Heavier Burden on Central Revenues. In China's current graded revenue-control system, most flow-tax revenue is shared by the center and localities at a 50-50 rate (in minority-nationality regions, the local share is greater; commissioned customs collections revert to the center). For 1991 and 1992, China's export tax rebates respectively totalled 25.4 billion RMB and 27.6 billion RMB. If export tax rebates and real export product tax inclusion were in overall balance, then the central revenue from export products before tax rebates would have been only 12.7 billion yuan and 13.8 billion yuan. But as tax rebates are mainly the responsibility of central revenues, the figures for these two years reduced central revenues about 13 billion yuan a year for this one item alone, thus putting a heavier burden on central revenues. That tax rebates are mainly the responsibility of central revenues was set years ago. In 1991, in order to reduce the impact of tax rebates on central revenues, while the state was forced to institute quantitative control of export tax rebates, using the quota method to break them down to all regions and export enterprises, this merely alleviated the symptoms without getting at the root of the problem. As we expand our reform and opening, China's exports and export tax rebates are bound to increase year after year. So if we do not thoroughly reform our treasury-rebate methods, central-revenue difficulties are also bound to grow increasingly more serious. 3. It Affects the Initiative of Local Governments To Support Export Growth, Acting as an Inducement to New Regional Economic Barriers. The provision that above-plan tax rebates are the responsibility of local government treasury rebates is a restriction on export growth per se. As to regions with rapid export growth but revenue difficulties, it is undoubtedly a blow. So proceeding from revenue-balance considerations, some local governments take a negative approach to export growth, even to the point of using administrative means to restrict it. Although many export enterprises could buy in products from other areas to expand their exports, the taxes would be collected in other areas while the tax rebates would be the responsibility of local revenues, causing strong opposition by local governments. In many areas, governments demand that export products be produced locally, forbidding exports of products bought from outside, which not only restricts export growth, but also forms new regional economic barriers. 4. It is Detrimental to the Intensified Reform of Our Foreign Trade System. Our foreign trade system reform is aimed at 1) achieving a corporate status for foreign trade enterprises and 2) reducing the scope of planning. An essential prerequisite for enterprise incorporation is enterprise operating independence, so that as long as they conform to state export policy, enterprises should have the right to decide their own export orientations and scales based on domestic and foreign market information. But export tax rebate quotas directly restrict enterprise export scales, thus indirectly controlling their export orientations. While a market economy intrinsically requires the reduction of government administrative interference and directive planning, combining export guidance-plans with quota-type tax rebate plans turns them into mandated plans in reality as well as in name. Our foreign trade sector has clearly pointed out recently the need to reduce planning-list commodities, as well as the export commodity varieties subject to quota and licensing controls, in order to expand the scope of market regulation. In this case, our export earnings plans grounded on tax rebate quotas should mostly no longer exist, with tax rebate quotas becoming like water without a source or a tree without roots. This means that the establishment of a new and scientific export tax rebate control form is imperative, without which it will be hard to move forward with intensification of our foreign trade system reform. 5. It Is Adverse to the Optimization of Export Product Mix and the Diversification of Export Markets. In recent years, China's export products have been concentrated mainly in a few varieties, such as toys, textiles, clothing, and machinery and electronic products, with our export markets being mostly in Hong Kong and Macao, Japan, the United States, the West European EC, and the five ASEAN countries. When formulating export operating tactics, enterprises are subject to tax rebate-quota constraints, being forced to consider matters such as the tax rebate rates of various products and the prices on various international markets; thus not daring to add new export varieties or open up new export markets. How many domestic products actually miss out on good opportunities of being exported to new markets due to tax rebate quotas? While we do not know this, we can say with certainty that as tax rebate quotas are set according to export plans, which in turn are basically set according to the real achievements of past years, keeping export tax rebates under overall quota control ultimately can only ensure that past export products and markets continue to maintain their dominant positions, while the export growth of new varieties and the development of new international markets are restricted. 6. It Apparently Strengthens but Actually Weakens. While the quota-type method apparently strengthens control, it is actually a mere formality that exists in name but not reality. 1) As tax rebate quotas have become a scarce item similar to our past coupons when we practiced supply by coupon, having become a special "commodity" transferred at a price privately among controllers and enterprises, among enterprises, and among regions, they have become the source of a certain amount of corruption and law violation. 2) tax rebate-quota control forces enterprises to pay attention only to fulfillment of export earnings plans instead of RMB-accounted profits and losses, while providing an opening for tax fraud. 3) When enterprises and regions exceed tax rebate quotas, the relevant departments are forced to grant further ones on pretexts, such as supplementary quotas. In both 1991 and 1992, real tax rebates exceeded the planned figures at the beginning of the year. III. Suggestions on Improving China's Macroeconomic Control Method for Export Tax Rebates Our guiding reform ideology is to standardize export tax rebates in order to bring them more into line with market economy demands, in order to push forward with normal export trade development and intensified foreign trade system reform. Reform should observe the following principles: treasury rebates should be tied to revenue jurisdiction; we should treat individual products or enterprises appropriately differently, in order to guide export trade to a sound growth; and macroeconomic control should be mostly through legal institutions. Our specific suggestions are as follows: 1. We Should Reform Our Treasury-Rebate System, by Dividing Up the Responsibility of Revenues at All Levels According to Revenue Jurisdiction. China' macroeconomic control method for export tax rebates was at first treasury rebates being the joint responsibility of the center and localities, then was changed after a relatively short time to central treasury rebates, which was a blow to central revenues, and then was changed again to the method of quantitative control and overall quota control, which took export tax rebate control off of a legal track, and finally created the many above-analyzed adverse results. This shows that in order to reform our current macroeconomic control method, we will first have to begin by reforming our treasury-rebate system. We favor bringing order to revenue relations, by dividing up central and local revenue treasury-rebate responsibility according to revenue jurisdiction. As the customs-commissioned part of flow taxes come under central jurisdiction, the central revenue treasury-rebate responsibility should be appropriately higher on the basis of revenue-sharing percentages. The greatest obstacle to local responsibility for tax rebates is local revenue sustainability. According to 1992 tax rebate calculations, the tax rebate responsibility per province, municipality, and autonomous region averaged 400 million yuan, reaching about 800 million yuan for certain provinces and municipalities with large export volumes, which was adverse to the local balance between revenue and spending. In addition, as product export tax rebates and pre-export taxation could be separate regionally, local governments also formed new regional economic barriers to increase local revenues and decrease tax rebate responsibility. This shows that while reforming our treasury-rebate system, we must also appropriately resolve the following matters. 1) As central revenues have over 10 billion yuan more in revenues on the current basis, giving them the capability to regulate the relations between local revenues, they should provide local revenues with appropriate fiscal subsidies based on their varying conditions. 2) In our tax separation reform process, we could appropriately increase local shares and tax categories. 3) When our market economy is being established, in order to keep the powers devolved by the center to enterprises from being intercepted by local governments, we must also perfect our administrative and economic laws and regulations, in order to reduce local government interference in the economy, and effectively promote export growth and interregional economic ties. Changing central treasury rebates to joint treasury-rebate responsibility by the center and localities will certainly not be merely a simple change of the form of transfer of revenue funds, but will rationalize relations by linking responsibilities to rights, not only increasing central macroeconomic regulation and control capability, but also paving the essential way for overall reform of our macroeconomic control method for export tax rebates. 2. We Should Abolish Our Quantitative Control and Overall Quota-Control Method, and Adopt a Selective Quota-Control Method. In order to abolish our current method, we will need to clarify a theoretical question, i.e., does export and export tax rebate growth affect the growth of overall state revenue? Our answer to this question is no. 1) Export tax rebates involve only domestic flow taxes, not other tax categories or revenues. 2) Domestic flow taxes are divided into two parts: a) taxes involving export products, being revenue that the state "renounces;" b) domestic consumption (final consumption) taxes, being genuine revenues. As to certain supply-constrained products or resources (such as oil) that are scarce, for which domestic supply does not meet demand (effective demand), and for which increased exporting would lower domestic consumption, the state restricts or bans exports, also not granting export tax rebates. So for most products, export growth and domestic-consumption (meaning substitute-product consumption) growth should occr together, with the latter necessarily being more stable growth. As long as domestic consumption grows, regardless of whether consumers buy domestic or imported products, this will provide the government with steadily growing domestic flow-tax revenues. If the phenomenon of simultaneous export growth and government flow-tax revenue decline occurs, the inherent causes will be either economic recession or lower domestic effective demand, or not having brought taxes into line with tax rebates. In other words, as long as the tax rebate system is designed to implement the principle of taxes being in line with rebates, with particular operations avoiding or reducing incorrect tax rebates and tax fraud, then export and export tax rebate growth will absolutely not bring a decline in domestic flow-tax revenues. 3) As to long-range development, export tax rebates will be converted to funding sources for individual income and enterprise expanded production and operation scale, finally promoting production and domestic-consumption growth, thus providing the state with more revenues. The practice of all countries in export tax rebate method shows that export growth has never yet caused a decline in national revenues. Of course, this analysis refers to overall state revenues. If the form of treasury-rebate sharing is inappropriate, export tax rebates will have varing impacts on revenues at various levels. But even in this case, export tax rebates will not affect overall revenue growth. This shows that there is a full rationale for abolishing our current method. We favor the adoption of a selective quota-control form: 1. We need to continue to draw up export tax rebate plans each year, as well as bringing them into line with the national budget (or budgets at all levels), the goal being to enable the government through such projection planning to fully grasp future national economic development trends, thus enabling it to adjust and perfect its macroeconomic and macrosocial policies. But we must not substitute planning for tax rebate laws and regulations, and even less so mandate plans for markets and enterprises, which would constitute forceful interference in export trade. 2. As to enterprises, such as those still within foreign trade export plans, those with low added-value products, and export enterprises with high exchange-conversion costs and poor economic efficiency, we should practice rigorous tax rebate quota control, with quota overages being the responsibility of treasury rebates from local revenues. While particular operations can be directed at export products and export enterprises, such products or enterprises should be the minority, as well as being clearly distinguished. Enterprises that export new or high added-value products and actively develop new international markets should be provided incentives. Despite the amount of their tax rebates, they must all be given priority tax rebates to speed up their fund turnover, with an appropriate increase in the central revenue share for their treasury rebates. As to the majority of export enterprises and export products that do not fit into these two categories, we must not exercise quota control, and we must grant special preferences for a regular system of tax rebates. 3. We Should Reinforce Our Legislation. Our current export tax rebate legislative inadequacies are quite glaring: 1) Our legislative norms are quite low. Except for the provisions on tax fraud and penalties in the NPC "Tax Management Law," the only higher standard is the provisions in the pertinent Ministry of Finance "Circular" approved by the State Council in 1985. 2) Our various provisions are quite disorganized, with many conflicts and duplications, and lacking a systematic and complete legal article. 3) The liabilities of all parties to violations of our tax rebate system are not detailed and clearly distinguished, equating tax fraud with tax evasion. 4) Penalties for violators are too lax. In 1992 for instance, we investigated 178 export enterprises throughout China for tax fraud involving 580 million RMB, averaging a high of 3.25 million a case. But according to the provisions in our "Tax Management Law," tax fraud of over 10,000 yuan is penalized by only up to three years of imprisonment or service in detention. In comparison to the "three to seven year sentences for tax arrears that are not paid and cannot be collected of over 100,000 yuan," and the penalties for tax evasion or other economic crimes, such criminal penalties for tax fraud are obviously too lax. We hold that macroeconomic control of export tax rebates should be mostly through the legal system, the prerequisite for which is legislative perfection. In a market economy, the lack of legislative guarantees for the export tax rebate system will have many harmful consequences. From a long-range perspective, the export tax rebate method is absolutely not a matter of expediency, but rather a permanent way to promote trade development and fair international competition either for China or other countries. So we are recommending that the NPC draft and promulgate as quickly as possible a systematic and complete "Export Tax Rebate Law," to restrain the fiscal and administrative behavior of the government sector and the economic activities of export enterprises, clearly distinguish the liabilities and rights of the control sector and tax rebate applicants, and thus lay the foundation for achieving the legalization of our export tax rebates.
