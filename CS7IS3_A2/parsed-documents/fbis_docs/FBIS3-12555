The brother chairman of Presidential Council spoke to them and reviewed developments in the national arena following the signing of the document of accord in the Jordanian capital under the patronage of His Majesty King Husayn and the hospitality of the fraternal Jordanian people. This meeting was attended by all Yemeni political and popular forces. The brother president told the audience: I am glad to meet with you before the end of this holy month to acquaint you with the results of this meeting, which received great Arab and international attention. Everyone thought that immediately after the signing of this document in Amman the crisis would be over and the state establishments would reunite in order to resume work and begin implementing the provisions of the accord document. You heard what happened later. Now we are making efforts to reunite the leadership and the state establishments, and to end all remaining skepticism, which certain elements have tried to sow. These elements always survive by plotting and fabricating strife at the expense of the people and the homeland. The brother president added: It is regrettable that these forces and elements have been practicing such activities since the outbreak of the Yemeni revolution and until now. These forces and elements are only concerned with their own interests, even if these interests conflict with the revolution's objectives and the aspirations of the Yemeni masses. He referred to the traces of fragmentation left from the Imam's regime and colonialism. He said: On the eve of establishing the Republic of Yemen and the unity of the homeland, we were aware that we would face difficulties caused by these traces left by the old regime. We hoped that through wisdom and cooperation we would be able to overcome these difficulties, benefiting from [words indistinct] the lessons of history. But to those who do not want to see a united people and a prosperous homeland tried, from the first minute of unity, to resume their destructive activities. They poisoned relations of understanding, created a skeptical atmosphere, and incited division among the sons of the same homeland. They fomented conflicts and sectarian and tribal problems, and incited all backward practices, which the unity came to bury to overcome all tragedies from which our people suffered for so long. The brother president said: We, and all the masses of the Yemeni people, led by the national military establishment, which offered the dearest sacrifices in defense of the revolution and for the sake of realizing unity, will work to protect the gains that we realized throughout the revolution's march, and we will not retreat whatever the price might be. We are prepared to sacrifice for the sake of preserving the revolution's march and to protect the unity of the homeland. We will not hesitate to offer concessions and to relinquish power, if need be, in order to preserve the revolution's march and the homeland's unity. We presented this idea during the Amman meeting, and we said: Instead of differing over posts, it is possible to sacrifice some leaders and relinquish power for the sake of the unity of 14 million Yemenis. The brother president expressed deep sorrow for what happened recently in Mudiyah and some areas in Abyan as a result of certain movements made by some adventurous military commanders, against the orders and instructions of the political leadership and the hierarchy of the military command. These commanders will shoulder full responsibility for the mistakes they made and for the bloodshed and killing of innocents that they have caused. He expressed his sorrow and condolences to the families of martyrs who fell during these regrettable incidents. He emphasized that the state will take care of the martyrs' families and will bring to account everyone responsible for these incidents. He said every drop of blood shed in these incidents is a loss for the people and the homeland. The brother president considered all those killed in these incidents martyrs for the sake of unity, stressing that the state is committed to dealing with all issues that result from these incidents. The brother president referred to the tasks of the military committee assigned with ending the military deterioration. He instructed the commands of the Defense Ministry and the General Staff to facilitate all tasks of the committee and overcome all difficulties for it in order to allow it to carry out its duties in following up implementation of the military aspect of the document of accord and ensure the withdrawal of the military forces to their garrisons as they had been before the beginning of the crisis on 19 August 1993. The brother president expressed his hope that every effort would be exerted to restore confidence and dispel doubts within the command. He said that confidence could not be achieved through a decision or decree by the Republic, but through national practice and behavior, apart from exaggeration or oneupmanship. He asserted that past practices, behaviors, statements, and media polemics do not honor any nationalist cause or maintain the homeland's interests. He said that he issued instructions to the official media to prevent the broadcast of any statements that may further the current deterioration. The brother president pointed out in his speech that it is the sons of the military and security establishments that paid the price for the 1972 and 1979 conflicts. He said they were the victims of the conflict, and that after each conflict before the unity, disputing parties sat at the dialogue table after our people paid a high price for those conflicts. So, why do parties not sit at the dialogue table to discuss all issues in a brotherly spirit before shedding drops of pure Yemeni blood and instead of repeating the tragedies, which our people cannot stand and which we do not need? He pointed out that the unity is a source of pride and strength for every Yemeni and its is also a new birth for Yemen. This unity, he said, has produced a new mechanism, which we should use, benefiting at the same time, from others' positive experiences in the areas of security, economy, administration, and construction. The brother president also pointed out that the signing of the document of authorization for the military committee by the brother president and his deputy has won the satisfaction of the fighters and the masses of the people and that instructions have been issued to provide every facility for the joint military committee to achieve success in its mission. The Presidential Council chairman also stressed that no party has the right to control any Yemeni region or exercise trusteeship over the people in any part of Yemen. [Word indistinct] of the constitutional and legitimate institutions that are freely elected by the people to represent them here and abroad. The brother president said: We have great confidence that you, O brother fighters and comrades-in-arms, will shoulder your responsibility and confront those who create conflicts in society. The conflicts should end, and we will do all we can to prevent sedition in our society. We will root out those who spread sedition in order to entrench security and stability and to maintain our national unity. Within the next few weeks, we will, God willing, return to our bases safely under the banner of unity and democracy; we will turn over a new leaf in the interest of the homeland; we will heal the wounds; and we will exert efforts to promote confidence through dialogue, meetings, and sincerity. The military committee will withdraw [words indistinct] to their previous regions in order to translate the contents of the accord document and to withdraw units from the dividing lines to other areas. There are good signs, he said, that the committee will succeed in its mission, and we in the command will direct and urge all the military commands to cooperate with the military committee and facilitate its mission. Any individual or group that rejects orders will be fully responsible. We hope that this blessed meeting will be a step toward a comprehensive solution to the crisis. I wish you every success. The meeting was attended by Interior Minister Brigadier General Yahya al-Mutawakkil, Chief of Staff Brigadier General 'Abdallah al-Tihami, Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations Affair Colonel 'Ali Muhammad Salah, and several officials from the Defense Ministry and the Interior Ministry.
