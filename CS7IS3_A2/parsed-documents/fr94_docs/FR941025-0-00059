The authority citation for Part 65 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq.; Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1978, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 329; E.O. 12127, 3 CFR, 1979 Comp., p. 376. §65.14 [Redesignated as §65.15] 10. Part 65 is amended by redesignating §65.14 as §65.15. 11. Part 65 is amended by adding a new §65.14 to read as follows: §65.14 Remapping of areas for which local flood protection systems no longer provide 100-year flood protection. (a) General . (1) This section describes the procedures to follow and the types of information FEMA requires to designate flood control restoration zones. A community may be eligible to apply for this zone designation if the Director determines that it is engaged in the process of restoring a flood protection system that was: (i) Constructed using Federal funds; (ii) Recognized as providing 100-year flood protection on the community's effective Flood Insurance Rate Map; and (iii) Decertified by a Federal agency responsible for flood protection design or construction. (2) Where the Director determines that a community is in the process of restoring its flood protection system to provide 100-year minimum flood protection, a Flood Insurance Rate Map will be prepared that designates the temporary flood hazard areas as a flood control restoration zone (Zone AR). Existing Special Flood Hazard Areas shown on the community's effective Flood Insurance Rate Map that are further inundated by Zone AR flooding shall be designated as a ``dual'' flood insurance rate zone, Zone AR/AE or AR/AH with Zone AR base flood elevations, and AE or AH with base flood elevations and Zone AR/AO with Zone AR base flood elevations and Zone AO with flood depths, or Zone AR/A with Zone AR base flood elevations and Zone A without base flood elevations. (b) Limitations . A community may have a flood control restoration zone designation only once for the purposes of restoring a given flood protection system and must complete restoration of the system or meet the requirements of 44 CFR 61.12 within a specified period, not to exceed ten (10) years from the date of submittal of the community's application for designation of a flood control restoration zone. The community may not extend this period. The information specified in this section must be supplied to FEMA by the community as part of its request for designation of a flood control restoration zone. (c) Exclusions . The provisions of these regulations do not apply in a coastal high hazard area as defined in 44 CFR 59.1, including areas that would be subject to coastal high hazards as a result of the decertification of a flood protection system shown on the community's effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) as providing 100-year protection. (d) Effective date for risk premium rates . The effective date for any risk premium rates established for Zone AR shall be the effective date of the revised Flood Insurance Rate Map showing AR Zone designations. (e) Application and submittal requirements for designation of a flood control restoration zone . A community must submit a written request to the Director, signed by the community's Chief Executive Officer, for a flood plain designation as a flood control restoration zone. The request must include a legislative action by the community requesting the designation. The Director will not initiate any action to designate flood control restoration zones without receipt of the formal request from the community that complies with all requirements of this section. The Director reserves the right to request additional information from the community to support or further document the community's formal request for designation of a flood control restoration zone, if deemed necessary. At a minimum, each request must include the following:
