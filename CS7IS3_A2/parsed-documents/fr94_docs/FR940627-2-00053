The Program Narrative Statement is a very important part of an application. It should be clear, concise, and address the specific requirements mentioned under the priority area description in Part II. The narrative should provide information concerning how the application meets the evaluation criteria (see Section C, Part III), using the following headings: (a) Objectives and Need for Assistance; (b) Results and Benefits Expected; (c) Approach; and (d) Staff Background and Organization's Experience. The specific information to be included under each of these headings is described in Section C of Part III, Evaluation Criteria. The narrative should be typed double-spaced on a single-side of an 81/2 ’ ’ x 11 ’ ’ plain white paper, with 1 ’ ’ margins on all sides. All pages of the narrative (including charts, references/footnotes, tables, maps, exhibits, etc.) must be sequentially numbered, beginning with Objectives and Need for Assistance as page number one. Applicants should not submit reproductions of larger size paper, reduced to meet the size requirement. The length of the application, including the application forms and all attachments, should meet criteria set forth in each Priority Area. A page is a single side of an 81/2 x 11 ’ ’ sheet of paper. Applicants are requested not to send pamphlets, brochures or other printed material along with their application as these pose xeroxing difficulties. These materials, if submitted, will not be included in the review process if they exceed the page limit criteria. Each page of the application will be counted to determine the total length.
