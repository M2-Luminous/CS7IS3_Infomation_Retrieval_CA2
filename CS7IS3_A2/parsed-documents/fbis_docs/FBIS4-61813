"The historic experience of our people and us both springs up from the same soil: both reborn Poland and reborn Estonia are the children of Munich, the Hitler-Stalin pact, Tehran and Yalta," Meri said. Meri said that this experience obliges the countries to think and act for Europe even if Europe neglects or does not know how to look into the past in order to understand the future. "Our experience must become European conscience," Meri said. Meri said that the paradox in Western democracy lies in the fact that it cannot defend itself before it is too late although democracy cannot ever be fatally late, but the price to be paid later must be paid with blood and suffering. Meri also touched upon Estonian-Russian relations saying Russia must show in action that it has cut through its ties with the defunct Soviet Union and that it is looking for its place in the world respecting the principles of international law. "Estonia cannot put up with the recent situation where one UN member country threatens another UN member country with military measures in order to achieve political goals," Meri said on referring to a statement made on Friday by the Russian Defence Minister, Pavel Grachev, on considering increasing its military presence in Estonia if it felt the rights of ethnic Russians were not protected. Estonia remains the only Baltic state with whom Russia has no formal agreement on troop withdrawal. President Lennart Meri on Saturday interrupted his visit to Portugal to return to Estonia and discuss the situation. On Monday, he asked Russia's ambassador Aleksandr Trofimov to explain the statement of his Defence Minister.
