FR940720-0-00097 FR940720-0-00006 (B) Exhaust benzene emissions under the Simple Model for an averaging period are calculated as follows: E:GRAPHICSER20JY94.005 where EXHBEN = the average exhaust benzene emissions for the averaging period BZ = the average benzene content for the averaging period, calculated per paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section AR = the average aromatics content for the averaging period, calculated per paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section (ii) Complex model calculations. Exhaust benzene, exhaust toxics, and exhaust NO X emissions performance for each batch shall be calculated in accordance with the applicable model under §80.45. * * * * * (i) * * * (1) Any refiner or importer shall for each batch of conventional gasoline, and other products if included in paragraph (d) of this section: * * * * * 23. Section 80.102 is amended by revising the formula in paragraph (b)(1) and the definition of V bs, the formula in paragraph (d)(1)(i) and the definitions of V bs and V g, the formula in paragraph (d)(2)(i) and the definition of V g,i, paragraph (d)(3)(iv), adding paragraph (d)(3)(v), and revising paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(i) to read as follows: §80.102 Controls applicable to blendstocks. * * * * * (b)(1) * * * E:GRAPHICSER20JY94.006 * * * * * V bs = Volume of applicable blendstock produced or imported and transferred to others during the calendar year, and used to produce gasoline * * * * * (d) * * * (1) * * * (i) * * * E:GRAPHICSER20JY94.007 * * * * * V bs = Volume of applicable blendstock produced or imported and subsequently transferred to others during the averaging period V g = Volume of conventional gasoline, reformulated gasoline and RBOB produced or imported during the averaging period, excluding California gasoline as defined in §80.81(a)(2) * * * * * (2) * * * (i) * * * E:GRAPHICSER20JY94.008 * * * * * V g,i = Volume of conventional gasoline, reformulated gasoline and RBOB produced or imported during averaging period i, excluding California gasoline as defined in §80.81(a)(2) * * * * * (3) * * * (iv) Transferred between refineries which have been grouped pursuant to §80.101(h) by a refiner for the purpose of determining compliance under this subpart; or (v) Used to produce California gasoline as defined in §80.81(a)(2). * * * * * (e) * * * (2) * * * (i) Include all blendstocks produced or imported and transferred to others in its compliance calculations under §80.101(g) for two averaging periods beginning on January 1 of the averaging period subsequent to the averaging period when the exceedance occurs;
