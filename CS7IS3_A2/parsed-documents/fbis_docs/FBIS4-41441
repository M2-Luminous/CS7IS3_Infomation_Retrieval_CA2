The EIS representative reported that Primakov had met with Yasir `Arafat in Tunis, and had also had a series of conversations with other political figures in various countries. While the EIS director's tour is unofficial, his peace-keeping mission seems to be fully official. One of the most important questions discussed by Primakov during his meetings was the Middle East peace process. Primakov was assigned the job of talking to leaders in the troubled area not so much due to his position as EIS chief, but because he is one of Russia's top Middle East experts. At the end of this week, Primakov is expected to return to Moscow.
