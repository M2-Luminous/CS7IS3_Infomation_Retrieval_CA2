Starikevich: "Belarus: Back Into the USSR"] [Text] The five-year mandate of republic authorities is expiring. Everyone in a leadership position wants to catch the next train, including those who are responsible for the Belarusian train finding itself on a siding. Maneuvers of the Communist Party of Belarusia after August 1991 The political landscape characteristic of 1990 - 1991 has actually been preserved in Belarusia. Most of the power belongs to a formation which is frequently called a party of the Council of Ministers. That is not quite correct inasmuch as it is really an officially totally unsanctioned association consisting of the former communist nomenklatura which retained positions in the republic leadership. The Council of Ministers here appears as one of the components, nothing more. The events of August 1991 forced the Communist Party into a castling move by transferring the main levers of power to the government. It is important to note that at that time the parliament and the government were merely appendages of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belarusia. The Central Committee ceased to exist and was replaced by the Council of Ministers. Naturally, government leaders immediately announced their resignation from the party. Thus an impression was created that the Communist Party has been removed from power. That allowed some to assume key roles and others to temporarily move into the shadows, while retaining power en masse. At present the Council of Ministers in essence is the sole active branch of power in the republic. The government lobby in parliament has a sufficient number of votes in order to control the situation. Its backbone consists of the "Belarus" group of deputies which formed in the fall of 1991 on the basis of the communist faction. Its members prefer not to advertise their pro-communist views. The faction of the People's Movement of Belarusia (NDB), which unified the "Soyuz" deputy group, the factions of veterans and the party of communists of Belarusia, that was formed in November 1993, is an ally of "Belarus." Most of its members were elected from public organizations (veteran and invalid societies). NDB does not conceal its pro-communist orientation and is distinguished by particular aggressiveness directed against practically any kind of a democratic transformation. Democratic organizations are represented in parliament by the Belarusian People's Front faction. Its activities are tinged by rigid anti-communist and anti-imperialist views. The opposition is from time to time joined by those with centrist viewpoints from the Party of National Consent and the Belarusian Social-Democratic Hromada. But even together at best they are capable of only blocking the adopted decisions (particularly those requiring a constitutional majority). In regular elections those holding centrist positions will more than likely have to be content with an insignificant number of mandates while the main harvest will be reaped by communists and the Belarusian People's Front. But who knows when the elections will take place meanwhile it is necessary to live today. After the resignation of Stanislav Shushkevich a situation formed where all of the key posts and structures came under control of the former nomenklatura, including the powerful ministries, which was so fervently desired for so long by the government. The piquancy of the situation is that it is still uncertain whether Shushkevich's resignation did more good than harm for the government. The former speaker was so well suited for the role of the main culprit responsible for all the troubles. It appears that in getting rid of him the nomenklatura was guided not by logic but by social instincts. As a result of that the government lost its screen and became a candidate for the job of the one responsible for everything. At the same time benefits derived from the resignation of the speaker are very doubtful. Yes, now the Council of Ministers and Supreme Council are under full control of the former nomenklatura, and the fist, which consists of the government, the parliament, and the communists, appears sufficiently powerful. According to all the signs, however, this wonderful association can expect a thrashing in the very near future. New head of the parliament Mechaslav Grib, who formerly did not lay any claim to independence and certainly not to a position of leadership, now, it seems, considers himself a figure at the very least as powerful as Kebich. He is starting to put together his team. It is true, his first forays among the people (in drugstores and at kolkhoz meetings) were such tortured affairs, done very clumsily. The communists also might feel themselves unsatisfied. All they have gotten out of this government up to now was several positions of secondary importance in executive power structures. At the same time it is not clear with whom the Council of Ministers officials will be entering the forthcoming elections since they no longer have their own party and its successor, the party of communists of Belarusia, has a sufficiently stable electorate, approximately the same one which is being claimed by the government. It is not precluded that the communists will not wish to share votes and on the eve of the elections will attempt to sink everyone they can, both the parliament and the government. Kebich's positions, however, are not as strong as many believe. If the erected framework for the unification of monetary systems collapses, it is rather doubtful that the premier will be able to get out from under its ruins. A lot of those will immediately be found who are willing to demonstrate for Kebich the difference between the status of a first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belarusia and a head of government. At the same time the question regarding the premier will sooner or later still appear on the agenda even in case the unification does take place. There is no doubt that Kebich will attempt to utilize such a success in order to conduct presidential elections in its light and occupy the heights unattainable for his opponents. But would such a variant suit his present allies? They will have ample opportunity in order to outmaneuver Kebich. After all a decision has not even been adopted yet concerning introduction of the post of president in the republic of Belarus. A Government Without a Program The phenomenon of the Belarusian government consists of the fact that in four years of its existence it is yet to carry out any transformations particularly since it never had anything even remotely resembling an economic program. Having received a relatively prosperous republic, compared to its neighbor, it systematically brought it to near collapse and is now lamenting over a broken trough. All attempts by the Council of Ministers to inject itself into the economic sphere, as a rule, ended in disgraceful failures. The introduction of single-use coupons may serve as an example of that. Since then that is how they exist: the government on its own and the economy on its own as well. The culprit in all of this, of course, is the former chairman of the Supreme Council, but a month has already passed since his departure without any noticeable changes, even microscopic ones. The reasons for such a state of affairs are seen in the fact that following the disintegration of the USSR a kind of power vacuum formed in the republic. Until then members of the local nomenklatura elite felt quite comfortable in the role of deputies of Moscow. Their main privilege was the possibility of not having to think since that was taken care of in the capital city. In the fall of 1991 the executives faced the need to make decisions. They had the power, but what to do with it was incomprehensible. Perhaps that problem could have been resolved but the Communist Party had met its demise somewhat earlier. The former nomenklatura lost a powerful structure which made it possible to govern the state. At the same time it is genetically incapable of adapting to the new conditions. Today Belarusian leadership is not a master of the situation, but a hostage of the situation which has formed and which it is powerless to change. Unfortunately this period of disintegration could continue for a very long time. In the meanwhile the communist doctrine, which has failed everywhere in the world, remains as the guiding star of Belarusian nomenklatura. Many of its representatives see a return to the past as the solution. It is not by accident that the "Belarus" group and the communist organizations favor the denunciation of Belovezh agreements. Having failed the test in reorganization of the economy, the government is attempting to rectify the situation once again shifting its problems to the shoulders of someone else. This time to the shoulders of Russia. At their noisy meetings the loyal Leninists repeatedly declared that they regard the republic as a springboard for revenge on the scale of the Soviet Union. Therefore if Russia agrees to carry the load of Belarusian economic problems, it will acquire a rather difficult ideological burden as well.
