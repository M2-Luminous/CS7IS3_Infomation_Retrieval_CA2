[Monteiro] Of course. I would like you to leave me alone, because I do not want to make any statements. [Correspondent] You have come out of all this rather badly. Is your conscience clear that everything was normal? [Monteiro]] Certainly. My conscience is clear, because I am certain that we acted within the law and in keeping with democratic rule. [Correspondent] What happened in Madeira? [Monteiro] What happened in Madeira was that two magistrates accused SIS of watching them or investigating them. As you know, the council.... [pauses] The government asked the monitoring council to look into this, and the council dismissed the accusation. [passage omitted] Therefore, it was not proved. [Correspondent] In any case, irregularities were found in SIS work in Madeira. [Monteiro] I do not want to say anything about that. What I find strange, very strange, is that the original issue disappeared while side issues have surfaced, remain there, and are greatly exaggerated--issues that I consider to be minor and that I partly blame on an unfortunate choice of words. [Correspondent] But did SIS act outside the law in Madeira or not? [Monteiro] I believe that in strict terms it did not. There may have been a linguistic slip. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] In the last eight years, did you ever feel that you were a tool of the government? [Monteiro] Never. The government never asked anything from me. All SIS activities were at my initiative and are my responsibility. I would like you to see my resignation as normal, because do not forget that the post of director general is a temporary post that can end at any time. It is not a lifetime position. Throughout the last eight years, the monitoring council has given SIS very favorable appraisals. I would go as far as to say it has praised SIS. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] If it were not for this affair would you have resigned? [Monteiro] Obviously in view of all this, and in view of the accusations leveled at my former colleague in Madeira--in my opinion a serious man, and therefore the accusations are unjust--and because I believe I should give the government room to maneuver to defend itself against the unjust accusations leveled at it, I felt I should hand in my resignation. It is above all a matter of dignity.
