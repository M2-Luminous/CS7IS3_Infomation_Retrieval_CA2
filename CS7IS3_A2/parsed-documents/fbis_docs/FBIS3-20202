As we pointed out yesterday, hope has been vested in the measures the Turkish Government has to take after 28 March, measures that the opposition parties should support... It is only then that we can feel relieved. However, judging by the reports that were disseminated by government sources yesterday, we do not have to wait until then. A new development has taken place and we may begin to relax immediately. What was that "development?" Clinton has reportedly sent a letter to Tansu Ciller. It was a lengthy letter, the text of which was leaked to one of the newspapers in one way or another... It contained several promises. It said: "(...) We eagerly expect to work with you and with your government in the next few days and weeks." Well, there is nothing to worry about... The United States is supporting us... Our economic problems and other difficulties will be resolved... Yes, that was the atmosphere that was created by the government circles and, of course, by the newspaper that published the letter. Yes, that was the "atmosphere" that was created. However, not even children would believe that that "atmosphere" will improve the situation. A letter from the United States, greetings from Ronald Reagan, a telephone call from George Bush, and an encouraging gesture by Clinton... Rejoicing and congratulating oneself over such developments is an ailment which has obsessed several of our leading politicians for many years. That approach has several drawbacks. It neither promotes their prestige nor adds to the dignity of their country. Usually, that approach ends in disappointment. The outcome of the hope we had to "put one in and take five out" during the Gulf crisis must be recalled at this point. The telephone calls we received [from the United States] inspired that hope in Turkey at the time. Meanwhile, it must be pointed out that the greetings, telephone calls, and letters are not limited to compliments and promises. Requests are conveyed in them as well. Naturally, no head of state will agree to give something to his counterpart just because he finds his colleague's eyes and conversation sympathetic. State interests are the determining factor in the relations between statesmen or stateswomen. And, what is exchanged cannot be defined as giving or taking. The matter is known as a "give and take" process. That matter becomes obvious when the translated version of Clinton's letter is read, regardless of the strange way it has been translated into Turkish. For example, the letter contained a promise for "technical aid" for the realization of Eximbank's credit of $5 billion for Turkey's imports... Yes, Clinton made that promise. However, he later said: "I hope that you will consider the possibility of easing the difficult conditions that prevent the Patriarchate from becoming a functional institution." The letter also contained a promise for U.S. support for Turkey's effort to secure $2.7 billion from the World Bank in the form of a credit. However, that was followed by a request for Turkey to "work" more closely with Rauf Denktas on the Cyprus problem and for "consideration of the political and human rights aspect of the Kurdish problem." Several of those requests may be related to matters on which Turkey already wishes to adopt a decision in accordance with its own will. However, let us consider the side that should be blamed for the inclusion of those matters in that letter... Furthermore, let us consider the self-exaltation for "having received such a letter..." Is there any aspect of that development that would make a serious state feel "relieved?"
