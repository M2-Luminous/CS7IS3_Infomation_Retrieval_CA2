Four villagers were seated on top of one of the vehicles among heavily armed gendarmerie soldiers. As we watched them go by we noticed their hands were tied behind their backs. But they could not see us, for their eyes were covered with rags. Blindfolded, they were clearly being taken for interrogation. Heading towards one of the seven makeshift refugee camps set up in northern Iraq to accommodate some 12,000 refugees, our group which was escorting a delegation from the Turkish Human rights Association was constantly accompanied by the sound of blasts coming down from the mountains. Explosions could be heard from miles away, signalling a new operation. Perhaps there will a new communique from the Governor's office on yet another victory against militants of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The explosions, however, are also being attributed to other things. At the Association branch office in Diyarbakir, a wall gazette is full of pictures. Pictures of burned down and destroyed houses. Pictures of civilians with bodies covered with bruises and burn marks. Asking the local activists on what they are, we get a blunt reply, "the houses are those which have been destroyed by security forces. The people are those who have been tortured." About 12,000 people living along the border have already fled into northern Iraq where they are scattered in seven separate camps. Everyone is scared. Among the scared are human rights activists. Association Chairman Akin Birdal suggests we move together and eat in the same place. "To avoid mystery killings," he explains. On the first day of the fact-finding mission, a decision is taken to keep the group together and "avoid complications." Numbering around 30 people and made up of human rights activists and journalists, our group headed for the border some 300 kilometers away. Stopped ten times at security check points along the road, we are constantly surrounded by the remains of petroleum tankers. Following the Gulf War, the road has been empty. There is hardly any traffic now and the sanctions on Iraq have hurt the local economy most. A police officer explains, "this situation has helped the PKK. Most of the unemployed youngsters are now heading for the mountains." Custom officials tell us that two to three thousand trucks were crossing the border before the sanctions. Now, even the customs crossing point is empty. "If things go on this way, the whole region will be empty," one customs official interjects. Immediately on the other side of the border we are greeted by a Kurdish border policeman. "Welcome to Kurdistan," he says, standing before a signpost saying the same thing. Close to the border post is the vast mountain of Cudi which ranges from Turkey into Iraq and has been used over the years as a crossing point by PKK militants. Mount Cudi is smoking. "Turkish planes hit it again this morning" one Peshmerge explains. In Zakho about 200 Turkish Kurds are on hunger strike. "They are bombing our villages," a middle age villager says. "We want to live like human beings," he adds. The delegation then moves on to a camp where about 2,000 refugees who have fled Turkey are housed. Despite previous statements by Turkey that the migration is only a PKK ploy, the first thing which attracts our attention is the crowded number of women and children. The situation in the Sheranishe and Beheri camps just on the slopes of the Zerkan mountains astonishes members of the delegation. Suddenly there are too many people. More than 10,000 villagers are now there and about half of them are children. Complaints are similar. Stories are almost identical. Some complain of being forced to join the village guards and losing their villages when they refused. Others say their settlements were bombed. The most common complaints are related to health and nutrition problems. There is a demand for more assistance from the United Nations. "We were forces to move here because of the security operations," explains an elderly man. "They bombed and destroyed our villages." Following the visit to three separate camps, a Turkish officer at the Habur border gate tells us there are 4,000 PKK terrorists on Mount Cudi. "We are conducting operations on the mountain every day," he says. "We have no day or night. It is very difficult." In the evening, we hear cannons pounding the mountain once again. Members of the delegation go silent as they listen. The roads at night are still dangerous. Nothing goes by but for military vehicles. Most officers insist we do not continue. "It is too dangerous," one of them says. It is in contrast to official statements made back in Ankara that Turkey has full control throughout the region. At one military post, where we are hosted while waiting for a fully equipped escort convoy, we chat with officers. They believe the problem in the Southeast can only be solved through peaceful methods. One officer says they have identified 2,500 PKK militants in Mardin by name. "But in the past two years, we could only get some of them. People forced to migrate are joining the organization." Another officer interjects, "peaceful methods are a must." Two of the four villagers on the Landrover are elderly and in no way do they resemble terrorists. Members of the delegation are in pain, knowing they cannot do anything. Two women on the bus wipe away their tears. If the villagers are crying as well, there is no way to know. Their eyes are blindfolded. They cannot even see that someone cares. These days, the scene everywhere in the southeast is similar. There is only military traffic on the roads at night. During the day, one can easily hear the blades of helicopters chopping through the air. Echoes of faraway explosions can be heard. And now, becoming a part of the natural scene, is the smoke. The mountains of the Southeast are smoking....
