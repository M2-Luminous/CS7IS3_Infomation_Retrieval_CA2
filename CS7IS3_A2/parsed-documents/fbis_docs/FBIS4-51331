The communists declare themselves to be the disciple of Lenin who once said that "statistics is a weapon to understand society." Since this is so, it should be regarded as a field of science which permits no "dishonesty, boastfulness, or exaggeration." Communist governments at different levels have all set up statistical departments--statistical bureaus--and they now also periodically make the statistical figures known to the public, but God knows whether these figures are reliable or not. For instance, the inflation rates published by the statistical departments of the communists are extremely unreliable. They said that last year's inflation rate on the mainland was ten-odd percent, but the actual feeling of common people is that it is far more than that. As they went to the market for necessities every day, they know best how much prices have soared. Boastfulness and Exaggeration in the Statistical Work It is unfair to say that the communist authorities know nothing about this unreliability of their statistics. In his report entitled "Statistics Is a Key Link in the Economic Construction," delivered to a national conference on statistical work held on February 23 this year, Zou Jiahua, vice premier of the State Council, acknowledged boastfulness and exaggeration in current statistical work, which could be rather serious in certain departments and localities. Some people talk big and indulge in empty talk, while others submit false information and publish imaginary figures; but they are pleased with themselves. It is a manifestation of corruption in the party's working style. Mr Zou said that the reasons for fraud and deception in the statistical work were as follows: 1) The relevant departments and their leaders in the Central Committee fail to have a solid grasp of and control over this work and neglect authenticity in statistical work and hence should be liable for this tendency. 2) There exist problems in the guiding ideology of local competent authorities with respect to their statistical work. 3) The influence of party working style and social tendencies. 4) A strict system and rational and effective rules and regulations for statistical work have been erroneously abandoned and violated. 5) Bureaucracy in certain administrative and supervisory authorities leads to failure in work, and 6) No importance has been attached to the solution of the problems that cropped up in the process of construction, opening up, and economic reform to bring back the working style of faithfulness and practicality. Also at this national conference of statistical work, Lu Peijian, commissioner of the Central Auditing Department, made known the following results of sampling and investigation concerning taxation and statistics conducted in the last quarter of last year and January this year by various provinces, localities and enterprises: -- Considerable discrepancies exist between the growth of the national economy and the actual fulfillment of various production targets as reported by governments of the eight provinces and autonomous regions and the 20 major prefectures and cities, with some discrepancies as high as 25 percent, -- As many as 12 provinces and autonomous regional and 20 major prefectures and cities failed to suspend or reduce the scale and progress of capital construction as they reported to the central government, -- Inconsistency exists between the actual quantity, scale, and capital availability of the joint ventures of 12 provinces or autonomous regions and 28 prefectures or cities and the figures contained in the statements submitted by such joint ventures, -- Inflation rate of the nine provinces or autonomous regions is five to eight percent higher than the real figures they submitted to the State Council, and -- Of the total production value of national economy in 1993 as submitted by the ten provincial and autonomous regional and the 25 prefectural or municipal governments, 3 to 12 percent are imaginary numbers. "What the Superiors Are Fond of, The Subordinates Will Be Addicted To" Although the authorities of the CPC have perceived the boastfulness and exaggeration with respect to statistics submitted by their subordinates, suffered from the "tendency of boastfulness and exaggeration" and are eager to correct this tendency, the trouble still exists that up till now there are still no effective countermeasures. It is a result of "being hard to change the original nature" of the "tendency of boastfulness and exaggeration." As the old saying goes in a Chinese history book, "What the superiors are fond of, the subordinates will be addicted to". Where the superiors are happy with success, the subordinates will of course report only their achievements rather than their setbacks, let alone the fact that the superiors often appraise the work of their subordinates on the basis of the so-called achievements reported by the latter.
