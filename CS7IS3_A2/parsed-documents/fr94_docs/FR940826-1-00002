ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This document recommends adopting a proposal to have the Class II milk price in all Federal orders be the basic formula price for the second preceding month plus a fixed differential of $0.30. The Class II price would, like the Class I price in all Federal orders, be announced on or before the fifth day of the month and apply to milk marketed during the following month. This recommended decision would also eliminate the ``add-back'' provision that requires that the difference between the Class II price and the Class III price be added to a subsequent month's Class II price when the Class II price for the month falls below the Class III price. DATES: Comments are due on or before September 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments (six copies) should be filed with the Hearing Clerk, Room 1083, South Building, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gino M. Tosi, Marketing Specialist, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090-6456, (202) 690-1366. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This administrative action is governed by the provisions of Sections 556 and 557 of Title 5 of the United States Code and, therefore, is excluded from the requirements of Executive Order 12866. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The amendments would promote more orderly marketing of milk by producers and regulated handlers. The amendments to the rules proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. They are not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.
