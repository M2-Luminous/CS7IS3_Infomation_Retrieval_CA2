Quintal] [Text] Cape Town April 24 SAPA -- State President F W de Klerk on Sunday [24 April] expressed shock and outrage at Sunday's car bomb explosion in Johannesburg, saying crimes of this nature would not stop the election. Nine people died and 92 others were injured when the car bomb ripped through several streets in downtown Johannesburg shortly before 10AM on Sunday. Reacting to the incident, Mr de Klerk said there was no possibility that radical minorities would be allowed to frustrate the will of the vast majority of the South African people. "All they will achieve will be to add to the unnecessary suffering of innocent citizens who have already suffered enough." Mr de Klerk said the SA Police would do everything in their power to bring the perpetrators to justice. Those responsible for the blast would be tracked down relentlessly and punished with the full rigour of the law. President de Klerk also condemned the attack on African National Congress members and Independent Electoral Commission monitors in Ulundi on Saturday in which at least three people were killed.
