Mesic believes it would be "perfectly logical" if "the republic of Kosovo" were to have its representative and an office in Zagreb. According to Mesic, the war between the Croats and the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina was "absurd" since both sides have "a common enemy -- the Serbs." Asked whether Croatia will be able to incorporate the territory of the republic of Serbian Krajina, Mesic said that first the Serbs in Krajina would have to be "politically defeated." "The most important thing is for the international community to isolate Milosevic completely and to close off all the bridges and roads via which Serbia supplies the Serb army in Bosnia-Herzegovina with weapons," Mesic said. Mesic also said that due to forceful pressure from Belgrade, Croatia had to ban the news program in Albanian on Croatian Radio.
