B. Bulgak] [Text]In Russia, the current level of telecommunications development corresponds overall to the state of the Russian economy. Quantitative indicators for the industry rise steadily, although the rate of their growth has somewhat slowed down recently. However, there is no cause for complacency. The industry does not permit market structures to function with certitude. Quality is not high, and the volume of the industry's main services is limited. The most modern types of these services are poorly developed. New requirements for communications services and the gradual formulation of a market economy made it necessary to develop a new state policy in the industry. Recently, the Russian government adopted ``A Concept for a Russian Federation Program in the Communications Field.'' This concept determines strategic approaches for the industry to move ahead in the forthcoming period, including stages and ways to move ahead. On the basis of this document, specific programs for individual types of telecommunications are being developed, including regional programs and programs for specific sub-branches of the industry. These programs provide for: - Prioritizing the development of the communications industry and establishing an incentive-based state policy in this area; - Optimally combining state investments in the industry with the combined resources of enterprises, as well as drawing on private domestic and foreign capital; - Using all forms of private property in the industry, and eliminating monopolies which provide communications services; - Creating the legal means for developing communications in the country, as well as legal guarantees drawing domestic and foreign enterprises into investments; - Converting the communications field, including the conversion of the radio frequency spectrum; - Establishing a new tariff policy for communications services; - Licensing by the state for the activities of individuals and organizations in the field of communications and certifying communications equipment and services; - Creating new types of communications services; - Integrating domestic communications networks with foreign ones; - Gradually eliminating disproportions in the development of communications region-by-region, by taking into account the state of their economies; - Restructuring the industry. In order to implement the ``Concept for a Russian Federation Program in the Communications Field,'' a regulated telecommunications market must be created. The regulating role of the state involves concentrating efforts on key trends for developing the industry, creating conditions for satisfying the needs for communications services, conducting a coordinated technical policy, coordinating communications networks, and creating a civilized community of communications operating companies in the country. The incentive-based state policy for developing communications calls for a preferential taxation and credit system. These preferential terms should be implemented when dividing land parcels for enterprises and communications facilities, when renting spaces, when local authorities allot subsidies, and when reducing taxes being charged to communication industries. The funds which are received should be used to invest in the communications industry. The investment policy should be designed to attract foreign capital from all over the world, and this policy should primarily be implemented on the basis of the individual and combined resources of enterprises, associations, banking and other organizations, and individuals. Appropriations from the state budget are intended for use to implement the largest state programs. Creating the legal basis so that the industry can function calls for the adoption of legislative acts of the Supreme Soviet, decrees of the President, and mandates of the government. These will ensure conditions for the development of communications in the country and provide legal guarantees for the functioning of the industry, including the protection of subscriber's rights, property protection, licensing and certification. All the interrelated communications networks of Russia are public networks, department networks, and private networks. They form the Interrelated Communications Network of Russia, and they are created and developed using the principles of organizational and technical unity and mutual redundancy. The Russian Communications Administration particularly focuses on regulating the technical and organizational aspects involved in interrelating the various communications networks. Enterprises in the industry are created on the basis of the similarities and differences in forms of property under competition. Networks and communications equipment may be state property (federal property, the property of subjects of the federation, or municipal property), or it may be the property of individuals or organizations, including foreign ones. In order to improve the management of the communications industry in the new economic conditions, the industry is being restructured. Three independent subgroups in the industry are being identified: telecommunications, television and radio, and postal. At telecommunications enterprises the stock auctioning process has already begun. The creation of non-state companies is also being supported, including those involving foreign capital. The new tariff policy in the communications field is characterized by its liberalization, and as the economic situation in the country stabilizes and market forces are adopted in the industry, it will also be characterized by a gradual reduction in interference on the part of the state in setting tariffs for communications services. Elements of state regulating are intended to retain social access to the main communications services while economic restructuring takes place in Russia. Destroying the monopoly on providing communications services calls for the provision of these services by several operating companies. A license issued by the Russian Communications Ministry gives the right to provide communications services, and this ministry controls the quality of the services. Some services call for a competition to issue the license, which also serves the interests of the consumer, and serves to create an effective telecommunications system in the country. In order to ensure high quality in the services being provided, and to preserve the compatibility of the communications networks and equipment, existing and future networks should be guarded against the appearance of equipment which does not meet the standards established for Russia in these networks. Therefore, each type of equipment to be installed must have a certificate issued by the Russian Communications Ministry on the basis of the results of testing conducted in specially created certification centers. New types of communications services which are being created by competition, primarily for fulfilling the needs of market economy organizations, include the following: - high quality digital communications networks; %data transmission networks with packet switching; %high quality facsimile systems based on digital networks and/or modern data transmission networks; %systems for receiving information from data banks; %message processing systems, which permit telecommunications text retrieval services to be united into one automated system for message traffic between subscribers; %mobile communications systems for document and speech traffic. Calculations show that solvent demand for similar communications services is fairly high. For example, the demand for digital telephone communications services is approximately 3.0- 3.5 million telephone sets, and for telecoded communications services (data transmission, message processing, and high quality facsimile communications) it exceeds several thousand connection points. At the same time, the potential exists for quickly fulfilling this demand by creating commercial organizations. An important aspect of the Russian state policy in the communications field is international cooperation, which should become one of the ways for this industry to get out of this difficult position under modern conditions. This cooperation is developing in the following areas: - Attracting foreign investments to carry out national and regional programs; %Creating joint enterprises to introduce advanced technology and new equipment into Russian communications networks; %Expanding existing international communications networks, and increasing the volume and quality of services provided to subscribers of the public networks in order to more fully integrate the national communications system with communications systems of the world community; %Carrying out major technical projects with foreign firms; %Purchasing imported equipment for the Russian communications network; %Initiating scientific and technical exchanges, and attracting foreign specialists to provide an expert's analysis of national programs and projects; %Participating in the work of the International Telecommunications Union; Adapting the communications industry to new economic conditions and new subscribers' demands will require a certain amount of time and can be carried out in stages. During stage one, the critical situations in the industry have to be stopped with extreme measures, since the crisis in the country's economy is continuing. This stage began in 1992 and also encompasses the current year of 1993. The main measures to be carried out during stage one are the following: - Liberalizing the tariff policy in the industry in order to increase enterprises' revenues, primarily by providing new and higher quality services to commercial market organizations. During this stage, elements of state tariff regulation will be maintained for the population and organizations funded by the state; %Improving the industry's management structure, which was already discussed, and privatizing enterprises; %Carrying out projects which will be implemented in relatively short time periods and will receive moderate capital investments will allow a fast return to be obtained. By the same token, this will make it possible to obtain the means for developing subsectors of the telecommunications industry with low profits. Such projects primarily include the creation of an international communications system in Russia, and the development of systems which will allow new, highly profitable services to be provided (for example, honeycomb radiotelephone service or data transmission with packet switching); %Introducing new mechanisms for payments between communications enterprises. This will ensure the proportional distribution of revenues received by the industry among the participants in the information transmission process. This will give all enterprises the chance to develop by using their own resources; %Increasing the performance of existing communications equipment and networks. The second stage calls for a set of measures for supporting the functioning of the industry at the level which has been achieved, for stabilizing the economic situation in the industry and for preparing it for accelerated development. In terms of time, this stage corresponds with the transitional period associated with overcoming the crises in the Russian economy (approximately 1994-1995). During this stage, the structural changes previously begun in the industry will be completed, issues of improving standards will completely be resolved, conditions will be created to broadly attract domestic and foreign investments into the industry, the integration of modern communications equipment and the development of new types of services will continue, market mechanisms will be improved, and eliminating the monopoly in the industry will continue. Stage three (probably in 1996-2010) calls for measures to accelerate development of the industry after the crisis is overcome, and the evolution in the country's economy progresses. This stage presupposes significant investment growth in communications, a qualitative jump in converting networks with modern technologies for the transmission and processing of information, and increased integration of the telecommunications networks of Russia into communications systems of the world community. It will be possible to increase the capacity of the public telephone network to 63-78 million basic telephone sets, and raise telephone density to 40-50 units per 100 inhabitants. New country- wide networks will arise. They will provide modern services which will be available to a broad range of subscribers, as well as high quality and expensive services for a more narrow group of subscribers. A general national data transmission network will appear, as well as a Russian intelligent network, and a digital network with integration of services. This will permit the creation of a telecommunications organization that will fill the demands of developing market relations. As far as prospects for foreign partners participating in developing communications in Russia is concerned, this is already being carried out in many areas. Our relationship is developing with communications operating companies, investment firms and international banks, with whom we are implementing major projects, both international and national in scope. An example of such successful cooperation is the construction of Russia's first international underwater fiber-optic line from Russia to Denmark in a system with digital radio relay links and three international switching stations. One of the first examples of cooperation with foreign operating companies inside the country in the field of public networks is the project to create a modern communications network in the Kaliningrad region. A branch of the France Telecom Company is taking part in the project. The joint enterprise organized by this firm and its Russian partners already has a license for the creation of a dedicated line, and a permit to build a network integrated with the general telephone network is now being processed. Foreign partners are participating heavily in the creation of modern data transmission networks in Russia. Many networks with packet switching which are successfully functioning and dynamically developing have a foreign operating company partner, for example, the SPRINT network, INFOTEL, POCHET, and others. Another important trend in developing cooperation is for domestic factories, primarily those which have been converted, to organize joint enterprises with foreign firms which manufacture communications equipment. Among them are firms such as IZHTEL, which are expanding into the production of modern switching equipment, which is extremely necessary now in Russia. Moreover, since there are limited currency resources, we prefer this form of cooperation to direct acquisition of communications equipment overseas. An important mechanism for the state to regulate the industry market is licensing. Licenses for the right to provide many of the most economically attractive services are being competed. In this way, there is a selection of the most fully developed proposals which are the most effective and convenient for subscribers, and which provide effective use of limited resources, like the radio- frequency spectrum, the resources of satellite communications systems and telephone numbering. Consequently, licenses are issued on a competitive basis for communications networks which have independent access overseas, and for honeycomb communications networks with NMT-450N and GSM-900 federal standards. The first such competition for the GSM-standard networks has already taken place for 12 areas, regions and republics in the Russian Federation. US West, our partner of long standing, has won this competition with its Russian partners in 8 regions. In order to issue a license to organize regional honeycomb systems for which the 800 MHz range has been identified, support of the regional administrations is necessary. The state is interested in developing networks which provide local and long-distance in-country telephone service. However, these networks require larger capital investments than small networks having international access, and they are less profitable. Therefore, in order to provide incentives to operating companies working within the country, more favorable conditions for connecting with the public networks have been established for them. If private international communications networks must interact with the country-wide network at the international switching center level, then local and long-distance operating companies can be connected to local and long-distance public networks. Russia is a colossal market in the communications area both for operating companies and for equipment manufacturers, and Russia is trying to enter the global telecommunications society as a worthy member, having not only the most extensive communications network, but striving to build this network on a modern technical level. We invite all our partners from the countries taking the place of the former Soviet Union and from neighboring countries to cooperate with us as equal partners in a mutually profitable manner.
