The enemy's prime minister, Yitzhaq Rabin, today toured the occupied border region. He met in Marj 'Uyun barracks with Antoine Lahd, commander of the agent militia, and a number of his military commanders. Radio Voice of the South, the mouthpiece of Lahd's South Lebanese Army, carried a statement by Rabin in which he insinuated that peace with Lebanon will come after the resistance is eliminated, particularly Hizballah; after the Lebanese Government proves its ability to maintain security north of the border area for six months; and after the soldiers and officers of Lahd's militia are absorbed in the Lebanese Army, as Rabin put it.
