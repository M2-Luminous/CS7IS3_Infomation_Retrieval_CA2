In an emergency government meeting called to discuss the latest developments in Bosnia, Yugoslav leaders said the United Nations, instead of disarming the Muslim forces in Gorazde, tolerated the two-week spring offensive against Serb-held positions launched by the Muslims in a systematic way. When the Muslims were defeated in their spring offensive, the U.N. gave the go-ahead to launch air strikes on Serb positions under the pretext of the Muslim enclave of Gorazde being one of the U.N.- designated "safe areas," they said. By authorizing NATO to launch air raids against Bosnian Serbs, the U.N. has been directly involved in the Bosnian war, the Yugoslav leader said, urging the world body to immediately renounce its "dangerous" policy of siding with the Muslims in the conflict. NATO jets today launched a second air strike on Serb positions around Gorazde in less than 24 hours. According to U.N. military sources, Serb artillery, tank and machine gun fire into Gorazde town abated soon after NATO warplanes destroyed at least one Serb tank. On Sunday [10 April], NATO war planes dropped three bombs on a Bosnian Serb command post controlling artillery attacks on Gorazde. The raid was the first time NATO has used air power on Serb forces attacking a U.N. "safe area" in Bosnia. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic said that by giving the go- ahead to NATO air strikes, the reputation of the world body as a mediator in the Bosnian peace process had been seriously impaired. The NATO air raids also drew an angry response from Bosnian Serbs. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic called off a meeting planned for today with U.S. peace envoy Charles Redman, and one of his senior adviser threatened to take actions against U.N. peacekeeping troops and put the Serbs at war with the U.N. if NATO continued to launch air raids. Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the Bosnian Serbs' parliament, said the air strikes showed that neither the U.S. nor the U.N. wanted peace in Bosnia. The threat of air strikes forced the Serbs to withdraw their heavy artillery from besieged Sarajevo by February 20. Eight days later, NATO jets shot down four Serb war planes violating the U.N. declared no-fly zone over Bosnia.
