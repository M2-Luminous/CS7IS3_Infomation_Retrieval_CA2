"Limiting participation in the fall local government elections to political organizations violates the spirit of self-government as understood in Europe and is unfavorable for the Poles in Lithuania, particularly for the Union of Poles in Lithuania [ZPL], but it is not deprivation of electoral rights," Widacki stated. He stressed that the Lithuanian Seimas had not yet passed the local government election regulations. On 9 May, during partial voting, an article permitting only political organizations to put forward candidates in the elections was adopted, which means the exclusion of social and sociopolitical organizations, which include the ZPL, from participation. Widacki stressed that, even if the electoral regulations were passed in their present form, it would not exclude ZPL members from participating in the elections, but they would be forced quickly to set up a political organization (election committee) [PAP parentheses] based on the ZPL.
