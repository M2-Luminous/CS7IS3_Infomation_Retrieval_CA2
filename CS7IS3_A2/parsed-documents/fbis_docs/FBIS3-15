Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-O8Mar94-Russia Shakhray Emerges From Political Eclipse SUMMARY After publicly protesting his exclusion from important deliberations on nationality affairs and threatening to resign his post as Minister of Nationality Affairs and Regional Policy, Sergey Shakhray appears to have halted and even reversed his political decline following the December elections. After losing deputy premier status in the recent cabinet reorganization, Shakhray appears to have rebounded by means of a presidential decree giving him special status as a member of the Government Presidium. Although the decree appears to mark at least Shakhray's partial return to President Boris Yeltsin's good graces, he continues to split with the president on major issues such as the recent amnesty for Yeltsin's opponents, suggesting the apparent reconciliation may be short-lived. END SUMMARY A presidential decree dated 12 February elevated newly reappointed (See Note 1) Minister of Nationality Affairs and Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray above the status of rank-and-file Russian government ministers, announcing that he would be included in the Government Presidium (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 15 February). According to the Council of Ministers press service, Shakhray will be the only "regular" minister attending the weekly meetings of the Presidium--which also includes Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and his four deputies--as a "full member" (Kommersant-Daily, 15 February) (See Note 2). Shakhray had made inclusion in the Presidium a condition of his acceptance of the ministerial port folio on 20 January. After being offered the portfolio, Shakhray reportedly said that he would accept only if the Nationality Affairs and Regional Policy Ministry were made directly subordinate to the premier and he as minister were included in the Presidium (Interfax, 19 January). (Note 1) Shakhray was previously chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for Nationality Affairs and Regional Policy, which was changed into a ministry in the post-election cabinet reshuffle. See the Trends of 26 January 1994, pages 16- 22, for a summary of changes to the cabinet. (Note 2) On 15 February ITAR-TASS reported that Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin--also a leader of Shakhray's Party of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES)--is a member of the Presidium. Shakhray had held the nationalities portfolio and the rank of deputy premier until Chernomyrdin reorganized the cabinet, reducing the number of deputy premiers and redistributing their responsibilities. The reshuffle decreased the number of deputy premiers from six to four, and the remaining deputy premiers were given more responsibilities (Mayak Radio, 31 January; ITAR-TASS, 15 February). Following the reorganization, Chernomyrdin signed a decision tasking First Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets with the coordination of the activities of 15 ministries, state committees, and departments (ITAR-TASS, 15 February). Chernomyrdin's reshuffle also assigned each of the deputy premiers oversight over specific areas of social and economic policy but did not explicitly assign the nationalities portfolio to any of them, suggesting that Shakhray will have considerable latitude in this area. End of Eclipse Recent media commentary on Shakhray's situation interpreted the decree as a victory for him, ending a period in which his influence on nationality affairs was visibly declining. Following his demotion from deputy premier to minister in the cabinet reshuffle (ITAR-TASS, 20 January), an article in the 25 January issue of Moskovskiy Komsomolets reported that nationality affairs were being handled by other officials, leaving Shakhray out of the loop on important developments: --Deputy Premiers Yuriy Yarov and Aleksandr Zaveryukha had been given joint jurisdiction over nationality affairs, and Shakhray was now complaining that he was being used as a "front" instead of being "the man in charge" of regional policy. --Chernomyrdin had met with Chechen Republic Deputy Premier Mairbek Mugadayev in disregard of "Shakhray's directive" not to treat representatives of the Chechen Government as leaders of an independent republic. --Shakhray had complained tHhat government officials invited him "to study" Tatarstan's draft "Treaty on the Mutual Delegation of Authority and Terms of Reference" only after he expressed in an Interfax interview his bewilderment at not being included in the treaty negotiations. Other media reports also noted that Shakhray appeared to be losing influence. According to Interfax (21 January), "well- informed" sources within the government had said that Shakhray had been "virtually debarred" from handling regional issues. Kommersant-Daily reported that before he was elevated to the Presidium, Shakhray had been complaining to journalists that urgent problems such as Tatarstan and Chechnya were being handled without his involvement. Shakhray was also apparently excluded from a 20 January telephone conference with the heads of administration of "a number of regions" discussing preparations for upcoming local elections. According to Rossiyskaya Gazeta (21 January), Presidential Administration Leader Sergey Filatov led the conference and Yarov participated. Background to Eclipse Shakhray appeared to overcome what the Moskovskiy Komsomolets article called his "rather dubious status" by threatening to refuse to accept reappointment to the nationalities portfolio. Interfax (21 January) quoted Shakhray as saying that if "vital issues of regional and nationality policies" continue to be dealt with "without participation of the government member responsible for these issues . . . , I will not be able to work in the cabinet." Shakhray's eclipse from nationality issues and his loss of the deputy premier post were probably retaliation by Yeltsin for Shakhray's limited support of the president and his reform team at crucial moments before and during the December election campaign. Yeltsin disdained Shakhray's establishment of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES) for splitting his reform team and contributing to the reformers' December national election defeat by splitting the vote. (Although Yeltsin avoided direct association with any party during the national election, he had been perceived as favoring Russia's Choice "in spirit" (Mayak Radio, 16 October 1993)--inasmuch as many of his close associates formed the party and actively promoted his reforms.) During the October 1993 crisis, Shakhray pushed for compromise and simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections rather than fully supporting Yeltsin's decisions. Shakhray had also undermined Yeltsin's authority at a preparatory regional conference by openly disagreeing with Yeltsin's decision to urge the voluntary dissolution of local soviets (Interfax, 6 October 1993). Outlook Shakhray's special status as a member of the Presidium puts him on a par, in effect, with the deputy premiers and probably allows him, as he had demanded, to report directly to Chernomyrdin on nationality affairs. The arrangement may also facilitate the division of labor among the deputy premiers, allowing the cabinet to make fuller use of Shakhray's experience in nationality affairs and freeing the others to concentrate on priority economic issues. With Shakhray apparently positioning himself as a future presidential candidate and staking out positions opposed to Yeltsin on key political issues--most recently on the issue of amnesty for Yeltsin opponents arrested in 0ctober (Interfax, 28 February)--Shakhray's apparent return to influence in the cabinet may not last long.
