The PRI also believes that despite the "efforts" taken in past years, the fact that 7 million Mexicans are unemployed is "alarming." That statement was made during a brief debate held by the PRI faction with PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] legislators who have criticized the current administration's economic policy, the "forceful" conditions under which Mexico joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the $6-billion line of credit the United States opened for Mexico following Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination. PRD Deputy Alejandro Encinas opened the debate by saying the announcement of Mexico joining the OECD "seeks to convey an air of optimism despite the overwhelming evidence that shows our nation's economic and social decline." Encinas said this air of optimism also seeks to "stop the drain of capital, both local and foreign, as a result of the news" of Colosio's slaying. Encinas criticized President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's announcement that Mexico had been accepted into the OECD as a full-fledged member when the country will not be admitted until 14 April, the date the OECD will issue its formal reply to the Mexican Government's petition. Encinas said Mexico will have to make adjustments and changes in at least 38 economic fields including capital assets, services, the environment, foreign investment, agriculture, trade, and consumer protection policies, among others. He said, "Mexico is responsible, by joining the OECD, for consolidating a more thriving economy, which will lead to higher standards of living for Mexicans by incorporating the public into the job market, and, overall, for improving the economy." He also said in order to join the OECD, a country must have a solvent market economy and a democratic government that respects human rights. The PRD argues Mexico does not meet these conditions, and to illustrate the weakness of the current economic model, Encinas mentioned two incidents that followed Colosio's assassination. First, he mentioned "to prevent the financial crack triggered by Colosio's slaying on 23 March, banks, exchange offices, and the stock market had to be closed to gain time and ask for foreign assistance." Application of the "life-saving" mechanism, which consisted of the United States' establishing for Mexico a $6-billion line of credit, followed shortly after. Thus, Encinas added, "the Clinton administration's financial rescue of the Salinas government and the announcement of Mexico's membership in the OECD correspond to Washington's basic interests of national security rather than to the efficient results of the economic policy, although, for the current government, they constitute a fundamental step in regaining foreign investors' trust." "The risks of a financial crack or a devaluation of the Mexican peso would spread their harmful effects through the interdependence between the Mexican and U.S. economies, given the commitments assumed by U.S. intermediaries in international markets with the issuance of Mexican currency. It is worth noting that U.S. pension and investment funds have invested considerable resources in these financial instruments and would incur losses in case of an additional upheaval in Mexico." Finally, he said "the economic slowdown negatively affects jobs, salaries, small- and medium-sized industries; the foreign debt has increased, and speculative activities in financial markets are becoming more volatile, threatening to reduce international monetary reserves and maintain artificially high interest rates, given the false value of the Mexican peso." PRI member Javier Garduno Perez took the podium to respond to Encinas' statements. Garduno said Encinas' arguments resembled "a soap opera script in which the most horrible scenarios are forecast for the Mexican economy" rather than a first-rate debate. Garduno claimed that because he did not believe Encinas' arguments were serious enough, he was not going to refer to them. Garduno said "I only want to say the PRI has never come to this forum to tell rose-tinted stories and has never come here with demagogy to manipulate distorted figures or use different scenarios and dates for comparison." "We have always explained the economic situation is still unresolved, and that there are very serious problems, very serious. We have made substantial efforts in the past five years and have not established that an economic policy to achieve monetary stability is the main goal of the economic policy." "We have said it is a means to achieve sustainable growth and to generate jobs, which are what we need at this time. Unemployment is the fundamental problem of this country and its economy. Job creation is one of the main issues the economic policy must carefully examine, because nearly 8 million Mexicans are jobless. This is alarming and concerns the PRI very much." This is why he said that according to his party, efforts regarding economic policy must be heightened, especially in job creation, so that public funds can tackle social problems more efficiently and thus "deal a serious blow to the extreme poverty affecting millions of Mexicans." To Reorganize Politics: Munoz Ledo During yesterday's session, PRD national leader Porfirio Munoz Ledo demanded the cycle "of impunity, violence, and suppression that has unfortunately pervaded national politics in the past years" be closed as soon as possible. Munoz also urged that dialogue as a means to advance toward a truly democratic state be strengthened. In this sense, he called for the resumption of multiparty dialogue in order to resolve unsettled aspects of electoral reform, including the electoral register, the media, absentee votes, the immediate implementation of reforms in the Federal District, independent nominations, and a more flexible alliance system. Munoz said all these reforms will help clear up any doubts about the PRI's trying to impose its candidate in the coming presidential elections. PRI member Carlos Jimenez Macias has told Munoz his party respects and approves the commitments to improve the democratic system that were signed on 27 January. In this regard, Jimenez Macias said Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the new PRI presidential candidate, upholds the political will to increase and deepen the political dialogue so that all Mexicans will be sure the 21 August elections will be a process based on total respect of the will of every citizen."
