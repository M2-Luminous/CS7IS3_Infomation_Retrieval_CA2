This was revealed by a MITI source on 3 May. Trade between Japan and Poland has been slow since underwriting of trade insurance was suspended three years ago. By reviving the trade insurance, the minister wants to show that Japan's willingness to assist East Europe in their efforts to develop market economies has not changed. MITI has decided to resume underwriting insurance in the belief that Poland has come out of its economic worst and the risk of doing trade with the country has decreased. The ministry does not intend to set ceilings on the amounts of insurance to be underwritten.
