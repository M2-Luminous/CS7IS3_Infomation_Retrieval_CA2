It is almost 100 pages long and is a recipe for the creation of what the Forza Italia leader calls the new Italian economic miracle. Renato Andreolassi reports from Milan. [Andreolassi] A whole day of meetings with Forza Italia candidates who all had their electoral kits with them, in order to discuss the outline of the political program. This was followed by a news conference. Silvio Berlusconi responded to journalists in calm and firm tones. Above all he replied to the bullets fired by Bossi on the themes of enemies and false friends. Berlusconi said that he would not accept provocation and that he would not fall into the trap of replying to questions in argumentative tones and therefore sparking off further debate. He said that Forza Italia is fighting for a new strategy, a new political plan which aims to give this country a majority, liberal democrat government. He added that the movement is presenting itself in the election along with other forces in order to defeat the Left, which is responsible for out-of-control public spending. Let's see what the main points of Forza Italia's political program are. [Reporter Anna La Rosa] Reduction in the number of taxes from 200 to not more than 10, and no taxes at all for the poorest members of society; removing the management of taxes from central government and handing it over to local authorities. Public spending must be reduced, its growth is the root of all evil. Forza Italia would encourage new businesses and would levy no taxes on newly-created work places. There would be the progressive privatization for all state-owned companies, and above all direct presidential elections. There would be fewer laws, but more judges and a reduction in the use of preventive detention. There would be a report on the armed forces and increase in their resources. Forza Italia would impose fewer taxes on one-income families and a crackdown on the distribution of drugs. There would be a gradual transition from the public pension system to a private one, however, guaranteeing help for those who are less well-off.
