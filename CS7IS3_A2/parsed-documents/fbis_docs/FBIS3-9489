Janez Jansa rebukes Prime Minister Drnovsek as the government commission that was investigating the Smolnikar case did not study all the necessary material. He also asks Janez Drnovsek how the government has acted in other cases in which there has been an overstepping of authority. According to him, the prime minister proposed the replacement before the meeting of the parliamentary inquiry commission and in the midst of a media lynching. Jansa believes that Drnovsek, in this way, prevented the investigation into the background of unlawful activities in which individuals and groups have engaged for months. The Presidency of the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia will discuss this issue tomorrow.
