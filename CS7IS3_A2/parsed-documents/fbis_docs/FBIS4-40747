Will The Military District Prosecutor Also Be Kicked Out?"] [Text] A tough, under-the-rug struggle seems to be proceeding in the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office, where Aleksey Ilyushenko is still the acting prosecutor. Yet one can only judge of this indirectly. Thus, recently three deputy general prosecutors at once lost their posts, whereupon Ilyushenko got around to department chiefs. In the very near future the entire leadership of the Moscow Military District Prosecutor's Office could also be replaced. District prosecutor Mikhail Kislitsyn, who lately closed the Terekhov case over the 3-4 October events following an amnesty, has obviously annoyed Ilyushenko. Even so, the acting prosecutor has not as yet countermanded Kislitsyn's decision (which he has every right to do) and it is not ruled out that he will soon invoke his other powers: to appoint and dismiss personnel. Rumor has it that an order to remove Kislitsyn is pending. Kislitsyn was appointed to his post only a few months ago. It is known that recently he was offered the position of deputy chief military prosecutor, which he refused for unknown reasons. At that time, the vacancy unexpectedly went to Stanislav Gaveto, who has been serving in Moscow all these years. It is not clear what has brought about his rise. This is a question for Valentin Panichev, who heads the Military Prosecutor's Office. Up till now Gaveto has held secondary positions. It is not ruled out, however, that the appointment has been made on Ilyushenko's initiative and is aimed at getting rid of Panichev himself, one of the few deputies who have survived the purge in the General Prosecutor's Office.
