According to the Belorusian leader, although affected by the Chernobyl catastrophe and floods more than others through no fault of its own, the republic did not attach prime importance to humanitarian aid in the past, either. In the opinion of the head of Belorusian parliament, the state's foreign economic policy should aim not at "patching up holes but at a search for ways of proper economic cooperation with foreign partners and, first of all, with the United States", something to be discussed during Bill Clinton's visit. Shushkevich noted that the Belorusian side had drawn up concrete proposals to be discussed with the American side. It is not ruled out that conversation will touch upon the United States' assistance in implementing measures linked to the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Belarus. As regards the Belorusian side's other proposals, he believed that it was too early to announce them prior to the meeting with Bill Clinton. Answering a question about why the program for the U.S. delegation's stay in the Republic of Belarus included separate meetings with the head of parliament and the head of executive authority, Shushkevich noted that this was in no way connected with different positions upheld by legislative and executive authorities. "Since the U.S. President is the head of supreme executive authority and has great powers in legislative activity, both sides have agreed to hold two separate meetings, with the chairman of the Supreme Soviet and the chairman of the Council of Ministers," Shushkevich said.
