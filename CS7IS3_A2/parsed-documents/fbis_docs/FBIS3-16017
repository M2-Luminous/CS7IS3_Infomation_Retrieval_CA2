A preliminary agreement on this was reached today during talks between Rasul Guliyev and Babken Ararktsyan, head of the parliaments of Azerbaijan and Armenia that took place in the Kazakhskiy Rayon of Azerbaijan on the frontier of the two republics. It went on for about an hour and a half behind closed doors in a specially isolated carriage set up on the border of the two Caucasian republics. Reporting this at the news conference that took place at the end of the talks, Rasul Guliyev noted that under the accord, the Armed Forces of the warring sides will be simultaneously disengaged from each other by 10 km [as received]. A buffer zone will be created between them. The Armenian side is to withdraw its troops 10 km inside the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, and the Azerbaijani Armed Forces will accordingly occupy the liberated areas to guarantee the safe return of the refugees. The Azerbaijani parliament speaker said that the buffer zone will be handed over to the control of international observers. As for the liberation of the Azerbaijani town of Shusha that is also occupied by Armenian troops, according to the chairman of the republic's Supreme Soviet, this will be discussed during the month at a meeting between experts of the two countries. In line with the planned schedule, this town situated right on the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh is to be liberated in two month's time. Referring to what his Armenian colleague said, Rasul Guliyev stressed that "Armenia has never recognized and will never recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as an independent republic." According to the statement by the Azerbaijani parliament head, the details of the accord that was reached will be examined specifically in two or three days time in Moscow at a meeting of representatives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Defense of Azerbaijan and Armenia. He noted that Russia and other intermediaries, including the CSCE, will play their role in the peace-keeping process as before. Speaking to journalists after the talks ended, Rasul Guliyev and Babken Ararktsyan noted the similarity of their opinions during the discussion of many questions. For instance, both sides agreed that the process of ceasing fire and stopping combat actions was irreversible. They also noted that despite all the complexity of the problem, it can be resolved by peaceful means. The head of the parliament of Armenia stressed in particular, that although representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh were not present at these talks, the Azerbaijani side for the first time did not object to their participation in the meeting. According to him, that bears witness to the fact that the sides are gradually finding points of contact. It was also reported that a meeting between experts of the two countries who are to draw up concrete proposals to achieve peace in the region will take place soon.
