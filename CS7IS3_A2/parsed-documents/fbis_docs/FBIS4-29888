The test was conducted at the ministry's Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science rocket test site at Noshiro in Akita Prefecture on the west coast of northern Japan. The M-14 motor has a diameter of 2.5 meters, a length of 13.7 meters, and weighs 92 tons. It can develop a thrust of up to 382 tons. The test team said the fuel used in the test matched their expectations and the equipment regulating the thrust operated normally. The fuel was ignited at 11:30 A.M. under a cloudy sky with a strong easterly wind. About 71 tons of fuel was consumed over 80 seconds. Journalists covering the event about a kilometer away could hear the rumbling of the horizontally positioned motor as it spewed orange flame and white smoke out over the Sea of Japan. Development of the M-5 began in the 1990s, but was delayed because it was accorded lower development priority than the smaller 1.8-meter-diameter solid-fuel rocket booster used in the National Space Development Agency's large-scale liquid-fuel rocket, the H-2. This autumn, in-flight combustion tests of the second-stage motor, M-24, will be conducted, and in 1995, fuel will be tested in a second experimental version of the M-14 using the same high- tensile steel as in the actual rocket. The first rocket is scheduled to carry a scientific satellite known as Muses-B from the Kagoshima Space Center in 1996.
