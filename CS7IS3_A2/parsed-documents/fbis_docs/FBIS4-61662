According to Arik, Turkey intends to open a Moldovan-Turkish Center of Culture in Chisinau. The Turkish Government provided $50,000 for the construction of a brick factory. This sum represents only half of a loan granted by the Turkish Government. Goods produced in the East pass through Moldovan territory to the European market. Therefore, Turkey is willing to finance the building of a highway stretching 100 km to unite Moldova's borders. It will be connected to the future Giurgiulesti Port. "Turkey tries to assist properly and find finances for the construction of the port," said Arik. According to him, Moldova needs to improve its economy and especially its agricultural sector. From 23-28 May, a conference for the businessmen of Turkey and other countries will be held in Chisinau. It will analyze the possibilities of investment in the Moldovan economy and the legislation on foreign investments. According to Arik, the "Tica" agency will prepare several projects for developing the Moldovan economy to be forwarded to the World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. "Suleyman Demirel's visit to Moldova to take place on 1 June proves that Moldova constitutes a priority in Turkey's foreign relations," emphasized Arik.
