No headway was made in last week's round of talks because of the "non-constructive approach of the Estonian side," the ambassador said. "The Estonian side has gone back on its earlier statements which Russia regarded as a basis for the withdrawal of the troops before August 31," the ambassador said, referring to the statement made by the Estonian delegation head during the 14th round of talks, who went on record as saying that the agreed provisions concerning military pensioners remained in force despite the fact that they were at variance with some clauses of the law on citizenship of Estonia". In the present situation there is no need to mislead the public opinion and continue "negotiations for the sake of negotiations". For this reason the Russian delegation has come up with a new proposal. Each of the for main working groups -- on humanitarian and legal, military, economic, and border issues -- must prepare new versions and formulas in May to pull the negotiations out of the impasse. Only when it becomes clear that serious shifts are in the offing, the date can be set for the next round of talks, the ambassador said. Russia has no "excessive claims" concerning social insurance for military pensioners and their families residing in Estonia. Moscow's position on this is analogous to that it upheld in negotiations with Latvia. A mutually acceptable solution was found in those talks and Russia and Latvia signed a package of agreements, the ambassador recalled. The successful outcome was made possible thanks to the political will of the two countries and their readiness for sensible compromise solutions, he said.
