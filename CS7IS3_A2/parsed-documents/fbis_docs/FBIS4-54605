Addressing the plenary meeting of the Sejm held amid a strike wave that has swept the country Kolodko said that under the present circumstances it is possible to reach consensus. "I will not appeal for 90 peaceful days, I have no doubt that we need much more of peace than 90 days," Kolodko said. In his opinion, the foundations of an economic policy of the state must be constructed in the conditions of a will to reach agreement rather than solutions attained by force. "I do not see such conflicts of economic interests that, with a good will of all, could prevent us from solving problems," he said. Kolodko did not agree with the opinion that the coalition government has no economic programme. Instead, he confirmed the opinion that this programme must be critically assessed in a constructive and creative way. the government's strategy for poland, co-authored by Kolodko half a year ago, is designed to simulate development and growth. He expressed the hope that the government, in agreement with trade unions, will settle the wage control problem shortly. In a statement for journalists Kolodko announced he will present to public opinion a medium-range programme of economic development for Poland, and submit it for discussion with trade unions and for approval of the government. A medium-range financial strategy that will combine instruments of monetary and fiscal policies will be an integral part of the programme. Kolodko named such priorities in the economic policy as stabilisation, economic growth and a just, or at least socially acceptable distribution of national income that would not give rise to conflicts. Kolodko said he will meet with National Bank of Poland (NBP) President Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz on Saturday. "I believe that our cooperation will go on perfectly well," he predicted. At the same time he said he will undertake steps to protect the zloty. Denomination of the zloty will have to be carried out along with the further fighting of inflation. The banks actions to this aim must be coordinated with those of the government. "We have good economic prospects," Kolodko declared saying that everything indicates that real wages will increase sooner than planned. "I would treat it as my defeat and a failure of my mission if we fail to maintain Poland's good position as a leading country in central and Eastern Europe," he said. The most important thing is to change the situation in Poland for the better, the new deputy minister and finance minister declared.
