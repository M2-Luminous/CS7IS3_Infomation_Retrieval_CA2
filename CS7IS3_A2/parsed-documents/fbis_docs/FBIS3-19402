Unnoticed by many, the order of Versailles has also perished. Almost simultaneously with the reunification of Germany and the independence of the Central and East European nations, those two "supranational" states, which one can call products of the 1919 world of Versailles, fell apart: First multinational Yugoslavia, and a short time later multinational Czechoslovakia. With the reduction of Soviet (Russian) military might and ultimately the splintering of the Soviet empire, a concept, disapproved of and even tabooed for a long time, gained prominence in the political debate: "Central Europe." In 1915, in the midst of World War I, the great Liberal, Friedrich Naumann, had presented "Central Europe," so to speak, as the war goal of the Kaiser empire--whereby he called the idea of the nation and the national state a democratic and liberal achievement. He recommended that the Germans, becoming a nation themselves, also advance the Slavic peoples and become the advocate for the medium-sized and smaller nations of that region which extends from the Russian western border to the German eastern border. Certainly, the preconditions have changed under which Naumann had developed his conception of Central Europe. But today's generation, after a long and bitter hiatus, has again become aware of the idea that the states and peoples of Central Europe have common interests, a common history, and common future opportunities. This "center" of Europe extends east from Germany and Austria to Ukraine; north to the Baltic Sea region; southeast as far as Hungary, Slovenia, and Croatia. In a certain sense, Bulgaria also professes itself a part of this European center, although it is a Balkan state. Romania, at least in its Transylvanian region which until 1918 had been a part of the Danube monarchy [Austria], tends in the same direction, although the French influence is strong there. [passage omitted] The San Andreas fault in California is often called a rupture line where there is increased danger of earthquakes. In the east of Central Europe, there exists a historical-political San Andreas fault line: a zone where different mentalities, religions, and views of the state clash. In many cases, this is not so much due to ethnic differences. The divergent outlook on life has a much deeper effect. It leads to the situation where Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats, or Muslim Bosnians, are alien to each other, although they have been living together in the same village for decades and speak almost the same language. [passage omitted] Until now, none of these nations had even been asked whether they wanted to be a part of the Warsaw Pact or the communist camp. It is a bitter irony of fate that, in certain regards, they have no say today, either. The wish of the postcommunist countries to be admitted into NATO with equal rights remained unfulfilled. Instead, they were fobbed off with a cheap substitute solution (which does not obligate the West to anything), the Partnership for Peace. When Western politicans assert that it will take a certain time until these states are "ripe" enough to be truly admitted to Western communities, the question arises: Does that time even exist? Does Central Europe not run the danger of once again being run over by developments? The world historic stroke of luck for the Central European nations consisted of the fact that, after the fall of the Wall, the Soviet Union as an imperial power also disappeared from the scene. For the first time in history, the center of the continent was able to start organizing freely--without direct power-political intervention by external powers. Even in 1990/91 it was foreseeable that Russia, as an insulted, humbled superpower robbed of its trophies, in the long term would not be put off with the role of onlooker and recipient of alms. The West, however, plagued by irrational fearful visions of a "disintegration" of the USSR (a disintegration that could not be averted, anyway), had only one prescription at hand: support for the Moscow central power against the "centrifugal" tendencies. Even today, the idea still lurks in Western minds that the newly created "ministates" from the Baltic to Slovakia are not really viable, and hence "anachronistic." In reality, the creation, recreation or independence of these states is of great importance, especially for the western part of Europe. If the Russian area between St. Petersburg and Vladivostok takes decades to consolidate, then the area west of the Russian state border acquires a special, specific weight for the continent's security. Up to now one could form the impression that Western policy was putting the cart before the horse: The FRG has expended enormous amounts in aid to Russia which have disappeared in a "black hole" without significantly consolidating the situation or, for example, preventing the election success of the Zhirinovsky party. Ukraine, on the other hand, came off almost empty-handed. Would it not have made more sense to first consolidate the Central European area economically, and from there to approach the "Russian question?" Instead, one concentrated on Russia and in fact neglected the medium-sized and smaller states. Regarding Germany, the question remains whether the problem of "Central Europe" has even penetrated the consciousness of the political class in Bonn. This lack is all the more astounding since reunification resulted in a shift of the geographic (and spiritual) coordinates. Although the Federal Republic of Germany still carries the name it received during partition--it is no longer identical with the state once ruled by Adenauer. The focus is shifting from the Rhine to the Spree River, from a West European setting to the center. Thereby united Germany is again transformed into a "Central European" power. In the longer term this means: The political perspective is also changing. From Berlin the world looks different from the vantage point of Bonn in the Rhine valley. The neighbors in the East have suddenly moved closer, those in the West (although this should not be seen as dramatic) are a little farther away than before. The Germans have remained a people of the European center--and if there is a "task" for them at all, it lies in this center. After World War I, and especially after World War II, this central location was overlaid by other constellations--after 1945, by the partition of Germany. The fact that removal of the partition at the same time also brought freedom for the nations which until then had been "forgotten" behind the Iron Curtain, only underlines the fact that Central Europe has a common fate. Germans today are affected by events in the entire postcommunist area more closely and, in part, more painfully than any other (West) European peoples. The days when other powers or authorities relieved us Germans of great decisions (and risks) are over. But decisions approach us in inexorably concrete form, such as the question whether Bonn sees the priority of its foreign policy in the East with Russia, or with the medium-sized and smaller states. The answer to that decides everything. Preferential German-Russian relations can only be at the expense of the interest of the smaller states. Vice versa, if Germany becomes the champion of the Central European states and their independence and security, then political conflicts and opposing interests with the "great power, Russia" surely are inevitable. Should Germany not take up its Central European task and opportunity, the consequences could be very negative--for the Central European states as well as the Germans themselves. A new power-political thrust by Moscow, be it against Ukraine or the Baltic states, would place Germany in a difficult situation and would deteriorate the political climate radically. One can only hope that this time what so often had not been achieved will succeed: the creation of a consolidated Central European area that offers a bridge toward Russia--but at the same time, protection against imponderables coming from Russia.
