Information in living organisms is transferred via electrical impulses, which means that, at the membrane level, there must be elements that transform every possible type of external event into electrical signals. The transformation mechanism is localized in the cell membrane, which contains receptor structures and is capable of generating an electrical response. Membrane potentials arise as a result of the selective diffusion of ions through individual transmembrane pores. The bilayer lipid membrane has trigger properties that are important from the standpoint of sensory systems, i.e., in physiological systems, it can be in two conformational states (gel and liquid crystalline). Experiments on flat bilayer lipid membranes have demonstrated that when a fixed voltage is present on a membrane, the transition from liquid- crystalline state to gel phase is accompanied by electrical signals that are ionic and capacitive. Membranes consisting of charged lipids are of particular interest to researchers, because they are sensitive to the external environment and to exposure to protons, divalent ions, pressure, and electrical field. The researchers here use measurements of electrical parameters in phase transformations induced by changes in Me[.sup]2+[/] concentration in bilayer lipid membranes consisting of acidic lipids to demonstrate that the phase transition is accompanied by capacitive currents comparable in magnitude and direction to the so-called gate currents of excitable membranes and by increased permeability for cations.
