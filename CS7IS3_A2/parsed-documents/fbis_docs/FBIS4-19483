The PFP agreement will be signed later, apparently at the same time as Sweden. In its decision to approve the agreement, the government stresses that Finland will chiefly take part in peacekeeping training, rescue work, and environmental protection. The government also points out that Finland is not seeking new defense solutions through the PFP.
