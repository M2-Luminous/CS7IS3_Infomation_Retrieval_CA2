At a friendship tea party today, Lu Ping told reporters that the above-mentioned principle had been clearly laid down by the relevant panel under the PWC. Although the method has yet to be finalized, he said that the panel is working hard to formulate a very flexible method which tallys with China's nationality law and which will enable most returnees to enjoy permanent right of abode in Hong Kong. Lu Ping said: Even now, many Hong Kong residents have not been granted an identity card with "three stars" [denoting permanent resident status] on it although they have lived in Hong Kong for several decades. The Chinese side has repeatedly suggested to the British Hong Kong government that Hong Kong's existing migration regulations should be amended according to the Basic Law. After listing several possible solutions to the problem, Lu Ping said: The suggestions raised so far are not well considered. For instance, some people suggested solving the problem on the basis of the place of residence. According to the common law, there are two types of residences. One is the original dwelling place, namely, the place where one's father lived and is considered one's permanent residence, the status of which will never become null and void; and the other is the selected place of residence, the status of which will become invalid. According to this principle, the status of the original place of residence will become null and void if the status of the selected place of residence is chosen, while the former will be restored if the latter is given up. Such a principle can only solve the problem concerning Chinese citizens born in Hong Kong as opposed to Chinese citizens who were not born in Hong Kong or who have resided in Hong Kong for seven years or more, or non-Chinese residents. Lu Ping continued: Other people maintain that since Chinese citizens born in Hong Kong and Chinese citizens who have lived in Hong Kong for seven years have been given permanent resident status, and the Basic Law does not say that these people's identity cards will be invalid once they change their nationalities, the problem of whether or not these people should enjoy right of abode should be given consideration. Non-Chinese residents who have lived in Hong Kong for seven years will be required to express a desire to regard Hong Kong as their permanent place of residence before they are granted right of abode, but their right of abode will be forfeited if they leave Hong Kong for a long time because this shows that they do not treat Hong Kong as their permanent place of residence. The Basic Law does not set conditions under which right of abode will be forfeited, so the relevant problem must be placed on the agenda. He stressed: The foregoing solutions are tentative ones and remain immature. The issue is in fact not as serious as claimed by the British Hong Kong Government. Our approach is to explore a flexible solution which will not contravene China's nationality law and which will make the right of abode obtainable to most Hong Kong people returning to Hong Kong from abroad. When talking about Chinese citizens among Hong Kong residents, Lu Ping said: China's nationality law considers dual nationality illegal. According to the nationality law and the Chinese Government's consistent stand on the Hong Kong issue, those Hong Kong Chinese holding BDTC (British Dependent Territories Citizen) and BNO [British National Overseas] passports and those who have been given right of abode in the United Kingdom but do not settle there are all Chinese citizens. Lu Ping also revealed today that the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) passport is being designed. To make travel convenient for Hong Kong people after 1997, Lu Ping added, the Chinese side has asked the Hong Kong side to provide materials about Chinese citizens among Hong Kong residents so that SAR passports will be given to them before 1997. When asked whether he had seen the design of the SAR passport, Lu Ping said he had. The design is similar to the PRC passport except for a bauhinia [the flower of Hong Kong] design on it. We are now designing the SAR passport; as soon as the passport is ready we will make representations to relevant countries through diplomatic channels over the matter. We will try our best to obtain mutual visa exemptions to make things convenient for Hong Kong travelers, said Lu Ping. He continued: The way to issue SAR passports to Hong Kong people before 1997 and the technicalities of the SAR government discharging its responsibilities related to the passports issue is under discussion. For instance, some people have suggested issuing SAR passports to Hong Kong people through certain channels. But the passport will remain invalid until it is endorsed by the SAR government putting its stamp on it in 1997.
