But since then people have become concerned about the direction in which the united republic is heading. What do you wish had happened? [Hamm-Bruecher] I wish we had learned from western experience as much as we learned from eastern experience. This wish incorporates my dream, which, as is usually the case with dreams, is somewhat of an illusion. Things probably could not have happened differently from the way they did, but I think we missed an opportunity to stop for a moment and examine what was proceeding successfully, what was not proving successful, and what we should change. But instead, we in the west thought: Well, we have to pay the solidarity tax surcharge for a certain length of time, and apart from that the people in the east must do the same as us. Most people here in the west have never even considered the fact that people in the east have totally different feelings and habits than we do, and that great efforts are required to adapt. [DIE ZEIT] Many people say that the Federal Republic was also merely a sort of antechamber and that the chamber of history is now empty. What do you think should be kept intact? What kind of heritage should we protect? [Hamm-Bruecher] Our "antechamber" has repeatedly produced excellent democrats; we have overcome difficult cases; and we have succeeded in reconciling the Germans to democracy which, by the way, was always linked to economic growth and prosperity. This is something that one must not only protect, but also develop. [DIE ZEIT] But one can extend the argument. Michael Stuermer, Joachim Fest, and others have claimed that the past 40 years were but a diversion and now the Federal Republic can follow the correct road at last. Do you agree? [Hamm-Bruecher] It was a diversion insofar as we Germans have finally realized that after one failure, or two if you include the year 1848, democracy and free coexistence require a new path. If people choose to see that as a diversion of the old Federal Republic, that means that we are heading toward quite a dangerous and reactionary tradition. [DIE ZEIT] Do the politicians realize this? [Hamm-Bruecher] No. There is an odd nostalgia for that part of German history that is worthy of display, to the exclusion of that part of German history that is best forgotten. That is dangerous. We imagine that at last we have a democracy and have completed our task. But in fact we must continue to work at it for a long time. [DIE ZEIT] One cannot say that we have come more Protestant, liberal, and reform-minded since unification? [Hamm-Bruecher] No. But even in the West, the new openness, the realization that democracy is a form of coexistence that is not limited to official institutions, did not materialize until the end of the 1950's. We were also in a period of desolation then. Look at all the men who fell in the war or were wounded well as the incorrigible Nazis. No wonder there was no strength for renewal after 1945. It took a long time to find this strength. After 1989, many people in the West remained forsaken and depressed. Because of that, renewal might only be possible in 10 years. As you can see, I am hopelessly optimistic. Even so I find our lack of concern about how a democracy is supposed to develop on the threshold of the third millennium dangerous. Representative democracy on its own serves no further purpose, and all the political parties are handing the idea of participatory democracy with kid gloves. On the other hand, we have a "spectator democracy" with citizens who feel that if they are only permitted to vote every four years, all they can do is sit and watch the politicians and criticize them. [DIE ZEIT] Some people recommend a sense of pride and participation as a recipe for national awareness. As a liberal, does the question of national identity have any relevance for you? [Hamm-Bruecher] No, I doubt whether the old type of nationalism and patriotism have to be rediscovered and whether women can do anything with these values. For me this is the domain of men. Other things are more important for me. We must make a serious attempt to redefine our identity. But this is not the kind of patriotism illustrated by the saying "whether the country does right or whether it does wrong, it is still my country." It is something that involves a feeling for spiritual and cultural values, not to mention an awareness of the failures and terrible wars we have experienced this century. We are discussing values that must be defended, on the one hand, and necessary changes on the other. Can one not say that Germany's openness to refugees is part of its identity? [Hamm-Bruecher] Yes. That is also the reason why I find it so difficult to accept the change in the asylum law. Of course, I also see the reality. But the asylum law is not just a reaction to the fortunes of those who fled from Nazism. It is also a genuine result of the changes. The things that burden us and have a bearing on our consciousness are also a part of our identity, for example the way one views human rights. Some of the things that were said in the debate on the expulsion of the Kurds sounded as if there was no right of asylum in Germany any more. We must face up to these things. And when I consider all this, I regret that I am no longer at the beginning of my political life, but at the end. That is why I am so keen on running for the post of president, because it gives me another opportunity to oppose these alarming trends. [DIE ZEIT] What is it that holds a disoriented society together? Is it common values? [Hamm-Bruecher] As a liberal, I oppose any kind of indoctrination. On the other hand, we must consider in what way we can teach young people to resist temptations posed by the media and the behavior of adults. One must realize that one cannot only do things that are to one's own advantage. One must also work to the advantage of others, something that often involves sacrifices. [DIE ZEIT] What do you think of the liberal opinions in the media, parliament, and the parties? [Hamm-Bruecher] The unique candle procession, for instance, was more than just a demonstration. It represented liberal public opinion. People did not have to be told to get up and do something to display their feelings. They just did it. [DIE ZEIT] Have you any criticism of us journalists? [Hamm-Bruecher] Yes. Journalists play down such phenomena as a greater degree of social commitment. It is not spectacular enough for them. I even find the liberal press rather disillusioned. [DIE ZEIT] Perhaps because liberal opinion manifests itself mainly as a kind of background noise? [Hamm-Bruecher] There is a constant overfeeding. Things used to be much clearer before. It also used to be more important whether or not one appeared in DIE ZEIT. But, unfortunately, DIE ZEIT is no longer the political institution that it used to be. [DIE ZEIT] In that case, where do you see liberal authorities and persons linked to them? [Hamm-Bruecher] Generally speaking, it takes more effort these days to prevent something than to change it. That takes a lot of energy. First we have to overcome right-wing extremist violence before we can consider any constructive political moves, otherwise we cannot establish a basis for peaceful coexistence between Germans and foreigners. [DIE ZEIT] Do you think that people encounter the limits of politics so frequently that they no longer care what you do as a politician or as a journalist? [Hamm-Bruecher] Even a parliamentary deputy becomes powerless when he thinks every single political faction in compliance with Article 38 of the Basic Law meeting means a loss of his identity. When someone is not as crazy as I am, one can say: Personal commitment is useless, so adapt yourself. But one should establish a political career not just through adjustment. It is bad that instead of doing something because of its importance and then introducing it to the rest of society, one introduces it first and then says it is impossible to achieve. [DIE ZEIT] Would a future president have to do it? [Hamm-Bruecher] I believe there is motivation to attempt a joint course of action again, because the question of party democracy versus a civil society remains unresolved. The political parties are no longer able to implement the idea of democracy as an ideal and as a reality and impart soul and life to it. [DIE ZEIT] How about a democracy without parties? [Hamm-Bruecher] Impossible. But one day there might be a formation gathering, for example, all the Pfluegers, Suessmuths, Geisslers, Hamm-Bruechers, Hirschs, Gansels, and so on. [DIE ZEIT] Are you in favor of an erasure of the GDR past, or a reappraisal thereof? [Hamm-Bruecher] I know that what is being done is not right, but I know of no better way of doing it, because the damage in the GDR after 12 years was much deeper and more far-reaching than here. To a major extent, the Germans were convinced Nazis. But I do not think they were communists or SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] supporters to the same extent. But we are combining the Nazi dictatorship with the SED. That is impermissible. This reminds me of the case of Maunz, former Bavarian culture minister, whom I helped topple in 1964. I consider it a scandal that a man like Maunz, following his resignation, could become one of the most respected law professors in Germany. [DIE ZEIT] Finally, I would like to ask you about the presidential election on 23 May. We have the impression that the FDP has not promoted your candidacy with enough militancy, and there are even rumors that some people in the party leadership want to make clear already in the first round of the vote that Herzog is assured of a majority. Does this bother you? [Hamm-Bruecher] I do not think that will happen, and I expect broad support for my party. [DIE ZEIT] But the question of a presidential candidate's liberal qualities must come before coalition business? [Hamm-Bruecher] Yes. It is important for me that in the end, every democrat is accountable for his own actions. I have been trying to do that for 40 years.
