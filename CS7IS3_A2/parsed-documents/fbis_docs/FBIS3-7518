The leading composite stock price index slid 21.31 points in the week ending Saturday, March 26, from 893.99 the previous Saturday to 872.68. Early in the week, share prices took a downturn due to the buildup of tension over the North Korean nuclear question and an anticipated financial pinch toward the end of the month. Late in the week prices rebounded, fueled by rising small- and medium-sized issues and rumors of additional market deregulation. But the rise was short-lived with prices again falling amid rumors that some listed firms were beset with financial problems and heavy selling by institutional investors. Nearly all issues other than fisheries, prefabricated metal and miscellaneous manufacturing declined. The slide in the insurance, inland transportation and lumber sectors was especially steep. Volume in the week was 180.52 million shares, a drop of 19.9 percent from the previous week when it stood at 216.40 million shares. The daily average was 30.08 million. Turnover amounted to 3,091 billion won or 515.2 billion won a day compared with 4,232.6 billion won (705.4 billion won a day) the previous week. During the week, institutional investors bought more than they sold while foreign investors did far more selling than buying. Institutional investors' selling amounted to 719.4 billion won or 21.7 percent of the total while their buying came to 794.7 billion won (23.9 percent). Selling by foreign investors reached 146.4 billion won and they bought shares worth 42.2 billion won, representing 4.4 and 1.3 percent of the total, respectively. In the previous week, foreigners sold shares worth 64.0 billion won and purchased 49.8 billion won worth. Stock players' deposits declined 48.9 billion won in the week ending March 24 from 3,320.9 billion won on March 17 to 3,271.9 billion won. Market analysts said that favorable future factors for the Korean bourse include the economy's reported entry into a full recovery course, President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China and permission for listed firms to purchase their own shares beginning next month. On the other hand, adverse factors include strained inter-Korean relations over the nuclear question, growing demand for funds by companies toward the end of the month, predominant selling by foreign investors and an anticipated deterioration of market demand and supply conditions, the analysts said.
