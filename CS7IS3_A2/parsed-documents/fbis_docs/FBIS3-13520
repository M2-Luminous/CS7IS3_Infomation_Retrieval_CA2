"Given India's black record in Kashmir, is it possible to absolve New Delhi of the savage killing of men, women and children?" asked Jomhuri-e Eslami, close to Islamic hardliners. Had the intervention been in the "long-term interest of a Moslem nation and the liberation movements in Kashmir?" The daily urged the foreign ministry to explain the logic behind the intervention to the Kashmiri people in order to "reassure them that Iran has made no changes in its position." Islamabad dropped the resolution to be put before the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva at the last minute Wednesday after pressure from Iran, China and other countries. The initial draft resolution proposed that the commission express "its grave concern at the gross and consistent violations of human rights in Jammu and Kashmir." On Thursday, a Moslem rebel group in Kashmir charged the Iranian stand on the disputed state had been an about-turn. More than 8,500 people have died in Kashmir since 1989 when Moslem militants stepped up a bloody campaign for succession.
