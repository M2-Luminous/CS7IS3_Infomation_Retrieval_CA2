SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The affected area includes approximately 117,000 acres of public land in western Mesa County between the Colorado National Monument and the Utah state line. Additional amendment items may be identified through the public involvement process. The proposed amendment and EA will be prepared by an interdisciplinary team which will include persons with expertise in outdoor recreation, archaeology, paleontology, wildlife biology, fire ecology, range conservation, realty, and geology. Public involvement opportunities will include open public workshops to develop portions of the plan. Persons wishing to participate in this process should contact the Bureau of Land Management, Grand Junction Resource Area.
