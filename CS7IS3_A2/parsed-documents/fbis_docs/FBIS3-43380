Yves Rolland Billecart, Air Afrique's managing director, is here in Ouagadougou to hold discussions with Burkinabe authorities concerning the necessary change in this indispensable tool for air transportation. After arresting the company's financial loss a few years ago, and after making important investments, such as the purchase of the Airbus which increased the transportation capacity of the company -- after this stage of spectacular rehabilitation -- Air Afrique is faced with new difficulties which demand increased support from its member countries. This will be the topic of the heads of state meeting which opens on 10 January in Dakar. After his audience with Prime Minister Youssouf Ouedraogo this morning, Yves Rolland Billecart talked to Gerard Sawadogo Koudaogo this. [Begin recording] [Billecart] This visit to Burkina Faso is meant to examine problems specific to Burkina Faso. We have noted with satisfaction that the exportation of agricultural products is going on well this year, thanks to greater discipline shown by exporters. It is also due to their commitments that Air Afrique has been able to meet the corresponding challenges. These were the major topics of my discussions with the prime minister. Earlier, I held a working session with the minister of transport, then with the minister of employment and labor, and with the minister of culture, whose many activities demand traveling, as well as with the minister of tourism. So, as you can see, the purpose of my visit was to discuss the general problems of the company for the Dakar conference as well as to discuss (?traveling issues). [Koudaogo] Let us then talk with Rolland Billecart about all these problems facing Air Afrique. [Billecart] Air Afrique is suffering from insufficient funds. When I took over the management of the company, there was no more capital because it was less than 15 billion CFA francs. Thanks to efforts made by France as well as our results for first four years, we were able to build up capital, which was good, but still insufficient. Presently, we have capital totaling 15 billion CFA francs, but we have a long-term debt of 80 billion, which came purchasing aircrafts and modernizing our installations. Therefore, we need to balance the funds. We had drawn up a program which consisted of an assistance from the African Development Bank [ADB]. Unfortunately, the ADB board of governors did not accept the suggestion of its president and we ended up suggesting a new plan which I negotiated with the French Government. And it is this program which will be examined in Dakar. If, as I expect, this program is accepted, Air Afrique might be able to arrange [words indistinct] as far its capital or a permanent fund is concerned, and have a more balanced financial structure. Contrary to what was said, we have not envisaged a restructuring of the company. It was restructured in 1989. As you know, this resulted in the retrenchment of workers and this time, there is no question of retrenching workers. [end recording]
