ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule will change the minimum inspection frequency for surface coal mining and reclamation operation that have been abandoned without completion of reclamation or abatement of violations. The change enables regulatory authorities to eliminate ineffective inspections to redirect resources to minesites where inspection and enforcement will achieve intended results. Before an abandoned site can qualify for a change in inspection frequency under this rule, the regulatory authority must make a written finding that a site is abandoned and that the change in inspection frequency is appropriate based on specified environmental and public health and safety criteria.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background II. Discussion of Rule and Response to Public Comments III. Procedural Matters I. Background Section 517(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (the Act) states that the regulatory authority shall inspect on an irregular basis averaging not less than one partial inspection per month and one complete inspection per quarter each surface coal mining and reclamation operation covered by a permit. To implement this requirement, OSM first promulgated rules at 30 CFR 840.11 for State regulatory authorities and at 30 CFR 842.11 for OSM where it is the regulatory authority authority in a State. 44 FR 15455 (March 13, 1979). These rules essentially mirrored the inspection frequency requirements of the Act. These rules were revised on August 16, 1982 (47 FR 35620). Among other things, the 1982 rules carved out for inspection frequency purposes a distinct category of surface coal mining and reclamation operations where reclamation was in the advanced stages. While retaining the quarterly requirement for complete inspections, these rules allowed regulatory authorities to reduce the number of partial inspections required at these ``inactive'' operations from an average of one per month to a frequency ``as necessary to ensure effective enforcement of the regulatory program.'' Since abandoned sites are incompletely reclaimed surface coal mining and reclamation operations where the operators will not or cannot return to the minesite to complete reclamation or correct violations, they remain in an ``active'' status, and, therefore, must continue to be inspected at the full mandated frequency of twelve times per year. To address the issue of inspection frequency at abandoned sites, the rules were again revised in 1988. (53 FR 24872, June 30, 1988). This time the rules defined an ``abandoned site'' as a distinct category at surface coal mining and reclamation operations and enabled regulatory authorities to reduce the inspection frequency at these sites and to refrain from issuing additional enforcement actions at abandoned sites under certain conditions. The definition of ``abandoned site'' specifies that, before a site can be considered abandoned, it must first meet certain criteria which ensure that the regulatory authority has taken or is in the process of taking all enforcement action available to it under the applicable regulatory program to compel abatement of violations and completion of reclamation. Sites meeting the definition could then, instead of twelve times per year, be inspected ``as necessary to monitor for changes of environmental conditions or operational status at the site.''
