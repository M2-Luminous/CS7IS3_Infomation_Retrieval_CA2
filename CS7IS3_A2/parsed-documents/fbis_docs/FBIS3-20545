Key To Further Advance Lies in New Actions Says Ge Hui (2047 6540), the Officer in Charge of the National Machinery and Electronics Products Export Office, in Response to Correspondents' Questions"] [Text] National Machinery and Electronics Product Export Office officer Ge Hui recently said in response to correspondents questions about the country's exports of machinery and electronics products during 1993 that exports of these products totaled $22.5 billion, up 13 percent from the previous year. He added, however, that the key to further advance lay in new approaches and new actions. In reviewing the golden age of machinery and electronics product exports from 1986 to 1992, Ge Hui told the correspondents that thanks to the enormous growth during this seven-year period, the country's foreign exchange earnings from machinery and electronics products exports shot up from $1.62 billion yuan in 1985 to $19.55 billion in 1992, an average annual 42 percent rise. China's exports of machinery and electronics products also increased from 0.3 to 1.3 percent of world trade in machinery and electronics products. Exports of machinery and electronics products also rose from 6.1 to 23 percent of the country's foreign trade exports, machinery and electronics products now ranking second after textiles (including clothing) among the country's exports. While evaluating the overall trend of development of China's exports of machinery and electronics products in 1993, Ge Hui stressed the need to look at them in the following two ways: First, machinery and electronics product exports continue to rise between 5 and 6 percentage points relative to foreign trade exports. Second, the 13 percent increase in machinery and electronics product exports during 1993 is far lower than the 40 percent of the previous year. After seven years of high speed growth of machinery and electronics product exports, hidden worries about insufficient export strength have begun to set in again. What are the reasons? Ge Hui believes there are five reasons: First is the impact of the overall climate. During 1993 the domestic market made a good showing. Demand was very brisk for commodities of an investment nature, such as machinery and electronics products for direct use in capital construction. This intensified the strain between the international market and the domestic market. Second, too brisk domestic demand caused excessive rise in the prices of raw and processed materials such as steel. This led, in turn, to a rise in foreign trade enterprises' export costs, which impaired exporting firms returns from exports and increased export business difficulties. In addition was the good domestic market prices of machinery and electronics goods. The problem of returns from export sales not being as good as those from domestic sales became more glaring. Many production firms put greater emphasis on domestic market sales. Third was further intensification of foreign trading firms' funds shortage. During 1992 and the first half of 1993, the country's financial order was somewhat chaotic. Bank discounting of loans in violation of regulations was rampant. This also meant that the banks could not fully ensure a supply of funds for foreign trade enterprises. Some foreign trade corporations and industrial and trading corporations also tied up fairly large amounts of money in real estate and stock speculation. Fourth, failure of state agencies concerned to enforce foreign trade export business policies also directly impaired the zeal of large numbers of export business. Examples include inability to offset renminbi payments when paying foreign exchange to the government, burdensome export tax rebate procedures, and inability to get tax rebates promptly. Of course, the situation improved following rectification of financial procedures and greater macroeconomic regulation and control during the last half of 1993. Fifth, the export mechanism shows no formation as yet of a mechanism whereby enterprises can make their own business decisions, be responsible for their own profits and losses, restrain themselves, develop themselves, and expand exports as they like. New problems also occurred in the course of reform. Some foreign trade corporations unilaterally construed the "primarily one business but running multiple businesses" that state policy permitted to mean making money mostly inside the country. They did not put much effort into the fundamental task of earning foreign exchange for the country. During 1993, a substantial number of foreign trading corporations and industrial and trading corporations showed zero or negative increase in exports. Ge Hui said that after an analysis and validation by units and locations concerned based on actual circumstances in China and the trend of world economic development at the All-China Machinery and Electronics Products Export Work Conference held in early 1993, a three stage development goal was set for China's machinery and electronics products exports: This was to export approximately $30 billion worth of machinery and electronics products by 1995 by meeting two years ahead of schedule the State Council proposed $20 billion export goal by the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan; exporting approximately $60 billion worth by 2000, machinery and electronics products thereby becoming China's first major category of exports; and exporting approximately $150 million worth in approximately 15 years beginning now. Ge Hui emphasized that attainment of this magnificent goal will require new approaches and new actions. He discussed this issue from several angles. First is the export products question. Vigorous efforts must be made to adjust the export product mix, truly creating a number of primary export products such as complete factories, ships, motor vehicles, and electronic products. If these products are to become the country's dominant exports, China will have to formulate corresponding industrial policies, draw up concrete methods, increase investment, speed up technological transformation, improve its product development capabilities, raise the level of its technology, and improve testing. Second is the export market question. Today, international markets are the weakest link in the expansion of machinery and electronics products exports. The urgent task of the moment is further improvement of ability to open up international markets. This means both focusing on the opening of important markets that have a large capacity, and simultaneously paying attention to places that have market potential (such as Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa), doing all possible to create conditions to enter these areas. This is the only way of forming an all-points, diversified market pattern to reduce export risks. Henceforth, we will have to fashion a composite force made up of designated foreign trade corporations, production firms that do their own exporting, and foreign owned concerns for joint opening of international markets. We must gradually build a number of primarily industrial or primarily trade export enterprise blocs to pursue a course of greater internationalization, greater industrialization, and greater commercialization. Next is the trading methods question. Trading methods must be more flexible. We must further develop the importation of materials for processing and re-export and develop OEM methods, i.e., use the manufacturing techniques, blueprints and materials of foreign firms to manufacture products bearing the trademarks of foreign forms, and using foreign firm commercial channels to sell them in international markets. We must operate joint ventures or produce and design in cooperation with foreign firms, investing in the operation of plants abroad to develop CKD and SKD assembled exports to expand exports of machinery and electronics products. With the steady intensification of our foreign trade system reforms, the domestic market will gradually dovetail with the international market. Some methods used in China that are not in keeping with international practice will gradually weaken. Ge Hui emphasized that the role of finance and banking in supporting exports will becoming increasingly important. He believes that the state should intensify financial support for machinery and electronics products exports. While ensuring the short term operating funds needed to expand exports, the state should more greatly increase intermediate and long term export credit, grant preferential credit interest rates for sellers, and support exports of large and complete plants and equipment, as well as aircraft, and ships. Formation of a Chinese import-export bank should be accelerated. We should learn from the experiences of Japan and South Korea in export and import banks support for the export of complete plants. Once China has founded an export-import bank, it should assume the credit risks that ordinary commercial banks do not want to assume or are unable to assume, preferential credit being used to increase the competitiveness of China's machinery and electronics products in international markets. Ge Hui said that the gradual intensification of reform should bring about the quickest possible formation of a mechanism whereby enterprises are responsible for their own operation, for their own profits and losses, for limiting themselves, for developing themselves, and for expanding exports. Truly effective policy measures should be formulated to arouse the interest of exporting enterprises in expanding exports. Ge Hui also especially emphasized the need to make the most of the role of the coordinated guidance and consulting services that the Machinery and Electronics Product Export Chamber of Commerce provides in building a regular export order. As government's function changes, not only will the Chamber of Commerce coordinate export prices, customers, and markets, but export quota assignments and preliminary examination of export licenses will gradually come to be handled by the Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce must substantially improve its organizational structure to meet the needs of deepening reform. He said that a "Foreign Trade Law," and "Regulations for Punishing Sales of Exports at Low Prices" must be drawn up as quickly as possible, legal methods use to prevent a chaotic situation. Punishments must be particularly emphasized, violations of the law dealt with according to law, severe punishments meted out depending on the seriousness of the offense, and for causing severe economic losses for the country. Reportedly, acting in the spirit of State Council structural reforms, a National Machinery and Electronics Products Import-Export Office organized from the merger of the former State Council Machinery and Electronics Products Export Office and the State Council Machinery and Electronics Equipment Import Coordination Office is to become the functional unit of the National Economics and Trade Commission. Ge Hui said that the new organization will formulate support policies as reform steadily intensifies. Just as in the past, it will be in charge of needed macroeconomic regulation and control measures to move ahead and spur healthy development of the machinery and electronics products import-export trade. The CPC Central Committee's listing of the machinery and electronics industry as a principal industry in the national economy has greatly encouraged the millions of staff members and workers on the machinery front. "Close involvement in reform, hastening development, vigorous development, and making the most of the national economy's dominant role," have become action slogans for stimulating an all-out effort throughout the industry. The development program for invigorating the machinery industry that the Ministry of Machinery has drawn up has been revised many times and will soon appear. Human talent is the keystone in dominant industries. One important aspect of the invigoration of the machinery industry is good management and good use of all kinds of specialists and technical talent to improve the caliber of the rank and file throughout the industry. Survey data show that as education, the economy, and science and technology develop, and as society and enterprises increasingly respect science and technology as well as scientific and technical talent, the speed of growth of technicians in the machinery system has been markedly higher than the total number of staff members and workers. Statistics from 10 dominant enterprises show an 8.6 percent increase in the total number of staff members and workers between 1988 and 1991, but a 20.8 percent increase in the number of technicians. At the same time, the caliber of technicians as a whole has also risen markedly, and the percentage of graduate students, and college undergraduates has increased by varying degrees. An environment of respect for human talent, respect for knowledge, and respect for contributions is gradually taking shape. However, by comparison with needs in invigorating the machinery industry, numerous problems in need of immediate solution continue in the training and use of human talent. Human Talent Utilization Efficiency Not High A questionnaire survey of 201 scientific and technical personnel shows that only 5.5 percent of scientific and technical personnel in the machinery and electronics industry personnel feel that their skills are being used to the full; 39.8 percent feel they largely apply their talents; and 17.4 percent believe their talents are not being used at all. In another survey of engineers in large and medium size enterprises, 72 percent felt they were being held back, 80 percent felt work unsatisfying, and only 5 percent put in overtime. Such a slack and easy going state of affairs naturally creates not very high work efficiency. Some comparative data for 1988 is shocking. In Japan, per capita gross output value of engineers in the machinery industry was $350,000, while it was only $84,000 in China. This is to say that in machinery industries having the same output value, China used 4.1 times the number of engineers as Japan. There are both structural reasons and conceptual reasons for this state of affairs. Examples include out of date products, antiquated organizational methods, softening of demand for technology and for technical personnel, and being accustomed to the expansion of extensive inputs primarily, using large amounts of money and manpower; and a serious shortage of development funds that leads to having a large number of technical personnel in name but not in reality, which makes the development of new products very difficult, and makes it even harder to translate scientific research achievements into production. (The money provided for technical progress in some developed nations generally runs between 3 and 5 percent of total sales. In strong Japanese enterprises, it runs as high as 10 percent. In China, by contrast, many enterprises invest less than 1 percent.) A Shanghai survey shows 70 percent of new research achievements have not been translated into the development of products. The value of knowledge is not fully appreciated. Many enterprises continue to treat scientific and technical personnel like organizational cadres, their average bonus being between 10 and 30 percent less than workers on the front line of production. Egalitarianism in distributions is a serious problem. "It makes no difference whether one works or does not work," or whether one "does not work and also takes few risks." This situation results in scientific and technical personnel not doing their best; production efficiency in the enterprise itself is not high; and overstaffing is the general rule, etc. Serious Flight of Human Talent Surveys show that despite the increase in technicians in the machinery and electronics industry in recent years, in state-owned enterprises -- particularly in large- and medium-sized enterprises -- the dropping out of skilled personnel, the aging of human talent, and the flight of human talent is extremely serious. It is mostly middle age and young permanent scientific and technical cadres that leave. A sample survey showed a decline from 24.6 to 19.28 percent in the number of scientific and technical personnel between the ages of 30 and 40 between 1986 and 1991. Another survey showed the flight of more than one-third of the young scientific and technical personnel during the past five years from large- and medium-size machinery and electronics enterprises. More than 60 of the best graduates of institutions of higher education assigned to the Dalian Municipal Machinery Bureau were snapped up by the three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises. Between 1984 and 1990, 4000 university graduates were assigned to a Beijing machine tool plant. More than half have already left. The problem in frontier regions is particularly serious. Survey statistics from 287 enterprises show only 7.92 percent of technicians in enterprises today are between 31 and 35 years of age, and 14.5 percent are between 26 and 30 years old. The flight of human talent not only weakens enterprises technical strength, but also damages continuity. It tends to create a vicious cycle. The main reasons for the flight and dropping out of human talent are that large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are in the least favorable position in the intense competition for human talent. They cannot compete with the three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, or with township and town enterprises, in earnings. In the probability of making a name for oneself and opportunities to travel abroad, state-owned enterprises cannot compete with educational and scientific research units. In housing, working conditions, and a feeling of being respected, state-owned enterprises cannot compete with administrative institutions. In work freedom, work environment, and income, state-owned enterprises cannot compete with companies of all kinds. Yet another important reason for the flight of human talent is that technicians can more easily put their talents to use in the three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, and in township and town enterprises, unlike in some large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises where seniority and age play a role, and where people are not used to the full. This corrodes people's spirit and enthusiasm. Accelerate Building of a Human Talent Corps Informed people believe that the priority task in invigorating the machinery industry is accelerating the creation of a high caliber specialist corps that combines ability and political integrity, and that is sensibly composed. The human talent strategy that the Ministry of Machinery espouses is "maintenance of continuity in the corps, optimization of the make-up, improvement of caliber, and speedy selection for promotion and training of middle agent and young permanent technical cadres and academic leaders so that new technical personnel will be available to replace old technical personnel over the next 10 years. It wants to build a technician corps of good political quality, that has fine professional skills, whose make-up is rational, that is highly trained, and that is imbued with vitality to meet the needs of reform and opening to the outside world, scientific and technical competition, and social development." The specific measures that the Ministry of Machinery has proposed to attain this strategic goal are the founding of a human talent bank, including the establishment first of a high level specialized talent bank, accelerated training of three-in-one talent (technology, management, and sales), and four-in-one talent (technology, management, sales, and foreign language); founding of a human talent exchange center, improvement of enterprises competitiveness, using fair competition as a basis for accurately guiding rational exchanges of human talent; formulation of preferential policies for the importation of scientific and technical management talent; founding a rewards system, increasing investment in education, etc. In short, "human talent engineering" is imminent.
