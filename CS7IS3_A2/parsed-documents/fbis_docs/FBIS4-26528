Accompanied by autonomous regional Governor Cheng Kejie and other leaders, the work team rushed to Wuzhou and other places by helicopter to inspect the disaster situation and to guide the work of combating floods and providing disaster relief. Leaders with Vice Premier Zou Jiahua included Chen Yaobang, vice minister of the State Planning Commission, He Jihai, vice minister of the Internal Trade Ministry, Li Jiaolin, deputy director of the Grain Reserve Department, Xu Caihou, deputy director of the General Political Department under the People's Liberation Army [PLA], and others. Autonomous regional party, government, and military leaders who welcomed Vice Premier Zou Jiahua and his party at Nanning's Wuxi Airport included Cheng Kejie, Liu Mingzu, Xu Bingsong, Mao Hubin, and others. Zhao Fulin, Guangxi Autonomous Regional CPC secretary, Wen Guoqing, Guangxi Military District commander, Liu Chunliang, political commissar of the air force stationed in Guangxi, and others rushed to Guiping and Pingnan, one of the areas severely affected by floods in our region, to inspect the disaster situation, and guide the work of fighting floods and providing disaster relief. On behalf of the regional CPC committee, regional people's government, Guangxi Military District, and PLA troops stationed in Guangxi, they visited and expressed their thanks to all servicemen and civilian who participated in the drive to fight floods and provide disaster relief. On the afternoon of 20 June, after arriving in Guiping, Zhao Fulin and his party took a boat to go downstream on the Yu Jiang to Jiangkou Town, a severely flooded area. When the boat arrived at the town, Zhao Fulin visited more than 700 officers and men of the Tashan Heroic Regiment, who were fighting the floods there. When he learned that these more than 700 fighters and officers had risked their lives and sweat to erect a 14-km flood-control dyke using 100,000 pieces of gunnysacks. He was very excited and said: You ventured to keep off the floods with your bodies to protect the lives and property of the people. You have proven to be the People's Army and heroic troops. In Pingnan County town where the water level was as high as over three meters, while inspecting those drowned streets and houses, Zhao Fulin asked local leaders about the floods. He wanted to know the situation regarding safety, food supplies, lodging, health, and other concerns of the masses affected by the disaster. When he learned that the county had succeeded in processing 300,000 kg of paddy into rice and that each and every victim of floods would first get five kg of rice to ensure that they would not go hungry, Zhao Fulin felt very happy. He stressed: The present priority task is to rescue those of the masses who are stranded on rooftops and hilltops as soon as possible. We must clearly examine each and every village, rooftop, and tree. We must rescue them as early as possible. Those who lack grain must be provided with relief grain. Our relief work must reflect that the party shows concern for the masses and that our party and government leaders have strong organization capability. It must also show the strength of army- civilian unity and team spirit under the leadership of the CPC. In Pingnan County town, Zhao Fulin also took a small boat to visit victims stranded on rooftops. He asked after their health with deep concern and said a few words to comfort them. When the masses witnessed the deep concern shown to them by the regional party, government, and military leaders, they were greatly moved. After inspecting the flood situation in the two counties and cities, Secretary Zhao discussed on the boat with Yulin prefectural, county, and city leaders disaster-relief plans. He uttered sincere words and expressed earnest hopes. When he learned that county and city party secretaries in Yulin City, Beiliu City, and Hongxian County, which were not affected by floods, had each led 1,000-man rescue teams consisting of young people's militiamen who could swim well to provide disaster relief, he praised them by saying: Such team spirit is very good. The foods are merciless but the men are full of sympathy. Party and government leaders at all levels must tell the broad masses of people affected by floods that the government and areas which have not been affected by the disaster will definitely come to their rescue. As long as there is the leadership of the Communist Party, difficulties can be overcome no matter how enormous they are.
