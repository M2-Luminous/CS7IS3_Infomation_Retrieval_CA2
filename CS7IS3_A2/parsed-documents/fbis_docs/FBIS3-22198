START II is yet to be ratified by Russia. Meanwhile the latter's missiles, including the heavy SS-18, continue to be removed from operational sites. This work was at its height during the summer and fall of last year. As in the past, missile men and defense experts displayed prompt and coordinated action at all the stages of the reduction process right up to the removal of missiles from silos and the draining off of missile fuel components. On the one hand, they were working under pressure of a tight schedule since every missile had to be removed from alert duty on strictly preset days and hours, while on the other hand they had to ensure that all the operations were carried out without any dangerous pollution of the environment ensuing. [070908] [video shows missile being removed from silo, personnel donning gas masks, fuel being siphoned off] [070909 thru 071021] [passage omitted on interview with engineer who says that ecological safety is guaranteed thanks to a closed-circuit system which prevents contact between fuel components and atmosphere] [071022] [Correspondent over aerial view of missile test range captioned ``Radar-TV, Voyen TV''] Our industry cannot do something that it was never equipped to do, in other words to salvage simultaneously up to 2,000 ICBM's, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of special fluids and nuclear and chemical munitions. What is more, we lack the necessary resources. This also applies to cleaning up the Russian Missile Forces' sole test range which covers an area of 175,000 hectares. During test launches certain parts of the delivery vehicle separate. They contain toxic rocket fuel residue. All this does not burn up in the atmosphere but falls to the ground and into water reservoirs. Two years ago the leadership of the Missile Forces together with (?``Transres''), a special science and production center, tried for the first time to carry out a mass cleanup of the test range, using their own resources. More than 2,000 tonnes of delivery vehicle debris was collected, but only a small part of the test range was cleared. By agreeing to sweeping reductions of the most powerful and technically most sophisticated missiles, Russia has not only forfeited its status as an influential partner in resolving strategic issues, but it also finds itself in a most disadvantageous position in terms of the need to observe all the necessary ecological and environmental protection safeguards during the elimination of the stockpiled weapons. [071142] [video shows aerial view of missile test range, test launch, computer graphics, debris littering the test range] [071143 thru 071230 -- passage omitted on officer describing operations to clean up 16,000 tonnes of debris accumulated at the test range] [071231] [Correspondent over video of operation to remove nose section from silo, captioned ``RADAR TV''] Today Russia is reaping the fruits of the most critical period of its military policy when, as a result of cuts in military production, it was forced to extend the guaranteed period of service of nuclear missiles on alert duty. Consequently, the safe service life of 30 percent of these missiles has already expired. And another 30 percent will turn into a potential nuclear threat in two years' time. Russia is faced with the task of scrapping more than 20,000 nuclear munitions by the year 2000. And since the pace of the salvage process is very slow, we may again fall hostages to the nuclear threat, but this time because of being incapable of carrying out mass industrial salvaging of such a vast quantity of nuclear charges. [071315] The radiation background at the launch site is only just above the permissible limit [video shows counter reading]. Furthermore, all the operations are controlled by several specialists simultaneously. Therefore the removal of the nose section at the launch site is by no means the most dangerous operation. [071331] [video shows operations above ground and detailed view of interior of missile silo] [071332 thru 071405 -- passage omitted showing officer issuing instructions on safety precautions during nose section removal] [071406 thru 071514 -- video shows nose section removal operation over largely unintelligible exchanges between officers] [071515 thru 071603 -- passage omitted showing Aleksandr Gribov, unit commander, to camera, on safety of handling and dispatch of nose sections] [071604] [Unit Commander A. Gribov, identified by caption earlier, over video of site being guarded by a soldier, sign reading ``Mines,'' nose section being loaded onto truck] It has to be said that this is by no means the least important or worst of our weapons. Fortunately, it has never been used in practice. But the tests that were carried out showed that both the missile and the warheads are excellent and highly effective. [071648] [video shows soldier guarding site, nose section being loaded onto a truck, partly over sinister music] [071649] [Correspondent over closeup of nose section being loaded onto truck] The nuclear nose cone of the SS-18 missile can carry 10 nuclear warheads. At the moment there is nothing to compare with it in the world. This unusual cargo will be carried in this neat truck only as far as the nearest depot. Before entering the industrial salvaging process, it has a difficult journey along worn-out Russian roads ahead. [O71713] [video shows warhead being loaded, truck on the move] [071714 thru 071741 -- passage omitted showing Aleksandr Volkov, first deputy commander in chief of Strategic Missile Forces, to camera, on safety regulations governing handling and storage of nuclear munitions] [071742] [Aleksandr Volkov, first deputy commander in chief of Strategic Missiles Forces, identified by caption earlier, over video of missiles on railroad platforms in a siding in snowy location] We have established two bases for scrapping missiles, the Surovatikha base, and Pibanshur near the city of Izhevsk. [O71805] [video shows missiles in railroad siding, concrete building in the middle distance, closeups of missiles on railroad platforms, partly over sinister music] [071806] [Correspondent over video of missiles being dismantled in large hangar] Pibanshur and Surovatikha are Russia's first bases for scrapping ICBM's using resource-saving technologies. Following the removal of the dangerous fuel components, each SS-17 and SS-18 missile will be carefully dismantled. In this way the Surovatikha base will be able to scrap more than 40 heavy missiles a year. This means that thousands of tonnes of expensive metals and alloys will be returned to industry. As is known, the previous class of missiles -- intermediate- and shorter-range missiles -- were scrapped by means of explosions. To the general amazement of our compatriots, billions of rubles were turned into ashes and smoke, quite apart from the damage that was done to the environment. This is why the two new enterprises -- which, incidentally, have been set up by the missile forces themselves within their department -- unquestionably mark a long-overdue step toward savings of state resources spent on disarmament. For the time being inadequate funding is hampering the entire federal program for recycling ecologically dangerous materials from scrapped weapons. The Surovatikha base could make up this shortage of funds through the sale of part of the salvaged materials to other enterprises for processing. But the latter do not have any money either. While a search for coordinated action by the ministries and departments interested in industrial recycling is under way at the top, the missile men have to bear the full burden of this work themselves. [072009] [video shows detailed views of salvage operation with camera switching back to railroad siding at the end] [072010 thru 072415 -- passage omitted on brief statements to camera by Volkov on safety regulations, START I and II provisions; video of silo being blown up with correspondent describing the economic disadvantages of this treaty obligation] [072416] [Correspondent over video of an SS-18 on a truck, followed by computer graphics, captioned ``RADAR-TV'' and ``Voyen TV''] To replace the multiple reentry vehicle missiles which are being scrapped, Russia is planning to build another multiple-warhead missile [mnogoblochnaya raketa] based on the SS-25. However, as distinct from the heavy SS-18 missile, the new missile cannot be guaranteed to penetrate the opponent's anti-missile defenses, since the SS-18 was capable of releasing, in addition to its 10 warheads, up to 1,000 false targets into orbit. Scientists at the Moscow Heat Technology Institute intend to make up for this forced minus-point in the design of the nose section of the new missile by making these missiles easily reequipable into the ``Start'' system which can be used for launches for scientific purposes either right now or in the event of arms reduction. Admittedly, the engineers and designers will have to find the money to further develop this project themselves in order to preserve the scientific potential of Russia's only institute of this kind.
