FR941031-2-00086 FR941031-2-00063 For eligibility before 1979, benefits are determined by means of a benefit table. In accordance with section 215(i)(4) of the Act, the primary insurance amounts and the maximum family benefits shown in this table are revised by (1) Increasing by 2.8 percent the corresponding amounts established by the last cost-of-living increase and the last extension of the benefit table made under section 215(i)(4) (to reflect the increase in the OASDI contribution and benefit base for 1994); and (2) by extending the table to reflect the higher monthly wage and related benefit amounts now possible under the increased contribution and benefit base for 1995, as described later in this notice. A copy of this table may be obtained by writing to: Social Security Administration, Office of Public Inquiries, 4100 Annex, Baltimore, MD 21235. Section 215(i)(2)(D) of the Act also requires that, when the Secretary determines an automatic increase in Social Security benefits, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a revision of the range of the primary insurance amounts and corresponding maximum family benefits based on the dollar amount and other provisions described in section 215(a)(1)(C)(i). These benefits are referred to as ``special minimum'' benefits and are payable to certain individuals with long periods of relatively low earnings. To qualify for such benefits, an individual must have at least 11 ``years of coverage.'' To earn a year of coverage for purposes of the special minimum, a person must earn at least a certain proportion (25 percent for years before 1991, and 15 percent for years after 1990) of the ``old-law'' contribution and benefit base. In accordance with section 215(a)(1)(C)(i), the table below shows the revised range of primary insurance amounts and corresponding maximum family benefit amounts after the 2.8 percent benefit increase. Special Minimum Primary Insurance Amounts and Maximum Family Benefits 1Special minimum primary insurance amount payable for Dec. 1993 1Number of years of coverage 1Special minimum primary insurance amount payable for Dec. 1994 1Special minimum family benefit payable for Dec. 1994 $25.10 11 $25.80 $38.80 50.10 12 51.50 77.80 75.60 13 77.70 116.90 100.80 14 103.60 155.70 126.00 15 129.50 194.30 151.30 16 155.50 233.80 176.60 17 181.50 272.80 202.00 18 207.60 311.60 227.20 19 233.50 350.60 252.30 20 259.30 389.50 277.90 21 285.60 428.70 303.00 22 311.40 467.60 328.50 23 337.60 507.20 353.70 24 363.60 545.90 378.90 25 389.50 584.60 404.40 26 415.70 624.20 429.70 27 441.70 663.00 454.80 28 467.50 701.80 480.00 29 493.40 740.90 505.30 30 519.40 779.70 Section 227 of the Act provides flat-rate benefits to a worker who became age 72 before 1969 and was not insured under the usual requirements, and to his or her spouse or surviving spouse. Section 228 of the Act provides similar benefits at age 72 for certain uninsured persons. The current monthly benefit amount of $183.40 for an individual under sections 227 and 228 of the Act is increased by 2.8 percent to obtain the new amount of $188.50. The present monthly benefit amount of $91.80 for a spouse under section 227 is increased by 2.8 percent to $94.30. Title XVI Benefit Amounts In accordance with section 1617 of the Act, Federal SSI benefit amounts for the aged, blind, and disabled are increased by 2.8 percent effective January 1995. Therefore, the yearly Federal SSI benefit amounts of $5,352 for an eligible individual, $8,028 for an eligible individual with an eligible spouse, and $2,676 for an essential person, which became effective January 1994, are increased, effective January 1995, to $5,496, $8,244, and $2,748, respectively, after rounding. The corresponding monthly amounts for 1995 are determined by dividing the yearly amounts by 12, giving $458, $687, and $229, respectively. The monthly amount is reduced by subtracting monthly countable income. In the case of an eligible individual with an eligible spouse, the amount payable is further divided equally between the two spouses. National Average Wage Index for 1993 General Under various provisions of the Act, several amounts are scheduled to increase automatically for 1995. These include (1) The OASDI contribution and benefit base, (2) the retirement test exempt amounts, (3) the dollar amounts, or ``bend points,'' in the primary insurance amount and maximum family benefit formulas, (4) the amount of earnings required for a worker to be credited with a quarter of coverage, and (5) the ``old law'' contribution and benefit base (as determined under section 230 of the Act as in effect before the 1977 amendments). These amounts are based on the annual increase in the average of the total wages. Section 321(e) of the ``Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994'' (Pub. L. 103&hyph;296), enacted August 15, 1994, provided the name ``national average wage index'' for the average of the total wages. This new designation will be used throughout this notice. Section 321(g) of the new legislation also revised the formula used to determine the OASDI contribution and benefit base, the retirement test exempt amounts, and the old-law contribution and benefit base. Under the old formula, the determination in a given year of the next year's amount was the product of the current year's amount and the ratio of (1) The prior year's national average wage index to (2) the second prior year's average wage index. (For example, the determination of the 1995 contribution and benefit base under the old formula would have been the product of the 1994 base times the ratio of the 1993 national average wage index to the 1992 average wage index.) The revised formula differs from the old formula in that the current year's amount is replaced by the amount in effect for 1994 and the national average wage index for the second prior year is replaced by the 1992 national average wage index. Thus, the revised formula can be stated as follows: the determination in a given year of the next year's amount is the product of the 1994 amount and the ratio of (1) The prior year's national average wage index to (2) the 1992 national average wage index. Under both the old and the revised formula, the resulting dollar amounts are rounded_to the nearest multiple of $300 in the case of each of the two types of contribution and benefit bases, and to the nearest $10 in the case of the monthly retirement test exempt amounts. By using fixed amounts in the revised formula, cumulative rounding distortions are eliminated. For the first determinations under the revised formula, the resulting amounts are the same as those that would have been determined under the old formula. For subsequent determinations, this may not be the case. Computation The determination of the national average wage index for calendar year 1993 is based on the 1992 national average wage index of $22,935.42 announced in the Federal Register on October 28, 1993 (58 FR 58004), along with the percentage increase in average wages from 1992 to 1993 measured by annual wage data tabulated by the Social Security Administration (SSA). The wage data tabulated by SSA include contributions to deferred compensation plans, as required by section 209(k) of the Act. The average amounts of wages calculated directly from this data were $22,001.92 and $22,191.14 for 1992 and 1993, respectively. To determine the national average wage index for 1993 at a level that is consistent with the national average wage indexing series for 1951 through 1977 (published December 29, 1978, at 43 FR 61016), we multiplied the 1992 national average wage index of $22,935.42 by the percentage increase in average wages from 1992 to 1993 (based on SSA-tabulated wage data) as follows (with the result rounded to the nearest cent): Amount The national average wage index for 1993 is $22,935.42 times $22,191.14 divided by $22,001.92, which equals $23,132.67. Therefore, the national average wage index for calendar year 1993 is determined to be $23,132.67. OASDI Contribution and Benefit Base General The OASDI contribution and benefit base is $61,200 for remuneration paid in 1995 and self-employment income earned in taxable years beginning in 1995. The OASDI contribution and benefit base serves two purposes: (a) It is the maximum annual amount of earnings on which OASDI taxes are paid. The OASDI tax rate for remuneration paid in 1995 is set by statute at 6.2 percent for employees and employers, each. The OASDI tax rate for self-employment income earned in taxable years beginning in 1995 is 12.4 percent. (The Hospital Insurance tax is due on remuneration, without limitation, paid in 1995, at the rate of 1.45 percent for employees and employers, each, and on self-employment income earned in taxable years beginning in 1995, at the rate of 2.9 percent.) (b) It is the maximum annual amount used in determining a person's OASDI benefits.
