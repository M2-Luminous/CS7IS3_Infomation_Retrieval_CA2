Konorov followed by editorial office note: "Defense Industry Has Stopped and Threatens To Go Out Onto the Street"] [Text] The two first Saturdays of March have become truly "black" ones for specialists of the military-industrial complex. Perturbed at the draft state budget for 1994, which dooms the defense industry to definitive collapse, the leaders and members of the league for assisting defense enterprises held emergency conferences. There was reason to be perturbed: Whereas last year the budget provided 7.5 trillion rubles [R] for the army's needs, and allocated R6.5 trillion, this year instead of the necessary R84 trillion the government intends to give only R37 trillion. Some R4,478 billion will be needed to fulfill conversion programs, but not a kopek is being allocated. That is why members of the government, to which those gathered in the Palace of Labor Great Hall appealed, were invited for 12 March. The planned reduction in defense expenditure means not only the complete stoppage of the majority of enterprises but also the birth of a 5 million-strong army of unemployed. The country will be deprived of its industrial potential and Russia's national security and future will be threatened. Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin assured those assembled that the absence of representatives of the Russian Federation Government in the hall does not mean the government's disregard for the sector's needs. Recognizing some of the criticism heard as fair, Andrey Kokoshin noted that plenty of edicts and decrees have been adopted, the trouble is that there is no mechanism for their operation. In particular, there is permission for trading in arms but bureaucratic obstacles are cancelling out all the efforts of the defense industry leaders to extricate themselves from their debts. The Russian Government has surrounded defense with excessive taxes, putting it on the edge of survival, while at the same time for reasons unknown to anyone and in accordance with inexplicable rules individual joint-stock companies and concerns receive benefits when being taxed. The participants in the conference adopted the text of a decree including specific measures to normalize the situation in the sector. In particular it was suggested that Russia's defense program be approved as soon as possible and that the Russian Federation law "on military production" be adopted. From the Editorial Office: It has become known to the editorial office that after the appeal by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to the Russian president the head of state imposed a resolution instructing that the draft budget be revised. It seems expedient to create an independent commission which would control the entire mechanism of the fulfillment of edicts and decrees already in operation.
