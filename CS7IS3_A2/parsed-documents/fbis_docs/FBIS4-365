Addressing more than 1,000 ANC Western Cape Youth League members he said the organisation had planned a weekend full of events to mark the first anniversary of the assassination of SA Communist Party [SACP] Secretary-General Chris Hani. SACP Chairman Joe Slovo is to address rallies in Guguletu and Khaylitsha this weekend. There will be an ANC/SACP alliance march from Guguletu to the Manenberg police station. Mr Yengeni called on the Youth League members to pull up their socks to explain to coloured people the position of the ANC and spread the organisation's word on trains, to "reduce the tensions between African and coloured people" in the peninsula. "I am a communist and I have always been one. I will struggle and also die for the interests of the workers in this country as Chris did," Mr Yengeni said. An MK leader representing the Western Cape region at ANC headquarters in Johannesburg, James Makhaya, who lived with Chris Hani said it was Hani who solved the 1982 MK mutiny in Angola. He said: "Chris was like a messiah and Jesus to many comrades in exile. He would solve any problem."
