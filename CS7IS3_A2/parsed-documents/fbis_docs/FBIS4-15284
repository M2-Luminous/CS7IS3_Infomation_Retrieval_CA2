According to the Ossetian parliament leader, personal contacts between North Ossetia's President Akhsarbek Galazov and Ingush President Ruslan Aushev may have a positive role to play in bringing peace to the south of Russia. Mr. Biragov said that the Ossetian side would insist on two "fundamental" conditions, namely that the Ingush republic abandon all territorial claims to Northern Ossetia and declare illegal and unconstitutional any attempts to settle the conflict by force. According to the provisional administration in the disputed regions of the two republics, its Armed Forces control the situation in the state-of-emergency zone and continue to take measures to restore law and order there. The confiscation of illegal weapons from the population continues. On Monday transport police officers and Russian Interior Ministry officials discovered two Uzi automatic pistols in a sleeper of the Baku-Kislovodsk train, but failed to identify and arrest their owners. The investigation of the case continues. A total of 246 submachine-guns, 22 machine-guns, 62 rifles and 417 pistols have been confiscated since the imposition of the state of emergency in the region.
