When journalists arrived on the scene at least three of the wounded were being treated at the side of the road after the dead had been removed by police. A tense situation developed outside the building where members of the police's Internal Stability Division and SA [South African] Defence Force cordoned off the area. Initial reports said ANC guards shot dead at least five Zulu marchers and wounded eight as they tried to attack the ANC head office. ANC Spokesman Carl Niehaus told SAPA there had been "attempts by armed men to enter the building". "There have also been reports of people shooting at the ANC headquarters from buildings across the road. Security guards at Shell House fired warning shots in the air but were forced to open fire in self defence," Mr Niehaus added.
