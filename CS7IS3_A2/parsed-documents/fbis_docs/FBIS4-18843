"I cherish the hope that the new determination that can be seen in the United Nations and in us will not fail to have the appropriate effect on the Serbs," Woerner said on the Cologne private television station RTL on Monday evening [11 April]. He expressed the expectation that this would push the peace process on further, "If possible at the negotiating table." With regard to Russian criticism, Woerner added that one could not start hours of consultation in the Security Council "to realize after days that we should really have taken action, but it was unfortunately impossible and now the people are already dead." The current consultation mechanism "should also satisfy Russian requirements." The NATO secretary general pointed out that the UN resolution under which the alliance was acting was "fully supported by Russia."
