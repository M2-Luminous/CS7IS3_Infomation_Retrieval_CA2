It was confirmed on 14 March, however, that Hata will not meet with President Yeltsin because he will take a two-week leave and will not stay in Moscow during Hata's visit to Moscow. The primary objective of the foreign minister's visit to Russia is to ask the president to reaffirm the "Tokyo Declaration" on which both Japan and Russia agreed last October and to express Japan's intention to continue its assistance for Russia's reforms. The foreign minister is not hiding his embarrassment at this development.
