This was stated by Saxony's Interior Minister Heinz Eggert (Christian Democratic Union) in Heringsdorf on the Baltic Sea island of Usedom. A joint working group is now supposed to examine to what extent victims' descriptions of being tortured after their return to Turkey are correct. Eggert criticized the work of the Foreign Ministry, which "did not" examine these reports "quickly enough and did not eliminate all doubts." At the beginning of the meeting, FRG Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) presented a report on the security situation. In addition, the agenda also included the observation of the right-wing extremist Republikaner, equal rights for policemen in eastern and western Germany, as well as cooperation with the police in East Europe.
