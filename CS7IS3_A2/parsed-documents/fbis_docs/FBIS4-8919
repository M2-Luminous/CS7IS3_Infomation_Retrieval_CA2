As indicated by U.S. Administration officials, the basic U.S. idea is to try to persuade its allies and the United Nations to step up air attacks on Bosnian serb targets. Yesterday's verbal attack on the Bosnian Serb leadership by Vitaliy Churkin in Moscow has directly spurred and encouraged Clinton's advisors to opt for more severe punitive measures against the Bosnian Serbs, sources in Washington said. Churkin's statement that Russia would not allow the Serbs to treat it as a `banana republic' and that `negotiations with the Serbs' should be suspended was received in the White House with relief because it was interpreted as a direct suggestion to the U.S. to adopt a radical platform which would not be countered by a Russian veto. Commenting on Churkin's statement, Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Yuriy Vorontsov said that neither the Russian Government nor President Boris Yeltsin were behind it. U.S. papers write that Monday's request by U.N. Secretary-General Butros Butros-Ghali for new NATO actions against Bosnian Serbs had been inspired by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright, who is also a member of the National Security Council. On Monday, she was briefly absent from a National Security Council session, which discussed proposals for Tuesday's meeting with Clinton, in order to telephone to Butros-Ghali and tell him that the White House was willing to launch more radical air strikes on the Bosnian Serbs. Observers in Washington are not sure what kind of reception the new, more radical U.S. variant will get. It is believed that a difficult diplomatic manoeuvre will be needed to win over NATO allies for a wider-scale bombing. Indicating a tougher stand toward the Bosnian Serbs, U.S. papers and a part of political structures on Tuesday said that the White House was ready to exempt the Bosnian Moslems from the embargo on arms deliveries to all sides in former Yugoslavia. After an incredible pressure from the Congress and the radical wing in the White House on Monday, the issue was put on the agenda of Clinton's meeting with the National Security Council on Tuesday.
