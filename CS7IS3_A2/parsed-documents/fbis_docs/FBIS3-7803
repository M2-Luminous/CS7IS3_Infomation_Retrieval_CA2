HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar and SNS Chairman Jan Slota briefed journalists on the results of the talks at an impromptu meeting: [Meciar] Both parties agreed on fundamental talks [zasadne rozhovory] with the SDL on how to stabilize and assess the situation. As for the developments in the most immediate future, we have to take into consideration several new facts. First, representatives of the Association of Towns and Villages strongly protest against the possibility that communal elections could coincide with the national elections. Second, by 25 February, over 400,000 people said in a petition that they were in favor of a referendum as a means of solving the present political situation and of tackling all three questions. As far as I know, the petition committee later relaxed its activities because it obtained many more signatures than needed, and many more were still interested in signing. Third, we cannot allow the parliamentary crisis to change into a permanent one. It would affect economic and social relations in such a way that the political climate would eventually result in the deterioration of the economy and of social welfare. It would be the people who would pay for it--in prices, pensions, etc. That is threatening the state. It is in the interest of the state--we both agreed on this--to hold elections as soon as possible. The date of 24-25 June 1994 seems to us to be the most suitable. However, the HZDS and the SNS together do not have enough votes to be able to push these dates through in parliament. That is why we need to hold talks with other political parties. [Correspondent] Which parties come under consideration? [Meciar] The SDL. We have agreed that both parties would hold talks with the SDL. [Slota] Clearly, June is the most suitable election time for the SNS. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Is there any realistic chance that the SDL and the HZDS would agree on the date of early elections, which should be, as the prime minister said today, the end of June 1994? [Weiss] There is no realistic chance for that. We have received no official offer for talks. I do not know on what grounds the prime minister gave you such information.
