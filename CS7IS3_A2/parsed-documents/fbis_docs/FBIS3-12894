In an article today, the paper adds that UN committees have emphasized that Iraq has fully met its obligations toward the resolutions issued against it, and that this requires that the UN Security Council meet its obligations toward the Iraqi people and prove its credibility to the world through the immediate implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687. The paper indicates that having given up his role as the president of a superpower, Clinton has handed the command to the Zionist lobby controlling U.S. policy, thus turning himself into a Zionist advocate at the expense of the U.S. interests and other peoples struggling for advancement. AL-QADISIYAH explains that U.S. world policy is dominated by arrogant and haughty tendencies and by the logic of force, paying no attention to other peoples' rights. Such a policy, the paper says, must backfire against its makers, leading them to the abyss. Concluding its article, AL-QADISIYAH says that when Clinton attempts to oppose the progress of a lively people such as the Iraqi people, who are supported by all struggling peoples, or when he threatens other nations with sanctions unless they give up their own interests in favor of U.S. interests, he should realize that the law of life and the logic of evolution say that the future is made by creative, lively peoples who are enriched by experiences and hardened by ordeals.
