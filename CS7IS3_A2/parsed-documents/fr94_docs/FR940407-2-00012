FR940407-2-00012 FR940407-2-00009 [A&hyph;475&hyph;031] Large Power Transformers From Italy; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review AGENCY: International Trade Administration/Import Administration, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative review. SUMMARY: In response to a request by the petitioner, the Department of Commerce is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping finding on large power transformers from Italy. The review covers exports of one manufacturer of this merchandise to the United States during the period from June 1, 1992, through May 31, 1993. As a result of the review, the Department has preliminarily determined that no dumping margins exist for the respondent. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph Hanley or Michael R. Rill, Office of Antidumping Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;4733. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On June 7, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (58 FR 31941). The petitioner requested this administrative review on June 28, 1993. We initiated the review on July 21, 1993 (58 FR 39007), covering the period June 1, 1992, through May 31, 1993. The Department is conducting this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). Scope of the Review Imports covered by the review are shipments of large power transformers (LPTs); that is, all types of transformers rated 10,000 kVA (kilovolt-amperes) or above, by whatever name designated, used in the generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization of electric power. The term ``transformers'' includes, but is not limited to, shunt reactors, autotransformers, rectifier transformers, and power rectifier transformers. Not included are combination units, commonly known as rectiformers, if the entire integrated assembly is imported in the same shipment and entered on the same entry and the assembly has been ordered and invoiced as a unit, without a separate price for the transformer portion of the assembly. This merchandise is currently classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers 8504.22.00, 8504.23.00, 8504.34.33, 8504.40.00, and 8504.50.00. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of transformers, Tamini Costruzioni Elettromeccaniche (Tamini), during the period June 1, 1992, through May 31, 1993. United States Price In calculating U.S. price (USP), the Department used purchase price as defined in section 772(b) of the Tariff Act. We calculated purchase price based on the packed price to the U.S. customer. We made adjustments to USP for transportation expenses to the Italian port and duty drawback. Foreign Market Value For the purposes of the preliminary results, we determined that, due to the highly customized nature of the products under review, the LPTs sold in the United States could not reasonably be compared to any other LPTs sold by Tamini. Therefore, in accordance with section 773(a)(2) of the Tariff Act, we calculated foreign market value based on constructed value of the model sold in the United States. In accordance with section 773(e) of the Tariff Act, the constructed value includes the costs of materials and fabrication, general expenses, profit, and packing for shipment to the United States. Home market selling expenses were used pursuant to section 773(e)(1)(B) of the Tariff Act. Since the profit submitted by Tamini exceeded the statutory eight percent profit, we applied the submitted profit to the cost of production.
