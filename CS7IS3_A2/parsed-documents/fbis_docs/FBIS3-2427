Wang said after the incident that he had been mentally prepared for all sorts of misfortunes, including being arrested and sentenced. This was the fourth summons for interrogation over the last two months. China has detained and summoned for interrogation many dissidents over the last few days. This has elicited a strong reaction from the United States. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is to visit China soon, warned that such a move may force Washington to apply trade sanctions against China. In an interview through the trunk-line exchange after his release, Wang Dan told this newspaper's reporter that he was taken away by three plainclothes public security officers yesterday while having supper at his home, and was released after an hour of interrogation. Wang also disclosed that the public security officers gave him five "strongly worded" warnings during the interrogation: 1. His words and deeds have overstepped the limit set by rules and regulations for a socialist citizen. 2. The rules and regulations require every socialist citizen to uphold the socialist system and no citizens or organizations are allowed to oppose the socialist system. 3. Some of his words were groundless and sheer fabrication. He must pay the price if what he says tarnishes the country's image. 4. China is a sovereign country and no interference in its internal affairs is allowed. 5. He has violated the criminal law. If he does it again, he will be punished without leniency. To the public security officer's "stern warnings" he responded: "I will hold to my own views and to the behavior I consider lawful. If I violate the law, I will accept the consequences," according to Wang. Wang also told this reporter that nothing will compel him to give up his efforts to promote democracy in China and his belief in the cause, adding that he is mentally prepared for any consequences, including being arrested and sentenced. [passage omitted] In another development, Ma Wendu, who has participated the 1989 democratic movement, was also taken away by public security officers two days ago and was released yesterday after being detained and interrogated for one day. Ma told his friends that the public security authorities had asked him about the "peace charter" and warned him watch his behavior.
