FR941021-2-00004 FR941021-2-00002 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE International Trade Administration [A&hyph;588&hyph;806] Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews: Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide From Japan AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Erik Warga or Dorothy Tomaszewski, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;0922 and (202) 482&hyph;0631, respectively. SUMMARY: In response to requests by the petitioners, the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') has conducted administrative reviews of the antidumping duty order on electrolytic manganese dioxide (``EMD'') from Japan. The reviews cover one manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United States, Tosoh Corporation (``TOSOH''), during the periods April 1, 1991, through March 31, 1992, April 1, 1992, through March 31, 1993. The Department has completed these reviews and has determined that respondent's dumping margin should be based on best information available (``BIA'') for the 1991&hyph;1992 and 1992&hyph;1993 reviews. The margin for this manufacturer/exporter is 77.43 percent for the 1991&hyph;1992 and 1992&hyph;1993 periods. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On April 13, 1994, and July 8, 1994, the Department published the Federal Register notices of the preliminary results of its administrative reviews for the periods April 1, 1992, through March 31, 1993 (59 FR 17511), and April 1, 1991, through March 31, 1992 (59 FR 35096), respectively. The Department gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received a comment from petitioners, Kerr-McGee Chemical Corporation and Chemetals Incorporated, on July 20, 1994, relating to the 1992&hyph;1993 review. TOSOH did not comment on either the 1991&hyph;1992 review or the 1992&hyph;1993 review. The Department has completed these reviews in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Scope of Reviews Imports covered by these reviews are shipments of electrolytic manganese dioxide. EMD is manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) that has been refined in an electrolysis process. During the review periods, such merchandise was classifiable under subheading 2820.10.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). The HTS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. On January 6, 1992, the Department published a final scope ruling, Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide from Japan; Final Scope Ruling (57 FR 395, January 6, 1992), in which it affirmed that high-grade chemical manganese dioxide (CMD&hyph;U) is a ``later-developed product'' and is included in the scope of the order on EMD from Japan. For a detailed discussion of that ruling, see Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide from Japan; Preliminary Scope Ruling (56 FR 56977, November 7, 1991). These reviews cover EMD sales to the United States by one manufacturer/exporter, TOSOH. Interested Party Comment Comment Petitioners request confirmation in the context of the 1992&hyph;1993 review that any subsequent review involving TOSOH's shipments of the subject merchandise will include an inquiry into the correct basis for U.S. prices of reviewed transactions. Specifically, petitioners request that the Department confirm that it will make a determination in a future review as to whether the price to test against fair value is TOSOH's price to its customer, Mitsubishi Corporation (``Mitsubishi''), or the price that Mitsubishi charges to its customer in the United States. DOC Position It is not appropriate for the Department to speculate on the resolution of issues that are not relevant to the instant proceeding. Although petitioners argued that Mitsubishi's prices to its customer should be the basis for U.S. price, this issue did not need to be addressed in the 1992&hyph;1993 proceeding because TOSOH did not participate. Whether, in subsequent review periods, the Department will examine TOSOH's relationship with Mitsubishi is a matter to be decided in those proceedings should the issue be raised. Final Results of the Reviews TOSOH declined to respond to section D of the Department's questionnaire in the 1991&hyph;1992 review. TOSOH also did not respond to any part of the Department's questionnaire in the 1992&hyph;1993 review. Pursuant to section 776(c) of the Act, whenever a company refuses to produce information requested or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation, the Department will use BIA. Because TOSOH refused, in both reviews, to respond to the Department's questionnaire, we consider it to be an uncooperative respondent. Our practice for uncooperative respondents is to apply as BIA the higher of (1) the highest of the rates found for any firm in the less-than-fair value (``LTFV'') investigation or prior administrative reviews, or (2) the highest rate found in the current review for any firm. See Final Results of Administrative Review: Antifriction Bearings (other than Tapered Roller Bearings) from France (58 FR 39729, 39739, July 26, 1993). Accordingly, for both reviews, we used as BIA the highest of the rates found for any firm in the original LTFV investigation: 77.43 percent (See Final Determination of the Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide from Japan (54 FR 8778, March 2, 1989)).
