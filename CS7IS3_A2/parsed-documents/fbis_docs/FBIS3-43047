Troyanova, Tayfun Scientific Production Association; UDC 551.510.41] [Abstract] Preliminary results of measurement of the total content and altitude concentration distribution of ozone are presented. Measurements were made from the Meteor-3 satellite with a BUFS-2 ultraviolet spectrometer. The information processing method is outlined, and simultaneous results obtained from the US TOMS ozone meter on the Meteor-3 are presented. The BUFS-2 instrument is a diffraction spectrometer with double monochromatization (dispersion subtraction) of the incident radiation. There are twelve spectral channels in the 255-340 nm range, with one channel at 388 nm in continuous operation. Ratios of atmospheric albedo are measured at a pair of wavelengths and compared with previously calculated values of these ratios for various ozone content figures. A figure contrasts ozone content findings from the BUFS-2 and the TOMS instruments for various latitudes. The Antarctic ozone hole is evident. Figures give the ozone concentration altitude distribution for Antarctica, the tropics, the middle latitudes, and the small ozone hole at 38.9N 111.5W formed by intrusion of a tropical air mass at the middle latitudes. Experimental data are contrasted with model data. The derivation of the model is described. Figures 3; table 1; references 16: 9 Russian, 7 Western.
