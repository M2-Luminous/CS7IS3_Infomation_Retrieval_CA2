Our Washington correspondent Arye Golan reports that although the atmosphere in the talks is good and positive, no agreements have yet been reached. Israeli sources said that part of the talks -- pertaining to the demarcation of the road from Jordan to Egypt via Israel -- may be relocated to the region. Israel claims that the marking and measuring work could be used to demarcate the border between the two countries, an issue which Jordan would like to tackle already at this point. It was further reported that the United States may be involved in the paving of this road.
