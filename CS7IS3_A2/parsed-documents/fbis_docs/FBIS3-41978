This announcement was made, quite unexpectedly, by Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella. This announcement constitutes a turnabout by the Peronist government in yet another traditional stance of Argentina's foreign policy, namely the reluctance to sign this treaty because it entailed a legal and political "inequality" between nuclear countries and nonnuclear ones. During an end-of-the-year toast with journalists, Di Tella tried to dampen the effects his announcement will trigger. "In our capacity as TNP members we will seek, in 1995, that nuclear powers disarm," he said in a matter-of-fact way. He thus produced an argument that goes against the historical stance of Argentine diplomacy, which had rejected the treaty on the grounds it was "the disarmament of those countries that have no [nuclear] weapons," according to what was officially reported. Taking stock of the results of the country's foreign policy this year, the foreign minister elaborated on "the new security policy." "We have implemented a security policy particularly based on the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, be they nuclear, chemical, or missile," he underscored following an aide-memoire that he himself had written to deliver the end-of-the-year speech, which nobody expected. He then enumerated some of the measures taken to abandon the Foreign Ministry's traditional positions in this area: -- "Our vocation for peace has led us to be totally open about the Argentine nuclear program by signing an all-encompassing agreement on safeguards with the International Atomic Energy Agency and furthering a joint nuclear policy with Brazil." Until democracy was reinstated in our country in 1983, the United States and other industrial countries suspected that our country had a secret nuclear program to develop the atomic bomb. -- "We have promoted agreements on the banning of chemical weapons, first at the regional level (the so-called Mendoza Declaration) and then at international level under the aegis of the United Nations." By virtue of the aforementioned declaration, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile committed themselves to renouncing chemical, bacteriological, or biological weapons. It has for time immemorial been surmised that Chile had developed chemical weapons in a clandestine way, but it has been denied by the current democratic Chilean Government. -- "Furthermore, we proposed amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty together with Brazil and Chile." Congress ratified this treaty on 11 November -- after waiting 25 years -- despite the Radical Party's opposition. The Tlatelolco Treaty establishes a nuclear-free zone in Latin America. The amendments Di Tella refers to have to do with the interest Argentina has in preserving its industrial secrets, like the method for processing enriched uranium developed by the National Commission for Atomic Energy (CNEA) at the Pilcaniyeu plant in Neuquen Province. -- "We also have discontinued the Condor-2 missile project and established the National Commission for Space Activities, which is in charge of retrofitting the Falda del Carmen plant (where the missile was developed) and developing satellites." Following infighting in its own party and a dispute with the Radicals, this administration dismantled the missile in 1991 and sent its components to the United States this year. It has not yet honored its promise to recycle the aforementioned plant into a technological research center for peaceful uses. Contradiction The unexpected announcement by Di Tella on 29 December contradicts his own remarks to CLARIN on 8 March 1982, when he announced that the government had decided to promote in Congress the Tlatelolco Treaty's ratification, but denied the country would sign the TNP. Argentina had signed the Tlatelolco Treaty, though its ratification by Congress still was pending until November, whereas it always refused to sign the TNP. Now the government will request signing the agreement and then will have to submit it to Congress for ratification so the treaty can take effect. What remains to be seen is the UCR's [Radical Civic Union] stance on this new and bold step taken by the government.
