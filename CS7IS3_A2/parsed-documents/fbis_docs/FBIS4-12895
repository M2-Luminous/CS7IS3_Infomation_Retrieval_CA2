FBIS4-12895 "drnes072_m_94005" FBIS-NES-94-072 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 JORDAN Hamas Operations Against Israel Said To Continue Hamas Operations Against Israel Said To Continue JN1404105394 Amman AL-DUSTUR in Arabic 14 Apr 94 pp 1, 22 JN1404105394 Amman AL-DUSTUR Arabic BFN ["Political Analysis" column by Mazin Hammad: "Two Out of Five"] [Text] It is unprecedented for an Israeli official like Yitzhaq Rabin to clearly state that there is no future for the settlements in the occupied territories. Here he is promising to remove the settlements within the framework of a final settlement. He would not have said this if it was not for the collapse of security Israel has been facing since the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre on 25 February. That massacre opened the doors of revenge in Palestine like never before. With bloody evidence, the massacre proved the impossibility of coexistence between Arabs and Jews on one territory. Rabin is fully aware of this result, which was in his mind when he told the settlers yesterday that eventually they will have to leave. The martyrdom operation in Hadera shook the faith of the settlers in the possibility of staying in the West Bank and Gaza and increased their motivation to pack their belongings and dismantle their settlements. The timing of this operation was well studied just like the timing of the 'Afula operation which was carried out by Hamas a week ago, killing 13 Israelis and wounding scores more. The first operation marked 40 days since the martyrs of Hebron. The second was carried out on Israeli Army day. It is noteworthy that Hamas had previously vowed to carry out five operations. This means that there are three operations on the way. Such operations not only remove the Israelis' sense of security, but also reveal the impossibility of controlling a decision by a movement such as Hamas to achieve martyrdom. Moreover, as Rabin and Peres said yesterday, it is impossible to seal the occupied territories when everyday, 10,000 cars come from the West bank and Gaza to Palestine of 1948. However, the more important question posed by the 'Afula and Hadera operations is whether Israel has learned its lesson and is now ready to achieve serious progress in the bilateral negotiations with the Palestinians and other Arab parties. It is totally clear that the Ibrahami Mosque massacre and the aforementioned operations would not have occurred if Israel had committed itself to starting withdrawal from "Gaza and Jericho First" on 13 December as scheduled and completing this withdrawal on 13 April; that is, yesterday. Will 1.7 million Palestinians remain the prisoners of a few thousand settlers, or must there be more martyrdom operations before Israel sees the road in front of it?!
