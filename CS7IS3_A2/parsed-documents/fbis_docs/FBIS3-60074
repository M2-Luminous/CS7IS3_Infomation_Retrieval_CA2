One of the country's most wanted men, Chavez arrived in Lima last night, 15 hours after he was captured and deported from Colombia. He was immediately taken to the Dirandro cells, where he will remain for 15 days under investigation, according to existing laws. It was reported no ad hoc prosecutor has been named to file the corresponding charges, although the drug trafficker has claimed innocence. Dirandro said Vaticano faces five summons on drug-trafficking charges. He will be presented to the media once the police investigation concludes.
