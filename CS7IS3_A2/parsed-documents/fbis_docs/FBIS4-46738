These questions are troubling the owners of checks. Citizens of the local administration are also asking them. Therefore, the mayor's office of Novosibirsk asked the Ministry of Finance of Russia for an explanation. The reply, signed by M. Chekurova, deputy director of the Securities Department of the Ministry of Finance of Russia, states: "In accordance with Decree No. 344 of the Government of the Russian Federation of 16 April 1994 'On State Debt Trade Obligations,' the Ministry of Finance, from 15 June 1994 to 1 June 1995, through the system of institutions of the Savings Bank of the Russian Federation, and other banks determined by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, will redeem 1990 non-interest- bearing bonds of state special-purpose loans from owners for appropriate domestically produced consumer commodities (except passenger cars) at existing consumer prices, and for passenger cars--based on 60 percent of the price determined by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, in coordination with plant manufacturers. "In a priority procedure, the indicated bonds will be redeemed from invalids and participants in the Great Patriotic War and invalids of the Armed Forces. "The procedure for the redemption of special-purpose loan bonds will be developed by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation together with the Savings Bank of the Russian Federation in the near future." As Tamara Aleksandrovna Lyubimets, deputy chairman of the Novosibirsk bank of the Savings Bank of Russia, reported to the editorial office at "Krasnyy Prospekt 34," if merchandise is issued for all trade bonds for all citizens from 1 July of this year to 1 June of 1995 (and only for invalids of the Armed Forces and participants of the Great Patriotic War--from 15 June), then the redemption of certificates, which ends according to the letter of the Savings Bank on 1 March, is extended to 31 December 1994. In addition, Tamara Aleksandrovna emphasized that the debts will be settled by the Savings Banks only on the condition of the payment of money for their accounts. The AKSB [expansion not identified] of the Russian Federation, not being the legal successor of the USSR Savings Bank, at the same time assumed settlements with the citizens for certificates, but it will make payment at the expense of resources of the federal budget allocated in 1994-1995 for these purposes.
