The visit has removed many obstacles in the path of expanding relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Kazakhstan. In his travels the Kazakh prime minister also visited Esfehan's steel mill and historic sites and travelled to the Kish free trade zone. The visits were aimed at familiarization with the actual and potential capacities for cooperation between the two countries in the fields of industry, trade, services, and communications and could lead to new fields for cooperation. The Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan is connected to Iran through the Caspian Sea but relations between the two people supercedes geographic borders because the two nations enjoy common historic sources of religion and culture, the roots of which are of great interest for Kazakhs. Now, following independence, Kazakhstan like other Central Asian republics has an opportunity to give new dimensions to these ancient ties and to expand them into economic and trade cooperation. Since Kazakhstan's independence the Islamic Republic of Iran, too, has welcomed and been a vanguard, together with other Central Asian Muslim republics, in improving various fields of cooperation, so that cooperation will be beneficial to both nations. Kazakhstan is among the republics which have great potential for cooperation with the Islamic republic of Iran in all fields. And this is also true for our country because both countries, as well as extraordinary underground riches, enjoy a strong and relatively matching industrial and trade infrastructure and could be close and reliable partners in special areas such as oil, transfer of energy, land-air-sea transportation, and industry. In this respect our country's geographic position as a bridge linking the Kazakhstan republic to free international waters is an important point. The agreements reached between the high-level Kazakh delegation and our country's political and economic officials cover many areas of cooperation. It is hoped that cooperation and ties between the two countries will enter a more advanced stage with the implementation of the plans for cooperation which have been the subject of the recent agreements.
