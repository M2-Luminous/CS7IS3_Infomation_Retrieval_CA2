It was 1900 hours and it was clear, as he admitted himself, that he still lacked all the information ("I am waiting to hear from [League's lower house floor leader] Maroni," he said.) But already he was banging his fist on the desk: "I will not sign this document, and if I do not sign it the League will not sign it, unless it adds that the next legislature will be a constituent one." Then late in the evening Maroni telephoned to clarify matters and to inform him that the demand had been accepted and that a sentence had been included in the document to state that the next will be a "constituent legislature." But apart from this clarification, it was apparent that Bossi is thinking about the repercussions within the movement, the many people who disagree with the negotiations and are unwilling to accept too much mediation, the hard-line League members who refuse to yield constituencies to unknown fellow travelers. First and foremost among these is Senator Miglio, who immediately dismissed the document: "The framework is national unity, which nobody is challenging; it seemed to me merely an electoral accord. It will be difficult to keep together everything and its opposite." Bossi was less skeptical.... [Passalacqua] What is your assessment of the document? [Bossi] Mine is a positive assessment, but.... [Passalacqua] But what? [Bossi] It confirms that there could be a shift toward something pseudo-federalist, that all the League's years of struggle in this field are having some impact. The document represents an understanding, a declaration that [Pact for Italy leader] Segni accepts a minor, superficial form of federalism. [Passalacqua] Is that not enough for you? [Bossi] It is not to be assumed that this document will guarantee the transition to the Second Republic. Only an overwhelming victory by the League in the North will guarantee the Second Republic. Only then will the situation inevitably change in a federalist direction. The League is not relinquishing political federalism. [Passalacqua] But what about its policy of alliances? [Bossi] We have the problem of whether to make a gesture of goodwill. For one thing, by joining a coalition the League is becoming a national political force. If we were to go it alone we would win everything in four or five regions North of the Po. But then we might be marginalized. If we become a national force, then the reform of the state will become a task for the entire country, including southern Italy. But this is a risky option, because according to my information, the major centers of power do not want a Second Republic. [Passalacqua] What do you like about the document? [Bossi] A number of things have been more or less copied from our programs. They have appropriated that which was ours, but they must remember that it was the League that made history. Looking at this document, you get the impression of an attempt to keep alive the principle of the citizens' economic equality -- a principle that constitutes a trap, because it leads to a rigid interventionist state. By focusing on federalism, however, the League is thinking about freedom. So the document represents a half-way stance. It can be interpreted in two ways. It depends on how it is interpreted at the right time. [Bossi ends] Bossi became more animated and cited his real precondition, the assertion that the next legislature will be a constituent one: "Otherwise I will not sign this document, and if do not sign it, neither will the League." [Passalacqua] But do you agree with putting forward Segni for the premiership? [Bossi] For the moment I do not agree with anything; first it must be signed, then.... The important thing is not the prime minister, but which political forces support him. [Passalacqua] Some people are saying that this document grants the initiative to Segni and [Italian People's Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli. [Bossi] The League has a large membership, who want a battle, who want a struggle, and who are ready for a fight. We must see whether this is a maneuver on Martinazzoli's part. There is a great difference between a warrior such as myself and a chicken thief such as Martinazzoli. We are prepared to continue the fight indefinitely. [Passalacqua] And what is Maroni doing negotiating in Rome, while you are here in Milan talking about battles? [Bossi] Mediators are there to mediate. But an adult decision must be made about what is to be done. There are several tendencies within the League, and I, being its founder, have worked to keep them together. In the North, the League is extremely strong. Never mind your opinion polls: We have an average of 45 percent on our own. Nobody can defeat us here. Even if [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto and [Fininvest President] Berlusconi get together, we can beat them with one hand tied. The accord must be reached with a realization that there can be no victory without us. And that change can only come about if the League scores an overwhelming victory in the North. [Passalacqua] Is this an appeal to the League supporters? [Bossi] It is not appeal; it is an analysis. I have never suffered any doubts or fears.
