FR940919-0-00153 FR940919-0-00017 Taking this information into consideration, as well as the actions discussed under factors A, C, D, and E in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section of this rule, the Service finds that the vernal pool fairy shrimp is not in imminent danger of extinction but is likely to become so in the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Designation of critical habitat for the vernal pool fairy shrimp, longhorn fairy shrimp, Conservancy fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp is not prudent at this time for the reasons discussed below. Critical Habitat Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at the same time the taxa are listed. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent for these species at this time. Because the three fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp face numerous anthropogenic threats (see Factor A in ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species''), the publication of precise maps and descriptions of critical habitat in the Federal Register would make these species more vulnerable to incidents of vandalism and, therefore, would contribute to the decline of these species. A number of sites inhabited by the four species occur on private land that is undergoing rapid urban and agricultural development. As documented above, some areas have been destroyed to eliminate vernal pool characteristics and escape regulatory jurisdiction by the Corps. The proper agencies have been notified concerning management requirements of these animals. Protection of the habitat of these species will be addressed through the recovery, section 7 consultation, and incidental take permitting processes. Federal involvement in areas where these animals occur can be identified without designation of critical habitat. Therefore, the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for these animals is not prudent at this time, because such designation likely would increase the degree of threat from vandalism or other human activities. Available Conservation Measures Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, local, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. Such actions are initiated following listing. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against taking are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. As described above, the U.S. Army Corps of engineers exerts section 404 jurisdiction over habitats supporting these animals. Nationwide permits are not valid where a federally listed endangered or threatened species would be affected by the proposed project. When listed species may be affected, formal consultation is required pursuant to section 7 of the Act before nationwide permits become effective. In addition, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) may insure housing loans in areas that presently support these animals; HUD actions regarding these loans also would be subject to review by the Service under section 7 of the Act. Other Federal agencies that possibly could be affected if these animals are listed include the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Agriculture (Farmers Home Administration), Veterans Administration, and the Department of Transportation (Federal Highways Administration). Populations of the longhorn fairy shrimp, vernal pool fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp occur on property owned by the Bureau of Land Management at the Carrizo Plain in San Luis Obispo County; and the U.S. Air Force at Castle Air Force Base, Mather Air Force Base, and Beale Air Force Base.
