This is a collective work specifically aimed at reflecting the historical development of Shanghai since the founding of New china. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "We should not only be good at destroying the old world but also at building a new world." The development of history has transformed, or is transforming, this maxim into fact. Since Shanghai was liberated in May 1949, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and with the vigorous support of various fraternal provinces and cities, we have, after more than 40 years of hard work, overcome difficulties and perils on our way forward and transformed the former semicolonial, semifeudal "paradise of adventurers" into a socialist new Shanghai full of vigor and vitality. In the course of building Shanghai into a new socialist city, what is most worthy of mention is the ten years since the introduction of reform and opening to the outside world. During these ten years, Shanghai, like the rest of the country, experienced one of the best periods for its economic and social development since the founding of the Chinese People's Republic of China. These are the main features of the period: Reform of the economic structure was carried out in an all-around way, giving rise to a pattern in which all sectors of the economy exist side by side on the premise of upholding socialist public ownership as the mainstay; great strides were made in opening to the outside world, and Shanghai's economy is marching into the world arena in the forms of utilizing foreign capital, importing technologies, running economic and technological development zones, exporting labor, and contracting projects overseas; significant progress was made in production and construction, and Shanghai's economic strength increased considerably with the completion of a number of key projects such as the Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex's first- and second-phase projects, Jinshan Petrochemical General Plant's second- and third-phased projects, Santana Sedan Factory's first-phased project, new railway passenger station, Yuejiang tunnel in Yanan East Road, [Yaohua-Pierjinton] Glass Plant, color picture tube plant, and cold-rolled sheet plant; in addition, projects under construction include a subway system, waste water treatment plant, the Nanpu bridge, the expansion of the Hongqiao airport, and installation of program-controlled telephones. These infrastructure facilities strengthened Shanghai's capacity to develop its economy and improve its appearance. A change took place in its industrial setup, and new progress was made in advancing technology. The ratio of the service industry rose from 21 percent in 1980 to around 30 percent. By transforming secondary industry, the ratio of technology-intensive enterprises rose to about 20 percent. Space, aviation, and sedan-manufacturing industries and other new generation of pillar industries are developing. The comprehensive functions of a city are beginning to show themselves. Even though the pattern of national income distribution has changed considerably, Shanghai still retained its lead in per capita income, in the realization of output value for every 100 yuan of fixed assets, and in delivering profits and taxes to the state. In terms of financial and foreign exchange matters, and in allocation of commodities, Shanghai has continued to make greater contributions to the state than other areas. At the same time, the people of Shanghai have significantly improved their material life, and they have made progress in education and culture and in building a spiritual civilization. These tremendous achievements have strengthened Shanghai's peoples' confidence in carrying forward the socialist modernization drive and enhanced their determination to overcome difficulties. Now, history has entered the last ten years of this century. Shanghai is now at a new starting line. In the middle and later parts of the 1980's, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council approved the "Outline of the Report on the Strategy for Developing Shanghai's Economy," the "General Urban Development Plan for Shanghai," and the "Report on Deepening Reform, Opening Wider to the Outside World, and Speeding up the Transformation of Shanghai's Economy into an Export-Oriented Economy." In April 1990, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council made the decision to develop Pudong and open it to the outside world, thus mapping out the direction for Shanghai's future development. In accordance with the guidelines of the Seventh Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee and the documents mentioned above, the 11th Plenary Session of the Fifth Shanghai CPC Committee, held in early January 1991, set the strategic guidelines and goals for Shanghai's economic and social development in the 1990's. They are as follows: Invigorating Shanghai, developing Pudong, serving the whole country, focusing on the world market; during the Eighth Five-Year Plan and the Ninth Five-Year Plan periods, efforts will be made to build Shanghai into an open, multifunctional, and socialist modern city with a rationalized industrial setup, advanced science and technology, and a high degree of spiritual civilization. When the proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation spent their Spring Festival of 1991 in Shanghai, they strongly affirmed these guidelines and goals. They encouraged Shanghai to do its work boldly, speedily, and successfully. To realize this glorious, great, yet arduous mission, we must earnestly implement the principles, tasks, and policies set by the Seventh Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee; undertake major reforms that directly affect the national economy, the people's lives, and economic development; focus on developing Shanghai's economy; and do our best to invigorate large- and medium state-owned enterprises. We must concentrate on building infrastructural facilities, especially the construction of housing to benefit the people, to satisfy them, and to inspire them. We should continue to deepen education on socialism, uphold the four cardinal principles, oppose bourgeois liberalization, improve party work style, build a clean government, rectify irregularities in various professions, and strive to do a good job in building a socialist spiritual civilization. We will train and bring up a contingent of cadres who have a firm political stand, adhere to Marxism and materialist dialectics, know their professions well, have a good work style, and advance and assume responsibilities boldly to lead the people of Shanghai to work hard in creating a better situation for Shanghai's construction and reform. In conclusion, I want to thank the comrades who worked arduously in editing and publishing this book.
