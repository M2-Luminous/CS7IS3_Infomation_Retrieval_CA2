In his words "it is essential to close off the routes by which these publications appear and, apart from this, establish who is financing and distributing them." S. Gryzunov noted that Roskompechat is enlisting representatives of the Moscow Antifascist Committee, journalists, as well as foreign diplomats from countries where the problem of neofascism has been encountered, in its work to expose papers of fascist orientation. "It is essential for us to work out our approach to state policy on this kind of publication," he said. He also noted that after those papers of fascist orientation existing in Russia have been exposed, a ban will be imposed on the publication of at least some of them. The mayor of Moscow has banned the sale of erotic literature on the capital's streets, having given orders to immediately regulate the distribution of such products. Yu. Luzhkov has given prefects one month to identify the commercial outlets on each's territory which might be used to sell these particular goods. [passage omitted]
