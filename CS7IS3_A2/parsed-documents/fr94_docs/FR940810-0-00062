FR940810-0-00062 FR940810-0-00021 OSHA is adding a definition for the term ``critical barriers'' whose use is required in certain asbestos operations. These are defined as plastic sheeting or equivalent material placed over openings to the work area. These barriers are effective when they seal all openings into a work area. Critical barriers can be other physical barriers sufficient to prevent airborne asbestos in a work area from migrating to an adjacent area. Disturbance OSHA has added a definition for ``disturbance'' to all three standards to distinguish it from removal. In this definition disturbance means any contact with ACM/PACM which releases fibers or which alters its position or arrangement. It also includes operations which disrupt the matrix or render it friable or which generate visible debris from it. A quantitative cutoff of disturbance is given_the amount of ACM/PACM so disturbed may not exceed the amount that can be contained within one standard sized glove bag or waste bag. OSHA believes that certain jobs, e.g., repairing leaking valves, often require asbestos to be cut away to gain access to a component. If the amount of asbestos so ``disturbed'' is contained in one bag, Class I precautions are not necessary. Glove Bag The term ``glove bag'' is also defined in the standards as a plastic bag-like enclosure affixed around ACM with glove-like appendages through which material and tools may be handled. Homogeneous Area The presumption that a material contains asbestos may be rebutted by sampling a ``homogeneous'' area of the presumed ACM to determine its asbestos content. OSHA has defined ``homogeneous area'' in much the same way it is defined by EPA as an area of surfacing material or thermal system insulation that is uniform in color and texture. Industrial Hygienist A definition for ``Industrial Hygienist'' is included in the standards as a professional person qualified by education, training, and experience to anticipate, recognize, evaluate and develop controls for occupational health hazards. Initial Exposure Assessment ``Initial Exposure Assessment,'' including ``Negative Initial Exposure Assessment'' are terms used in the construction and in the shipyard standards. It means a required assessment by a ``competent person'' concerning the exposure potential of a specific asbestos job, or series of similar asbestos jobs. A ``Negative Initial Exposure Assessment'' is such an assessment in which it is concluded that employee exposures during the job are likely to be consistently below the PELs. Assessments must be based on information and data which are allowed pursuant to criteria in paragraph (f). The results of ``Initial monitoring,'' no longer required for each job, should be considered, but do not necessarily constitute an adequate ``assessment'' if they would not represent all worst-case employee exposures during the entire job. Modification Alternatives or modifications to listed control methods are allowed when the employer demonstrates that such a ``modification'' still provides equivalent worker protection. OSHA does not intend that changes in a control method which decrease the safety margin of a material or omitting a procedure be permitted by calling it a ``modification.'' A ``modification'' means a changed or altered procedure, material which replaces a procedure, material or component of a required system. For example, a new test proven successful in detecting leaks might be substituted for required ``smoke tests.'' Omission of a procedure or component, or a reduction in the stringency or strength of a material or component is not considered a ``modification'' under this section. Presumed Asbestos-Containing Material (PACM) In all three standards, ``presumed asbestos containing material,'' ``PACM'' means thermal system insulation and sprayed on and/or troweled or otherwise applied surfacing material in buildings constructed no later than 1980. OSHA has found that these materials are ``high risk'' if asbestos-containing. OSHA bases this on the record, including the HEI Report which states that ``thermal system insulation and surface treatments (fireproofing, acoustical and decorative finishes) stand out in importance for their potential for fiber release and subsequent exposure to [building] occupants'' (Ex. 1&hyph;344, p. 4&hyph;5). Although these materials may have been installed in small quantities after 1980, OSHA finds that their installation is unlikely after that date. Project Designer OSHA has adopted a definition like that of EPA for a ``Project Designer''_ a person who has successfully completed the training requirements for an abatement project designer established by 40 USC 763.90(g). Removal ``Removal'' means all operations where ACM and/or PACM is removed from a building component, regardless of the reason for the removal. It includes those maintenance, repair, renovation and demolition activities where ACM and/or PACM removal is incidental to the primary reason for the project, as well as where removal of ACM and/or PACM is the primary reason for the project. Removal should be distinguished from ``disturbance'' which includes ``cutting away'' a small amount of ACM or PACM.
