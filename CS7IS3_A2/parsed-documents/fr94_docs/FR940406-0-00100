FR940406-0-00100 FR940406-0-00011 In summary, EPA has decided to implement ORVR controls for LDTs for several reasons: Their contribution to the VOC inventory is significant and there is a need for additional VOC reductions to address air quality concerns, the control is technologically feasible and inexpensive, there are additional valuable benefits, and, as discussed in the RIA, the cost effectiveness is very attractive, especially when compared to other programs being implemented and under consideration. The analysis shows that the cost effectiveness of implementing ORVR controls for LDTs is superior to retaining Stage II controls for the same purpose. The overall benefit to cost ratio for LDT ORVR is about 1.5. If the application of ORVR controls to LDVs and LDTs allows phaseout of Stage II controls in the future, the cost savings attributable to Stage II operations/ maintenance which would no longer occur would make the average annual costs of ORVR controls negative (an average annual savings of over $40 million). Based on the cost effectiveness analysis and benefit-cost ratio, one could also justify implementing LDT ORVR controls incremental to Stage II controls. However, the long-term retention of Stage II would seem problematic since it would be needed only for heavy-duty vehicles. 3. Heavy Duty Vehicles In the NPRM, EPA proposed to require ORVR controls for all HDVs. However, as discussed below, this requirement is not being finalized in this rulemaking. Information available to EPA indicates that an HDV ORVR system would be conceptually similar to those applied LDVs and LDTs and the initial costs should be relatively small. However, motor vehicle manufacturers have argued that the design and production of ORVR systems for HDVs would be considerably more difficult than for LDVs and LDTs. Commenters have maintained that the technological step from light-duty technology is greatest with regard to HDVs which have the largest fuel tanks and different fuel/vapor system component designs and configurations than many smaller LDTs. Comments regarding incomplete HDVs expressed concern that secondary manufacturers would improperly modify or incorrectly complete the vehicle fuel system (which is usually not fully installed for incomplete HDVs) and perhaps affect the proper function of the manufacturer-provided ORVR system. Concern was also expressed that secondary manufacturers might not have the expertise to correctly install the ORVR systems in all cases. In each case the primary manufacturer may have legal liability for potential problems. It is also worth noting that many HDVs are also produced by the primary manufacturer as an incomplete HDVs, perhaps compounding the concern. EPA recognizes the manufacturers' strong concerns about ORVR implementation issues that are unique to HDVs, and agrees that in many cases the application of ORVR controls to HDVs would be more difficult than for LDTs. Oftentimes the fuel and vapor control systems are differently configured than those on LDTs and the fuel tanks are larger and of different design. The large number of commercial applications for HDVs leads to a larger number of unique body/chassis designs (e.g., 12 passenger vans, crew cabs, long bed pick-ups, dual wheel axle trucks) and thus a larger number of different fuel system configurations. Another significant difference is that the engine in the HDV would be certified separate from the ORVR system and thus there are additional challenges in matching the canister purge provided by the engine with the needs of each ORVR system. The manufacturers' comments discussed above lay out the special concerns for incomplete HDVs, including potential legal liabilities for the primary manufacturer. Finally, it should be noted that unlike LDVs and LDTs EPA is not aware of any prototype ORVR-equipped HDVs. Given these concerns, the effort needed to implement LDV and LDT ORVR systems, the relatively small number of gasoline-fueled HDVs, and the fact that the application of ORVR standards to HDVs is discretionary, EPA is not finalizing the portion of the NPRM which applies to HDVs.
