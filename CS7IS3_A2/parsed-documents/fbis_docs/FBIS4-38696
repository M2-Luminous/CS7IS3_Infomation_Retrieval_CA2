Previously the general had been received by military aviators in Pskov, Ivanovo, and the Moscow region, where the guests were acquainted with our defense equipment since they want to cooperate for the sake of peace. Tver aviators also saw a thing or two in their country when they flew U.S. military aircraft a year ago. During the return visit the U.S. air aces put our MiG's and Su's "through their paces" -- and they flew like birds.
