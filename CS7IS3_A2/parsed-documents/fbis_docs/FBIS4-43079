Kiriakidhis] [Text] The American Embassy in Nicosia leaked the information carried by REUTER about President Glavkos Kliridhis' threat to resign if the Security Council proceeds with a decision to reinforce the confidence-building measures [CBM's] process. According to REUTER the threat is contained in the letters to U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister John Major. This is according to I MAKHI exclusive information which also reveals the negative role of former U.S. coordinator Robert Lamb. The same information notes that the American Embassy's action tried--initially--to have people think the leak emanated from the Cyprus Government in order to: FIRST: Be seen as a "bluff" by President Kliridhis with the same contents as the intentions and warning he conveyed to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher during their recent telephone conversation. (The National Council was briefed at its meeting last Wednesday on the telephone call which was made at Mr. Chrisopher's initiative.) SECOND: To weaken, through the publicity and dimensions that the issue would acquire, the dramatic tone, seriousness, developments, and President Kliridhis' categorical refusal to accept the continuation of talks on the CBM's. The same sources revealed to I MAKHI that the ultimate goal of this action was for the U.S. Government not to pay proper attention to the Kliridhis letter and to conceal the actions and recent handling by Robert Lamb and American Ambassador in Nicosia Richard Boucher. According to reliable information I MAKHI has, which leaves no room for doubt, the U.S. Government and the State Department are COMPLETELY UNAWARE [uppercase as published] of the ways Lamb and Boucher handled the issue and particularly of Lamb's proposals made in Vienna and the promises (which are outside the 21 March document) he gave "behind the backs" of the Greek Cypriot side and which Rauf Denktas now invokes and uses as a basis for the strengthening of the CBM's talks. Moreover, it is worth stressing that the UN secretary general's representatives also disagree strongly with Lamb's promises and they have expressed their strong displeasure at the way that Lamb handled the issue in Vienna and the current approach for the future course of the Cyprus issue. Meanwhile, there has not been any official reaction by the Cyprus Government to Kliridhis' threat to resign and call elections, as REUTER reported. Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis, despite repeated questions from journalists, neither denied nor confirmed the REUTER report. He confined himself to saying only that the contents of President Kliridhis' letters to the U.S. President and the British Prime Minister are confidential. Commenting on the insistence by the Americans and the British and their efforts to continue the CBM talks, a diplomatic source in Nicosia told I MAKHI that they are heading in this direction because it suits them since it gets them out of the difficult position they would be in if they followed the Butrus-Ghali options, by which they would be compelled to condemn Denktas and adopt measures against him. According to New York reports, during a press briefing, the UN secretary general's spokesmen Joe Sills and Fred Eckhard expressed the view that there are some hopeful signs, but they avoided specifying them, adding only that Mr. Gustave Feissel is continuing his consultations. Asked when the secretary general's new supplementary report will be issued, Mr. Eckhard said that he does not know what form the report will finally take (whether it will be a letter or some sort of report) but he revealed that another UN official Mr. Karekan [name as transliterated] told members of the Security Council that the secretary general will add to the 31 March report information concerning the most recent position of the Turkish Cypriot side.
