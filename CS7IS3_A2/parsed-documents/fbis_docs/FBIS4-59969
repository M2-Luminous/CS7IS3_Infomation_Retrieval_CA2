FBIS4-59969 "drnes097_o_94004" FBIS-NES-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 SYRIA Christopher's Damascus Visit Reported, Assessed Christopher's Damascus Visit Reported, Assessed Press Views Visit, Israeli Stand JN1905074194 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 19 May 94 JN1905074194 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Press review] [Text] Under the headline "Facts of the Peace Process Anew," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: During his reception of the U.S. secretary of state yesterday, leader al-Asad reemphasized several facts concerning Syria's position on the peace process. These facts are among the bases on which the Middle East peace process was established when Syria accepted this process and gave an opportunity for its launching through the Madrid conference. AL-BA'TH explains that among these facts is Syria's care for continuing the peace process and its appreciation of the U.S. efforts designed to achieve a just and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The paper asserts that achieving this objective is linked to the commitment to the bases and principles on which the peace process was established. This process emanates from the resolutions of both the United Nations and international legitimacy, led by the commitment to the land-for-peace principle. The paper holds Israel responsible for the stumbling bilateral negotiations. Israel has not ceased its attempts to circumvent the peace process, the paper says. These Israeli positions prove to everyone that Israel's acceptance of the peace initiative was formal in the first place. This acceptance also conceals intentions that reject a just solution. The paper points out that Israel always seeks to depart from the bases and substance of the peace process, and to shirk the commitment to the initiative which was accepted on the Arab, regional, and international levels. This was confirmed yesterday through the [Israeli] replies Christopher carried to Damascus. AL-BA'TH stresses that Israel is the only party that is undermining the peace initiative and threatening regional stability through intransigent positions and dictates that are not in harmony with the substance of the peace process. Concluding its comment, AL-BA'TH wonders: To what extent can Israel continue its refusal to respond to both the international community and the cosponsors of the peace conference? The near future, however, may answer this question. Under the headline "Israel Is Undermining the Peace Efforts," the newspaper TISHRIN says: After he was briefed on the outcome of Christopher's talks in Israel, President Hafiz al-Asad explained that differences between the Syrian and Israeli positions are wide and great because the Israeli side departed from the bases and requirements of the peace process. Discussing the Israeli positions based on intransigence and procrastination, the paper adds: The rulers of Israel have foiled all efforts designed to remove the peace talks from their deadlock. The paper explains that Syria worked for a real and substantial launching of the peace process, and also supported the U.S. Administration's efforts designed to place the peace process on the right path. TISHRIN continues: In brief, the Rabin government wants to annex the territories. Thus, this government's talk about peace is no more than a cheap maneuver designed to mislead world public opinion and create a false optimism that the peace process is achieving progress. The paper notes that Syria absolutely believes in peace and that it continues to make every possible effort to promote the peace process. The paper emphasizes that Syria adheres to regaining the entire Golan and other occupied territories and to Israel's withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 borders. It is not a Syrian tradition to sell out an iota of national soil or any Arab right. This is because peace should be just and comprehensive. TISHRIN points out that the proposed Israeli settlements are actually a consecration of occupation and an open disregard of both the Security Council resolutions and the international community's principles and charters. Concluding, TISHRIN says: Peace can be achieved by resorting to the international law and not by entrenching and spreading the law of the jungle. The rulers of Israel should realize that all their alleged peace plans would fail because Syria is the Arabs' conscience and also because the Arabs will only accept what Syria accepts. Under the headline "Complete Withdrawal First," the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: At a time when Syria showed full cooperation with both the U.S. initiative and efforts designed to promote the peace process in implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy, Israel showed much disregard of international principles, UN charters, and the legitimacy of the relevant UN resolutions rejecting the Israeli occupation. AL-THAWRAH adds: Despite the apparent future difficulties and traps facing the Cairo agreement and obstructing its implementation, it seems Israel has not yet learned the lesson that lame peace settlements cannot make a durable peace, that peace does not mean there is a winner or a loser, and that peace does not imply concluding cheap deals based on bargains. The paper says all observers have no difficulty in discovering that the real Israeli position is pushing the peace process toward numerous bargains, now that Israel has placed obstacles and demonstrated intransigence about this process. The paper explains that there is a great difference between someone who wants a complete, just, and comprehensive peace, and someone who wants to tamper with the components of such a peace, ridicules the resolutions of international legitimacy, and discounts the international will on the other. The paper adds: Christopher's regional tour has shown that differences [between Syria and Israel] are still wide because the Israeli position departs from the bases and requirements of the peace process launched in Madrid. AL-THAWRAH points out that Syria cares for the continuation of the peace process. As President Hafiz al-Asad asserted, the objective is to achieve a just and comprehensive solution in accordance with both the international resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. Concluding, AL-THAWRAH notes: As President al-Asad said, Syria adheres to the pillars of the peace process, which is based on the Security Council resolutions. These resolutions stipulate full Israeli withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 borders in order to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the region. Thus, complete Israeli withdrawal is the first and foremost priority under all circumstances.
