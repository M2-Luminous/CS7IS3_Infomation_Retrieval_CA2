The country's defense minister, Mr. Moven Mahachi, said today that Zimbabwe has already lined up a battalion of soldiers for duty in Liberia at the request of the United Nations but they will not be deployed unless more money is made available. Zimbabwe has troops with UN forces in Somalia and Mr. Mahachi said his government had learned from experience that the money available for the Liberian exercise was just not enough. He said America had put up 31 million dollars for Zimbabwean, Ugandan, and Tanzanian troops due to go to Liberia and argued that the United Nations should approach other countries for more funds. Ugandan and Tanzanian troops have already been sent to join a Nigerian-led peace-keeping force in Liberia under the terms of an accord signed between rival Liberian factions in July last year, to put an end to a brutal civil war that began in December 1989.
