"It is good that NATO is now sharpening its tone against the Bosnian Serbs. The threat of air attacks is a very sharp warning that the Serbs ought to take seriously," she said. "The situation has worsened in recent weeks. It is a natural frustration that is now being expressed by the NATO countries," she commented. Af Ugglas, the former chairwoman of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, would not say whether she believes the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's threat issued Tuesday at a summit in Brussels would be carried out to lift the siege on threatened areas in Bosnia. "That is a decision that must be taken by the UN's local military commanders and the UN secretary general," she concluded.
