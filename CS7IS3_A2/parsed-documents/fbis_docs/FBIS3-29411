"We agreed with each other about the mechanism, the framework, we would like to have to discuss this," the prince said after lengthy talks here with his Vietnamese counterpart. Other items on the agenda were the issue of Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia, trade facilities and customs regulations. "But I told my Vietnamese friends the border problem is the main problem," the prince said. The prince said he hoped further progress would be made when Vietnamese premier Vo Van Kiet visited Cambodia in March or April. Prince Sirivut said he told the Vietnamese side that the government was also aware of Hanoi's concern about the fate of thousands of ethnic Vietnamese who fled to the border between the two countries last April to escape a Khmer Rouge campaign of ethnic cleansing and have since been barred from re-entering Cambodia.
