"I should however say that the Yugoslav-Romanian relations have managed to maintain the well-known characteristics of traditional friendship, a high level of understanding, confidence, interest and readiness for collaboration. Obviously, in conditions of unjustified and inhuman sanctions which Romania too, has to observe, despite the tremendous damages it sustains, the concrete collaboration in the economy, and even in culture and sports, has recorded terrible losses. Suffice it to mention that the goods exchange between our countries before the sanctions stood at $500 million for the first half of 1992 and was showing an upward tendency. Many deals started together were stopped, but both parties are making efforts for the existing links not to be severed, and for waiting for the period after the embargo is lifted with ready documents and articulated ideas for the continuation of collaboration at high pace. I would mention one more important fact: Romania shows great readiness to get adequate approval from the sanctions committee to make humanitarian exports to Yugoslavia (food, medicines, raw materials for farm production, fuel for schools and hospitals' heating), which helps keeping the relations of friendship and a certain amount of trade. "The official Romanian visit by the foreign minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is yet another contribution to the continuity of the Yugoslav-Romanian top-level dialogue that has not been broken. I would only mention Romanian President Ion Iliescu's visit to Yugoslavia and the Bucharest visit by Yugoslav Prime Minister Kontic, both paid in the latter half of 1993. In this respect, as well as for the purpose of finding solutions to the Yugoslav crisis, in which Romania has proved understanding, flexibility and readiness to help settling the crisis and maintaining the stability in the area, the Yugoslav minister's visit has been a full success achieved at the fittest moment."
