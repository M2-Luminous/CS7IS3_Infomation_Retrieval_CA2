ACTION: Notice of intent to prepare a supplement to the Blackleaf Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a drilling proposal in the Blackleaf Gas Field, Teton County, Montana. SUMMARY: On January 20, 1994, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) received a Notice of Staking (NOS) for a proposed well in the Blackleaf Unit. The proposed well is located in northwestern Teton County about 25 miles northwest of Choteau, Montana. The NOS is the first step in the process and allows an operator to survey a location and access route to a proposed well. An Application for Permit to Drill (APD) including the subsurface plan (which details the drilling program) and the surface use plan (which describes any surface disturbances) will be submitted to BLM following an onsite inspection. Upon receipt of the APD, the BLM will analyze the proposal. DATES: A public scoping meeting has been scheduled for August 15th and 16th, 1994, in the American Room of the Heritage Inn, 1700 Fox Farm Road, in Great Falls, Montana. ADDRESS: Comments should be sent to Richard L. Hopkins, Area Manager, Great Falls Resource Area, 812 14th St. N., Great Falls, MT 59401, 406&hyph;727&hyph;0503. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tad Day, Great Falls Resource Area, 812 14th St. N., Great Falls, MT 59401, 406&hyph;727&hyph;0503. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The BLM issued a final Blackleaf EIS in June 1992 which analyzed the impacts of reasonably foreseeable oil and gas development activities in the Blackleaf Unit. A record of decision was not prepared, pending receipt of a proposal for oil and gas activity within the Blackleaf Unit. Upon completion of the analysis for the proposal, the BLM will issue a decision on the APD and the final Blackleaf EIS. Dated: July 1, 1994. David L. Mari, Lewistown District Manager.
