In Belarus, there are 16 such settlements that are to be handed over to various religious groups and the ICFB according to a government resolution. These organizations, with the help of investors and other sides that are involved in this process, should convert them into convalescent spas for people who suffered from the Chernobyl disaster, nursing homes, hotels, and other facilities. [Begin recording] Unidentified Reporter: Nikolay Nikolayevich, how will the ICFB carry out the conversion of military towns? Unidentified ICFB official: At a recently held ICFB conference, which was attended by all leading religious groups and officials of the nine ministries that support our work, a decision was adopted on the ICFB's participation in the conversion of military towns. A meeting with representatives of the Chernobyl Union -- which has already taken over some military towns -- showed that the Chernobyl Union supports this idea. A meeting between Ivan [name indistinct] and representatives of leading religious groups confirmed that the government agrees to hand over military towns to the ICFB and Belarus' leading religious groups. [end recording] To begin with, officials of the involved organizations will visit those facilities to inspect the buildings. Later, reconstruction and modernization of those facilities will begin, to ensure that military towns serve the people well. The idea is good, if only there are enough resources to implement it.
