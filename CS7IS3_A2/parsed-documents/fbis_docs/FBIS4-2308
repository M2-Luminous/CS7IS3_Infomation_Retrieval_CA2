They involved regulations set up by the Sino-Ukrainian Joint Government Committee on Trade Cooperation and a summary of that committee's first meeting. They were signed by the two chairmen He Guangyuan, minister for China's machine-building industry, and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valery Shmarov. The two sides exchanged views on the prospects of enlarging trade and technical cooperation between them and agreed that it is mutually complementary on an economic basis. They also suggested that the trade, at present mostly on a barter basis, should take on a new format which involves a combination of barter, cash transactions and a means of settling accounts in a third country. The two chairmen stressed that the joint committee has become a bridge for developing cooperation and decided that its second meeting will be held in Beijing next year. The Chinese delegation, which arrived in Kiev Sunday [3 April], will leave here for home Thursday.
