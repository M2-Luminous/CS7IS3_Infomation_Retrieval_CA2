FR941125-2-00003 FR941125-2-00002 UNITED STATES INFORMATION AGENCY Social Science Curriculum Development at Selected Central European Universities ACTION: Notice; Request for Proposals. SUMMARY: The Advising, Teaching, and Specialized Programs Division of the Office of Academic Programs of the United States Information Agency's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs announces an open competition for an assistance award. Public or private non-profit organizations meeting the provisions described in IRS regulation 501(c)(3) may apply to cooperate with USIA in the administration of Year One of a three to five-year project to support the development of instruction in the social sciences, especially political science and public policy analysis, at universities in Hungary, Poland, and Romania. The primary departments participating in the project are the Center for Public Affairs Studies at the Budapest University of Economic Sciences, Hungary; the Institute of Sociology at Warsaw University, Poland; and the Department of Political Science at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. In addition to supporting the development of programs at these core departments, the project will also enable scholars and students from other institutions in the region to participate in the programs to be based primarily in Warsaw, Budapest, and Cluj-Napoca. The project to be funded in Year One of this program may be implemented over a two-year period and will assist in the development and teaching of up-to-date Western university-level social science curricula. The rationale for the project is based on the expectation that after the students and faculty involved with this project are equipped to analyze social, political, and public policy issues in an empirically grounded manner, empirical research methods and analytical tools will increasingly inform public debate about these issues, and will encourage cooperation among scholars and public servants. The USIA solicits detailed proposals from U.S. educational institutions and public and private non-profit organizations to develop and administer a comprehensive range of exchange mechanisms and related activities, including assistance with curriculum and materials development and acquisition, and to identify and cooperate with appropriate U.S. departments and scholars in support of the project. The award to cooperate with the USIA on Year One of the project will be renewable for up to two additional fiscal years that may comprise up to four additional program years upon successful completion of Year One activity. Applicants should propose detailed, creative programs for all three countries for Year One of the project and should outline a strategy for the on-going assessment of Year One programs to determine program effectiveness and to facilitate the definition of programs for two additional fiscal years. The cooperation with USIA will include regular consultation with USIA and USIS field posts with regard to program implementation, direction, and assessment. Proposals should demonstrate both an understanding of the issues confronting central European universities and expertise in the teaching and practice of the social sciences in U.S. higher education, including graduate education. The funding authority for the program cited above is provided through the Support for East European Democracies Act (SEED). Programs and projects must conform with Agency requirements and guidelines outlined in the Application Package. USIA projects and programs are subject to the availability of funds.
