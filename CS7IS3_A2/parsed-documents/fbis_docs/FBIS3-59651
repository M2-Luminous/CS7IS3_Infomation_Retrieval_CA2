The objectives of that committee are to assess and predict the practical possibilities of future energy technologies that are seen as important, e.g., atomic energy, solar power, hydrogen power, and to get a grasp on how Japan's energy supply and demand will appear 60 years from now. The following is how the committee's report depicts Japan's energy situation in 2010. "The trend toward exhaustion of petroleum resources will be conspicuous, prices will rise, and those resources will be limited to noble uses such as for the chemical industry and transport." "There will be calls for conversion to other energy sources because the regulations on CO<inf> 2</inf> emissions will be strengthened to prevent global warming. And, CO<inf> 2</inf> recovery and processing will become more practical, though the costs will be high." "There will be more dependence on solar energy, which is a perpetual source of energy. Because of that, basic changes in urban social systems and lifestyles will be needed." "The development and utilization of renewable and clean energies will expand globally." "As for atomic energy, an optimal nuclear fuel utilization cycle involving new types of reactors will be established." "The practical use of humanity's most revolutionary energies (nuclear fusion, solar power generation in space) will become possible." As a result of those, the committee estimates that the primary energy supply in 2010 will consist of 15% new energies, 2-3% hydro power, 1% geothermal energy, 30-35% atomic energy, 15-17% natural gas power, and 13% petroleum energy. The total percentage of non-fossil-fuel energies is 55%. The key to that, however, is the "technology."
