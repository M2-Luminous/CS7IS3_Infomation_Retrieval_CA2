FBIS4-30904 "dreeu105__a94017" FBIS-EEU-94-105-A Daily Report 28 May 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Name Dispute Prevents Signing of Customs Accord Name Dispute Prevents Signing of Customs Accord AU3005082094 Prague CTK in English 1459 GMT 28 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU3005082094 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, May 27 (CTK) -- An agreement to facilitate customs clearance in the road, railway, and water transport between the Czech Republic and Germany has still not been concluded due to the German demand that Czech border communities bear their pre-war Sudeten German names in the agreement as well as the Czech ones, Miroslav Karnik from the Customs General Directorate, confirmed to CTK today. RUDE PRAVO, the left-orientated Czech daily, reported today that the fact that the Germans did not want to recognize agreements concluded between the former Czechoslovakia and East Germany was another problem preventing an agreement from being signed. Once these things were clarified and the agreement is signed it would be no problem for a Czech expert commission to agree with the Germans on everything that should be done to simplify customs clearance on the joint border, the paper wrote. Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik said on Thursday [26 May] that the absence of the agreement was the main cause of the kilometers- long lines of lorries forming daily at border crossings. He described the German demand that Czech villages also bear German names as a key obstacle hampering the conclusion of the agreement.
