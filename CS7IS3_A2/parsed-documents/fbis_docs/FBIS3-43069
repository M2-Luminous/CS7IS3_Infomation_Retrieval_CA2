Clinical residents are trained according to specialties specified in the existing ``List of medical specialties,'' and in accordance with the curriculum and syllabus for each specialty. According to the Russian Federation Law ``On Education,'' the mandatory minimum of the professional syllabus for a specific medical specialty is determined by the pertinent State standard. The syllabuses for clinical residency and curriculums are approved by the scientific councils of institutions that train clinical residents, and they are revised every 5 years, with consideration of changes in the State standard for educational minimum of professional syllabus for each specialty. 5. The Russian Federation Ministry of Health reserves the right to terminate physician training in the form of clinical residency in institutions where such work is not organized satisfactorily. 6. Clinical residency training takes place away from the main workplace. Training lasts 2 years. If the scientific council of the institution providing clinical resident training raises the question of extending clinical residency to 5 years, permission is granted by the Russian Federation Ministry of Health on an individual basis, depending on the specialty of training. Residencies start on 1 September. Clinical residency acceptance and training 1. Physicians participate in competitions to be accepted for clinical residency.
