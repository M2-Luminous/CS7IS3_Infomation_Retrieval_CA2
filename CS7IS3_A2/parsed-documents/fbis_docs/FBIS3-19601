In fact, not all the objectives set by the government are easily attainable and the impact of the economic crisis is weighing more heavily than expected. Pending publication of the quarterly figures, however, no one is hazarding to advance numbers, even if recourse to a new economic maneuver already appears inevitable. Yesterday both the ABI [Italian Bankers Association] and the European Commission confirmed that Italians will be called on to make certain sacrifices in 1994. But the choice of measures will fall to the government which will be formed after 27 March. The status of the public finances was set out on Tuesday [15 March] at Palazzo Chigi [government seat] where Auditor General Andrea Monorchio met Prime Minister Carlo Azegli Ciampi. Conversations focused on the quarterly report, which could be available as early as the beginning of next week, with very positive accounts thanks to Ciampi's belt-tightening on expenditures. The prime minister and the economics ministers have not fallen prey to easy enthusiasm. The first quarter's good performance, however, is only temporary and the benefits could be lost in the coming months. In fact, according to initial projections, there could be a shortfall of 5 trillion lire in the 1994 objective of 446 trillion in tax receipts, while the 10 trillion of "savings" which the Cassese package is supposed to bring about will be difficult to achieve. In short, the shortfall, as already underlined by the IMF, is likely to be on the order of 15 trillion, which will have to be through an ad hoc maneuver: due in part at least to the lower cuts achieved in spending. The ABI too confirms this supposition in its monthly report: For the banks, the failure to meet the budget deficit objective and the slow economic recovery make it impossible to contain 1994 requirements at 144 trillion. The path to be taken in order to get the public accounts back on track, is not, however, indicated, even if the new government will have very limited room for maneuver. Imposing new taxes is out of the question. Fiscal pressure, as the IMF itself has pointed out, is too high. The only measures which are open relate to the contents of public expenditures, and in particular, the revision of the resources earmarked for social security. A decision which is considered unpopular and not pursuable in tight times. The need for a new public finance measure is not, however, viewed with particular concern by the European Union. "Italy's public accounts are on the right track: There should not be particular problems in the granting of the third installment of the Community's 8 billion ECU balance of payments loan, Giovanni Ravasio, the Commission's Director General of Economic Affairs explained. "For the granting of the third installment of the loan we have agreed with the Italian Government that we will examine the situation in April- May. Once the accounts for the first three months of the year are known," Ravasio continued, "we will assess whether, and to what extent, it will be necessary to rebalance the public accounts in order to attain the objectives already agreed between the Community and the Italian Government". He added that "it may be that some adjustment will be necessary, but it will be a totally bearable one, within the reach of the government and citizens." The Commission will also have to assess the effect of the recession on tax receipts. "From the first, partial indications available to us," the Commission's director general for economic affairs went on, "it would appear that the situation has not become worse. Therefore, I believe that achieving the planned target is within the government's capacity. The data on the deficit, for the first months of the year, are better than forecast. We do not yet have the details, and we cannot, for the time being, attribute this improvement with certainty to improved receipts or to a slowing down of public expenditure." The year 1993 also closed with an improvement: The deficit amounted to 153,539 billion compared with a requirement of 158,840 billion in 1992, calculated according to the new version which excludes public agencies which have been converted into limited liability companies. At the end of the financial year, the tax offices recorded final receipts of 510,630 billion, compared with final expenditure of 650,180 billion, with a net balance to be financed of 148,550 billion. To this must be added a 4,989 billion deficit relating to treasury management operations.
