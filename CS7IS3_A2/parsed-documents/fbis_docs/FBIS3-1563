Discussions are expected to focus on inspection of Taiwan's software exports and proposed revisions to the trademark and patent law, according to Lin Yi-fu, head of the Taipei negotiating team and deputy director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade. Lin said that Taipei will explain to the U.S. side the measures it has been taking and the results of its efforts on IPR protection. Taiwan has invested a lot of money and manpower in implementing a software export inspection system at the request of the U.S., he said, but the inspection operation has inconvenienced Taiwan software exporters and benefited only a few American software makers. Lin said he will call for the termination of the inspection operation during the talks. Meanwhile, Economics Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang noted that the U.S. is expected to review its special 301 priority watch list at the end of March and the talks offer Taiwan a chance to try to relieve the imminent threat of U.S. sanctions. Chiang said that Taiwan has performed well on the IPR issue and should be removed from the priority watch list. He added that his ministry and concerned government departments have prepared a "position paper," which details Taiwan's efforts and results toward IPR protection over the past one year, to persuade the U.S. to remove it from the list. But Economics Ministry officials are not so optimistic about Taiwan's full removal from the list. However, they said it may be possible for Taiwan to be downgraded from the special 301 priority watch list to the watch list.
