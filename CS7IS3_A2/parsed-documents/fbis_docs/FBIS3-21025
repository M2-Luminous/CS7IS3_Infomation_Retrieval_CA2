The National Center for Space Studies (CNES) will act as chief contractor for the device, which has been dubbed Vegetation. The Earth observation satellite Spot-4 is expected to be placed into orbit around mid-1997. The French space agency announced that the European Commission and the CNES 1 had signed an agreement to allocate 16 million ecus to the French agency for the program on 17 January in Paris. Besides the European Commission, France, Belgium, Sweden, and Italy will team up on the project, for which Aerospatiale (France) has been selected as chief industrial contractor in charge of instrument payload. Europe expects to finance 50 percent of the cost of the Vegetation program, including manufacture of the instrument and construction of an image-processing center. According to the CNES, the Commission already plans "an additional funding package." The CNES directed construction of the first three Spot satellites, in partnership with Belgium and Sweden. Spot-3 was placed in orbit last 26 September. Footnotes 1. Represented by Mssrs.
