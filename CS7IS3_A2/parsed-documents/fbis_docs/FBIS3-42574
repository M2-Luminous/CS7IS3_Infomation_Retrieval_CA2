The Russian State Customs Committee [GTK] issued an Instruction No. 553 "On Temporary Urgent Measures Regarding Implementation of the Government Decree." And although a concrete mechanism of its implementation is still under development, according to this customs document, new rules for moving goods and means of transportation by individuals, in the part of value quotas and amount of duties, were introduced on 1 January. As we were told in the Customs Committee, the new rules so far do not extend to those who left for abroad before 31 December. Nevertheless, it is expected that the new rules will begin to apply to their full extent in February, and therefore we believe that it would be useful to learn about its basic provisions and to prepare for possible consequences of the upcoming innovations. First of all, while reducing the value quota of duty-free importation of goods by private parties from $5,000 to $2,000, the government set a single rate of custom duties for individuals in an amount equal to 60 percent of the customs value of imported goods. Duties at this rate will be applied only to amounts exceeding $2,000. This measure undoubtedly is aimed first and foremost against "shuttle" business and is quite justified from the standpoint of replenishing the state budget, since the main flow of goods comes into the Russian market precisely through these uncontrolled private imports. Nevertheless, people who have nothing to do with commercial imports may fall under this "shuttle" category, while customs officials get another source of income. The point is that a customs official is a person vested with the power to determine for what purpose an item is being brought in and to agree with the declared customs value--which, as is known, in a number of instances may differ considerably from base prices used by the customs (catalog prices of leading Western companies). The greatest troubles are in store for foreign car lovers. In order to bring in a new car duty-free, one now has to have spent at least six months abroad. However, if the engine displacement volume is greater than 1,800 cubic centimeters, there is a mandatory duty of 5 ECU per 1 cubic centimeter of engine displacement value. Also, an automobile is considered new if it is less than one year old or has a mileage of less than 20,000 km. As Vladimir Chuvayev, chief of the GTK's nontrade turnover customs control department, explained to KOMMERSANT, when cars with lesser displacement value are brought in, the terms of import depend only on the length of the individual's uninterrupted stay abroad. According to the GTK's official version, the new customs barrier will facilitate combating illegal and semilegal import of foreign cars, since in the past "gray" importers paid a considerably smaller customs duty than official dealers of foreign companies. Now this difference will disappear. KOMMERSANT experts believe, however, that new duties are a strictly fiscal measure. As to foreign car dealerships' retail prices, in their opinion, for automobiles with more than a 2-liter engine alone it will almost double. Another blow will be dealt to sales of foreign cars.
