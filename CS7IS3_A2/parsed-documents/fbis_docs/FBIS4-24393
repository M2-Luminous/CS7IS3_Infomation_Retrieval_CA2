He urged all localities and departments to put inspection work high on the agenda and try to achieve practical results. Zou Jiahua said: In light of the guiding spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress concerning resolutely combating fraud and proneness to boasting and exaggeration and striving to improve the work of statistical and administrative supervision and auditing supervision, the State Statistical Bureau, the Supervision Ministry, and the Legislative Affairs Bureau are launching a nationwide inspection of the Statistics Law enforcement. The inspection drive is important to correcting the party's work style and guaranteeing the state's scientific decision-making and modern management. Meanwhile, the inspection drive also plays an important role in strengthening the building of the Statistics Law system and in pushing forward the reform of statistics work. Zou Jiahua continued: Since the promulgation of the Statistics Law, China has achieved great results in statistics work over the past 10 years and more. Meanwhile, we should have a clear understanding of the existing problems. At present, phenomena such as being late in filing statistics reports or refusing to file them at all are very flagrant. The practices of boasting, exaggeration, and fraud, mainly caused by the changes of the interest pattern, begin to emerge in some localities and units and become very serious in some localities. Resolute efforts should be made to stop such behaviors. Otherwise, these practices will lead to incorrect statistical data, which in turn will cause the state to make wrong macroeconomic decisions and bring about serious consequences to economic development. Zou Jiahua said: While carrying out this inspection, first of all, localities and departments should make great efforts to strengthen the educational campaign to publicize and enforce the Statistics Law. Any one, including party and government leaders whose jobs are related to statistics work, should learn, understand, conscientiously observe, and strictly carry out the Statistics Law. While carrying out this inspection, we should conduct a thoroughgoing investigation of the new situations and problems in implementing the Statistics Law and sum them up. Great efforts should be made to amend the law to improve the statistics legal system. It is necessary to conscientiously sum up practical experiences at home and boldly borrow foreign countries' successful practices. We should strive to be specific and concrete in setting up our statistics requirements. In this way, we can establish a supervision and control mechanics that will enable us to guide, push forward, and guarantee the smooth progress of the statistics work reform to prevent and eradicate the corruptive phenomena of artificially imposed obstacles and frauds. Zou Jiahua stressed: The following people will be severely punished--anyone who refuses to perform statistics obligations, who is late in reporting statistics data or refuses to report statistics data, who files incorrect statistics data, who fabricates or changes statistics data, who forces or incites statistics organizations or personnel to practice fraud in statistics data, who fabricates statistics data to cover up serious mistakes or fish for honor, position, or other personal objectives, who brings about losses or bad consequences to the interests of the state and the people, who retaliates against those who dare to adhere to the principle and expose violators of the Statistics Law, and who obstructs those who conduct investigations on illegal statistics practices. If a case is particularly severe, it will be exposed in the newspapers. We should ensure that whenever a wrong practice is dealt with, all the people will learn from it.
