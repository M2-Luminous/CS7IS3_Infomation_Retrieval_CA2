The Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) and the government headed by President Ramiro De Leon Carpio will continue to discuss the topic of human rights at a meeting scheduled for the second half of February. Sources close to the negotiations told NOTIMEX that the delegations agreed to restart the discussion of the agenda of Mexico, which contains substantive and operative topics whose discussion precedes the signing of a peace agreement. The agenda includes the analysis of substantive topics such as the human rights situation, economic-social and technical-cultural aspects, the problem of land ownership, displaced population, and the constitutional reforms. The operative topics regard the cease-fire, the demobilization of the rebels, and their integration into legal life, according to the same sources. The parts also agreed to ask the Episcopal Conference to appoint Rodolfo Quezada, bishop of Zacapa, as president of an assembly of civilian sectors that would ratify all the agreements reached by the government and guerrillas. Another one of the agreements reached today was the appointment of UN representative Jean Arnault as coordinator of the five days of discussions and mediator and overseer of the negotiation process. The URNG and the Guatemalan Government began on 6 January at a hotel in the Mexican capital preliminary meetings convoked by the United Nations to discuss and frame agreement to allow restarting the peace negotiations. The signing of the agreement is scheduled for 1230 local (1830 GMT) on 10 January. The Government Commission was headed by Hector Rosada and was made up by Antonio Gonzalez Taracena, deputy chief of staff of the Army; Victor Argueta, commander of the "Honor Guard" military base; and Victor Ventura, director of the technical school. The Government Commission also included Maximiliano Kestler, Mario Permuth, Antonio Arenales, and Victor Viteri. The URNG delegation was made up by Commanders Pablo Monsanto, Gaspar Ilom, and Rolando Moran, as well as members of the Political-Diplomatic Commission: Luis Becker, Miguel Angel Sandoval, and adviser Vinicio Castaneda. UN Under Secretary General Marrack Goulding also participated in the discussions.
