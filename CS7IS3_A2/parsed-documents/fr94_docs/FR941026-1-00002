SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 106(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 1972) generally prohibits a bank from tying a product or service to another product or service offered by the bank or by any of its affiliates. 1 A bank engages in a tie for purposes of section 106 by: (1) offering a discount on a product or service (the ``tying product'') on the condition that the customer obtain some additional product or service (the ``tied product'') from the bank or from any of its affiliates; or (2) allowing the purchase of a product or service only if the customer purchases another product or service from the bank or from any of its affiliates. Violations of section 106 can be addressed by the Board through an enforcement action, by the Department of Justice through a request for an injunction, or by a customer or other party through an action for damages. 12 U.S.C. 1972, 1973, and 1975. 1 Although section 106 applies only when a bank offers the tying product, the Board in 1971 extended the same restrictions to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. See 12 CFR 225.7(a). Section 106 contains an explicit exception (the ``statutory traditional bank product exception'') that permits a bank to tie a product or service to a loan, discount, deposit, or trust service offered by that bank. The Board has recently extended this exception by providing that a bank or any of its affiliates also may vary the consideration for a traditional bank product on condition that the customer obtain another traditional bank product from an affiliate (the ``regulatory traditional bank product exception''). 2 2 See 12 CFR 225.7(b)(2). Section 106 authorizes the Board to grant exceptions to its restrictions by regulation or order. On October 19, 1994, the Board granted an exemption permitting the subsidiary banks of Fleet Financial Group, Inc., Providence, Rhode Island (Fleet) to offer a discount on the monthly service fee charged for the ``Fleet One Account'' to a customer who maintains a combined minimum balance of $10,000 in one or more products selected by the customer from a menu of eligible Fleet products. The Board decided that, to the extent that Fleet's combined-balance discount was prohibited by section 106, an exemption was warranted given the public benefits and absence of anti-competitive concerns generated by the arrangement. The Fleet One Account provides a customer, for a $14 monthly fee, discounts and premiums on various Fleet services, such as free checking and lower installment loan rates. Under the Board's order, Fleet may waive the $14 fee for any customer who maintains a $10,000 combined balance among the following eligible products: (1) deposits and certain loans at the Fleet bank at which the customer establishes the Fleet One Account; 3 (2) credit card balances at a Fleet bank; (3) investment securities held at Fleet's brokerage subsidiary and (4) shares held in a family of mutual funds advised by a Fleet subsidiary. All products offered as part of these arrangements are separately available to customers at competitive prices. 3 These products include: checking, savings, cash reserve and sweep accounts; certificates of deposit; installment and home equity lines of credit and certain loans. Proposed Rule The Board is proposing to use its statutory authority to grant a regulatory exception to section 106 for combined-balance discount arrangements akin to that offered by Fleet. The Board is proposing the exception in order to provide certainty as to the general permissibility of combined-balance discounts, and because it believes that such discounts are pro-consumer and not anti-competitive.
