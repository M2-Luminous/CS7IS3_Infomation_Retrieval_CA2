FR940728-2-00017 FR940728-2-00012 Minority Business Development Agency MEGA Center Applications: Chicago, Illinois AGENCY: Minority Business Development Agency. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting competitive applications to operate its Chicago Minority Enterprise Growth Assistance (MEGA) Center. The purpose of the MEGA Center is to provide integrated business development services to minority entrepreneurs in geographic areas containing high concentrations of minority individuals and businesses. In addition to basic business assistance services, the center will provide specialized assistance in the areas of Construction Assistance and Bonding, Capital Development, Franchise Development, International Trade and Tourism Development. Each one of these specialized business areas are considered functional components, and serve as integral parts of the center. The MEGA Center is, therefore, equipped to meet the more complex business needs of the minority business community. This, in turn, is expected to create growing and more profitable ventures resulting in increased job opportunities. DATES: The closing date for applications is September 6, 1994. Applications must be RECEIVED on or before September 6, 1994. Anticipated processing time of this award is 120 days. A pre-application conference will be held on August 12, 1994 at 9:30 a.m. in the Palmer House Hilton, 17 East Monroe Street, Chicago, Illinois. ADDRESSES: Chicago Regional Office, 55 E. Monroe Street, suite 1406, Chicago, Illinois 60603. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, CONTACT: David Vega, Regional Director, (312) 353&hyph;0182. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Contingent upon the availability of Federal funds, the cost of performance for the first budget period (15 months) from January 1, 1995 through March 31, 1996 is $1,343,158 in Federal funds and a minimum of $237,028 (15%) in non-federal (cost-sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $1,580,186. Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions, or combinations thereof. The Chicago MEGA Center will provide service in the Chicago Metropolitan Area with selected services throughout the States of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Wisconsin. The award number of this MEGA Center will be 05&hyph;10&hyph;95002&hyph;01. The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions. Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: Applicant capability in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included in the application (25 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for funding. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award. The MEGA Center shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To assist in this effort, the MEGA Center may choose to charge client fees for business services rendered. Fees for assistance rendered under the Basic Service Component of the MEGA Center range from $10.00 to $60.00 per hour based on the size of the client's business. Fees for assistance under the Market-Specialized Service Components of the MEGA Center may be based on a portion of the current market rate for such services. If an application is selected for funding, MBDA has no obligation to provide any additional future funding in connection with that award. Renewal of an award to increase funding or extend the period of performance is at the total discretion of MBDA. Executive order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' is not applicable to this program.

Pre-Award Activities_ Applicants are hereby notified that if they incur any costs prior to an award being made, they do so solely at their own risk of not being reimbursed by the Government. Notwithstanding any verbal assurance that an applicant may have received, there is no obligation on the part of the Department of Commerce to cover pre-award costs. Recipients and subrecipients are subject to all Federal laws, and Federal and Departmental regulations, policies, and procedures applicable to Federal financial assistance awards. Delinquent Federal Debts_ No award of Federal funds shall be made to an applicant who has an outstanding delinquent Federal debt until either the delinquent account is paid in full, a negotiated repayment schedule is established and at least one payment is received, or other arrangements satisfactory to the Department of Commerce are made.

Name checks are intended to reveal if any key individuals associated with the applicant have been convicted of or are presently facing criminal charges such as fraud, theft, perjury or other matters which significantly reflect on the applicant's management honesty or financial integrity. Award Termination_ The Departmental Grants Officer may terminate any cooperative agreement in whole or in part at any time before the date of completion whenever it is determined that the award recipient has failed to comply with the conditions of the cooperative agreement. Examples of some of the conditions which can cause termination are failure to meet cost-sharing requirements; unsatisfactory performance of the MEGA Center work requirements; and reporting inaccurate or inflated claims of client assistance. Such inaccurate or inflated claims may be deemed illegal and punishable by law.
