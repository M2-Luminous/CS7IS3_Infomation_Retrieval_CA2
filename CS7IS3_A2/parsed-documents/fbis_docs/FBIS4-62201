What is your view on the prospects for such an opening? [Widacki] The signing of the bilateral treaty was an important moment in the relations between our two countries. However, this was not some unexpected event, but the result of extensive preparatory work. I suppose that the signing of this treaty will be followed by a more rapid and broader development of ties. The treaty ends period and begins a qualitatively new one in our relations. It raises our ties to the European and world levels. In view of the new relations, one should not think about the past -- mutual injustice and postwar grudges. Neither France nor England, or Germany think about them. Otherwise today we would not have either the European Union or other structures of this continent. I repeat once again that the treaty must close the past. One must look to the future. By signing this document, both parties demonstrated their maturity to join the Union. I believe that West Europe has realized this. [Vinickas] Signed agreements are normally subject to ratification. What procedure does Poland have in this respect? [Widacki] If we seek to sign an agreement, we also want to ratify it. Each government wants this to occur as soon as possible. According to the Small Constitution in Poland, bilateral treaties are ratified by the president, and the fact is publicized. The Polish Sejm ratifies those agreements, which require amendments in the law, or which entail financial changes. [passage omitted] Poland does not see any obstacles, and if it becomes clear that Lithuania is ready to ratify the treaty, this will be promptly accomplished in Poland. There is no threat that the president will not ratify a treaty, which he himself has signed. [Vinickas] Both Poland and Lithuania have people who opposed the treaty before the signing without knowing its contents. What would you tell those people now? [Widacki] I think that these people speak the same language on both sides, and they need one another. Since they criticized the treaty without reading it, I propose that they read it very attentively. I am convinced that people who opposed this treaty will change their mind after reading it. I also believe, however, that someone will try to discern things that are not there. We already know the interpretation of one Lithuanian politician [reference to Center Movement leader R. Ozolas] that the treaty empowers us to return the former property of Polish social organizations. However, the treaty does say a word about this. He read what was not written.... I think that this is a psychological phenomenon. [Vinickas] The situation at the Polish-Lithuanian border is like laughter through tears. So much has been written and said about it.... Do you expect the situation to improve anytime soon? [Widacki] [passage omitted] It is difficult to say today whether it will be easier to cross the border, let us say, beginning in September. I think that the large flow of people is linked with a difference in prices between our countries. A few years ago, people would bring various goods from Lithuania to Poland, sell them there, and return with dollars in their pockets. The situation seems to have changed today: They are going to Poland with dollars for shopping. I suppose that when prices become equal, there will be fewer traders, who currently constitute the majority of people crossing the border. The crossing points may even be overly large in the future. There are two border check points for cars and one for trains on our 100-km-long border -- such is its approximate length. No other border of this length has so many crossings. This situation is unnatural from the economic viewpoint. [Vinickas] While on a visit to Lithuania, President L. Walesa evaded any comments on the current situation in Poland. A general strike was announced immediately after his return home. Even today (the interview was conducted on 2 May -- G.V.), the situations seems to remain serious. Could you comment on this? [Widacki] Reform and all changes demand that society express its wishes and attitudes. Society must pay some price for the introduction of market relations and changes. How can one introduce market relations and protect the community against their painful effects at the same time? One must find the golden mean between economic requirements and social needs. From the economic point of view, it is clear that a mine or, let us say, a foundry must be closed down. However, what do thousands of workers have to do? One must find the golden mean. While searching for it, one commits many mistakes and applies improper methods which lead to strikes. [passage omitted]
