The recently-completed report on Taiwan's foreign trade outlook for 1994 said the performance of the Japanese yen will be the major factor affecting Taiwan's exports to Japan. The report estimated that the value of Japanese yen against the greenback this year will drop to 119:1, benefiting Japanese exporters. The large-scale appreciation of the Japanese yen last year boosted Taiwan exports by encouraging Japanese traders in Taiwan to re-export their Taiwan-made products to Japan. The appreciation also resulted in more OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturing) orders here. The report said its predictions for a depreciation of the Japanese yen were based on improvements in the US economy and large- scale public expenditures by the Japanese Government. In addition, the report noted that there is no more room for further appreciation of the yen after the mass relocation of Japanese industries last year. Any depreciation in the yen will not be good for Taiwan exports, but expected depreciations will be countered by an estimated 1.6 percent real-term economic growth rate and recovery in the Japanese economy by the middle of the year, the report said. The report concluded that Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan is expected to increase 11.43 percent to US$15.846 billion in 1994, up from US$14.22 billion in 1993.
