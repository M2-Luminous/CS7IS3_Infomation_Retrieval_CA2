Here are the most important themes of the speech: The treaty with the Republic of Lithuania signed by President Lech Walesa closed a fundamental stage of Polish foreign policy devoted to establishing the foundations for partnership relations with neighbors and to defining the strategic goals of the foreign policy of the sovereign Polish Republic. We can be satisfied with the results achieved. There are no foreign troops in Poland--a rare fact in the history of the past 300 years. We are the only country under transformation that has concluded treaties on good-neighborly cooperation with all of our neighbors. (...) Poland is also a country of agreement between all serious political forces and in public opinion on the basic goals of foreign policy. We owe appreciation to the authors of these important achievements, in particular to my predecessor, Professor Krzysztof Skubiszewski. We are building our place in the world on the solid foundations created by them. It is worth recalling the guiding principles of our foreign policy. The efforts of our diplomacy focus on activities serving people and the good of individuals. There is clarity in the policy and of the concrete actions taken within its framework. The government has no monopoly on activity abroad, and neither has the state. (All centers of power--the president, the government, and parliament--take part in its creation and implementation. The openness of our state and society makes politicians, self-government activists, and ordinary citizens participate every day in this activity.) The policy, determined in a normal democratic process--that is, with the participation of the parties--is implemented in a supraparty manner (we require diplomats to represent the state and its goals and not give party interests or personal views). Foreign policy, as any other, has to be coherent (it means, among other things, the need for close coordination of actions by various state bodies and institutions). Our policy strictly observes modern international standards, in particular the respect for identity, aspirations, and views of other states. We are conducting a friendly policy, well-disposed to everybody who does the same. The most important task of our foreign policy is to ensure lasting security for Poland. We are doing so by developing good relations with all of our neighbors and by rapprochement with Euro- Atlantic security structures. Every day we are hosting in Poland, legally and illegally, hundreds of thousands of Russian, Ukrainian, and other seasonal workers, tradesmen, and tourists. They argue with Poles about wages, prices, and the quality of goods. Despite such great movements of people, we have not noted any incidents aimed at Russia. Miracle? Yes, it is a miracle of normality. I am convinced that, at the basis of this peaceful atmosphere in human relations, there is a feeling among Poles that now they are hosts in their own country, and, as such, they are able to welcome all guests, including those who only recently symbolized imperial violence and dictatorship. (...) By increasing contacts and proposals of joint practical actions, we are telling all of our neighbors: We are ready to become friends, we are aiming at being related by a net of agreements and projects that will ensure the free movement of people, information, goods, services, and capital. (...) Poland and Germany are good neighbors. We are looking with confidence at democratic and European Germany. This good-neighborliness should transform into a friendship. A firm friendship is still the aim. If we are to have any mission, this should be it because friendship between Poles and Germans will mean that an important source of potential conflict in Europe will be eliminated. This is a course worth pursuing. We see the path to friendship in uniting Poles and Germans in the same commonwealth of nations, in the European Union [EU], and in making us partners in joint projects, similar to French-German reconciliation. This aim dominates our political dialogue. A particular form of this is the Paris-Bonn-Warsaw cooperation, the so-called Weimar triangle. We are placing a great deal of importance in developing this cooperation by intensification of a dialogue, as well as by its broadening and move from diplomacy to parliament and into sector problems and, finally, to local and civil projects. Regional and transborder cooperation, as well as German investors' interest in all Poland's regions, are very important. We attach great importance to military cooperation, and we will strive to expand it. Taking care of Polish citizens and citizens of Polish origin living in Germany and the German minority living in Poland is the topic of our constant attention. The neighborly, friendly relations with the Czechs, the Slovaks, and the Hungarians are developing very well. The agreement on free trade--CEFTA [Central European Free Trade Association]--is the greatest joint achievement. We believe the weakening of the Visegrad Group to be unfavorable. It stimulates a search for different ties in Central Europe. We are not happy about it because we cannot find a better solution than the Visegrad Group. It includes the states that have been the leaders among the postcommunist countries of political and economic reforms and that unequivocally support integration with the EU and NATO. Relations with eastern neighbors have been less developed. They are too weak, and our important task is to raise them to the level achieved with other neighbors. (...) In this context, relations with Russia are of the utmost importance. We have different views on ways of achieving European security. This difference, however, should not exclude lively bilateral and regional cooperation. Within the program of joint Polish-Russian undertakings this year, we are going to conclude a trade protocol for 1994 and, possibly, for the following years. We will start work on an agreement on economic cooperation that, among other things, will define the principles and directions for developing cooperation links. We will expand transborder cooperation. We will review and specify the possibilities for financial and banking cooperation. We will undertake work on the setting up of a supragovernmental foundation for supporting democracy and market reforms in Central and East Europe, activities that will compensate for shortcomings in the sphere of information and expand the Polish-Russian dialogue to various political issues. We will try to set up an association for preventing and combating organized crime, including representatives of police, prosecutors, the judiciary of the states of the region, and Interpol. In relations with Ukraine, we are striving to fill the formula of the "close" partnership with material content. In relations with Lithuania and Belarus and also with other eastern neighbors and countries further afield, such as Moldova and Kazakhstan, we concentrate our efforts on creating conditions conducive to economic cooperation. We are continuing our active participation in regional institutions, in particular in the Baltic initiative and the Central European initiative. We will contribute with our experience to work on the pact on stability with regard to the legal regulation of relations with neighbors and with national minorities. We see two threats to the process of building good-neighborly relations, friendship, and regional cooperation. At the basis of this is intolerance and indisposition toward differences. Poland is treating all of its neighbors as fully independent and sovereign states. The development of friendly bonds in our region can also be hampered by the intolerance of one of the nations. Unfortunately, we have noticed the symptoms of this in Russia. We are afraid of it. We have been alarmed by statements about Russia's "particular interests" and "special role" in neighboring countries. These are not conducive to the stability of the region and of Europe. We do not accept this. The second threat, also having its source in intolerance, is nationalism. We can see what it has led to in the former Yugoslavia. (...) Poland persistently supports the process of linking the East and the West into one whole. We want a practical implementation of the principle of indivisibility and security of the whole of Europe and, more widely, of the whole European area. We are of the opinion that the most direct road toward a Europe without divisions is an expansion of proven structures--the North Atlantic Treaty and the EU. This expansion does not mean the creation of new divisions but the breaking down of old ones. That is why we are striving resolutely for our membership in these organizations. That is why we support similar attempts by other states of the Visegrad Group and treat the membership of the group in the Atlantic structures as an important step, but also only aa the first step. That is why we support the establishment of close ties between NATO and Russia. The security of Poland and Europe would not be full and permanent if the ultimate system were not to include Russia and our eastern neighbors. Our most important goal in 1994 is to create conditions for a speedy development of cooperation and the compatibility of the Polish defense system with the system of NATO. Our participation in the Partnership for Peace and a number of agreements on bilateral military cooperation serve this purpose. We have to maintain the momentum of joining the Partnership. The combination of our arguments about the advantages--for Poland and for Europe--of expanding NATO and of the realistic nature of our offer within the Partnership are yielding good results. Further results will depend on our diplomatic efforts and even more so on the military dimension of our relations with NATO. I want to stress here the full involvement of MON [Ministry of National Defense] and the exemplary cooperation of both our departments in the actions to date. We will continue our efforts for NATO and WEU [Western European Union] membership. We are moving closer toward both these goals. In the case of NATO, we cannot count on any spectacular results for the moment, unless some dramatic--and potentially dangerous for us--events were to take place in Russia. Consequently, our task for today is to maintain the debate about what is happening. (...) We attach special importance to the discussion with and in the United States. A very important occasion for continuing this discussion will be President Clinton's visit to Warsaw this July. We welcome with satisfaction our associate WEU partnership. It constitutes the beginning of the road toward membership and the basis for involvement in the work and activities of the Union. We are continuing our activity in the CSCE, where we are a significant member. We are particular about the full implementation by Poland and all partners of the agreements on reducing arms and military activities in Europe and about the clarity of these agreements. At the United Nations, we are concentrating on activities that serve the resolution of conflicts, the protection of human rights, and arms reductions and disarmament. Our activities for security are encountering obstacles. On the one hand, there is the conservatism of Western institutions, a fear of opening up, and an unwillingness to take up the challenge connected with the election of new members and their integration. On the other, there is the conservatism of significant political circles in Russia that treat these institutions as a threat to Russian national interests. Regretfully, today such statements as Minister Kozyrev's last year, that Russia "sees the NATO countries as natural friends and in the future as allies," are rare. The second fundamental foreign policy task is to ensure the best possible conditions for permanent development of our country in its entire economic and civilizational spectrum. Since 1989, we have consistently been seeking these conditions in integration with the European Communities. (...) Just like then, we also can find no better possibilities today for ensuring development conditions for Poland than participation in the EU. (...) Our future membership is accepted by the Union. An expression of this is the association treaty and the declaration of the Copenhagen summit. Poland must proceed toward the EU consistently and quickly. Remaining outside it would mean being a politically marginalized country that is economically discriminated against and forced to submit to decisions made by others. This choice has no alternative: Such are the realities of today's and the future Europe. The most important task in 1994 is to determine as specifically as possible the road toward Poland's EU membership. We are making efforts for an undertaking from the Union on Poland's acceptance that would be more binding than the Copenhagen declaration. An important opportunity to obtain this undertaking will be during the German presidency of the Union, which is very well disposed toward our demands. We are striving to initiate joint work on a scenario for integrating Polish and European agriculture. (...) We are also striving for further improvement in the access of goods and services to the Common Market, and we are counteracting signs of protectionism. We are looking for ways of joining in cooperation in areas covered by a joint EU policy--trade, transportation, energy, agriculture, environmental protection, finance, and so on. Finally, we are striving for increased aid for Poland within PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary], as well as from other community funds, and for earmarking a greater part of them than hitherto for investment purposes. (...) The issue of European integration dominates our relations with the West European states. We are increasing the initiatives and diplomatic consultations involving them. The visit by French Prime Minister Balladur this July will be an important event. We will be convincing him that Poland's participation in the EU will be to its advantage and not a burden to it. We are intensifying dialogue with Great Britain, the third state in the European big three, on ways of political integration, of which that country is a convinced advocate. The visit by the president and the prime minister to Italy confirm the good relations with that country. We are looking for new possibilities of cooperation with the medium and smaller states of the EU--toward Greece, Spain, Ireland, and Portugal. We are intensifying our action explaining our integration plans. With the Nordic countries, we are looking for ways to strengthen and utilize the promising prospects of dynamic development of the Baltic region, linked inter alia to its inclusion in the EU. In view of the approaching EU membership of the four EFTA [European Free Trade Association] states, reaching agreement with this group will be of great significance for our participation in European integration. We will strive for our trade relations with these states not to deteriorate. (...) Already today we must translate what are still for many people abstract slogans about Poland's membership in the EU into specific information and undertakings. This task is urgent, given that the prospect of enlarging the Union is not at all distant. (...) The greatest threat to the policy of integration is protectionism. This problem is still particularly important in agriculture. In the association treaty, there is a lack of strategic vision of integration in this sector, a lack of will to create a common market in this area. Integration must take many years here, however, and cannot take place without conflicts. Until protectionist resistance is overcome and a scenario for including Polish agriculture in the Community is created, the prospects of membership will be uncertain. I do not have to add that, from our side too, protectionist tendencies constitute a real and the most serious threat, apart from possible delays in the adaptation processes, to integration into the EU. The United States, together with the EU, plays an important part in our efforts to ensure the best conditions for the development of our country. Traditionally, the Poles see the Americans, many of whom are of Polish origin, as friends who are sympathetic and ready to cooperate and help. This results in our deep belief in the need for a U.S. presence in Europe, for our frequent contacts and very intensive political dialogue--more lively than that with the European states--as well as for the rapidly growing U.S. investments in Poland. Our objective is to maintain this situation, our position as the main U.S. partner in Central and East Europe, as well as to obtain U.S. consent for our integration into NATO. We are making promising progress. In the economic field, we attach much importance to the program "of emerging large economic markets". We like its philosophy, which characterizes sensible investors: support for countries that manifest dynamic development and that have conditions for becoming regional driving forces and, consequently, important economic partners for the United States. We are particular about the perfection of our multidimensional relations with the Holy See. An additional reason for this today is the fact that the Holy Father is the best disposed toward us foreign head of state. We must not forget this when debating the ratification of the concordat, because our relations will enter a difficult phase without it. We are trying to broaden our circle of important economic partners. We are looking for them among East Asian and Middle East countries. (...) This year's visits, President Walesa's to Japan and Prime Minister Pawlak's to China, will provide opportunities to present our plans and win over partners for them. We will extend our Partnership for Development initiative toward them, as well as toward other states that cooperate with us. Neither do we forget the developing states. They include many people who are very sympathetic to us. We maintain with them regular contacts that are commensurate with our interests and abilities. We are participating in the work on UN reform. We maintain intense cooperation with the IMF, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. We have applied for OECD membership, and we are trying to normalize the conditions of our GATT membership. We have joined the World Trade Organization created under the Uruguay Round. We have started work to ensure our participation in the organization that is to replace COCOM [Coordinating Committee on Export Controls]. We are intensifying international cooperation on environmental protection. This year we will sign appropriate agreements with Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Belarus, and Lithuania, and we will strengthen our presence in the Baltic region. Together with the Sejm commissions, we want to determine with greater precision the aims and means for the promotion of Polish culture so that it can facilitate the development of our country. We are seeking ways of linking international scientific exchange to the economy, without which its development would be constantly hindered by insufficient state resources. Perhaps the greatest progress we have made is in the field of creating conditions for the free development of personal contacts. Today we can travel abroad without excessive formal impediments. However, this does not mean that travel is easy and that we are welcomed everywhere with open arms. Nor does it mean that our relatives, fellow countrymen who permanently live abroad, are well treated there and can visit us freely. We have to expand and civilize our border crossing points. (...) The provision for our fellow countrymen of their rightful, proper, and safe conditions for cultivating their Polish provenance is more difficult. We attach much importance to this task. We consistently enforce the rights provided for under international norms and guaranteed under agreements. We will strive to protect Poles in Kazakhstan. We are continuing our activities that serve to cultivate the Polish language, traditions, and culture. The most difficult task, however, is changing the Poles' and foreigners' stereotyped images, both positive and negative. Foreigners who are well disposed toward us see us as patriots ready for heroic deeds, as fervent Catholics, and as romantics. There is nothing in this image about enterprise, education, and present-day know-how. It is dominated by grave faces, with blood and horsemen in the background. Those who think ill of us see Poles as lazy workers, cantankerous politicians, corrupt bureaucrats, and fraudulent businessmen, and Poland as a country of dirt and mess. In fact, both images are grim. They do not encourage contacts. We have to change them, lighten them, show that Poland is a country of great opportunities and talented people. We have to promote Poles and Poland. These are our three tasks--durable security, favorable conditions for development, and freedom of personal contacts--and the four greatest threats to them are intolerance, conservatism, protectionism, and stereotypes. These are the fundamental parameters of our foreign activity. There is also a domestic dimension. Today it is perhaps the most important one. Rarely in its history has Poland had such a favorable situation and such good opportunities for development as now. It is very much up to us whether we are going to make use of these. We are modernizing our foreign service. We want to eliminate the lack of separation between the fields of "politics" and "administration," which is no longer found in modern democracies. We will achieve this by separating out in the ministry the minister's political servicing apparatus. (...) The official apparatus at the ministry will be headed by a general secretary assisted by his deputies. The officials' duties and powers, the criteria for their selection, subordination, and promotion, will be defined by an act. I have already sent the bill for interdepartmental consultation. (...) Second, we would like to introduce a number of solutions strengthening the coordination of foreign policy.
