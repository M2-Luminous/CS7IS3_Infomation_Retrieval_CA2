"I told him the timing is important in taking economy-spurring measures," Yohei Kono told reporters after emerging from a meeting with Hosokawa at the premier's official residence. "I also emphasized it would be a disaster if meaningful and substantial stimulus steps were not taken this time," he added. Kono quoted Hosokawa as replying he will strive to do what is necessary to boost the economy as early as possible. The Hosokawa cabinet is scheduled to announce Thursday a massive economic stimulus package expected to total 15 trillion to 16 trillion yen, Japan's largest pump-primer ever, to cope with the economic slump. Although the premier explained that his government and ruling coalition parties are in the final stage of building consensus on a large-scale income tax cut, he did not touch on how the government proposes to finance the tax reduction, Kono said. On Japan-U.S. relations, Kono said he stressed the importance of Hosokawa having a successful summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton next week. The Japanese and U.S. leaders will meet in Washington on February 11 to assess progress in the bilateral framework trade negotiations. In the meeting with Kono, Hosokawa was accompanied by Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. Kono attended the meeting along with Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs Research Council. Asked about possible future meetings with Hosokawa, Kono replied he will confer with the premier if he thinks it will be "meaningful," adding he has no plan to hold such talks on a regular basis.
