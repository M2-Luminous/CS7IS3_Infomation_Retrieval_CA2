During the luncheon, the host and his guest delivered warm and friendly speeches, in which they praised Sino-Danish friendship and signaled their willingness to work together to further promote the continuous development of relations between the two countries. Li Ruihuan said: I visited your beautiful country 11 years ago. Your country's quiet idyllic scenes, and your warm-hearted and hospitable people, produced a deep impression on me. The industrious people of Denmark, after several centuries of hard work, have built Denmark into a modern country with highly developed industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and tertiary industry. The Chinese people highly admire the achievements scored by the Danes. He said: The Chinese and Danish peoples began friendly contacts several centuries ago. Denmark was one of the first Western nations that established diplomatic relations with New China. After the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two countries kept developing and strengthening friendly contacts and mutually beneficial cooperation. Over the past few years in particular, joint efforts by the two sides have led to more exchanges of visits by high-level officials, ever-deepening mutual understanding, and the rapid development of cooperation in the economic, trade, scientific, technological, educational, and cultural fields. Li Ruihuan said: Over the past 10 years or more, China's achievements in economic construction have riveted the world's attention, with sustained growth in the national economy and marked improvements in people's living standards. We should further intensify our efforts in reform and opening up; maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy; maintain political stability; and promote all-around social progress. Lykketoft said: The friendship between the Chinese and Danish peoples dates back to ancient times. At present, trade between the two countries continues to grow, economic cooperation keeps expanding, and political contacts are increasing gradually. The Danish Government and the Danish business community are devoting great efforts to advancing relations between the two countries, especially to further developing economic relations and trade. He expressed the belief that Li Ruihuan's current visit would benefit contacts and cooperation between the two countries. Lykketoft also recounted his visit to China in 1993 as head of a delegation. He said the Chinese people's resolve to realize the established goal of modernization, as well as rapid economic development, had produced a profound impression on members of the delegation. Moreover, China's efforts to strengthen its legal system to ensure stable economic and social development and its realistic approach toward political reform are unforgettable. He said: Denmark thinks highly of the positive role played by China, in its capacity as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, in international and regional affairs, and in maintaining world peace and stability.
