He added that this tragedy is also a disgrace to all those who could put an end to this issue, but do nothing and stand as spectators. This came, during a meeting yesterday, with His Excellency Pablo Puente, the Vatican's ambassador to Lebanon and envoy of Pope John Paul II. The president added that the position of America and Europe will forever remain shameful and disgraceful. He said: In fact, their position is disgraceful from top to bottom. The president said: These countries not only refrain from helping or protecting the oppressed party, but they ban it from receiving arms to defend itself and its property. In fact, these countries, which have the military power to deter the oppressor and assist the oppressed, do not support justice. It is as if they are helping the oppressor against the oppressed. Shaykh Zayid added: The Islamic nations, which witness and follow up these daily massacres that are taking place under the eyes of the European countries, believe that there is a tendentious plot against the Islamic minority in Europe. The Islamic nations also believe there is an attempt to suppress and liquidate the Muslims. He said: Such a thing cannot take place in the Islamic world against any minority because Islamic law bans any coercion against the Christian minority. At the same time, however, Muslims each day see the Muslim people of Bosnia being slaughtered like sheep. God may give someone time, but He will never forget. Regarding the dialogue between Muslims and Christians, his highness the president of the state welcomed this dialogue for the sake of peace and mankind's prosperity, noting that the teachings of the heavenly religions should be applied. He said that the Islamic world is committed to implementing Islamic law, God's book, and the prophet's sayings. Therefore, he added, the Christians should also apply the sound teachings of their religion, follow their holy book, and work for the well-being and prosperity of mankind. [passage omitted]
