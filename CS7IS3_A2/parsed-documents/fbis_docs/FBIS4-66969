Jose Antonio Ochoa Palacios, the PGR's representative in Baja California, reported the burning of the following drugs in the Fifth Infantry Battalion's facilities located in the town of Tijuana's settlement of El Aguaje de la Tuna: approximately 8.5 tons of cannabis indica, 4,237 grams of Thai heroin, 15.5 kg of methamphetamine, and 38 kg and 585 grams of pure cocaine. The drugs presumably were intended to be smuggled into the United States for sale and consumption. According to reports submitted to the PGR's assistant attorney for local offices and inspection, Alfonso Cabrera Morales, the drugs in question, with a market value totaling several tens of millions of new pesos, were seized by Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agents assigned to both Tijuana and Tecate. The PJF's deputy commissioner, Raul Loza Parra, remarked: "The drugs burned were confiscated within the past two months." The event was attended by Ruben Dario Castillo Ferrara, the district garrison commander; Ricardo M. Legario Z., commander of the Fifth Infantry Battalion; Jorge Avelaez Palacio, director of the SSA [Secretariat of Health and Assistance] Health Center in Tijuana; and Eduardo Garcia Alcaynes, from the PGR's Internal Comptroller's Office, among others. Representative Ochoa Palacios underscored the resolute participation of all the state's social and institutional sectors in the battle against the drug traffic. Carlos Jaime Pratt Straffon, the PGR's representative in Sonora, for his part, reported that approximately nine tons of compressed marijuana were destroyed at the Hermosillo Hunt Club and Firing Range facilities located at km 26 of the Bahia de Quino highway. These drugs also were presumably intended for shipment to the northern part of the country and, subsequently, to the United States. Like Ochoa Palacios, Pratt Straffon addressed that state's attorney general, Wenceslao Cota Monteya, the State Human Rights Commission inspectors, Hector Contreras Perez and Jesus Arturo Pena; as well as the Foreign Relations Secretariat's regional representative, Alejandro [surname missing]. Straffon emphasized the valuable, determined participation of the civilian society and the military, state, and municipal authorities in the daily battle being waged against the grave, increasing drug trafficking problem, afflicting everyone alike. He added that the nearly nine tons of cannabis indica incinerated had been seized during the past 60 days by federal agents under orders from the force's assistant representative, Julio Cesar Moralla Amador.
