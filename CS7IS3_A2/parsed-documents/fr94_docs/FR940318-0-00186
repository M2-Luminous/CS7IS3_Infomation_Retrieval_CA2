FR940318-0-00186 FR940318-0-00023 (g) Foam. Foam is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute. Foam extinguishers cannot be used as a substitute for halon in all applications. Portable foam extinguishers are intended primarily for use on flammable liquid fires and are somewhat effective on Class A fires. Foam can also cause secondary damage on objects onto which it is discharged. Foam extinguishers should be used in accordance with manufacturer's guidelines and with NFPA standards. (2) Total flooding agents. (a) Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. Exposure to carbon dioxide poses an imminent threat to life. However, because it displaces oxygen, it is an effective fire protection agent. As a result, both OSHA and the NFPA address CO 2 systems for occupied areas. OSHA 1910.162(b)5 requires a pre-discharge alarm for systems with a design concentration of 4 percent or greater. NFPA has written a standard (NFPA 12) that explicitly controls how such CO 2 systems may be safely used in occupied areas. To protect life, the standard requires a system design such that no personnel may be present upon system discharge. The EPA recognizes both the OSHA regulation and the NFPA standard as industry practice and therefore defer to them in this rule. CO 2 systems require a storage volume of three times that of Halon 1301. In the review of proposed substitutes, the Agency looks at a variety of health and environmental factors, including whether the agent contributes to global climate change. While carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, it is also a byproduct of many industrial processes and is recaptured and reformulated as a fire fighting agent and thus does not require new production. Therefore, the Agency has determined that its contribution to overall greenhouse gas emissions is low. (b) Water. Water sprinkler systems are acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute. Such systems are in widespread use and are governed by NFPA technical standards. EPA encourages adoption of water systems wherever feasible. Care should be taken when using water on Class C electrical fires, and it may not be suitable in instances in which secondary damage is considered unacceptable. (c) (Inert Gas Blend) B is acceptable for use in unoccupied areas. The decision for use of this agent in occupied areas is pending until the agency completes its review of low oxygen atmospheres, and will be included in a future rulemaking. Use conditions to limit the risk of inadvertent exposure to personnel in normally unoccupied areas may be included in future rulemakings. (d) (Powdered Aerosol) A is acceptable for use in unoccupied areas. The decision for use of this agent in occupied areas is pending until the agency completes its review of the potential health effects of this agent. In addition, use conditions to limit the risk of inadvertent exposure to personnel in normally unoccupied areas may be included in future rulemakings. (e) (Powdered Aerosol) B is acceptable for use in unoccupied areas. This SNAP submission included many different formulations. While the formulations pose little risk in a normally unoccupied area, the decision for use of the various formulations in occupied areas is pending further review of their potential health effects. In addition, use conditions to limit the risk of inadvertent exposure to personnel in normally unoccupied areas may be included in future rulemakings. b. Acceptable subject to use conditions. (1) Total flooding agents. In analyzing the acceptability of substitutes for total flooding applications in occupied spaces, the Agency considered cardiotoxicity one of the primary decision variables. Current OSHA limitations on use of Halon 1301 in total flooding applications assure that these uses do not pose a cardiotoxic risk to personnel at the design concentration. OSHA promulgated a safety and health standard (29 CFR 1910 subpart L) governing fire protection systems used at all workplaces which is designed to limit employee exposures to toxic levels of gaseous agents used in fixed total flood systems. OSHA section 1910.162 governs the use of all gaseous agents in fixed extinguishing systems, however the guidance is not explicit on the allowable concentrations of the different agents. While paragraph 1910.162(b)3 stipulates that ``[t]he employer shall assure that employees are not exposed to toxic levels of gaseous agent or its decomposition products,'' it does not define what a ``toxic level'' is. In examining paragraph 1910.162(b)(6)(i) through (b)(6)(iii), EPA concludes that it is OSHA's intent to limit exposure to gaseous agents based upon cardiotoxicity levels. EPA's conclusion was confirmed in discussions with OSHA. EPA's assessment is that the use of NOAEL/LOAEL values based on exposure scenarios is the proper method to ensure safe use of gaseous agents, and agrees with OSHA's approach. It is therefore EPA's intention to stipulate the cardiotoxic levels for each agent and, until OSHA incorporates clarifying language for the new agents, to impose use conditions that apply 1910.162 in its entirety to these agents. References in ยง1910.162 to a Halon 1301 concentration of 7 percent imply a cardiotoxic NOAEL, and references to a Halon 1301 concentration of 10 percent imply a cardiotoxic LOAEL. In this regulation, EPA is clarifying the intent of ยง1910.162(b)(3) to allow the use of the substitute gaseous agents only according to paragraph (b)(6)(i) through (b)(6)(iii), using the cardiotoxic NOAEL and LOAEL of each agent as the concentration referenced in each subparagraph.
