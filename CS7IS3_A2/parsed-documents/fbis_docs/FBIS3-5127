NODONG SINMUN today in a by-lined article in this regard quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as saying: "Our task at the present stage is to follow up the success in the rural technical revolution to advance the industrialization and modernization of agriculture to a high level". The article says: The promotion of the technical revolution is one of the most important tasks in the efforts for the ultimate solution of the rural question under the banner of the rural theses. The task of the technical revolution laid down in the letter represents a just policy based on a scientific analysis of the present state of the development of agriculture in our country. This state shows that only when we consolidate and expand the achievements made in the technical revolution while accelerating the ideological and cultural revolutions in the countryside, can we steadily raise the standards of industrialisation and modernisation of agriculture and win a shining victory in the efforts to finally solve the rural question. The technical revolution makes it possible, above all, to solidify the material and technical foundations of agriculture by stepping up the technical reconstruction of agricultural production and thus make a dramatic progress in the solution to the socialist rural question. In the past period the technical revolution has made a fast progress along the road indicated by the rural theses in our country, bringing irrigation and electrification to completion in the countryside and successfully bringing into reality the mechanisation and extensive application of chemicals as well. The technical revolution also makes it possible to push ahead with the process of organical combination of cooperative property and all-people property while continually enhancing the leading role of the latter over the former. To enhance this leading role is an important demand for the ultimate solution to the rural question and it is definitely guaranteed only by solid material and technical conditions. The technical revolution is an important way of creating material and technical conditions for constantly enhancing the leading role of all-people property over cooperative property and combining them organically. When we energetically accelerate the rural technical revolution, faithfully fulfilling its tasks set by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his historic letter to the national agricultural conference can we make a signal progress in the development of the socialist rural economy and constantly increase agricultural production.
