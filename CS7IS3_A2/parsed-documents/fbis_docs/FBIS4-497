FBIS4-497 "drafr070_c_94036" FBIS-AFR-94-070 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA NIS Reportedly Linked to Eskom-kwaZulu Arms Deal NIS Reportedly Linked to Eskom-kwaZulu Arms Deal MB0904121994 Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English 9 Apr 94 pp 1-2 MB0904121994 Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR English BFN ["Exclusive report" by Janine Lazarus] [Text] Members of the National Intelligence Service [NIS] might be linked to Eskom's sale of arms to the kwaZulu Police. On March 25, the day the parastatal announced it had uncovered and cancelled plans to sell 1,000 semi-automatic rifles to an arms dealer for resale to the kwaZulu Police, 10 weapons were signed out of Eskom's arsenal and loaded into a truck parked outside Eskom's Megawatt Park headquarters. A source within Eskom said the truck was accompanied by a number of other vehicles, including a grey Mercedes-Benz bearing the registration NVB131T. Senior police sources said this week that the Mercedes was registered in the name of the NIS at a Skinner Street, Pretoria, address. According to official Eskom documents in WEEKEND STAR's possession, two transactions for the removal of 20 LM-4 semi-automatic rifles to an unknown destination took place two weeks ago. The weapons were apparently checked out to a "bearer". WEEKEND STAR knows the identity of the "bearer", but for legal reasons cannot name the person. Eskom officials insist that the "bearer" is not one of their employees. A form authorising removal from Eskom stores was signed by Eskom manager Johan van der Walt, who, with Eskom security head Floris Bonthuys, was suspended last week after the utility investigated the weapons deal. The weapons then mysteriously returned to the stores. Repeated attempts to find out from the NIS, Eskom and the State President's office failed to establish what an NIS vehicle was doing at Eskom, the identity of the "bearer" who signed for the weapons, and why further weapons were being sold after Eskom had publicly undertaken not to sell arms. An NIS spokesman, who refused to be named, denied that his organisation was linked to any arms deal between Eskom and the kwaZulu Police. "There is no question whatsoever that we could be involved there. We do have contact from time to time. It's formal liaison -- just a question of talking about what things are like. Then we drive to the front door." The spokesman at first refused to take down the Mercedes-Benz's registration details, but then agreed to check the information. He called back later to say the information was wrong, and attempted to support this by quoting a different registration number, which he said belonged to a BMW registered to a financial house in Orkney. He laughed when he was told the information had been gleaned from reliable police sources. "And you trust them?" he asked. The police sources double-checked their information and confirmed that the registration number noted at Megawatt Park at the time of the arms deal belonged to the NIS. An Eskom spokesman, given the name of the mysterious "bearer" and asked who he was, said the only people who would know were the two suspended Eskom employees who set up the weapons deal. "And is it fair to worry them after they have been suspended?" he asked. Late last Thursday Eskom's public affairs senior general manager Bongani Khumalo promised he would come up with some answers. After arranging a meeting last Friday to clear things up, he referred WEEKEND STAR to Eskom's acting chief executive, Dr George Lindeque. "We've designated him spokesman on this." However, Lindeque was not prepared to clear up the mystery surrounding the NIS vehicle. "We have appointed an investigative committee," he said. I can't pre-empt any finding right now and it would not be right to comment on any of the findings. We are going to go public on all the findings." Richard Carter, President's Office communications department director, said his office was "grateful" for the information provided, but said it was "impossible" to make any comment. "I will pass it on to the people concerned," he said, and referred WEEKEND STAR to the NIS -- which was, after all, where we had started.
