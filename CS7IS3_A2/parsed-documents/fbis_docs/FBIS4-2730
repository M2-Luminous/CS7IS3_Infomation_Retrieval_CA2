The province, one of the major heavy industrial centers in China, has been plagued by industrial pollution for a long time. Shenyang, capital of the province, and Anshan, a steel city, and other large and medium-sized cites were once pollution-ridden and are now still facing serious problems of pollution. To reduce pollution and better protect the environment, the province is now taking every possible measure to make its residents aware of pollution problems. Children in schools all over the province are given books on environmental protection which explain in simple and clear language the relationship between nature and human beings, and between environmental pollution and disease. Two special primary schools have been established, where students are examined on the subject of environmental protection as well as other subjects. Government officials are also required to stay abreast of problems of pollution. They are given lectures on the basics of environmental protection and its relationship with economic development. Factories are now paying attention to environmental protection as well as to safety in the workplace. Newspapers give prominent space and radio and TV use prime time to cover stories on environmental protection. The chief of the provincial bureau of environmental protection has even hosted radio phone-in programs on environmental protection.
