The main reason is the unceasing search for a judge to try this case, and not one from Novi Pazar, where the trial is taking place, but from outside. First, Radomir Janicijevic and Nikola Jovicic, former judges from the Novi Pazar District Court, were "slated" for the trial, but both left the judiciary at exactly that time and joined the bar. Then, Dragoje Tapuskovic was brought in from Kraljevo to be the judge, and the trial began on 31 January, but then on 18 February it was interrupted, because Tapuskovic had a traffic accident in which he was badly injured. Just the other day, three months after the trial was interrupted, Dragomir Lelovac of Kraljevo was finally designated the new presiding judge. In the meantime, Sava Teofilovic, a judge from Novi Sad, who by decision of the Supreme Court of Serbia was supposed to take over the trial in Novi Pazar, withdrew without giving his reasons. On the insistence of many attorneys that a new judge be designated as soon as possible, Nuho Mehovic, president of the district court in Novi Pazar, said that he was unable to form a new panel without consent of the presiding judge of the Supreme Court of Serbia, and he referred the attorneys to Caslav Ignjatovic. By all appearances, it seems that the indictment charging 25 people with threatening the territorial integrity of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] dictates this kind of behavior by representatives of the supreme and district courts, but many people are inclined to believe that the trial is being dragged out and a new judge is being constantly sought so that the case would not be conducted by any of the judges (Muslims) from Novi Pazar. The Turkish School The entire case began in May of last year with the arrest of four Muslims in whose possession, according to the news release of the Serbian MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs], was found a large quantity of arms, explosives, and war plans. Arrests continued in the days that followed, and soon there were 25 persons of Muslim nationality behind bars. The indictment then said that the objective of the arrestees was to create by the use of force an independent state of "Sandzak" from a part of the territory of the FRY, that they drew up war plans and other plans to that end, that they established military and police units, and that they acquired large quantities of arms and explosives without authorization. Not long after that, an indictment was returned against Sulejman Ugljanin, leader of the SDA [Democratic Action Party] for Sandzak, who at that time was outside the country. Although from the very outset Ugljanin has been mentioned as the main culprit and was mentioned in connection with the first arrests, he left the country quite legally. In any case, one group of members of the Serbian MUP nevertheless arrived in front of his house to arrest him, that is, to detain him. We will soon learn whether the state agencies here intentionally gave the appearance of releasing Ugljanin to leave or this was a mere coincidence. Those who are very familiar with the situation in Sandzak believe that it was the former, because in that way they prevented him from returning to the country. Sokol Ahmetovic, another of the key people in all of this, was also outside Yugoslavia when the indictment was brought. He is charged with organizing the departure of young Muslims for military training in Turkey. Back in the middle of last year, BORBA carried the story of one of them who went through that training, and recently our newsman heard the same story in Rudo. A young man from the vicinity of Prijepolje, who spent some 40 days in a military camp near Izmir along with 80 other young men from Sandzak, is in the prison there. According to his account, a fair number of those were convinced that they were going to Turkey to work, but once they got there they were compelled by threats to obey, and all of this was aimed at creating a free Sandzak to which they would return as military officers. However, after they returned to the country he and many others were forced to flee either abroad or to Bosnia, where they joined the Muslims. And that is how this lad was arrested--in the attempt to get through to Gorazde or Sarajevo. Showdown With the SDA Because both Ugljanin and Ahmetovic are inaccessible to judicial authorities, Milan Veselinovic, federal deputy of the SRS [Serbian Radical Party] from Novi Pazar, predicts "that all the blame will be put on those 25 arrestees, while the main culprits and ideologues will remain protected and unpunished." Zoran Jovanovic, chairman of the Novi Pazar Committee of the SRS, says that the Muslims have created paramilitary units, have sent their children for military training, so that tomorrow, if needed, they could fight against the Serbs. At the same time, the SPO [Serbian Renewal Movement] in Novi Pazar says in its news release that "the way in which this case is being treated is yet another political act that serves to disgrace the Serbian nation and state." The SDA for Sandzak sees this entire trial as an attempt to settle accounts with the Muslim people, but it is most likely that the trial will also make it easier to attack that party, which frequently represents itself as the sole legitimate representative of the Muslims in Sandzak. This can be read between the lines of the statement by Radmilo Bogdanovic made recently in Prijepolje: "The elements have long existed to ban the operation of the Democratic Action Party. We did not do that, because this would have been interpreted as a threat to their rights. It would only have brought us foreign delegations, because Ugljanin has turned to everyone in the world to say that the `Muslims are threatened.'" Numerous defense attorneys have been thinking in precisely those terms in the statements they have made so far. Thus, Rajko Danilovic says that "this trial is obviously aimed at a showdown between the incumbent regime and the SDA, and the possession of arms is a commonplace in ethnically mixed communities." That is close to the thinking of Azem Vlasi, who says: "A trial is being prepared for these citizens because they dared to think about whether they could do something if necessary to the end of their own self-defense, that is, defense of their people and the territory where they live. And the need for defense is not some function or consequence of a persecution mania, but a part of our reality. It is hard to believe that there is anyone who is not thinking about this today even in the situation when the government is protecting him, but not in this case." Seven of the arrestees recently wrote to the Serbian justice minister and said in their letter: "It seems that in our case no one is in a hurry to hear and prove the truth. Although a year has already passed, we are still hostages to those who are hunting fabricated enemies. The proceedings in the investigation, seeking and bringing in judges from outside, although there are five judges in the district court in Novi Pazar, bring us to doubt the objectivity of this court. Do we have to be tried by some obedient Serb, against all legal and moral standards?" Unsolved Hijacking The upcoming trial in Novi Pazar, whose resumption is scheduled for 25 May, must nevertheless answer the key question: Did the arrested Muslims intend to redraw borders by force under the sponsorship of the SDA, or did they arm themselves for self-defense? Provided the trial is legal, and not politically colored. When we bear in mind the way in which problems are being solved in our region and the bloody outcome of the Yugoslav war drama, it will not be easy to distinguish what part was a need to collect arms for security and what part consisted of extremist political objectives in order to create the so-called republic of Sandzak. In the section that borders Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Muslims have not been living in peace for the last two or three years. This has been most pronounced in Priboj and Pljevlja Opstinas. Many people remember two hijackings--17 Muslim inhabitants of the village Sjeverin were taken from a bus in Mioce, and the same number of Muslims were taken from a train standing in the Strpci station. Even today, nothing has been officially solved concerning their fate. Only that recently suspicion fell on one person for kidnapping them. So, then, will the weapons and war plans that were found be sufficient grounds to support the charge that the accused were really threatening the territorial integrity of a state which was unable to guarantee them any kind of security? Or will the trial try to prove that the threat to the Muslims did not evoke the extremism, but that from the very outset this was a characteristic of the leading circles in the SDA, in particular its leader Sulejman Ugljanin, who even before the war in the former Bosnia and Herzegovina was declaring "We will either die or be free"? Like many former leaders of the SDA, Ugljanin is outside Yugoslavia. The people who will have to continue to live together in Sandzak or Raska Oblast have remained here.
