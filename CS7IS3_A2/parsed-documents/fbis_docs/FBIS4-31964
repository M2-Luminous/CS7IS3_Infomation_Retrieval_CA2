In order fully to grasp the enormity of the losses, it should be said that Yugoslavia's projected national product for 1994 stands at 13 billion dollars, Unkovic, who is also Serbia's minister of science and technology, told reporters of influential Bulgarian newspapers who arrived on a three-day visit to Krusevac, central Serbia, on Thursday. The United Nations voted the sanctions in place in May 1992 because of Yugoslavia's alleged involvement in civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. Serbian Information Minister Ratomir Vico, who also attended the talk, said that the only thing Serbian authorities insisted on in their contacts with foreign media reporters was truthful reporting. Vico said that this kind of reporting would give a much more objective picture of Serbia and Yugoslavia and the situation in the lands of former Yugoslavia.
