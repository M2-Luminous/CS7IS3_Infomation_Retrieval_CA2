Do you agree with this assessment? [Ghawshah] That is correct. The agreement is not ideal. We view what took place in Cairo as an incomplete step. It is not a positive start for the resumption of negotiations on various issues. We view what happened in Cairo as a new indicator, as Rabin has resumed the policy of procrastination, extortion, and imposition of the status quo. He went beyond that to ridicule the entire [Oslo] agreement. Things got worse when Rabin said there are no sacred dates. This is despite the fact that the only issue that will not tolerate various interpretations or double-dealing is the dates of 13 January and 13 April. However, even this clear issue has been considered not sacred by Rabin. Therefore, I say that what ttook place in Cairo is a possible step. But it is not a step that responds to the minimum level of our demands. We see the negotiations as a long and arduous process. There will be negotiating battles. Rabin and his generals will try to impose their concept of the agreement and to delay the implementation of the Declaration of Principles [DOP]. [Al-'Abid] Can I understand from what you have said that the Palestinian negotiating team was subjected to extortion during the Cairo negotiations? Were specific pressures put on the delegation? [Ghawshah] We can say the extortions were tremendous. However, the Palestinian delegation did not accept all extortions. It resisted some of them. If the Palestinian had given in to extortions, the matter would not have required rounds of negotiations in Oslo, Davos, Versailles, and Cairo. On the contrary, extortions were even greater. Still, we have to admit that the Palestinian delegation could not impose its concept of the agreement in a manner that meets the minimum [Palestinian] demands. [Al-'Abid] Some of those who attacked the Cairo agreement said President Yasir 'Arafat is not authorized to sign the agreement, and that the PLO Executive Committee has not authorized him do so. What is your comment? [Ghawshah] I attended the PLO Executive Committee meeting [prior to the Cairo agreement]. Many arguments took place. It is known that it was an incomplete PLO Executive Committee meeting and that arrangements had been for a liaison committee delegation rather that brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] to travel to Cairo. It was originally planned that brother Abu-'Ammar would travel to the Egyptian capital only to meet with President Muhammad Husni Mubarak. However, a host of circumstances led to the participation of President 'Arafat, including the Israeli insistence not to participate unless brother Abu-'Ammar attended in person. Eventually, this issue was discussed during a meeting of PLO Executive Committee members who agreed to attend. A last-minute decision was taken concerning brother Abu-'Ammar's travel. Still, it should be noted that the PLO Executive Committee should be briefed on any steps during its subsequent meetings. Its members have the right to express their views. This actually took place during a subsequent meeting on the nature of the Cairo agreement. Various views were expressed. We should not forget that there are various views. We express our views in a democratic way. What I have said has been officially announced in a Palestinian Popular Struggle Front's statement in which we discussed the meeting. I believe that any faction is entitled to debate issues and express their views within the framework of the Palestinian institutions. [Al-'Abid] What were the most prominent developments that took place a short time before President 'Arafat decided to participate in the Cairo negotiations? [Ghawshah] Intensive international and Arab contacts were held with President 'Arafat to remove the obstacles. The United States was the most active country in this respect. The strange thing is that the United States exercises its role only when there is a need to bring pressure to bear on us, and not as an honest and faithful mediator and sponsor. What was achieved in Cairo could have been better had the sponsors of the conference, specifically the United States, assumed the role of an honest partner and mediator. As yet, the U.S. Administration has not adopted a balanced or equitable stand. It tilts toward the Israeli concept and viewpoint, irrespective of the justifications and the preambles. We can say that up to this moment, the United States has not adopted a balanced stand, and has not exercised the required role. On the contrary, the role that is being exercised is to bring pressure to bear on the Palestinian side and not the Israeli side. [passage omitted] [Al-'Abid] Many believe Israel will not abide by the 13 April deadline and that it will put forth excuses. What can the Palestinian side do to force Israel to respect timetables? [Ghawshah] Those who believe that all barriers and obstacles between us and Israel have been removed will reap disappointment and failure. Israel is still an enemy which carries out a policy of land confiscation, repression, and extermination. It is only natural that it tries to maneuver and procrastinate to empty the agreement of substance. From this premise, we are not surprised by any Israeli stand. We expect the worst. However, this does not mean that we keep silent. We should confront it. But this depends on the balance of powers from which the Arabs and the Palestinians are suffering. [passage omitted] [Al-'Abid] There is a weapons-acquiring wave in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Most of it is not for militant purposes. This heralds internecine fighting in the future. What do you have to say about this? [Ghawshah] The question of weapons-acquiring in the occupied homeland is eye-catching. What is taking place is an increase in the activities of weapons smugglers. This has taken place recently. It seems that the Israeli security bodies facilitate the possession of weapons so that the Palestinian people may kill one another. However, we say that the Palestinian people are so mature and have learned from past experience and will not fall victim to the enemy's schemes. We are studying measures and arrangements to prevent the shedding of any Palestinian blood by Palestinian hands. [Al-'Abid] What about the meeting of the committee on the refugees and the displaced which met yesterday, and what about the agenda of the negotiations with the Jordanian side? [Ghawshah] We agreed on a draft agenda. We discussed at length the issue of refugees, which we reviewed in all its aspects, particularly from its strategic aspect based on the fact that a just solution consists of their repatriation and not their compensation, and forcing Israel to implement international legitimacy resolution No. 194. We also discussed various other issues, particularly the role of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. We emphasized the need to effectively carry out coordination and cooperation and reject the principle of resettlement. Wuth respect to the displaced, there is UN Security Council Resolution 237 which calls for their repatriation, and special clause 13 in the DOP on the modalities of their return. This will be studied through a four-way Jordanian-Palestinian-Egyptian-Israeli committee. There was also a Jordanian and Palestinian understanding on the various issues slated on the agenda.
