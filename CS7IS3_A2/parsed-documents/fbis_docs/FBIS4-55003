A spokesman for UNPROFOR's northeastern sector, Captain Jens Kirk, confirmed the deployment of 16 observers at four observation posts near the front lines of the Bosnian Serbs, who hold the town, in line with an agreement reached earlier this week with local Serb authorities. Their presence is aimed at averting fighting in a strategic corridor linking Serbia with territory held by the Bosnian Serbs in Croatia and northwestern Bosnia. A UN official said the team in Zvornik, on the Drina River border with Serbia, had been forced to leave Saturday by Serb forces. Swedish General Gunnar Ridderstad, commander of UNPROFOR forces in northeastern Bosnia, told AFP the withdrawal threatened to disrupt observation of traffic through the town, a key entry point into the Brcko corridor. He confirmed that Bosnian Serb forces had been blocking the route from Tuzla to the Moslem enclave of Srbrenica, a UN "safe area", since April 29. "The situation is not desperate, as some convoys could still come through from Belgrade, but it is getting worse every day," he said. He said the blockade followed Danish retaliation against a Serb attack in which Danish tank gunners killed nine Serbs and wounded four. According to unconfirmed reports from both Serb and mainly Moslem Bosnian sources, the two sides have been sending reinforcements to the corridor ahead of an expected new, large-scale offensive.
