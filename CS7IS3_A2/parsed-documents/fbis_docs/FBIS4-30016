In the past few months, Japanese companies have announced plans to move capacity out of their home base almost daily. China and Vietnam are among the most popular destinations, followed by Thailand and other ASEAN countries. What's happening in corporate Japan? Is a restructuring of the world's second largest economy in the making? The strong yen coupled with rising costs at home have driven many once-formidable Japanese firms into the red. Moving increasingly-uncompetitive domestic manufacturing bases out to places where the comparative edges are clearly superior is what corporate Japan is doing relentlessly. Wages, level of technological development in host countries, and the emergence of sub-regional economic groupings are key factors determining which Japanese industries go to which countries. As for the European markets, Japanese firms have set up factories in the European Union to ensure market access to all 12 countries. Non-EU countries will enjoy tariff privileges once their factories are in the community. Most of the relocations are in high-technology areas. The ASEAN Free Trade Area [Afta] still has a long way to go due to the grouping's 15-year time span. Deputy premier Suphachai Phanitchapak has called for a shorter timeframe of 10 years to avoid the grouping being left behind in the race of regionalism. At the moment, Afta has not yet fully kicked into gear but the prospect of expanding membership will make the grouping more attractive especially as the emerging Indochinese economies like Vietnam become new members. With the long time-span of complete implementation of Afta, Japanese firms have plenty of time and room to manouevre to fine-tune their position on the eventual outcome of this regional effort. In the case of European Union, Japan and other foreign investors do not have much time to spare so virtually everything had to be fixed quickly. Japanese investment in Korea or Taiwan, regarded as the first newly-industrialized economies (Nies) after Japan, is also undergoing change. High-technology capacity is moving from Japan to this first tier of Nies. Wages are not the determining factor for projects in these countries. Capacity down the technology ladder goes to countries like Thailand, Malaysia or Indonesia where wages are rising because of rapid economic prosperity over the past decades. Automobile and electronics industries are among the key sectors of relocation. Industries which are very labour intensive then go to China and Vietnam where the level of technological development is low. This can be seen in the relocation of low-priced textile or footwear manufacturing in Thailand to China and Vietnam because of the wage factor. With the wave of regionalism washing over the world, there are now enough different sub-regional groupings to create confusion among policy planners. Apec, Afta, Nafta, EAEC and Sea-10. Nies like Korea see Apec as the most promising of all. First, this grouping is the most comprehensive geographically, with members covering both sides of the Pacific. Secondly, Apec has what appears to be the best mechanism to function -- senior official meeting, finance ministers meeting and plan for an environment minister meeting plus the summit of top national leaders hosted by U.S. president Bill Clinton last November. Its membership is also expanding, with Chile due to join Apec as the 18th member later this year. The probability of Apec to work is high as evidenced by the last senior official meeting in Jakarta at which there was discussion on whether to turn Apec into an open free-trade group. Malaysia appears to be the only country that explicitly opposes this kind of trend.
