Akbar: "Histrionic About History"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] This country now has to deal with the United States' good intentions these days. There is a new mantra wafting out from Washington. Get everyone onto a table and talk, talk, talk. Or as they used to put it in old fashioned Americanese, it is better to jaw than to war. The big success story of this mantra of course is the west Asia peace process, the entente between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. If you can make a Jew and a Palestinian talk, you can open up a dialogue between God and Lucifer without problem. Therefore the U.S. president, Mr. Bill Clinton, and his Oxford friend and present U.S. assistant secretary of state for south Asia, Ms. Robin Raphel, have decided that the time has come to make India and Pakistan talk to Kashmiris about Kashmir and to each other about this and other topics. If only this wide world, full of all sorts of different characters, was so amenable to one plastic code. Sadly this is not so. Kashmir and Palestine are not in the same place. You cannot even will them to be the same. Palestine now remains in the last, if most tortured, item on an agenda which has gradually been edging towards a resolution after three major wars and one momentous peace--though the latter was only between Israel and Egypt. Any change in the status quo will be the beginning of problems rather than the end of them. If there is a comparison, and it is not a too steady one at that, then it is with the former constituent republic of Yugoslavia, Bosnia. When a hundred Bosnias erupt all across India as Muslims pay the price for Mr. Clinton's theatrics, where will Ms. Raphel's concern for human rights get us? The problems of Kashmir cannot be separated from the events of 1947. Even more so the problems cannot be separated from the legitimacy of the rationale of the partition and all that went with it. If the United States puts its weight behind the idea that Hindu and Muslim can never live together in the Indian sub-continent then we are staring at a tragedy of gruesome proportions. There is no force in the world large enough to control an India blazing with communal hatred. Perhaps this is why Ms. Raphel is also seeking to change history when she suddenly begins to question the legality of Kashmir's accession to India. Such a policy is madness. Good intentions are a poor excuse for irresponsibility of this magnitude. A little more reading of the facts, a touch of larger vision, would certainly help Washington. Words these days mean lives. We should take neither lightly. *
