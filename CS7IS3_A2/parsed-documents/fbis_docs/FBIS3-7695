In their plans, the automakers came up with financial targets concerning their purchases, because they took into account the ongoing bilateral frictions over the automobile sector. In trying desperately to avoid having their targets be considered commitments, however, automakers are trying to put across their individual plans through such means as setting different fiscal years as their respective target periods. While praising such efforts by the private sector, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] remains very sensitive to how the United States will now respond, saying that "the atmosphere in Washington is quite severe" (as stated by a top MITI official). Although the five automakers' procurement plans cover all overseas products, they focus primarily on importing more auto parts and completely assembled automobiles from the United States. Automakers have avoided disclosing their data on past purchases, and they have also set different fiscal years as target periods. However, if we dare add up all the figures listed in the automakers' finalized purchase plans, the total purchases of auto parts come to approximately $23 billion. This figure surpasses the target figure of $17.8 billion which the five automakers had to share and meet when it was announced during U.S. President George Bush's visit to Japan in 1992 that Japan would "purchase $19 billion worth of auto parts in fiscal year 1994." However, the figure falls far short of the expectations of the U.S. automobile industry, which is "demanding a 30-percent annual increase." Consequently, concerns have been voiced doubting the effectiveness of the latest voluntary purchase plans in resolving the bilateral automobile trade dispute. However, there are some advantages for Japanese makers of fully assembled automobiles to purchase U.S. auto parts. Among crucial parts, for example, antilock braking systems (ABS) "made in the United States are 80 percent less expensive than those made in Japan" (as stated by a Toyota Motor Corporation official). On the backdrop of the yen's appreciation against the dollar and the recovery of U.S. auto parts manufacturers, Japanese automaker officials recently confessed that "if we really wanted to, there are many U.S. auto parts that we could buy." The problem, however, is that automobile exports -- which have been the mainstay of the Japanese automobile industry -- are continuing to drop. Due to declining exports, the domestic production of automobiles by the Honda Motor Company, Ltd. is expected to drop from 1.2 million units in 1992 to around 1.06 million units in 1994. Because the outlook is also uncertain for domestic automobile sales, automakers find it difficult to boldly announce plans to import more auto parts. While maintaining that "there may be adjustments in automobile production" (as stated by a Mazda Motor Corporation official), automakers express strong concerns that their voluntary target figures may assume lives of their own and become commitments. Meanwhile, it is expected that the United States will now ask Japan to sell more fully assembled U.S. automobiles in its markets rather than U.S. auto parts because this would lead to a more direct increase in profits.
