"We may have to consider first pushing reform bills through in the current Diet session and then modifying the laws in the next session," said the official of the largest party in the coalition government, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the coalition has to "make a political promise" to the opposition on future amendments of the laws in return for securing passage of the bills in the current Diet sitting, which ends January 29. The political reform measures won approval of the House of Representatives in mid-November and are pending in the House of Councillors. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has vowed to get the bills passed in the current extraordinary Diet term, but the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party is trying to prevent their passage. The proposed reform legislation is intended to introduce a new system for lower house elections and tighten controls on campaign funding.
