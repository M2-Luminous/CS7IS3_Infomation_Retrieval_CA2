A senior local Xinhua (New China News Agency) official has been given the responsibility of coordinating the fielding of candidates to the three sets of polls. The main job of Huang Zhizhao, a deputy secretary-general, is to liaise with the three district offices of the de facto embassy which handle district-level matters in Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories. A more senior-level working group to be headed by Zheng Guoxiong, a Xinhua vice-director, will be formed to map out the overall strategy for pro-China forces in the elections for the district boards, the two municipal councils and the Legislative Council. Mr Zheng is in charge of organisational matters within Xinhua-- the most politically sensitive and secretive work of Beijing's establishment in Hong Kong. A source said yesterday that Mr Huang had been working behind the scenes for months to strengthen coordination among the three district offices. One of the major tasks of the district offices was to identify pro-China supporters to stand for district and municipal-level polls, he said. Community staff from the offices will liaise with different candidates to avoid direct conflict within the pro-China circle, the source said. "Staff of the district offices have often raised the question of whether there are good candidates for the forthcoming elections... Such activities have not come to a halt because of the political row," the source said. Contrary to previous speculation, the pro-China camp would not boycott the elections, he said. Although Chinese officials have yet to spell out whether pro- China figures should take part in the polls, political groups considered sympathetic to Beijing, such as the Democratic Aliiance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), have said they will join the fray. A DAB core leader said the party would field about 50 to 100 candidates to contest the 300-plus seats in the district polls next year. "It's out of the question that we should or would boycott the elections. No one has disputed that. We ought to seize the opportunity to strengthen our links at district levels," said Cheng Kai-nam. In addition to the DAB, leaders of traditional pro-China associations as well as kaifong groups will form the major component of the left-wing forces. Some pro-China figures said the scale of participation of pro- China candidates in the next three-tier polls would be the largest ever. One veteran left-wing leader said he expected pro-China candidates to contest more than half the district seats next year. Although some candidates might prefer standing in the polls as independents especially in district board elections, he said many are set to seek backing from the pro-China camp.
