In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Sunday, Vladimir Kazimirov, head of the Russian delegation to the talks, expressed satisfaction with the negotiations, stressing that both sides consider as inadmissible any attempts to internationalise the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. The participants in the talks agreed to take practical steps and act together if need be in order to end the bloodshed and stabilise the situation in the war zone. Iran and Russia are ready to support constructive moves by international organisations and separate countries in this direction, Kazimirov said. Over the last two days Kazimirov met with Iranian [Deputy] Foreign Minister Mahm'ud Va'ezi and Iranian Foreign Ministry department for the CIS and the Caucasus Morteza Bank. [sentence as received] Russia is acting as a mediator in the conflict settlement in the disputed enclave. It channels its efforts in several directions: Mediation proper, activities within the framework of the Minsk talks of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as active contacts with the states interested in ending the bloodshed because of their geographical closeness to the war zone, Kazimirov said. "Within this context we continue enhancing mutual understanding with Iran, whose borders are now close to the war as never before," Kazimirov said. He stressed that the talks have revealed the closeness of the two countries' approaches to and assessments of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. An agreement has been reached to maintain regular contacts and take concrete steps to resolve the conflict. Kazimirov noted that Russia will continue "persistent" mediatory efforts in order to reach a concrete and binding agreement on ceasefire and termination of hostilities. This will pave the way for solving many other problems caused by the conflict, including the withdrawal of troops from the occupied territories, the return of refugees to the places of their permanent residence, resumption of transport services and energy supplies, and acceleration of the negotiation process on the whole. Kazimirov's visit has been initiated by the Russian side, following a new aggravation of the conflict. The Russian envoy is expected to leave Tehran on Monday.
