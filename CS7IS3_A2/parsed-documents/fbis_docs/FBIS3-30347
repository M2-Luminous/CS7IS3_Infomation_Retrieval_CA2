Krajisnik said on Radio Jagodina (central Serbia) that the RS leadership "most categorically denies the reports circulating in U.S. circles that Army of Yugoslavia (VJ) units are crossing into the RS armed or unarmed to fight on the Serb side in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina." Co-chairman of the international conference on the former Yugoslavia Thorvald Stoltenberg said in New York on Monday there was no evidence that there were Army of Yugoslavia troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Krajisnik said it was true that the Muslim side had declared a longlasting war on the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats. He said the Bosnian Serbs were preparing to defend their territory, and the RS supreme command had proclaimed a (general) mobilization on Monday to that end. "Our mobilization should be understood as a preventive response to the Muslim side's commitment to a longlasting war," Krajisnik said. He set out that the purpose of the mobilization was, among other things, to distribute the burden of the war among all RS citizens. Krajisnik said he would meet again soon at Sarajevo airport with Bosnian Muslim Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. "The purpose of our meeting will be to replace the war option with a negotiating one, and I hope the meeting will be successful so that we could have concrete results in Geneva on February 10 (in the resumption of the peace talks)," Krajisnik said.
