FBIS4-51884 "dreas086_c_94038" FBIS-EAS-94-086 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 North Korea Writers Urged To Participate in Conference Writers Urged To Participate in Conference SK2704231594 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1501 GMT 27 Apr 94 SK2704231594 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Central Committee of the General Federation of the Unions of Literature and Arts of Korea called upon all the literary and art organizations, patriotic writers and artists in South Korea and abroad aspiring after national independence and reunification of the country to make a bold decision to participate in a national conference and actively lead other political parties, organizations and individual figures to join them. In a statement today the spokesman said the Kim Yong-sam group's opposition to the proposal of a national conference initiated by a joint meeting of the DPRK Government, political parties and public organizations is, in essence, intended to conceal their flunkeyist, treacherous nature and monopolize North-South dialogue. "The South Korean authorities claiming to be 'civilian' have blocked all dialogues and contacts between political parties, organizations and individual personages," the spokesman said, adding: "This clearly shows that they do not want national reconciliation and unity but seek to prolong their remaining days as henchmen of outside forces."
