A document made public in Bishkek points out that "the extremely grave crisis situation" has made them take this step. The parties demand, in particular, that measures be taken to halt the production slump, that key state management posts be filled by specialists as soon as possible, regardless of their nationality or tribal allegiance, and that pensions and benefits for the needy be increased. The document also demands that the government devote the maximum attention to carrying out spring field work.
