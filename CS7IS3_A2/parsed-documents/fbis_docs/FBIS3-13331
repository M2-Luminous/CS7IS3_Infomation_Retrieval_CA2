President Clinton, in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly on September 27. 1993, said: "Bloody ethnic, religious and civil wars were raging from Angola to Caucasus to Kashmir." On October 29, 1993, Robin Raphel, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, at a "background briefing' for the South Asian journalists, observed: "We do not recognise the instrument of accession as meaning that Kashmir is for ever an integral part of India....The people of Kashmir have got to be consulted in any kind of final settlement of the Kashmir dispute." A clarification, subsequently issued by the State Department, confirmed what was stated by Raphel. It did not change the content of the dish but merely the manner of serving it. On December 27, 1993, President Clinton wrote to Ghulam Nabi Fai, 'Executive Director', Kashmiri-American Council, saying that he shared the latter's concern for human rights and looked forward to working with him to help bring peace in Kashmir. In reply to a letter from Congressmen Gary Condit and 15 others, President Clinton observed: "I am aware of the chronic tensions between the lndian Government and the Sikh militants, and share your desire for a peaceful solution that protects Sikh rights." All these statements and letters, issued in a short span of about four months, clearly point to the direction in which the wind is blowing. President Clinton's address to the U.N. Assembly where he virtually equated Kashmir situation with that prevailing in former Yugoslavia and Somalia; his warm response to Fai, a self-styled interlocutor whose activities are funded by Pakistan, and who is fuelling terrorism in the Kashmir Valley; his reference to Sikh rights as if Sikhs are not like other Indian citizens; and Raphel's highly provocative observations, questioning even the validity of the Instrument of Accession, are all manifestations of U.S. increasing disposition to ignore Indian sensitivities, lean towards Pakistan and indicate, in the process, a subtle preference for independent or semi-independent Kashmir. There are other straws in the wind which point in the same direction. On September 27-28, 1993, the Kashmir Bar Association organised a "Lawyers Meet" at which a series of resolutions were passed. One resolution (No. 5) says that the people should be given 'an option not to accede to either of the two countries, India or Pakistan'. Reading between the lines, it is evident that public opinion is being created to secure modification of the U.N. resolutions and provide for the 'third option' -- independent Kashmir. Efforts of this nature, there are reasonable grounds to believe, are being surreptitiously encouraged by U.S. policy-makers. For the last two years, the U.S. Institute of Peace, Washington, a 'think tank' funded by U.S. Congress, has been showing inordinate interest in Kashmir affairs. In continuation of the January 1993 meeting, another meeting was organised by the Institute in January 1994 and 15 non-officials from India, Pakistan and `both parts of Kashmir', who are believed by the Institute to exercise influence over public opinion were invited. The `framework' papers and pattern-of discussions, albeit informal, seem to suggest that the `position, of Kashmiris as central actors' need to be given a `top slot'. The intention was clear. It was to prepare a background for a change in the thinking of both India and Pakistan. One of the Indian participants, in an article written after the Washington meeting, argued: "How long can India be indifferent to the status damage it suffers as a result of the continuing blood-letting in Kashmir?". Earlier, some academicians like Prof Cohen who have a substantial say in the formation of American policy on South Asia had begun arguing that "the road to accession to Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] runs through Kashmir", implying thereby that India's current difficulties with regard to the Valley could be used to pressurise it to sign the NPT. Taking an overall view of the situation and long-term interests of the US in the region, its policy-makers seem to be seriously thinking that it would be best to have an independent or semi-independent Kashmir. Such a state could serve as an effective instrument for putting pressure on China, if the need for doing so arises in future. It could also help in acquiring a stronger foothold in five Central Asian Republics and manipulating events in Russia to prevent an unfriendly power-structure emerging there once again. Pakistan could become a client state to a greater degree and India's arm twisted more forcefully to sign the NPT. The United States is seeing new opportunities for itself in the troubled waters of Kashmir and it is moving, albeit unobtrusively, to seize these. Its basic objective is to remain as the only superpower in the world. President Clinton, in his address to the U.N. General Assembly, made it clear: "The United States intended to remain engaged and to lead". An influential section of American academics have also been arguing that the "bear may be dead but snakes and scorpions still roam". If India encourages U.S. moves on Kashmir with a determined stand and by mobilising strong opinion in its favour, the U.S. could well abandon or modify the course it has presently taken. After all, Washington cannot afford to incur the hostility of a nation of 880 million people. In this connection, it is worth recalling that when the die-hard Tory members of the British Parliament, like R. A. Butler and Winston Churchill tried to browbeat India by espousing the cause of the Nizam of Hyderabad, the `faithful ally of the empire', Sardar Patel firmly told them not to stand by the `old world' . He made it clear: "It is only in goodwill spirit, and not on the malice and venom of Mr Churchill's tongue, that an enduring relationship of friendship can be built between India and Britain and other members of the Commonwealth." He thus successfully prevented Hyderabad, which he described as an 'ulcer in the abdomen of India', from becoming cancerous. Such a forthright and fearless stand towards Washington's new posture, I am sure, would help India in retrieving the situation, besides sending the right signals to the secessionists in the Valley. Unfortunately, India is taking a characteristically meek stand. When President Clinton wrote to Fai, virtually ignoring the savagery of terrorism in Kashmir, I wish someone from our foreign office had invited his attention to what Senator Jackson said when the safety of American citizens was itself under terrorist threat. Jackson observed: "The idea that one person's terrorist is another's freedom fighter cannot be sanctioned. Freedom fighters or revolutionaries do not blow up buses containing non-combatants; terrorist murderers do. Freedom fighters do not assassinate innocent businessmen or hijack and hold hostage innocent men, women and children; terrorist murderers do. It is a disgrace that democracies should allow the treasured word 'freedom' to be associated with acts of terrorists."
