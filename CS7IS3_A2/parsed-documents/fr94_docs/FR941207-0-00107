FR941207-0-00107 FR941207-0-00018 A technical review of the 1994 plan is further discussed within the August 30, 1994 TSD. The following discussion includes summaries of the 1994 submittal's completeness determination, adherence to the Act's part D, section 172(c) nonattainment plan provisions, and the technical review that USEPA conducted. (A). Completeness Determination States are required to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan revisions for submission to USEPA. The Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. The USEPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further USEPA review and action. The USEPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The State of Wisconsin held a public hearing on September 13, 1994 to receive public comment on the implementation plan for the Rhinelander SO 2 nonattainment area. Following the public hearing, the plan was adopted by the State and signed by the Governor's designee and submitted to USEPA on October 21, 1994 as a proposed revision to the SIP. The SIP revision was reviewed by USEPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, and was found to be complete. A letter dated November 8, 1994 was forwarded to the Director, WDNR, indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. (B). Nonattainment Plan Provisions (Act Part D, Section 172(c)) With this submission, Wisconsin will have a fully approved SO 2 SIP meeting all of the applicable Part D requirements for the Rhinelander nonattainment area. The following discusses how the submission complies with the pertinent provisions of section 172(c), which sets forth the requirements for Part D SO 2 SIPs. Section 172(c)(1) In General_The plan complies with the requirements to implement reasonably available control measures by providing for immediate attainment of the SO 2 NAAQS through the emission limits and operating restrictions imposed on the source by Consent Order AM&hyph;94&hyph;38. By providing for immediate attainment, the plan also satisfies the requirements of section 192(b) that provide for attainment by November 15, 1995. Section 172(c)(2) RFP_Reasonable further progress is achieved due to the immediate effect of the emission limits and plantwide cap that is discussed within the plan. Section 172(c)(3) Inventory_An inventory of the actual SO 2 emissions from the stoker and cyclone boilers has been provided and is found to be acceptable. Section 172(c)(5) Permits for New and Modified Major Stationary Sources_Any new or modified sources constructed in the area must comply with a State submitted and Federally approved New Source Review program. The State currently has an approved Federally delegated program. Section 172(c)(6) Other Measures_The plan provides for immediate attainment of the SO 2 NAAQS through the emission limits and operating restrictions that are set forth within Consent Order AM&hyph;94&hyph;38. By adhering to more stringent limits for the stoker boilers and presently setting an overall plantwide emission cap, the area should continue to attain the SO 2 NAAQS. Section 172(c)(7) Compliance with section 110(a)(2)_This submission complies with section 110(a)(2). With respect to section 110(a)(2)(K), under which USEPA generally requires modeling in the case of SO 2 , USEPA notes that the Industrial Source Complex (ISC) model used by WDNR has been shown to underpredict ambient SO 2 concentrations in the Rhinelander area, especially on known exceedance days. Therefore, as described in more detail below, in this instance, an alternative methodology using the rollback analysis was needed and has been used. Section 172(c)(8) Equivalent Techniques_Since modeling attainment of the SO 2 NAAQS is not achievable, an alternative methodology using the rollback analysis to set a plantwide emissions cap was required. This is further discussed within the August 30, 1994 TSD. Section 172(c)(9) Contingency Measures_A plan should be provided for the implementation of specific measures if the area fails to make reasonable further progress (i.e., contingency measures), or to attain the primary NAAQS referenced above. The State Implementation Plans; General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (General Preamble), which was proposed within the Federal Register on April 16, 1992, provides guidance on SIP requirements for SO 2 nonattainment areas. The General Preamble discusses contingency measures for SO 2 controls that fail to attain the NAAQS. Therefore, USEPA interprets ``contingency measures'' for SO 2 to include the ability to rely on comprehensive State programs to identify sources of violations and to undertake an aggressive follow-up program of compliance and enforcement. Wisconsin Administrative Code, State Rule NR 404.05(6) dictates that the NAAQS may not be exceeded within the State of Wisconsin. Wisconsin State Rule NR 404.08(2) allows the State to be more restrictive with emission limits than those prescribed within an implementation plan or air pollution control rules where emissions cause or substantially contribute to exceeding an air standard in a localized area. The USEPA notes that through the issuance of Consent Order AM&hyph;94&hyph;38, the State has used these rules in context of the Rhinelander area SO 2 exceedances. These exceedances were determined to be the result of excess SO 2 emissions from the Rhinelander Paper Company. The USEPA believes that the existence of these state rules and WDNR's program to implement them satisfies the requirements of section 172(c)(9). (C). Review of Technical Merits of Plan (1). Emission Limits/Plantwide Cap: Due to ISC's apparent underprediction of ambient SO 2 concentrations, the State used the rollback analysis to determine appropriate emissions limits for the source. A rollback analysis takes a monitored ambient exceedance recorded during a specific set of facility operating conditions and determines the amount of the exceedance due to each of the source's SO 2 emitting operations in use at that time. These estimates are then linearly ``rolled back'' to acceptable SO 2 emission limits which provide for attainment of the NAAQS under that set of operating conditions (refer to 58 FR 326). At the time of the exceedance, the source was operating its cyclone boiler and only two of its five stoker boilers. A rollback analysis only accounts for those operations that were running at the time of the exceedance. However, the source requires the flexibility of using multiple scenarios of boiler operations for economic reasons. Therefore, the source accepted an overall daily SO 2 emission cap for the entire facility. This cap will assure protection of the SO 2 NAAQS, while still allowing for operational flexibility. For further discussion on the rollback analysis, please refer to the August 30, 1994 TSD.
