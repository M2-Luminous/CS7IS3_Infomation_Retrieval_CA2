As known, in the contact prior to this, we had put forth a new rational proposal which can open a breakthrough in the current deadlock in the DPRK-U.S. talks. In this regard, officials of the United States had made positive assessments. Nevertheless, in the 10 December contact, the U.S. side came forth with an alternative which denies our proposal. The U.S. side practiced magic as if its alternative was progressive, but as the spokesman of the White House officially proclaimed that there is absolutely no change in the U.S. position, in essence there is nothing new in the alternative. Considering the fact that the U.S. side said that it will accept our package deal method, we showed the maximum generosity we can carry out at the current stage. Nevertheless, when viewing the fact that the United States is continuing to insist on such an unjust position, we cannot but doubt whether it truly wants to resolve the nuclear issue or whether it is pursuing the plot to crush [apsal] us by finding fault with the nuclear issue, even though on the surface it is saying that it wants to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue. Moreover, the reason that it was inevitable for us to be suspicious about the agenda of the talks by the United States is that it continued to come forth with the issue of exchanging special envoys of the North and South as a precondition for holding the three-stage talks, which has no relation to the DPRK-U.S. talks, and intentionally delayed the resolution of the nuclear issue. We presented a momentous proposal to accept the inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency necessary to ensure the continuity of safeguards, a proposal commensurate with our special position of tentatively suspending the validation of the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, out of our basic stand to resolve the nuclear issue at source through the DPRK- U.S. talks. We cannot but be surprised at the fact that the United States is laying artificial obstacles again by linking the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South, an internal affair of our nation, with the nuclear issue in a far-fetched manner at a time when the prospects of a negotiated solution of the nuclear issue are in sight. If this is prompted by a change in the U.S. policy, we also must prudently reconsider our position toward dialogue [urido yoksi taehwae taehan uriui ipchangul sinjunghi koryohaeboji anulsu opta]. If the United States is thus not interested in the progress of dialogue and resort continuously to the tactics of pressure and delay, even if the third round of talks is held, we can hardly expect the package solution to be agreed on there. We cannot but be on our guard, in particular, because the United States, saying that this counterproposal is agreed on with its allies, is taking an attitude of putting pressure in the manner of delivering an ultimatum, saying that if we do not accept it, it will take the issue to the United Nations. If the United States behaves unjustly as it does, threatening our existence, thereby losing the last chance for resolving the nuclear issue through talks, it will be the United States that will regret it after all. Our position is clear. It depends entirely on the attitude of the United States whether the third round of talks is held and the nuclear issue is resolved.
