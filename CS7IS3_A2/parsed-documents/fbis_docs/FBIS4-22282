The customs code specifically envisages the creation of a special self-financing fund. In accordance with this, a statute on the extra-budgetary fund for the development of the Russian customs system was drafted, was approved by a government decree, and was officially circulated yesterday. The customs code created a new niche for Russian business developing under the patronage of the State Customs Committee. Of course, the customs service is not in dire straits. It collects fees for licenses authorizing the use of a particular customs procedure (for opening a customs or free warehouse, for example) or qualifying certificates (particularly those granting the right to act as a customs broker). The inclusion of credit institutions guaranteeing the payment of customs fees in the register also costs the banks a certain amount. Now these payments, along with the traditional customs fees, the proceeds from the sale of confiscated contraband and of property used as security deposits, fines and other penalties, will be used to set up a fund for the development of the customs system. The fund is called extra-budgetary, but the approved statute defines its resources as federal property and as part of the federal budget. At the same time, the fund will be managed and administered by the State Customs Committee and will not be subject to expropriation. There is an obvious contradiction here. It is clear that proceeds from the customs business will be budget revenue. As for the use of these proceeds, however, although the procedure for allocating budget resources for other than their designated purpose is extremely complicated, it would be wrong to completely exclude the possibility of a situation in which the Ministry of Finance might shock the customs service with the news that all of its money is gone. In short, the extra-budgetary status of the customs fund is extremely conditional. Only one thing is absolutely clear: The money in the fund will not be subject to capitalization, distinguishing it from a pension fund. Therefore, although the fund is certain to improve the life of customs service personnel, the use of this money will be subject to definite limits and could be opposed by the Ministry of Finance. [Box] The Customs Service Plans To Use the Fund for the Following Purposes: --to combat crime in the customs sphere; --to improve customs control and the customs registration of freight shipments; --to establish currency control and strategic export control; --to keep customs statistics; --to provide state agencies, enterprises, and citizens with information about customs procedures; --to strengthen the material and technical base and develop the social sphere of the customs system; --to build and renovate vehicle checkpoints on the border; --to build customs warehouses, temporary storage facilities, and other structures; --to finance measures connected with the financial and personal security and social protection of customs service personnel "in areas not covered by budget financing"; --to maintain the scientific research institutions of the State Customs Committee; --to finance enterprises of the customs system whose operations will supplement the fund; --to supplement resources for the financial incentives and sociocultural measures of customs agencies (no more than 75 percent of total wages).
