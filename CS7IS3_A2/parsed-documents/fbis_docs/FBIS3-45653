Han Zhubin, minister of railways, told a working meeting here today that due to insufficient funds, the ministry's initial plan is to invest 29 billion yuan in capital construction, of which 26.65 billion yuan will go to large and medium-sized projects, and 2.35 billion yuan to smaller projects. Han said that this year tracks will be laid on 2,100 km of new lines, with 234 km operational; 1,335 km of multiple tracks will be laid, with 1,293 km operational; and 194 km of rail lines will be electrified. Last year China's railway construction used investments of 22.5 billion yuan, 12 billion yuan more than in the previous year. Tracks were laid on 1,437 km of new lines and 1,073 km of multiple- track lines. To fill in the gap between available funds and actual demand for capital construction, the ministry of railways will further expand its use of overseas funds. A preliminary agreement has been reached with the World Bank on using its seventh railway construction loans, totalling about 550 million U.S. dollars; and a loan of 200 million U.S. dollars will be taken for the first time from the Asian Development Bank for building the Beijing-Kowloon Railway. The ministry is also negotiating with the Japanese Government on projects to use the fourth group of Japanese yen loans. Sources said that the yen loans -- equivalent to over two billion U.S. dollars -- will be used for key railway construction projects.
