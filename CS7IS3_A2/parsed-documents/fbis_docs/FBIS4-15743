"You know that Russia wants to join G7. Why shouldn't these two problems be linked? If we are invited to cooperate in political and military spheres, why shouldn't this be expanded to economic cooperation?," he said. Kostikov said it is a prerogative of the Foreign Ministry to decide who will sign the document on Russian joining of the Partnership for Peace program -- whether it will be Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev or it will be signed at a "lower level". "Bearing in mind unclear content and consequences of the `Partnership' program, the State Duma has suggested to sign the framework agreement at a lower level to have more space for manoeuvre," said Kostikov. He said his task is to spare the president and the State Duma of confrontation related to the discussion or ratification of the Partnership for Peace program. In this connection, Kostikov said that press reports on the program concept are useful as they help to make the topic more open.
