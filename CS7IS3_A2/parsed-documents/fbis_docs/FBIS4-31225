The essence of our proposals is that the deadlines and modalities of establishing a cease-fire should not lead to the freezing of the current situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Zubak said. Federation Vice President Ganic added that he expects a new round of talks at 1700, not with [Bosnian Serb leader] Karadzic but with Akashi and his team of military experts who are supported by cochairman Stoltenberg and a UN team. Secretary-General Butrus-Ghali and his special envoy Akashi had a meeting in the Palais des Nations this afternoon. They discussed the modalities and deadlines for a cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The United Nations is hoping that the cease-fire negotiations will begin today.
