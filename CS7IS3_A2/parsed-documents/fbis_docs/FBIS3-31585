Ion Iliescu and Adrian Nastase [executive president of the Social Democracy Party of Romania-PDSR]." In an article published on the front page of the aforementioned weekly, the PRM leader claims that "the information about Madame Roxana Sugurel (former secretary of Traian Chebeleu when the latter was working at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs -- editorial note), with whom the insatiable Chebeleu was caught in compromising circumstances inside the sanctuary of Cotroceni [presidential palace], were telephoned in to our magazine by an aide to President Ion Iliescu, whose allegations were also backed by a senator." After vilifying Traian Chebeleu once more, Corneliu Vadim Tudor launches a frontal attack against President Ion Iliescu, insinuating that he might also have been involved in similar sexual scandals: "Why do you defend his sexual escapades and aberrations, Mr. Iliescu? Do you want us to believe the similar press accusations against you on the same subject, regarding certain affairs you had when you were first secretary of the Central Committee of the Union of Communist Youth or on your various assignments in Iasi, Timisoara, the Ministry of Waters, or the Technical Publishing House?" Corneliu Vadim Tudor does not forget Adrian Nastase, either, who is picked as a target for the letter of support he has sent to the presidential spokesman. The PDSR executive president, Adrian Nastase, is called "sweetheart beatitude" (preafericitul bombonel), winner of the great "silver condom" prize. Finally, in the PRM leader's opinion, the two politicians, Ion Iliescu and Adrian Nastase, "are surely leading the country to new disasters."
