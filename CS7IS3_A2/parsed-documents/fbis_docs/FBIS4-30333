"We regret the decision," White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said in a statement, referring to the disbandment of the two-month-old minority government earlier in the day. "President Clinton and Prime Minister Hata enjoyed a good working relationship," Myers said. "The United States will continue to work closely with the government of Japan as only allies and friends can at a moment of political change." Hata's Cabinet resigned en bloc to pave the way for a new coalition with majority support rather than calling a snap general election. Hata will stay in office at the head of a caretaker administration until a new government is formed.
