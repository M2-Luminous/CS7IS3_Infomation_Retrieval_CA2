FR940224-2-00129 FR940224-2-00082 9. Applicants also propose to amend condition seven to eliminate the requirement that the securities comprising the collateral be valued at least equal to ``102% of the Maximum Purchase Amount.'' Applicants believe that neither rule 2a&hyph;7 nor relevant regulatory pronouncements require the collateral for the repurchase agreements to be valued at 102% of the Maximum Purchase Amount. Applicants propose to substitute the requirement that the collateral be at least equal to the amount (the ``Required Collateral Amount'') necessary to collateralize fully (within the meaning of rule 2a&hyph;7) a repurchase agreement in an amount equal to the Maximum Purchase Amount. Applicants believe that maintaining additional collateral beyond that necessary to collateralize fully a repurchase agreement reduces the relevant Fund's yield on the repurchase agreement to the detriment of the Fund's shareholders. 10. To permit FNBC, as each Fund's investment adviser, to invest anticipated net assets attributable to the ``sweep'' program on the same day that they are available for investment (despite the fact that the exact amount thereof will not be known until after the time for investment that day), FNBC or an affiliate proposes to enter into overnight repurchase agreements with each Fund. Such assets would be invested in shares of a Fund as of the time the Fund determined its net asset value (the ``Pricing Time'') on the same day the sweep occurs. 11. Each Fund proposes to enter into a master repurchase agreement with FNBC or one of its affiliates, which is substantially the same as the industry standard master repurchase agreement promulgated by the Public Securities Association, covering all repurchase agreement transactions (the ``Master Repurchase Agreement''). 12. To facilitate the repurchase transaction where the exact amount of the overnight repurchase agreement and, consequently, the required collateral is not known until the following day, FNBC, at no cost to the Funds, will maintain at all times in a segregated sub-custodian account in the name of each Fund the Required Collateral Amount. Each Fund will promptly notify FNBC of any increase or decrease in its net asset value and FNBC will adjust the amount of collateral maintained in the segregated account daily so that it at least equals the Required Collateral Amount for each Fund. The relevant Fund will have a perfected security interest in the repurchase agreement collateral held in such account. 13. If the cash balances swept into a Fund equalled the Maximum Purchase Amount, the required amount of collateral already would be held in the Fund's segregated sub-custodian account with FNBC's Trust Department and the Fund would have a perfected security interest in all such collateral notwithstanding the fact that the actual amount of the repurchase transaction would not be known until the computer records were received the next morning. If such cash balances were less than the Maximum Purchase Amount, the repurchase transaction would be over-collateralized. If such cash balances swept exceeded the Maximum Purchase Amount, the excess amount would remain uninvested. FNBC, however, believes that its experience in operating the ``sweep'' program and its daily consultations with other departments should limit the amount of funds being swept and thus potentially held uninvested. 14. FNBC's Trust Department will act as each Fund's sub-custodian pursuant to a sub-custodian agreement approved by each Fund's Board of Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who are not '`interested persons,'' as defined in the Act, of either FNBC or the Fund. 5 Each Fund's assets held by FNBC's Trust Department will be maintained in a segregated custodial account established on its behalf in accordance with the rules and standards of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Act. FNBC's Trust Department would receive the eligible securities transferred to it in its capacity as sub-custodian for each Fund and hold them in a manner complying with the requirements of section 17(f) of the Act. After the Completion Time that evening, for a particular fund, the records maintained by FNBC for its clients' accounts and by FNBC's Trust Department in its capacity as the Fund's sub-custodian would show: 5 The sub-custodian account may be maintained with FNBC's Trust Department or a nominee qualified to act as a custodian pursuant to section 17(f) of the Act and references herein to FNBC's Trust Department shall mean either entity.
