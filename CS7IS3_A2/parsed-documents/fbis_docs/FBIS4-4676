During the meeting, Mr. Takano promised that the Foreign Ministry will do its best to resolve problems arising from the U.S. military bases on Okinawa. The Foreign Ministry official is in Okinawa to tour U.S. military bases, and an F-15 Eagle fighter crashed during his stay in the island. It is said that during his meeting with Donald R. Gardner, commander of U.S. Forces Okinawa, at Camp Courtney, he asked the commander to conduct a "thorough investigation into the cause of the crash and take thorough measures to prevent a recurrence of such a crash." In response, the commander said, "I understand." During the meeting with Mr. Takano, Okinawa Prefectural Governor Ota said: "The Okinawans are increasingly reacting against intensifying live-fire exercises and flight training by U.S. Forces on Okinawa. The presence of Naha Military Port stands in the way of developing the free trade zone. Under this situation, the crash occurred and I have difficulty dealing with problems, including the crash accident, arising from the U.S. military bases in Okinawa." In response, Mr. Takano said, "The Foreign Ministry will do its best to smoothly resolve problems arising from the U.S. military bases on Okinawa."
