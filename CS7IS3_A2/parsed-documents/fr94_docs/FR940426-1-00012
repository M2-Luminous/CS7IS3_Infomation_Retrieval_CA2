Executive Summary The ability of corporations and other enterprises to finance their operations is critical to the development of the nation's economy, and the sale of securities is a principal means for obtaining capital. 1 The Commission has recognized that securities offerings involve risk and uncertainty, and that the pricing of an offering is not an exact science. 2 From its earliest days, the Commission and its staff have been called upon to implement the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') 3 to prevent manipulative activity in the context of securities offerings. 4 The challenge to the Commission in administering the Exchange Act in this context is ``to determine the extent to which market activities of participants or persons otherwise interested in the distribution should be prohibited or permitted.'' 5 1 Securities offerings in 1993 reached a record of approximately $1.1 trillion, surpassing the previous record set in 1992 of approximately $856 billion. See Siconolfi & Peers, No End in Sight for Underwriting Boom, Wall St. J., January 3, 1994, at C1.; Peers, New Issues Set to Hit Record of $1 Trillion, Wall St. J., December 10, 1993, at C1. 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 2446 (March 18, 1940) at 10, 11 FR 10971 (``Release 34&hyph;2446''). 3 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq. 4 The prevention of manipulation is one of the principal goals of the Exchange Act. See, e.g., section 2(3), 15 U.S.C. 78b(3). 5 Foshay, Market Activities of Participants in Securities Distributions, 45 U. Va. L. Rev. 907, 910 (1959) (``Foshay''). The Commission's principal antimanipulation provisions that apply to securities offerings, Rules 10b-6, 10b-7, and 10b-8 (``Trading Practices Rules'') 6 under the Exchange Act, are intended to assure prospective investors in a securities offering that the offering's price has not been influenced improperly by persons who have a significant interest in the success of the offering. Rule 10b-6 is an antimanipulation rule that is intended to prevent those persons participating in a distribution of securities from artificially conditioning the market for the securities in order to facilitate the distribution, and to protect the integrity of the securities trading market as an independent pricing mechanism. Rule 10b-7 prevents any stabilizing bid from being made to facilitate an offering of a security except for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the open market price of the security. Rule 10b-8 pertains to distributions of securities being offered through rights on a pro rata basis to security holders, and restricts the prices at which rights may be purchased as well as the prices at which the securities being distributed, or securities of the same class and series, may be offered or sold. 6 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;6, 240.10b&hyph;7, and 240.10b&hyph;8. Since these rules were adopted or last significantly amended, there have been significant changes in the structure of the markets, including the expanded role of institutional participants, new kinds of trading instruments and strategies, enhanced transparency of securities transactions, expanded surveillance capabilities, globalization of the markets, and transformation of the capital raising process. Over the years, the Commission has sought to address the effects of these developments. Although the Commission has amended the rules several times, the primary method of adapting the rules to changing circumstances has been through the exemptive, interpretive, and ``no-action'' letter processes. The Commission believes that it would be useful and timely to examine comprehensively the current regulatory structure and the concepts that underlie the Trading Practices Rules. The review is not limited, however, to these provisions, which concentrate on persons participating in the distribution process. Other persons also may have incentives to manipulate securities prices at the sensitive time surrounding an offering. In this Concept Release, the Commission solicits comment on necessary or appropriate regulation to prevent manipulation during securities offerings. Rather than proposing particular changes to the Trading Practices Rules or other provisions at this time, the Commission is seeking comment on the scope and direction that antimanipulation regulation should take in the contemporary context. In addition to providing views pertaining to revising and simplifying the present regulatory scheme, commenters are invited to consider alternative approaches for applying antimanipulation principles to persons who may have an incentive to influence artificially the market during an offering.
