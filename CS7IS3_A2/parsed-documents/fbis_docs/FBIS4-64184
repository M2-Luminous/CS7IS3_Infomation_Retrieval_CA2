Guests in the SAT-1 studio in Mainz and people in the main square of the east German city of Wernigerode, Saxony-Anhalt, who also participated live in the program, ask the chancellor questions on topical issues. After being asked by the SAT-1 moderator Heinz Klaus Mertes on how he feels, to which Kohl says that he is very well, the chancellor talks about the many upcoming international meetings. Kohl says that, at the moment, he was making efforts to ensure that "the majority of the European Parliament" will approve of the acceptance of the four EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries into the European Union. Bundeswehr Lieutenant Jochen Michels in the studio asks Kohl about planned Bundeswehr cuts, and the differences between Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, who has called for reducing the Bundeswehr strength to 340,000, and Foreign Minister Kinkel, who would rather leave the level at 370,000. Kohl says there are no "real differences" between Ruehe and Kinkel's views on the issue and sees "no major problem" in the coalition. Confronted with the reduced figures for Bundeswehr spending by the lieutenant, Kohl says "we cannot spend more than we have." The chancellor emphasizes that the Bundeswehr's tasks have "changed in a changed world," that more money is needed for the new tasks, and that the country's external and internal security must be ensured. Kohl says he has always been an "advocate" of the Bundeswehr, had "great sympathy" for the soldiers, and that "the soldiers will get what they need." The moderator then raises the issue of unemployment, with figures standing at almost 4 million unemployed at the moment. Juergen Grandisch, a member of the works council of an aircraft engines company at Limbach, criticizes the government's lack of concept for preventive measures against unemployment. Kohl contradicts: "I deny that altogether," and points to the "millions of new jobs" that have been created since he took power 12 years ago. He argues that current economic problems are partly the result of the loss of jobs in eastern Germany in the wake of unification-related changes. He points out that the "industrial base of the new laender has broken away" mainly as a result of the disappearance of the markets in the former Soviet Union. Kohl cites the example of a train car company in eastern Germany that was the "dominant producer" in the entire former East Bloc. In the main square of Wernigerode, Heiko Dietz, unemployed, voices his doubts about the economic upswing in the east and the promised jobs. Kohl says that it "cannot be denied" that the economic recovery is in "full swing." As far as the housing situation is concerned, Kohl says we "will build 100,000 apartments" in eastern Germany this year, more than ever before. Kohl adds that "thank God, unemployment has begun to stagnate." Kohl points to the higher economic growth in eastern Germany. The unemployed man insists that this is not true, and is invited by Kohl to accompany him on one of his regular trips through the new laender where he would show him that "things are improving slowly but surely." To a baker, who complains about investment problems in the new laender, Kohl says that this is a structural problem as "medium-sized enterprises" were "neglected" in the "40 years of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] regime." Back in the studio in Mainz, Peter Darter, a member of the works council of Mercedes-Benz, criticizes Kohl's job balance, saying that 4 million unemployed are 3.9 million too many. When he mentions the 1,500 jobs that were cut at Mercedes last year, and the 1,000 that might have to go in 1994, Kohl says that "the jobs in industry" cannot be seen as the "main responsibility of the federal chancellor." He complains that whenever things go well, the company managements claim all the credit, while they blame politics when things go badly. Kohl points once more to the high amount of public holidays and vacation in Germany, something "unparalleled" in any other country. The next person to ask a question is Rudolf Koschorz, a member of the works council of a chemical enterprise. Koschorz complains about the lengthy licensings periods in his industry -- 22 months in Germany, compared to only 22 weeks in France. Kohl says that these periods are indeed "absurdly long." Kaethe Lindner, a businesswoman from eastern Germany, took over her parent's company in 1990, and even increased the work force from 38 to 50 since then. Still, she would wish for an economic program for the small- and medium-sized enterprises, pointing out that higher equity capital could immediately create jobs there. Kohl does not answer Lindner's question directly, but says "I can only congratulate you on your personal attitude." He gives assurances that, "within a few years" the new laender will be "among the best economic centers in Europe." Dirk von Gehlen, a student, who will graduate from high school this summer, asks Kohl what he would train in if he were the student's age to have a secure future. Without giving a concrete answer, Kohl says that when he graduated from school in 1950, the situation was "quite difficult," too. He tells the young man that "you belong to the luckiest generation of Germans within living memory." Kohl adds, that "in all probability, you will not have to experience war and you will be able to enjoy peace as long as you live." Kohl says that things might be difficult now, but that the young man still has his "entire life" ahead of him. Ina Regel, an apprentice goldsmith, asks Kohl how the image of nonacademic jobs can be improved. Kohl says that he believes that the young woman will have "excellent job opportunities." Kohl notes that the traditional differentiation in Germany between academics and nonacademics is "stupid." He argues that "it depends on what a woman or a man achieves, and on her or his character" and not on the certificates they hold. Moderator Mertes shows several charts on income developments in eastern and western Germany since 1990, noting that real incomes in western Germany have fallen by about 1 percent, whereas in the new laender incomes in real terms are up 6.1 percent. Comparing the tax burden, Mertes says that of 1 German mark [DM] earned, 40 pfennigs had to be paid in taxes in 1990, while in 1994 it is 46 pfennigs. Back at the Wernigerode main square, a home owner criticizes the strong increase of taxes and local rates, pointing out that many people are forced to sell their homes. Kohl emphasizes the importance of maintaining private property, saying that "of course, I am banking on private property." Kohl argues that a great amount of repair work in eastern communities is simply costing a lot of money and that house owners have to "pay" their "share." Kohl points to the large transfer payments to eastern Germany, "almost DM150 billion" a year, and that this huge amount has to be earned "somewhere." He cannot promise tax cuts, but notes that "I am strongly in favor of reducing taxes as soon as we will have overcome the worst." Yet, "at the moment we need this money." A young mother asks why women with children are facing so many obstacles when they want to go back to their jobs, and what Kohl intends to do about it. Kohl defends companies, saying that most of them treat returning mothers "fairly." He states: "I deny" that women are in general forced to do less qualified jobs "once they return after maternity leave." Mr. Treisbach, a pensioner, complains about the pension regulations introduced after unification. Kohl says that compared to the DM400-600 the man received in the GDR and the 1,400 he is getting now, there is a "big difference," and that pensions are about to be increased soon, anyway. Back in the studio in Mainz, Mertes asks Kohl whether the Germans were maybe complaining too much. Kohl says that when people in eastern Germany are asked how they are now compared to before, "two-thirds" will say that they personally are much better off now, but that "the country is much worse off." The chancellor blames the media for creating this atmosphere, noting that the "lousy mood" of many is "false and hypocritical." "Abroad, not a single person" can understand all those complaints in Germany. Asked about the tax burden and the planned solidarity surcharge by Mertes, Kohl says that he is absolutely in favor of phasing out the solidarity surcharge "at the earliest possible time" but adds that "I strictly reject" mentioning a year because "I will never again be accused of a tax lie." In the election campaign he will tell people that "we need this money now" and that we will reduce taxes "as soon as we will have overcome the worst," Kohl said. "We want peace, we want freedom, we want social security, we want a modern infrastructure" and "all that cannot be had for free." Joerg Asmussen, a student of economics, asks Kohl whether the European currency will be introduced by 1997 or 1999, or even later. Kohl says that "we can replace the German mark only by a common European currency, a Euromark, that is as stable and as hard as the German mark." Kohl says that "this is a precondition under the Maastricht Treaty." If this should not be the case at the deadline the student mentioned, it would "not be a disaster." It will only be put off for a few years, because "we are fully under way on our path toward European integration." Kohl emphasizes again that "I am not ready to exchange the German mark for a European currency that does not have the same qualification or the same quality -- that is the important thing." Asked by the student whether he would like to succeed Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission, Kohl says "no, I am not crazy to take on such a burden now." He notes that "I want to become federal chancellor again." Thomas Suewelack, a chocolate producer, complains about bureaucracy in Germany. "Despite the irritation, which I am feeling myself at times," Kohl emphasizes that he is in favor of compliance with regulations, something that has contributed to Germany's high competitiveness and good reputation. The moderator asks Kohl to ask the people in Wernigerode a question, and Kohl investigates whether five years ago they thought that German unity would be achieved so quickly. Two women say that nobody would have expected it five years ago. A man stresses: We have achieved freedom through our own fight. Kohl calls for modesty saying "that you and I would not have achieved anything, unless Gorbachev, and U.S. President George Bush had said yes to German unity. They were the two most important men." Kohl adds that "the Germans themselves have also contributed to it, both in the GDR and the FRG." Hinting to the Bundeswehr officer in the studio, Kohl emphasizes that without "many of those who risked a lot in the era of the Cold War and the arms race and stabilized NATO, German unity would not have been achieved either." At the end of the program, the moderator asks Kohl whether, right now, he is proud of being a German. Kohl says: "I have always been proud. Why should I not be proud of being a German. After all, my pride has nothing to do with disassociating myself from others. You know this is a typically German question. If you asked this question of a French politician he would look at you with bewilderment." Mertes then asks the final question, about Kohl's dream of Germany. Kohl answers: "A reunited Germany in a united Europe; a Germany, which after the terrible experience of the first half of the century, including two world wars, Nazi barbarism, the bitter experience of a communist regime in one part of Germany, the GDR, that is now making contributions to peace. What I most appreciate almost every week, is when I have visitors from abroad, who say that the Germans have really become different: They help, they are open. And I think that this is good."
