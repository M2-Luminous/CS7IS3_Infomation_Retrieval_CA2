Terekhov, chairman of the Committee for Labor and Employment of the Novosibirsk Mayoralty, by Irina Kamenskaya; place and date not given: "No Unemployed With Tenure Have Been Detected"] [Text] The mayor of the city has approved the Program for Facilitating Employment of the Population in Novosibirsk. We asked Igor Yevgenyevich Terekhov, chairman of the Committee for Labor and Employment of the mayoralty, to comment on the most fundamental aspects of this document. [Kamenskaya] What changes have occurred on the labor market in the last year? [Terekhov] As of 1 January 1993, 6,500 unemployed were registered in Novosibirsk, whereas as of 1 April of this year--6,180. This is to say that the number of unemployed has not been growing, despite a slump in production. This is associated with employees of state structures going over to the sector of private trade (200,000 people since 1992). In addition, hidden unemployment exists, which in the event of an abrupt deterioration of the economic situation might become a destabilizing factor. The social breakdown of the unemployed has changed. In 1993 we referred to engineers, technicians, and clerical employees. At present workers account for 30 percent of those registered by the Employment Center. There are still complications with the placement of women in jobs. They account for 76 percent of the unemployed. One-third of those registered are under 30. The proportion of this age bracket is growing, as is that of people who have not turned 18 yet. [Kamenskaya] What is the outlook for the next few months? [Terekhov] The law on mass layoffs currently in effect envisions a certain financial load on enterprises in the event of their releasing large numbers of employees. This is a restrictive factor. People mostly quit at their own request, substantiating this by delays in paying wages. Of the 60 enterprises of the city that we checked, wages have been paid on time at only six as of now. Reinforcements are expected in the youth labor market. According to our projections, between 5,000 and 9,000 current graduates of educational establishments will be concerned about finding employment. [Kamenskaya] Does the form of providing assistance to unemployed depend on the situation on the labor market? [Terekhov] Yes. Previously we restricted ourselves to consultations at the Employment Center, whereas other forms of work are also in use at present. Their objective is to encourage self-reliance in those who are going through a difficult time. Of course, a number of measures to alleviate the situation of unemployed young people are envisioned separately. These are traditional forms: retraining, organization of public works, and also new forms--for example, half a year of on-the-job training for graduates of special secondary and higher educational establishments, incentives for entrepreneurs to create jobs for young specialists. We will prepare young people for commercial activities: instruct them in marketing and familiarize them with legal documentation. The plan is to provide financial assistance to novice entrepreneurs. In addition, a mayoralty decree on tax relief for this group of the population is being developed. [Kamenskaya] Tell us briefly about retraining the unemployed. [Terekhov] We have not given up retraining. Last year 700 people were trained in 20 occupations; 90 percent of them have been placed in jobs. To be sure, I will note that training costs us four times more than payment of benefits. [Kamenskaya] What is the vacancy situation as of today? [Terekhov] There are about 4,500 vacancies in the city. Engineer and technician cadres, clerical employees, and managers of various levels are sought. However, for the most part these are blue-collar occupations. Here is an interesting fact: There are about 50 vacancies for those with the occupation of accountant in the city; at the same time there are about 200 representatives of this profession among the unemployed. What is going on? Employers are not happy with their professional competence. As you can see, quality requirements for labor are now greater. [Kamenskaya] Do we have unemployed with a long tenure? [Terekhov] On average one succeeds in finding a job in four months. [Kamenskaya] How much does this program cost? [Terekhov] About 10 billion rubles, including the payment of benefits and support for planned projects. The program will be financed out of 2 percent transfers from the wage fund of city enterprises and organizations.
