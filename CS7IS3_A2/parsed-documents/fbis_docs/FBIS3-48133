Ruling coalition and opposition parties are expected to agree on the setting up the 20-member joint council at a meeting Monday night of the House of Representatives steering committee, they said. The House of Representatives will approve the establishment of the panel at a plenary session Tuesday. The council will be formed by 10 members each from both houses. The House of Representatives, which approved the bills in November, will select its 10 members from among those who voted for them. The House of Councillors will send 10 members from among those who voted against the bills. If two-thirds of the joint panel members agree on a compromise plan, the four bills can be enacted into law once they are endorsed by a majority of votes at plenary sessions of both houses of the Diet. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who has said he would take political responsibility if he fails to get the package passed, will put the bills to a floor vote again at a lower house plenary session if the joint council ends in failure, coalition officials said. Hosokawa explained his strategy during a meeting Monday of representatives from parties in his ruling coalition. The prime minister told the session that he is ready to meet Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], if Kono makes such a call. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a morning news conference that both the ruling and opposition camps need to hold frank talks and work out a compromise. LDP Diet Affairs Committee Chairman Sadatoshi Ozato told reporters the coalition parties should unify their position and promise not to take a vote at the lower house plenary session even if talks at the joint panel fail. Under constitutional rules, bills which were approved by the lower house but rejected by the upper chamber can be revived for legislation if the lower house passes it again by a two-thirds majority. The upper house voted down the package of four government-sponsored reform bills which among other things call for the introduction of a combination of single-seat and proportional representation districts for lower house general elections in place of multiseat constituencies. The reform bills also aim to tighten controls on political fund-raising to stem graft. Seventeen legislators of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest coalition bloc, sided with LDP members to reject the bills. At a meeting Monday, leaders of seven parties in the ruling coalition renewed their resolve to pursue enactment of political reform by the end of the current Diet session, the officials said. The coalition is determined to enact the bills as a package that encompasses antigraft measures, the officials said. The political reform bills will only be effective to wipe out corruption if they are enacted as a package, the officials said. The 90-day schedule of the present extraordinary Diet session was extended for 45 days beyond the initial deadline on December 15 to achieve Hosokawa's pledge to act on political reform bills during the current parliamentary session. The Diet session ends Saturday. Since taking office in August after ousting the LDP from its 38-year grip on power, Hosokawa has staked his political fate on enacting political reform. In the wake of Japan's political turbulence, Tokyo stock prices plunged sharply with the 225-issue Nikkei stock average plummeting 954.19 points to finish at 18,353.24.
