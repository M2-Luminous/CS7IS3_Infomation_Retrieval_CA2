There was no plenary meeting, but UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye and the troika of observers held a lengthy meeting with the Luanda team led by Faustino Muteka to discuss issues pertaining to the second round of presidential elections. This issue had already been discussed with the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] team on 15 April. It would appear that there were not too many problems and UNITA and the government managed to overcome some of their differences. However, no progress has been made concerning national reconciliation. Sources said that nothing major is expected until Luanda has responded to UN proposals concerning UNITA's participation in the government of the country. The two sides have decided to leave those matters for discussion at a later stage. Today is Sunday and there is no negotiation under way in Lusaka. The peace talks are scheduled to resume tomorrow.
