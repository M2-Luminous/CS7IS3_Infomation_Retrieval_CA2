But while turning down the demands, judge Anna Introini ruled that investigations into the accused would continue. Judicial sources said this was "because of serious indications of guilt." The arrests were demanded last week by prosecutors leading the Clean Hands corruption investigating, in connection with fraud and false accounting allegations. Berlusconi, head of the Go, Italy party [Forza Italia] in general elections due for March 27 and 28, immediately welcomed Wednesday's decision, saying that "justice had been carried out." The judge said she had decided not to order their arrests as there was no danger they would flee, or that they could tamper with documents involved in the investigation. Berlusconi, who has been ahead in some recent polls, has accused some of the investigating magistrates, above all Gherardo Colombo of Milan, of seeking to bring him down in the middle of an election campaign. The three Berlusconi officials involved are: Marcello Dell`Utri, the administrator for his advertising agency Publitalia, Romano Luzzi, who also works for Publitalia, and the director general of his Telepiu television channel, Valerio Ghilardelli.
