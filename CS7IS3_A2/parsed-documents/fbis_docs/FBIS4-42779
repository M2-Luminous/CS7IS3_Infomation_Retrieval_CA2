As AN leader Fini has rightly said, this empty, sterile upsurge against AN must be allowed to simmer down, to get the election campaign out of the way, and the facts left to speak for themselves, the facts being the actual conduct in government of our ministers and under secretaries, which will reveal the falseness of the many prejudices cunningly being spread to date. Indeed, it must be acknowledged that our foreign minister, Antonio Martino, has determinedly and effectively helped sweep away a lot of the preconceptions and misinformation in both the United States and Europe, which have been built up against the new governing majority over recent weeks. Martino's actions have also served a useful purpose in sending out precise signals to the international community as to the new government's intention to establish new foundations for Italian foreign policy which will make its premises and objectives clearer and more visible. The end of the Cold War; the breakup of the Soviet Union; the emergence from its ashes of new state entities over which the Russian Federal Republic wants to reestablish its hegemonic influence; the unification of Germany and its resumption of political and economic expansion toward East Europe and the former Soviet world itself; the implosion of the former Yugoslavia with the birth of the new sovereign states in the area and the consequent return to the traditional instability of all the Balkan states; Turkey's new bid for an international role and the resumption of its potential conflict of interests with Greece; the Palestinian movement's progress toward autonomy and its new relations with Israel; Iran's dynamic policy toward the new central Asian republics that used to form part of the Soviet Union: These are just some of the many issues that are inexorably forcing Italy, too, to redefine its geopolitical role in Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. The election of Mirko Tremaglia as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Chamber of Deputies is also significant in this connection, giving an unequivocal sign of the new, active attention that the governing majority is devoting to the matter of a nontraumatic, constructive revision of the Osimo Treaty and the reinstatement of millions of Italians who live and work abroad into the life of the nation. However, this is neither the time nor the place to discuss the foreign policy decisions that are a matter for the new government and its parliamentary majority. Although we fully agree with these decisions, they obviously remain outside our field of expertise. We merely wish to stress that any foreign policy adopted by the Italian state with the claim to be serious and credible and with the intention of successful implementation requires the use of effective instruments to carry it through, particularly in the economic and military spheres. Indeed, if it wants to acquire credibility abroad, Italy must prove itself capable of reducing the public deficit, of reversing the soaring growth rate in its public debt, of boosting its economy and, with it, employment and the national income. Only a country with a strong economy can play an incisive role on the world stage, where relations are governed by trade in goods and services, by exchange rates, and by the increasingly close socioeconomic links between the various geographical areas in the world, which has turned into a true "global village." A country without the proper credentials as to its overall economic clout in the concert of nations will perforce pursue a wishful, drifting foreign policy lacking credibility. Suffice it to mention the importance attributed nowadays to the area of economic and financial aid to the developing countries, toward which we must channel resources for the creation of local facilities for the production of wealth capable of absorbing the local workforce, which is otherwise destined to turn into waves of migration; and the higher the rate of demographic growth in their countries of origin, the wilder the waves will be and the greater the turmoil that they create. Suffice it to mention also the savings capacity, and the resulting investment potential, that an industrialized country with a strong economic structure can yield to defend its share of the export market and its imports of raw and semifinished materials. All these are vehicles for "showing the flag," for acquiring credibility when confronting foreign policy issues as well, and may be seen as the natural projection of vitality at home. But an appropriate specific weight in terms of the economy is not enough in itself for the pursuit of a credible, effective foreign policy. Credibility at the military level is needed as well, not, of course, to pave the way for aggressive policies, which have long ago ceased to be in our national interest, and, indeed to be part of normal international relations, especially now that we live in a "post-Cold War" world, beset as it sadly is by grave local and/or multiethnic conflicts that had been quelled for decades under the bipolar domination of the two opposing power alliances. The role of the United Nations, NATO, the Western European Union, and perhaps the CSCE in controlling and peacefully resolving all the tensions that have sprung up in the world -- and in particular those nearest our own doorstep, in Yugoslavia, the Balkans, northern Africa, and the Middle East -- can be backed up and enhanced only by credible military forces at the service of the economically stronger states, among which Italy rightly wishes to be numbered. This is why our country must have at its disposal -- to perform this role properly, without groundless ambitions and empty posturing, but with the serene awareness of carrying a weight commensurate with our strength -- a largely career-based Army, Navy, and Air Force equipped with modern defensive weapons and machinery and manned by motivated, fully trained personnel: a military instrument that is no longer overweight and bureaucratized (as it still is today), but lean, flexible, and rapidly deployed in response to the changing, and often unexpected, requirements of "international policing." Moreover, the factor that could weld economic structure and military structure together for the purposes of the new Italian foreign policy would be the revival of our disaster-ridden arms and military electronics and interception, aircraft, and shipbuilding industries. A lean, efficient, professional military apparatus cannot do without national industries to supply it with products produced alone or in international joint ventures, at least at the European level, as visions of protectionism in this field would be anachronistic now, given the research, development, and production costs typical of this type of product. Nevertheless, no clear distinction can now be drawn at a technical level between military and civilian output in many sectors of industry (electronics, for example): Either we give up national representation in the sectors concerned, thus clipping the wings of industrial development in the country as a whole, or we must agree to the production of military goods alongside those made for civilian purposes. A resumption of state arms procurement would thus make it possible to modernize our armed forces and turn them into a viable instrument of foreign policy and, at the same time, to set these sectors of industry, which have long been on the brink of collapse, back on their feet. (Moreover, most of the companies are publicly owned, and likely to remain so for a long time in view of the low profitability that results from the high level of investment and associated costs involved.) Lastly, as domestic demand alone will certainly not suffice to keep these industries working to capacity, our foreign policy (like, on a large scale, those of France, Germany, and Great Britain) should also be able to use the said industries to channel exports to its own specific purposes, without this contributing to the "gun running" logic that must never influence our objectives or our national interest. In conclusion, therefore, economic policy and military capability must be regarded as necessary premises for the foreign policy of the advanced industrialized country that is Italy; without them, Italian foreign policy would be in danger of remaining wishful and confused, and this is something that the government and majority can no longer afford.
