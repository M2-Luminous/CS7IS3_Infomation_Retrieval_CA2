This was announced by ZRS Chairman Jan Luptak, deputy to the National Council of the Slovak Republic for the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], in Banska Bystrica on Saturday [12 March], immediately after delegates to the Third ZRS Assembly approved, by an absolute majority of votes, the transformation of the ZRS, which has until now been a civic association, into a political party. The delegates confirmed Jan Luptak as chairman of this new left-wing party, which has 13,000 members. Jan Luptak stressed that, in a public opinion survey, as many as 85 percent of 1,264 respondents said that they would support the ZRS with their vote in the coming parliamentary elections. According to Luptak, this optimistic election forecast is based on the fact that workers' interests have so far been represented by political parties only haphazardly and expediently, whereas the ZRS bases its program on a systematic solution to the problems of people who are the greatest victims of economic reform. After the elections, the new political party intends to cooperate with the SDL and the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia [SDSS] and plans, among other issues, to initiate changes to legislation that is, in the opinion of the ZRS, directed against workers. This concerns, in particular, the Labor Code and the Law on Wages and Supplementary Payments. Within a short period of time, the party will address its potential voters by its own weekly--HLAS ROBOTNIKOV [Workers' Voice]. Both the editorial staff and the ZRS central bodies will be headquartered in Banska Bystrica. [Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 14 March on page 2 carries a 300-word TA SR report on the ZRS congress, which specifies that the "public opinion poll" referred to by Jan Luptak was organized by the ZRS itself and that it was conducted "chiefly among blue-collar workers."]
