Yesterday in Koblenz Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) appointed him as successor to Lieutenant General Helmut Hansen. At the same time, the 3d Corps, which is stationed in Koblenz, was dissolved after 37 years of existence and put into service as the new Army Operations Command. This restructuring is a "milestone" for the German Army, Ruehe said. At the same time, he stressed that the foreign and domestic policy challenges for the Bundeswehr have "clearly increased." Germany must remain a reliable partner in the international community. The main defense forces can be reduced in terms of "presence and readiness for action." At the same time, crisis reaction forces, which "can be deployed and transferred quickly," must be created. Ruehe paid tribute to Army Inspector Hansen as a "dedicated advocate of the troop." He has "essential credit" for restructuring the Army in unified Germany. Hansen will become the new commander in chief of the Central Europe NATO forces. With the Army Operations Command the Army for the first time has an instrument with which German Army units can be commanded at a purely national level in operations abroad. In the future, the Army Operations Command, the Army Office, and the Army Support Command are subordinate to the Army inspector only as the supreme commander for troop service. In contrast, the Army Operations Command plans and commands all Army operations. The inspector remains responsible for Army planning and remains a departmental head in the Defense Ministry. The first practical experience was gathered by the staff of Commanding General Klaus Reinhardt, who will remain in command as head of the Army Operations Command, during the mission in Somalia. The Army Operations Command in Koblenz has the following responsibilities: - Planning and preparation of operations under national responsibility. These are Bundeswehr operations for crisis prevention and settlement and also operations for humanitarian and disaster relief. In most cases, troops of other nations will also be involved. - Establishing readiness for action of the necessary contingents; - Commanding the operations of German Army units abroad; - The preparation and carrying out of military exercises and maneuvers at national and international level; - Cooperation with German civilian offices for the "territorial organization" of national defense.
