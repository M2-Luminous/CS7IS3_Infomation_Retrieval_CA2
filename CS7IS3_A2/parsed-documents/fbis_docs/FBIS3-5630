Mieno told a regular news conference that he wants to continue "carefully watching" conditions before judging whether signs of improvement can be sustained. It is too early to say whether such promising signs as partial improvement in consumption will prevail over such worrying indications as a gradually worsening job situation, he said. Mieno said, for example, that fiscal year-end factors apparently played a part in January's modest rebound in industrial production. "We'll have to watch a bit longer to judge sustainability and growth potential," he said. He said economic conditions differ from those of last spring, when the economy seemed to bottom out, only to slide further. Last year, there were more negative factors in the economic mix, Mieno said, adding that the economy was dragged down by the yen's sharp rise, bad summer weather and political confusion. The yen has recently been in "a state of remission" on the foreign exchange market, he said. Asked about recent rises in long-term market and lending rates, he said they will not likely have an immediate effect on the economy. Higher rates are "obviously" a minus for recovery, he acknowledged, but noted they were just one factor. Mieno said capital spending by smaller companies, which usually leads an economic recovery, will continue to slump. But he said their weak investment will not likely lead to further setbacks. Mieno said the central bank will consider economic conditions in taking "appropriate" policy steps, but he played down the idea that falling short-term rates signal an imminent cut in the official discount rate. Although market players consider it critical that there be a half-percentage point spread between the benchmark overnight lending rate and the discount rate, Mieno said the spread is not a decisive factor. He said, however, it would be hard to imagine the overnight call-money rate falling below the discount rate for a prolonged period. With the central bank taking a loose stance in funding the money market, the overnight unsecured call rate has recently moved around 2.1 percent, less than a half point above the 1.75 percent discount rate. Mieno repeated that for recovery to begin, it is not necessary for companies to have finished adjusting their balance sheets, hit by shrunken asset values after the bursting of the speculative "bubble" in the late 1980s. But, citing the U.S. recovery, he said that if a turnaround begins while balance sheet adjustments are continuing, it would be a very "slow tempo" recovery. Asked about rising public service rates, Mieno said they would not likely harm the economy, noting that overall prices remain very stable. On trade matters, Mieno said cutting Japan's chronically huge current account surplus would contribute to stable growth globally. He called for "leadership" from Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in implementing "bold" deregulation, which he said would directly reduce the imbalance by facilitating imports and would increase the chances for investment in Japan. He also urged domestic companies to "actively" develop new business. Mieno said fiscal steps taken thus far will help promote domestic demand-led growth, a key component in curbing Japan's surpluses, but he also urged further efforts from Japan's trading partners.
