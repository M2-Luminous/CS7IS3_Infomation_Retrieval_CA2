FR941116-1-00033 FR941116-1-00009 Medium-risk: A lender with a default rate in excess of 5 percent but not to exceed 10 percent would be assessed an insurance premium equal to 5 percent of the principal amount of any new loans made. High-risk: A lender with a default rate in excess of 10 percent but not to exceed 20 percent would be assessed an insurance premium equal to 10 percent of the principal amount of any new loans made. Ineligible: A lender with a fault rate in excess of 20 percent would not be eligible to make new HEAL loans. The proposed rates for holders included in paragraph (b)(4) would be as follows: Low-risk: A holder with a default rate of not to exceed 5 percent would not be required to pay an insurance premium. In addition, a holder whose volume of HEAL loans held (for purposes of the default rate calculation) is 50 or less, would not be required to pay an insurance premium. Medium-risk: A holder with a default rate in excess of 5 percent but not to exceed 10 percent would be assessed an insurance premium equal to 5 percent of the original principal amount of any loans newly purchased. High-risk: A holder with a default rate in excess of 10 percent but not to exceed 20 percent would be assessed an insurance premium equal to 10 percent of the original principal amount of any loans newly purchased. Ineligible: A holder with a default rate in excess of 20 percent would not be eligible to purchase new HEAL loans. The proposed lender and holder insurance premiums are the same as the school insurance premiums which were enacted as part of Public Law 102&hyph;408 and became effective January 1, 1993. The proposal to make lenders and holders with default rates greater than 20 percent ineligible for the HEAL program is also consistent with Public Law 102&hyph;408, which generally prohibits students at schools with default rates in excess of 20 percent from borrowing from the HEAL program at all. Since schools, lenders, and holders all play an important role in assuring the collectibility of HEAL loans, and all benefit from participation in the HEAL program, the Department considers it most equitable for all parties to be subject to the same basic insurance premium rate structure. This is also consistent with the Conference report language accompanying Public Law 102&hyph;408, which indicated that schools, lenders, and holders should assume and share the responsibility for minimizing HEAL defaults. Although the Department's proposed approach is modeled after the school risk-based insurance premiums established in the HEAL statute, the Department is interested in comments on an alternate approach which would create a more gradual continuum of risk-based premiums for lenders and holders. This alternate approach would be structured such that lenders and holders with default rates: (1) Greater than 5 percent but less than 6 percent pay a 1 percent premium; (2) Greater than 6 percent but less than 7 percent pay a 3 percent premium; (3) Greater than 7 percent but less than 8 percent pay a 5 percent premium; (4) Greater than 8 percent but less than 9 percent pay a 7 percent premium; and (5) Greater than 9 percent but less than 10 percent pay a 9 percent premium. This approach would still result in an average risk premium of 5 percent for lenders and holders in the 5&hyph;10 percent range, but would phase the penalties in more gradually and provide less harsh penalties for lenders and holders at the lower end of the default rate spectrum. The Department is interested in comments regarding whether this alternate approach would be considered preferable to the ``notched'' approach that is being proposed. A new paragraph (b)(5) would prohibit schools, lenders, or holders from passing their insurance premium costs to borrowers. Existing paragraphs (c) (1) and (2), which address the method of calculating the insurance premium for loans made before July 22, 1986, when premium amounts were determined based on the amount of time remaining until graduation, would be deleted and replaced by a new paragraph (c), which would set forth procedures for the collection of insurance premiums. New paragraph (c)(1), dealing with the borrower premium, would address provisions previously included in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2). This paragraph would state that the premium charged to the borrower must be collected by the lender through a deduction from the HEAL loan proceeds and is due to the Secretary, along with documentation identifying the loan for which the premium is being paid, no later than 30 days after the date of disbursement of the HEAL loan. It also would require the lender to identify clearly to the borrower the amount of the borrower's insurance premium. New paragraph (c)(2), addressing the school premium, would state that for schools required to pay an insurance premium, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the premium would be collected by the Secretary on a quarterly basis, and would be due to the Secretary no later than 30 days after the date of the quarterly billing notice. New paragraph (c)(3), addressing the lender premium, would state that for lenders required to pay an insurance premium, in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the premium, including documentation identifying the loan for which the premium is being paid, would be due to the Secretary 30 days after the date of disbursement of the HEAL loan. New paragraph (c)(4), addressing the holder premium, would state that for holders required to pay an insurance premium, in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the premium, including documentation identifying the loan for which the premium is being paid, would be due to the Secretary 30 days after the date that the loan transfer takes place. Existing paragraph (a)(3), which establishes penalties for late payment of the insurance premium, would be redesignated as paragraph (c)(5)(i). As amended, this paragraph would require that if the insurance premium due from a school, lender, or holder is not paid by the due date, a late fee will be charged in accordance with the Department's Claims Collection Regulation (45 CFR part 30). This paragraph also would prohibit the late fee from being passed on to the borrower.
