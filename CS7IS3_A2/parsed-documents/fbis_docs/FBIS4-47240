To losses which are serious for such a small population, the Karabakh are filled with determination to respond with "adequate measures" for surviving and preserving their gene pool. According to data provided by the Stepanakert ZAGS [Civil Registrar's Office], at the end of May 1994 the birth rate--although continuing to lag behind the death rate--is already gradually overtaking the latter. Since 1 January, 404 deaths have been registered (according to ZAGS Inspector Elmira Grigoryan, 90 percent of them perished at the front) and 320 births. Whereas during the prewar years men in Karabakh used to marry--as a rule--after reaching the age of 24 or 25, nowadays they are marrying at much younger ages, i.e., 18 or even 17, so as to leave an heir behind before going off to the front. "Karabakhians have now come to understand that having traditionally small families with one or two children was our biggest mistake." So states Boris Arushanyan, first deputy chairman of the NKR Council of Ministers. "Every family should have a minimum of four or five children. The leaders of this republic are attempting to provide a personal example. For example, my youngest daughter is three months old, and the chairman of the NKR Supreme Soviet had a boy two and a half months ago. We understand that things will be hard for these children; those who are now two or three years old were mostly born and grew up in cellars under shelling and bombing. However, we must give life to a new generation of Karabakhians." As noted by Mr. Arushanyan, the protectionist policy of the NKR leadership will proceed along two principal lines: one prohibitive and the other providing incentives. The former provides for introducing a ban on abortions in the NKR in the very near future. According to a law--the draft of which is now being considered and amended--it will clearly be forbidden for women under the age of 45 to have abortions, unless there are medical grounds. As to providing incentives for having many children, the government is introducing a system of benefits and creating privileged conditions. It will give families having three or more children considerable humanitarian assistance, to be obtained from charitable funds. An unprecedented method of providing social protection for children who have been deprived of a breadwinner is the institution of "posthumous marriages"--an institution that has been officially legitimized in the NKR. By a special edict of the NKR State Committee for Defense it has been decreed that in the case of a soldier of the Karabakh Army living in a common-law type of marriage before leaving for the front but not getting around to registering this marriage, and in the event he is killed, his widow--on a court decision--may be recognized as such in full accordance with the law. Accordingly, she--together with the children of the deceased--may receive the appropriate pension. Moreover, such cases cannot be called isolated instances. According to data provided by the Stepanakert ZAGS, of the 173 marriages entered into since the beginning of this year, one out of every 10 has been "posthumous." Measures have been undertaken to prevent the mass killing of children and youths during shelling and air raids. Specifically in connection with the April bombings by ground-attack aircraft of the Azerbaijani Air Force, secondary schools in Stepanakert were closed down for about a month. "We do not have enough children to risk having scores of them wiped out by a single bomb," the Karabakhians explain. Finally, attempts are being made to recall minors from combat units of the Karabakh Army of Defense. Whereas just a year ago the Army Staff Headquarters mentioned with pride a battalion made up entirely of 15- and 16-year old volunteers fighting in the Mardakert Region, nowadays Major Murad Petrosyan, the chief of the Army's Political Section, assures us that it is strictly forbidden to accept youths under the age of 18 for service and that the Staff has ordered the Finance Unit to exclude all minors from the lists of combat units. As of today, the exact number of Nagorno-Karabakh's inhabitants is unknown, but as a rule the approximate figure of 150,000 persons is cited. Nor has there been an official report of the total number of losses suffered by the NKR during the years of the conflict (unofficial sources proceed on the basis that the number of persons killed among the civilian population as well as among the combatants amounts to something like 5,000). Be that as it may, Boris Arushunyan, first deputy chairman of the NKR Council of Ministers, asserts the following: "The losses incurred by Nagorno-Karabakh during the years of the Great Patriotic War were much greater than they have been during the course of the present conflict. Therefore, even if we are now compelled to continue this war, I am confident that this will not bring our people to the brink of extinction."
