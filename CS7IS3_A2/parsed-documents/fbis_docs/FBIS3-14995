The huge debt for nuclear fuel for them from Russia has practically halted its deliveries and reserves are being used up. At No. 1 set of the South Ukrainian Nuclear Electric Power Station, for instance, its reserves are enough only till mid-May, and at a number of others for little more; and the Ukrainian press is already sounding the alarm about the destiny of the republic's nuclear power overall, even claiming that its nuclear power stations are dying. Is the situation really so alarming? I asked this question of Nur Rashitovich Nihmatulin, the first deputy chairman of Ukrainian Goskomatom. He explained: [Begin Nihmatulin recording] The situation in nuclear energy today is rather complex. We have worked fairly successfully in the autumn-winter season, producing up to 42 percent of the electricity throughout Ukraine. This is not because we raised the power at our atomic stations. It is because conventional power was forced to reduce generation of electricity owing to nondelivery of oil and gas. About 30 percent of the capacities were in reserve. But we are feeling a terrible shortage of deliveries of nuclear fuel. To date, we have not paid for fuel for four sets, and if this situation continues we will be forced to take out of circulation about 4 million kWh of capacity. That is one set at the South Ukrainian, one set at the Zaporozhye, perhaps even a second set at Zaporozhye, and lower the load on the Chernobyl atomic power station. Today, we consider that it is being resolved positively: There is compensation for the strategic weapons that will be sent off to enterprises in Russia, and on account of that strategic weaponry fuel is to be supplied for our reactors, and we hope that nuclear power will be alive and we will not have to take out of circulation a single set of a single station.
