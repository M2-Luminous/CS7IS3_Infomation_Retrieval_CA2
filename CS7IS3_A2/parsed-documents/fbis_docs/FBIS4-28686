Reporters of foreign newspapers, news agencies, and radio in Germany attended the news conference. The foreign minister, who spoke at the news conference, talked about our principled position on the nuclear issue -- including the essence of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, the replacement of fuel rods, and the method of resolving the nuclear issue -- and answered reporters' questions by saying: Over the past few years, the great leader Comarde Kim Il-song has already declared on many occasions that our country has no intention nor capacity to produce nuclear weapons. If we have them, where can we use them! The nuclear issue of our country has been raised because the United States has dealt with us from the beginning with its doubts on our peaceful nuclear activity. He stressed that because our country has a foundation of self- reliant national economy and a powerful defensive capability, no sanction steps can frighten us, and he continued: We demand that the United States respond to talks with its interest to peacefully resolve the issue. The United States should clearly know that if it does not come to the talks, but rather tries to resolve the issue with its pressure or sanctions, it will only aggravate tensions on the Korean peninsula.
