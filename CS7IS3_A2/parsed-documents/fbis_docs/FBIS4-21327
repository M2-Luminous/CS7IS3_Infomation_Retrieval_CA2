He has compiled information about the drug situation in Finland for a report covering the situation in 13 European cities. There are 500-1,000 drug users in Finland who use hard drugs. The figure is 10 times higher in the other Nordic countries. During the period studied, hundreds of grams of drugs were seized in Finland, while, in other parts of Europe, hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of kilos were seized. Death by poisoning is not caused by heroin, but by medication abuse, and of the individuals who are HIV-positive, only 10 percent are intravenous drug users. "In a civilized nation, the number of drug users does not determine the country's drug policy, but instead it is formulated from the perspective of the individual users. We have forgotten the users and their problems, and the few existing treatment institutions are fighting for their survival," emphasized Kontula. Drug users have been watched more intensely in Finland than in Sweden, and monitoring has been as extensive as the law allows. Drug users have been arrested, and their homes have been searched, in a way that Kontula does not feel would have been found appropriate in any other Western European country. Tighter Controls Needed "I would like to encourage the supervisory authorities to use more common sense than before, and to contemplate which would be more appropriate in lessening the negative effects, control or treatment. Drug addicts have become the victims of the policy chosen, and this has caused major problems for users," explained Osmo Kontula. In his view, the monitoring of users could be reduced and it could be directed toward cases "where the users themselves may experience problems, or where other criminal activities are involved." According to Kontula, at the beginning of this decade, Finland had three full-time drug enforcement officials for every drug user, while there was only a minimal number of treatment personnel. "Joining the European Union will increase the need to humanize the monitoring process and move the focus from customs and police services to the areas of social and health services. We moved in an opposite direction from the rest of Europe, when, during the last few years, we decided to reduce treatment facilities," he added. Narcotics Do Not Compete With Alcohol The Finn's intoxicant of choice is alcohol. Mixing alcohol and medication is a fairly common practice. The abuse of medical drugs is four times as common as the use of narcotics. Psychoactive drugs prescribed for medical use are also considered narcotic substances. According to Kontula, in the rest of Europe, only addictive drugs are considered to be narcotics. The drug problem is not very large, as there are still few displaced people in Finland. Another obstacle, in Osmo Kontula's view, is a feature of the Finnish culture where intoxication is a conscious means of establishing contact with other people. According to him, because narcotics lead to social isolation, they can not compete with alcohol.
