FBIS4-45078 "jpnea034___94027" JPRS-NEA-94-034 JPRS Near East & South Asia 27 May 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA U.S. Congress Vetoes Move Against India U.S. Congress Vetoes Move Against India 94AS0311E Bangalore DECCAN HERALD in English 27 May 94 p 1 94AS0311E Bangalore DECCAN HERALD English CSO [Text] EXPRESS NEWS SERVICE, Washington--It is a measure of the changing mood of the U.S. Congress that an anti-India move aimed at cutting development assistance to India was defeated unanimously in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives on Wednesday. U.S. development assistance and aid under the International Military Education and Training (IMET) is meagre -- slightly over half a billion dollars a year. For the past three years in a row, however, amendments to cut this aid have been routinely discussed in the house and used by India-baiters to make outlandish charges of human rights violations in Punjab and Kashmir. At the forefront of such moves have been India's bete noir representative Dan Burton of Indiana and some California Congressmen. Last year, representatives Dan Burton and Vic Fazio of California managed to embarrass India when a similar amendment to censure it on human rights violations was barely defeated (231 to 202 votes) in the House. This year too Rep. Dan Burton was flogging his usual legislative agenda. He moved two amendments to the Appropriations Bill. Had even one of them been admitted, there would have been an embarrassing debate in the House on India's human rights record. Embarrassing, because representative Dan Burton is given to making outlandish charges. For the past three years, he has been showing old, grisly photographs of some militants killed in Punjab, creating the impression that they were recent. A day before Prime Minister Rao addressed the U.S. Congress, he claimed in the House that "right now in North-Western India in a place called Punjab and in a place called Kashmir, 1.1 million Indian troops are gang-raping women." The Congressional response to the Indian Prime Minister's address to a joint session was positive. Rao's visit to the United States and his meeting with President Clinton also created the impression that the two nations were serious about improving their ties. There is also the fact that U.S. Congressmen are getting better informed about India, especially its economic reforms. This is the direct result of lobbying by members of the India Caucus led by Congressman Jim McDermott, by the lobbyist hired by India as well as by the big U.S. Corporations in the India Interest Group. Congressmen almost always listen to the voice of American business.
