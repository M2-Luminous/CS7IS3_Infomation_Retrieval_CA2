It is noted that Turkey has not yet signed the international treaty on the Law of the Sea. [passage omitted] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos made the following statement when asked to comment on remarks by Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller: Greece has its well-known sovereign rights, which it exercises within the framework of this discreet freedom.
