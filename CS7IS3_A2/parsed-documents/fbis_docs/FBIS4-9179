[passage omitted] After the television debate, Slovak President Michal Kovac met with Slovak journalists. He briefed them on the bilateral talks he had conducted in Litomysl. With Vaclav Havel, he spoke about the present state and prospects of relations in the cultural and civic spheres and about ways of preventing mutual alienation [between Czechs and Slovaks]. At the meeting with his Hungarian counterpart, Arpad Goncz, the two presidents agreed that the "Slovak card" should not be played in the coming election campaign in Hungary, and vice versa. Michal Kovac informed the Hungarian president that the present government would carry out adjustments to the designation of names of communities and surnames but that the issue of territorial and administrative arrangement would be postponed on the basis of an agreement reached with the Hungarian parties [in Slovakia]. While meeting the German president, Michal Kovac asked him to mediate a meeting between the German chancellor and the Slovak prime minister. With the Slovene president, they agreed that Milan Kucan would pay a visit to Slovakia in the second half of the year. According to Michal Kovac, the meeting in Litomysl was significant because vitally important issues of relations and the integration of the Central European region were discussed. As he noted, meetings like these can contribute to overcoming tension and possible disagreements that occasionally result from intergovernmental talks. [Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 18 April on page 1, in the "Single Question" column, carries the following reply by President Michal Kovac to Maria Sisulakova's question about his meeting with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz in Litomysl: "We agreed on further meetings, but, above all, we reaffirmed that we must not slacken the efforts to establish a good atmosphere at home and in relations between our states. We realized that the results of elections in Hungary and, subsequently, Slovakia might bring new and, it is hoped, positive aspects in this regard, in that they may establish prerequisites for us to also address other outstanding issues. We believe, however, that many issues could be tackled even now, before the elections in Hungary. This concerns problems of a specialist nature that have been needlessly politicized. In this regard, however, we had to take into consideration the fact that, in the matter of Gabcikovo, for example, the Hungarian parliament is bound by its previously adopted position. These issues can be partly clarified before the elections, but the more serious aspect--that is, the overall attitude toward the hydroelectric power project--can be changed only after the Hungarian elections."]
