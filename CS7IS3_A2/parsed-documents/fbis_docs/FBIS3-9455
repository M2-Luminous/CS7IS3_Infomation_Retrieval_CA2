This statement was made yesterday by Peter Koncier, the director of ZTS in Dubnica nad Vahom. According to him, the howitzer will be introduced commercially following the appropriate trials in the second half of this year. ZTS Dubnica arranged the development of the Zuzana howitzer in the past; therefore, it has the exclusive rights to the results of this howitzer's development as opposed to those of the older type, Dana, whose modernization is taking place concurrently with the development of Zuzana. The project to modernize the Dana howitzer, manufactured since 1979 for the unified 152-mm-caliber Warsaw Pact munitions, was arranged and financed by the Czechoslovak Army, and the two successor armies have a claim to the results of its development. The Zuzana howitzer belongs to the high-tech category, which fully corresponds to the highest requirements of the North Atlantic Alliance, and could, therefore, also be sold to Western armies. Director Koncier emphasized that the development of such a specialized system takes many years. The results of the development of one system are carried over into the development of the other as partial results. He also commented that the Germans have announced that they will bring a howitzer similar to Zuzana onto the market in 1998. Part of the Zuzana howitzer trial series is intended for the Slovak Army, which will support Slovak industry.
