Target of Bribery Probe Vice President, Director Arrested OW1801121494 Tokyo KYODO in English 1141 GMT 18 Jan 94 OW1801121494 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- Prosecutors arrested a vice president and a director of major contractor Obayashi Corp. on Tuesday [18 January] on suspicion of giving a 10 million yen bribe in 1992 to then Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii. Vice President Koreaki Hagihara, 66, and Director Juichi Konishi, 59, allegedly conspired to give the money to Ishii, 69, as a reward for favorable treatment in the awarding of public works projects, informed sources said. Investigators from the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office also raided the Osaka and Tokyo headquarters of Obayashi and other related sites in a search for evidence of suspected illicit payments. Obayashi President Takao Tsumuro apologized for the controversy but denied the company's involvement in the scandal. Obayashi is Japan's fourth largest construction firm in terms of sales, following Shimizu Corp., Kajima Corp. and Taisei Corp. The sources said the Osaka-based company is suspected of giving Ishii 10 million yen in October 1992 after asking him for favorable consideration in its bid for an 8.2 billion yen project to construct a waste incineration plant in Sendai, the capital of Miyagi Prefecture. The alleged bribe was also intended as a reward for his efforts in awarding such projects as building a subway station, the sources said. The money is believed to have been received on Ishii's behalf by his aide Mitsuo Moriya, deputy secretary general of the Miyagi Prefectural chapter of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who is under indictment in a separate bribery case involving former Miyagi Gov. Shuntaro Honma. Investigators suspect that Ishii, as mayor of Sendai, may have received a total of 140 million yen in payments from eight construction companies, including Obayashi, for alleged favorable consideration on project bids, the sources said. Ishii resigned as mayor soon after he was arrested last June. In a related development, informed sources said Obayashi's wholly owned subsidiary allegedly paid some 30 million yen in rental payments for a Tokyo office of senior LDP politician Hiroshi Mitsuzuka. The subsidiary shouldered about 500,000 yen a month for five years starting from December 1983, the sources said. Mitsuzuka, former chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs Research Council, has been elected as a House of Representatives member from a constituency in Miyagi Prefecture. Commenting on the arrest of Obayashi's executives, Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi said he thinks the series of arrests of top executives of general contractors represents "a structural problem" in the country's construction industry. Igarashi stressed the need for fundamental reform of the industry. After the arrests of the senior Obayashi officials, several municipal and prefectural governments announced they will suspend nominating the company as a bidder in public works projects. Kanagawa Prefecture and the city of Yokohama, south of Tokyo, decided to suspend nomination of Obayashi as a bidder for three months until April 17. Okayama Prefecture and Kitakyushu City, western Japan, imposed a four months' ban on the company's participation in public works bids.
