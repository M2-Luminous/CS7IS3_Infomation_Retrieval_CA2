FR941005-2-00077 FR941005-2-00048 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION Hart-Scott-Rodino Act Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and Regulations Thereunder; Notice Regarding an Increase in the Filing Fee AGENCY: Federal Trade Commission. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: On August 26, 1994, the President signed legislation into law mandating that a fee of $45,000 must be paid by each person acquiring voting securities or assets who is required to file a premerger notification by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The newly enacted law amends Section 605 of Title VI of Pub. L. 101&hyph;162, which mandated the collection of a $25,000 filing fee. The new provision increasing the filing fee to $45,000 became effective upon the President's signature, late Friday, August 26, 1994. The Commission is collecting the new fee for filings made on or after Monday, August 29. The Commission has issued this Notice in order to advise the public about the increase in the filing fee. EFFECTIVE DATE: The increased filing fee is due from acquiring persons submitting Premerger Notification and Report Forms on or after August 29, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard B. Smith, Attorney, Premerger Notification Office, Bureau of Competition (Sixth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Room 301), Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580, 202&hyph;326&hyph;3100. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The United States Congress, in an Act making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies, 1 has mandated that a fee of $45,000 must be paid by ``persons acquiring voting securities or assets who are required to file premerger notifications by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 2 The new fee provision was signed into law by President Clinton late Friday, August 26, 1994, and took effect immediately. 3 The increased fee must be paid for filings made on or after Monday, August 29, 1994. 1 The newly passed law (H.R. 4603, Pub. L. 103&hyph;317) amends Section 605 of Title VI of Public Law 101&hyph;162 (103 Stat. 1031), which originally mandated the collection of a filing fee beginning November 28, 1989, by striking ``$25,000'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``$45,000.'' 2 Section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a, as added by Section 201 of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Pub. L. 95&hyph;435, 90 Stat. 1390. 3 Many other provisions of the legislation, relating to current appropriations for FY 95, are effective October 1, 1994. Although the fee increase provision is contained in the FY 95 current appropriations legislation, the increase itself is not a current appropriation for FY 95, nor is it made dependent upon the FY 95 appropriation. Rather, the fee increase is permanent legislation amending a provision of law that has been in effect since 1989. The appropriations act contains no provision specifying an effective date for the fee increase provision, and it was therefore effective upon enactment.
