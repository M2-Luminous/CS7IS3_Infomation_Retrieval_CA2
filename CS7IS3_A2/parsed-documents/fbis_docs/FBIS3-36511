We are presenting our traditional Monday radio interview with Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian parliament and head of state, Batono Eduard, both you and Mr. Yeltsin gave a high appreciation to the signed treaty of friendship, good-neighborly relations and cooperation at the news conference last week. This is really a large, comprehensive treaty, apparently different from all other agreements Georgia has had with other countries. Yeltsin said that Russia aspires not only to friendly relations with Georgia but also to allianced-based relations. Could that probably annoy the West? In addition, the military package of the treaty and other documents stipulate joint guarding of the Georgian-Turkish border. Also signed was a memorandum according to which a drafting group will work out principles of transferring Russian troops to military bases. Could that mean that we will not have equal relations with all countries and that certain special relations have been formed with Russia? [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. I would like to add to what I said at our joint news conference and in my other speeches that all the agreements, I mean the major treaty and the package of all other agreements we signed, represent a balance of interests of both countries. We have long been looking for this balance. Work has been carried on for almost two years. The well-known Paragraph 3 of the treaty and its part stating certain responsibilities and commitments Russia is undertaking in connection with building Georgia's Armed Forces was included in the treaty at the last stage only. This demonstrates that during the last two years we were busy thinking about the treaty and wanted to have every word and phrase weighed and selected so that it could endure the test of time. Of course all depends on how this agreement is implemented. This will depend on the two parties and on processes which develop within the two countries. Now a little more detail in connection with guarding the border. First, I have to remind you that we are guarding the border jointly at present, too. Or rather, mainly Russian border forces are guarding the border at present. Our frontier troops are not able to guard the border independently, unfortunately. There is neither a material or financial basis for this, nor appropriate personnel. You should be aware that a border is technically rather a complex object. It is not easy to maintain it. This is connected with professions and it will apparently take several years to acquire the skills. We speak of friendly and fraternal relations with Turkish leaders. I believe we will build such relations with this big neighbor of ours. In future, there will probably be no necessity to guard the border. You were in Turkey when Mr. Demirel said that we have such fraternal relations that in time the border could became symbolic. I agree with him. But, at the moment, the elimination of the border will cause big problems for both countries. A mechanism for annullment has also been included in the treaty. We shall create our own border forces. This will probably take several years. Then time will show and we will make a decision as convenient and necessary for our own interests and the interests of our neighbors. Second, the presence of the Russian troops in Georgia and Caucasia is a fact. Not only in Georgia but in Armenia, in particular. As far as I know, Azerbaijan has a similar approach to the settlement of the issue, I mean the principle of military bases. Speaking of Georgia, we mean a new statute and there really is a compromise. We have found a compromise. The statute of the troops will be founded on the principle of military bases. It will happen in the future because, to be more precise, there is no agreement yet. This is a memorandum about our recognizing the principle and wishing to create an operative group which will work out the issue and get the text of the agreement ready. Now, where is the compromise? Russia is interested in remaining here on the principles of military bases because we cannot speak of creating a stable infrastructure in one or two years. When we speak of bases, we mean a long stay. No country can be happy at allowing other country's troop to enter its territory. But we can see Russia's interest on one hand and, on the other hand, we have to create an army, a real army. The other side of the compromise speaks in our favor and it will be reflected in the agreement stating detailed commitments and measures Russia will have to take to have our army created. Today we possess nothing of our own. We have no arms, no heavy equipment, medium and light equipment, no ammunition, nothing. We failed to get arms even for the police from anywhere. [Oniani] There seemed to be certain promises in the past. [Shevardnadze] We were promised but...[pauses] let us think. If a country can exist without an army we would not make that decision. But an army is apparently a necessity. If a country can exist without the police we would ask the Russians to quit and no talks about any bases would take place. But at present normal formation and functioning of the police and interior ministry troops depend on arms, a technical basis and finances, if you will. [Oniani] Batono Eduard, sorry to interrupt you but I remember that having returned from Turkey you said at the Tbilisi conference of the Union of Citizens that Georgia will really have its own army which will fight to the last drop of blood for the country and will protect the country's interests. Did you mean that? Did you mean that there would be assistance in building troops? [Shevardnadze] You know, Turkey, despite the fact that it is rendering immense help to us with credits and other supporting actions, cannot provide arms. [Oniani] Was it known then that we would transfer to the system of bases and Russia would help us? [Shevardnadze] Of course it was meant at that time. Along with these factors, the compromise has to be expressed in another thing. Russia and its armed forces should play an active and positive role in the settlement of the Abkhazian issue and in the settlement of the Abkhazian conflict. Only if we see that this positive role is guaranteed, only then shall we sign an agreement. Now, will this complicate our relations with other countries? I believe that politicians and analysts of other countries interested in Russia's policy in Caucasia and in Russia's policy in general are scrutinizing all this. I do not think this could cause any serious complications. Turkey could be the most sensitive toward this issue. But I already informed Mr. Demirel yesterday, I wrote to him what we had in mind when signing the agreement. Turkey as well as Russia is most of all interested in a stable Caucasia and a stable Georgia. And the guarantees which secure this stability will be welcomed with understanding by our neighbor Turkey, other neighbors and other countries. So, I do not think that this could have an adverse effect on our relations with other countries. [Oniani] I would like to remind you of a few phrases said by Yeltsin during his visit: There are forces in our country who want to restore Moscow's role, to restore the empire within its former borders. This tendency is dangerous primarily for Russia itself. You have expressed a hope that the treaty will not have a fate similar to the two previous ones, meaning the Tractate [signed between the East Georgian Kingdom and the Russian Empire in 1784] and that of 7 May 1920 [between the independent Republic of Georgia and Bolshevik Russia] and it will not be violated unilaterally. You have also said that Yeltsin is the only person who properly understands Russia's strategic interest which implies having a stable and friendly neighbor in the south. In principle, stability is the target Georgia has been striving for for a long time. It can be said that Russia has already specified its interest in relation with Georgia. How reliable are these interests if Russia is not stable itself? Does it imply that the stability of the two countries is of mutual interest for our countries? [Shevardnadze] I highly appreciate what Yeltsin said in Georgia. Along with the phrases you remembered so well, I would like to draw your attention to yet another phrase. I regard his speech in the Academy of Sciences as a very important one, a landmark in Russian-Georgian relations. There was a phrase like this: Russia is not relieving itself of responsibilities for the fact that agreements on the settlement the Abkhazian conflict failed. He admits it. You have to be a courageous and honest man to say this. One thing is that we said something and we complained but the other thing is that the president himself said it. In fact, he said many significant things during his stay here. Now, has Russia defined its strategic goals in Caucasia in general and in Georgia in particular? Speaking of the president and his policy and his understanding of Russo-Georgian relations in the long run, I think that the president has this issue well understood. At least, our conversations and his speeches differed from those at previous meetings. I saw that he really understood this. He persistently stated in his conversations that he interprets Russia's strategic interests in Georgia's being united and integral, strong and friendly toward Russia. I see this in the same way. However Russia's fate develops in future and however complicated the internal relations between various forces and regions become, I believe that friendly relations with Russia are a better shield than confrontation. Even if imperial forces, as we call them, come to power in Russia. In any case, we took a proper step and we did what we had to do. I have no doubt at all that the majority of our population expected the same from the visit and assessed the results in the same way. If I did not have a deep conviction that 70 or 75 percent of the Georgian population interpreted Russian-Georgian relations the same way as I did I would not have signed these documents. Seventy percent and probably even a little more. [Oniani] After Yeltsin's visit you said that if we had had this treaty a year ago the Abkhazian conflict would have been over. Last week, UN Security Council resolution No. 896 was made public. Abkhazian issues will again be discussed on 8 February. Information has been spread that the treaty will not be ratified until the Abkhazian issue is settled. What is your assessment? What did this treaty bring into the problem of the settlement of the Abkhazian issue? [Shevardnadze] When I said that had we had the treaty a year ago Abkhazia would not have been lost I meant that Russia would have also avoided a lot of troubles. Russia gained nothing at all from the fact that Georgia lost Abkhazia temporarily. On the contrary, it found far more difficulties near its southern borders in North Caucasia in particular and in the country in general. Russia found certain difficulties on the international arena, too. The international opinion about Georgia is quite sensible and quite objective. When I said that had we had this treaty ready a year ago Abkhazia would not have been lost and we would have avoided lots of troubles, I said this and I am saying it now for the attention of the forces which even now continue the traditions of that old Supreme Council. I am really sorry that they cannot understand that friendly relations, normal relations between two countries are a guarantee for the settlement of conflicts. If we do not trust each other, I mean Georgia and Russia, how can any issue be settled without Russia's participation? This atmosphere of distrust brought us to the disaster linked with Abkhazia. All these 200,000 refugees, so many lost lives and other misfortunes are the cost of this. [Oniani] There was a statement by the forces you have just mentioned that if Sukhumi were lost and Abkhaz forces occupied Sukhumi the world would see with whose participation it happened and the world would take our side and return Abkhazia to us. Not only Sukhumi but virtually whole of Abkhazia has been lost. [Shevardnadze] I would like to say that I meant forces in Russia, too. They criticize Yeltsin for signing the treaty. I speak more to the attention of those forces. Indeed, I speak to the attention of our partners and opponents, too, but particularly to the attention of those forces who state their fundamental position and criticize the president for signing this treaty. I reiterate that Georgia has lost much but Russia has gained nothing. This senseless confrontation must by all means come to an end. And I think that a foundation has been laid for this. Now, about Russia's role in the settlement of the Abkhazian conflict. This role is in close contact with active participation of the United Nations and European security structures. This is very important now. The use of international forces in its classic form is not ruled out despite the negotiations Yeltsin and I held and despite Russia's readiness to take the most of the commitment on itself. It is not ruled out but I am not very convinced that the Security Council will take a decision of this sort. [Oniani] Does it mean that international forces should enter the territory with various countries having a definite role, and not only Russia? [Shevardnadze] There is such a possibility. However, the main factor of the settlement is Russia, anyway. We do not have to be afraid to state this. I believe that this emphasizes not only Russia's role but its commitments. The visit provided us with certain guarantees. At least the president's public statements and what he told me during our private meeting can be considered as a guarantee. Now the main thing is how quickly will there be a settlement of all problems, including and apparently primarily the issue of refugees. Tomorrow negotiations on the statute of Abkhazia are beginning and we believe that the issue of the return of refugees should be submitted once again and the process has to be sped up. [Oniani] During your meeting with Yeltsin you presented your own model of the settlement of Caucasian conflicts. It was three plus one, that is three Caucasian states plus Russia with its North Caucasian subjects. North Caucasian republics have been against the treaty from the very beginning and joined the camp of the opponents of the ratification. Obviously, Russia has to consider this but Russia has to consider Georgia, too because, as you have said, a disintegrated country in the south next to North Caucasia cannot meet Russia's interest. What does the Caucasian factor mean for Russia, for Caucasia and who will manage this process? [Shevardnadze] The Caucasian factor is one of the guarantees for the stability of huge areas and vital centers in the south of Russia's territory. Not the only one but a very important one. An unstable Georgia is not acceptable for Russia's national interests. If there are considerations and actions in conformity with the law, Russian politicians should understand this in this way and I believe that the Russian president understands it in this way. As for starting the mechanism, this needs time. The peoples of North Caucasia will be interested in a Caucasian dialogue. I am positive about that. They are not probably ripen for it today. Let us wait till tomorrow. Some time is needed. And I think that this is not very far off. I have publicly said that the Azeri president, the Armenian president, and President Yeltsin had a positive response to this idea of three plus one, or maybe one plus three, and I believe that it has far-reaching prospects. [Oniani] And yet another issue which could be considered as important. We have been refused the right to join the ruble zone for the time being, although there has been a fear in Georgia that we would be dragged into the zone by force. How important are those economic acts stipulated by the agreements? [Shevardnadze] Measures and agreements included in the treaty do not imply imply our joining the ruble zone. As for the issue by itself, they have neither refused nor agreed to it. We have not insisted on it, either. The issue is so significant that it cannot be solved overnight. The principal thing is whether we will be able to strengthen the coupon, to vitalize our economy. Economic agreements signed in Tbilisi as well in Moscow can be considered as preconditions to this. If we find that we are able to strengthen the coupon there will be no need to speak of the possibilities of joining the ruble zone. Important measures have been planned for this week. These include an assessment of the results of the last year, plans and targets for the current year, discussion of a program of surviving the crisis -- but the main issue is strengthening the coupon. We shall consider and discuss this issue at every level, at the government level, with my participation, without my participation. Then parliament will take up the issue and in a certain time we may be able to give a definite answer to the question whether we need the ruble zone. [Oniani] Batono Eduard, yet another explosion resulted in the killing of Deputy Defense Minister Nikoloz Kekelidze in Tbilisi last week. The idea is circulating that some state or government structures were involved in this incident to some extent. First, could you please comment on this. And another question. The mass media reported the resignation of Defense Minister Georgiy Karkarashvili. Have you any information for us on this issue? [Shevardnadze] As for the death of Mr. Kekelidae, it is most deplorable. I was rather distressed. Similarly deplorable was an assassination in Rustavi a week ago, as well as the brutal killing of two police officers in Tbilisi the other day. As you know, the killing of Kekelidze coincided with the date of the Yeltsin's visit. It happened at 0330 and the visit was beginning in the morning. But I do not think that any state structure, even if there is a bandit terrorist group in it, would time this horrible crime to coincide with a crucial day like this. I have read a statement by one of the parties mentioning state terrorism and implying that we could be dealing with the state terrorism. Speaking of state terrorism and somehow linking this event with it is to my mind a very worrying fact in itself. A politician who admits the possibility of the state's involvement in terrorist acts so easily, is probably not far from implementation of an idea like this if we permit him to manage any state structure -- or if the people elect him to manage a state structure. I cannot simply bear the thought that the state has chosen the path of terrorism in Georgia today. Whoever assumes such a possibility may be brooding over this idea himself. As for Karkarashvili's resignation, I could not see him and I will meet him soon. His resignation letter is rather categorical and I do not think that it was written rashly because the demand to let him resign is so categorically stated. I have not made any decision yet. We shall meet in two or three days and the final decision will of course be made public. [Oniani] And finally another question. I would like to return to Yeltsin's visit. The ceremony of meeting him and other matters were organized in such a normal way that we experienced a feeling of a sort of statehood. We felt that we were citizens of a state. Tomorrow, 8 February, we celebrate the memorial day of Davit Aghmashenebeli [12th Century Georgian king], a Georgian king to whom the idea of Georgia's statehood is linked. During your meeting with Kutaisi citizens yesterday you said that a new stage of the national movement was beginning, a new era which could be called an era of commitments, commitments to one's own country because this is your state and it does not belong to someone else. Youth has a special role in this. Finally, restoration work is being carried out at the shrine to Bagrati [first Georgian king to unite Georgia in 11th Century] in Kutaisi, which can be considered a symbol of the unity of the Georgian people. Do you think Bagrati will become a real symbol of unity or it will remain a mere symbol? [Shevardnadze] You are right. The reception of a high level visitor like Yeltsin is not easy for the country in such a disastrous situation. This is linked with lots and lots of factors. As we saw Mr. Yeltsin off and the plane took off I told one of my colleagues that we were beginning to resemble a state. It really meant a lot. I met with citizens of Kutaisi yesterday. You could see some people from Tbilisi, too, but there were mostly visitors from Kutaisi headed by Kutaisi Mayor Temur Shashiashvili. And I really spoke of a new stage of national commitments. What is being done in Kutaisi can be considered as one of the links in this. I am aware that a lot is being done in Tbilisi, in Ajaria, in other regions. But this is a Kutaisi citizens' initiative. I have welcomed this initiative. It is a magnificent initiative. The Bagrati temple and the name of Bagrati should be connected with the struggle for unity, not merely symbolically but truly and meaningfully. It should give an impetus to a new stage of a new real national movement for the unity of Georgia. There is a proposal to celebrate the 1,000th anniversary of integrated Georgia next year and I fully support the idea. I think that if we manage it adequately it will mean the return to the path taken by Bagrat and the great Davit -- not in words and only at anniversary times and not with loud festivities. We have to move forward and build, following in their footsteps. We have to move along the road of building and not of destruction. This is the road we have to take. I understand this in this way. If I have the tiniest chance I will visit Gelati [monastery in Kutaisi where King Davit is buried] and kneel before Davit the Builder's tomb, not because I want to connect it with a sort of populism but to appeal to my people that we have to advance together along the road of building and that it was not by accident that our people gave great Davit the name of Builder.
