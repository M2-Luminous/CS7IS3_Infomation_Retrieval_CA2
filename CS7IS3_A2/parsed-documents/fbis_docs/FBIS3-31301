Was this visit conducted in the context of relations with Greece in its capacity as head of the EC Presidency, or were there other problems associated with relations and the regional situation? [Serreqi] The meeting was not bilateral. It was a meeting held in the context of Albanian relations with the European Union. Of course, the Greek foreign minister presented the invitation, but on behalf of the EC Presidency. The meeting aimed at discussing the results achieved so far in Albania's cooperation with the EU and the prospects for this cooperation. The meeting was mostly characterized by a real climate of understanding. I should stress that the results of the reform in Albania and those of Albania's cooperation with the EU were very positively assessed. Besides this problem, we discussed the crisis in the region, as well as joint programs of future cooperation, the PHARE [Economic and Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] and inter-EC programs. We also discussed other problems of a political nature. [Muharremi] Mr. Minister, what was the attitude of the Greek side regarding the crisis in the region? [Serreqi] In general, the positions were pretty far removed from each other. The discussion resembled the confrontation of viewpoints we presented in Geneva several days ago. Of course, we stressed two or three main points, such as that we do not consider the division of Bosnia into three ethnic units to be a fair and permanent solution that serves peace. We believe that the recent NATO decision, the final ultimatum, should be supported, and the Albanian Government fully supports it. Our positions were not consistent with those maintained by the Greek Government. [Muharremi] Mr. Minister, at the news conference held in Athens, you were questioned about the Albanian Government's opinion on the stability of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Can you please tell us something about this problem? [Serreqi] That was not the question. The question was related to the Congress of the Party for Democratic Prosperity in Macedonia and the answer was very clear. The answer was this: Interstate relations have nothing to do with interparty relations. Albania has been very clear in its policy toward Macedonia. Albania has recognized Macedonia for reasons that are already known. At the same time, we will never stop until Macedonia guarantees all legitimate rights to Albanians living there.
