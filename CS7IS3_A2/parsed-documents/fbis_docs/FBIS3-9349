Martonyi arrived for a visit to Poland on Saturday [19 March] to open the Hungarian Consulate in Krakow, for the time being only a symbol, as actual work will begin later. The state secretary said the main aim of his visit was to hold consultations with senior officials from the Polish Foreign Ministry, mainly in an effort to coordinate European integration policy. "The reason is that we consider Polish-Hungarian cooperation to be of strategic importance, and this remains key to the whole of the region," Martonyi said. Talks with Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski and his assistants, and with members of Polish Parliament's Foreign Affairs and European Relations Committees, served this end, as well as the furthering of bilateral relations. Martonyi said that like the Hungarian, Polish foreign policy also considers the Visegrad cooperation (between Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary) to be alive and important. The free trade zone taking shape creates a good basis for developing relations in other areas as well.
