According to injured survivors in Diyarbakir hospital, the village was attacked on Saturday by fighter planes of the Turkish airforce. But authorities in the region denied this version of events, saying instead that a minibus had hit a mine near the village. Also in Diyarbakir, a grenade was thrown at a school being used as a polling station in Sunday's municipal elections, slightly injuring two people. By close of polls at 4:00 PM (1300 GMT), this was the only violent incident in the city directly linked to the elections despite threats against voters by Kurdish separatists.
