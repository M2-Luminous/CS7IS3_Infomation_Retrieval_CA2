Yesterday the board of the bank approved a detailed investment plan for the Kola power station and two other Russian nuclear power stations. A decision in principle to give money was reached last year. Certain negotiations with Russian authorities remain before the work can start. In return the EBRD wants the Russians to shut down some of the oldest and most dangerous reactors. On the Kola Peninsula one possibility is shutting down one of the two old reactors earlier than planned. Russian authorities have announced that they will shut it down in the year 2000. The money will come from the special fund for making safe nuclear power stations in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union which the G-7 countries set up in 1992 and which has since grown to sizeable proportions. Last year the Nordic area, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the EU [European Union] Commission joined the fund. The fund currently contains around 1.2 billion kroner. Norway has paid in 16.5 million. The largest and most important of the planned investments in Polyarnyye Zori on the Kola Peninsula is an emergency cooling system. Today the power station would only be able to stand a cooling system breakdown of an estimated six hours before the reactor core in one of the four reactors would melt. "The danger of accidents would be reduced as a result. The employees would have much longer time for repairs," assistant director Torbjorn Norendal of the Foreign Ministry said. He is Norway's representative on the board of the bank. Other elements in the investment plan are new and better fire equipment, instruments which are able to give operators more rapid warning that an accident is taking place, equipment for measuring radioactive emissions outside the power station itself, a number of safety values, and other surveillance equipment. Everything will go out to international tender. The board bank will decide on the final allocation of funds at its July meeting. Norway has already donated equipment worth 20 million kroner to the power station. It is Norendal's view that the money from the EBRD will increase the safety of the power station considerably. It is planned that the investments will be made in the course of 1995 and 1996. The other two power stations which will receive similar help are Sosnovyy Bor near St. Petersburg and Novo-Voronezh south of Moscow. Bellona [Norwegian environmental organization] was among the first to raise the alarm about the state of affairs at the nuclear power station only a few miles from Norway. Expert Frederic Hauge is skeptical toward the EBRD's investment plan. "This money does not solve the biggest problem. The main threat is that the workers at the power station are not being paid. It is now a month and a half since they were paid, and last week there was a phone call with an anonymous threat that reactor 4 would be set on fire if wages were not paid," Hauge said. He believes that it would have a great effect if Finland stopped importing electricity from the power station. "I would also have liked to have seen how much progress would have been made if the 180 million had been spent on energy saving measures and the development of local gas power," he said. A united Nordic area in the EU could mean large-scale economic and expert support for the nuclear cleanup in the north, Bettina Lorz of the EU's Environmental Directorate (DG-11) said. She has played a central role in the EEA [European Economic Area] negotiations and the negotiations on membership for the Nordic countries. Yesterday she took part at a seminar in Oslo on the EU and the environment. She received the support of the EU's ambassador to Norway, Aneurin Rhys Hughes: "As yet the EU has not allocated money to the Kola Peninsula problems. This is something that will change radically when Norway becomes a member," he said. Bettina Lorz told AFTENPOSTEN that there are some significant funds in the EU which are to be used for important environmental measures in Eastern Europe. Today they are being used to make safe nuclear installations, primarily nuclear power stations, in the immediate vicinity of today's EU countries. "Even though the EU is of course already involved in what is happening in the Barents Sea region, its involvement would increase dramatically if Norway, Sweden, and Finland join. The Kola Peninsula would then become the EU's closest neighbor in the north," she said.
