FBIS4-47659 "drafr084_a_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-084 Daily Report 1 May 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda Denies Thousands Stranded at Border Denies Thousands Stranded at Border EA0205082094 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in English to Rwanda 1900 GMT 1 May 94 EA0205082094 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura English BFN [Excerpts] The report by the UN High Commission for Refugees [UNHCR] that the Rwandan Patriotic Army has blocked the Rwanda border with Tanzania is baseless and absurd. The UNHCR has reported that thousands of people trying to escape to Tanzania are stranded on the Rwandan side of the border with Tanzania because the Rwandan Patriotic Army has closed the Rwanda-Tanzanian border at Rusomo. The Rwandan Patriotic Army has not closed the border and contrary to these reports, more than 500,000 people have crossed into Tanzania through the border point at Rusomo within the last three days. [passage omitted] As for now, there are no people whatsoever at the Rwandan side of the border trying to cross into Tanzania. On the contrary, a number of people who had crossed into Tanzania are now trying to return home, for the massacres have been stopped since the arrival of the Rwandan Patriotic Army forces in this area. [passage omitted] The UNHCR could have been fed with fabricated and false information by people with ulterior motives. These could be the same people who had earlier blocked the entry points into Tanzania, blocking the refugees who were running away from the massacres committed by the Rwandan Government forces and this made the refugees easy prey for the Army and the armed government-controlled militia.
