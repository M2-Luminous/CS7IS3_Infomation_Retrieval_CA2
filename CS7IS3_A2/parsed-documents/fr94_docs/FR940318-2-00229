FR940318-2-00229 FR940318-2-00116 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;33758; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;92&hyph;12, Amendment No. 6] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Proposed Rule Change by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., Relating to Amendments to the NASD's Proposed Short Sale Rule March 11, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on March 8, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') Amendment No. 6 to the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. 1 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change, as amended, from interested persons. 1 On January 14, 1994, the NASD submitted Amendment No. 5 to this filing. Amendment No. 6 supersedes and replaces Amendment No. 5, which was not published for comment. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The NASD is amending its proposed short sale rule or ``bid test'' applicable to stocks traded on the Nasdaq National Market by expanding the options market makers' exemption from the rule to include certain short sales effected by index options market makers. Specifically, for an eighteen-month pilot period, the proposal provides that an NASD member shall be permitted, consistent with its quotation obligations, to execute a short sale for the account of an index options market maker that would otherwise be in contravention of the NASD's short sale rule so long as: (1) The short sales are hedges of existing or contemporaneously established index options positions and (2) the dollar value of all stock sold short to hedge the offsetting stock index options position(s) does not exceed the aggregate current index value of the offsetting index options position(s). The NASD also is proposing four other amendments to the NASD's short sale rule. First, the NASD proposes to amend the filing to provide that all market maker exemptions from the rule will be uniform in duration. Specifically, under the proposal, the exemptions afforded qualified Nasdaq market makers, Nasdaq warrant market makers, and qualified options market makers will all expire eighteen months after the effective date of the NASD's short sale rule. Prior to the termination of the eighteen-month period, the NASD will evaluate whether these exemptions should be extended, modified, approved on a permanent basis, or terminated. Second, with respect to the trading activity of options market makers and warrant market makers, the amendment clarifies that transactions unrelated to normal options/warrant market making activity, such as index arbitrage or risk arbitrage that in either case is independent of an options/warrant market maker's market making functions, will not be considered a hedging transaction for purposes of the options/warrant market maker exemption from the NASD's short-sale rule. Third, consistent with Rule 10a&hyph;1 under the Act, the amendment expands the exemption from the NASD's short-sale rule for certain transactions in special arbitrage accounts and special international arbitrage accounts to include short-sales effected by non-members. Prior to this amendment, only NASD members would be able to avail themselves of these two exemptions from the rule. Fourth, the NASD proposes to amend the options and warrant market maker exemptions to provide that an NASD member would not be in violation of the NASD's short sale rule if it executed an order for the account of an options or warrant market maker in the good faith belief that the order was in full compliance with the NASD's short sale rule and it was subsequently determined that the order was either not entitled to the exemption or it was incorrectly marked long. The NASD also proposes to make some minor stylistic modifications and grammatical corrections to the short sale rule and amend the section numbers for the rule. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary of the NASD and at the Commission.
