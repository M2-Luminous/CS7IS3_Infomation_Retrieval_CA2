The Turkish Government has known of the cooperation between the PKK and the Armenians for many years, but the issue was consistently denied by circles supporting that organization. It has been established that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan received funds and arms from Armenia through Armenian priests in Lebanon. Ocalan's links with the Armenian priests have been documented with photographs. The intelligence units have tried to document the cooperation between the PKK and the Armenians for years. They had an opportunity to do so in Bar Ilyas in al-Biqa' Valley on Tuesday, 3 May. The intelligence units established that the priests of the Gregorian Church in Lebanon frequently call on Ocalan, who occasionally travels from Syria to the small town in al-Biqa' Valley. They took action and documented the most recent meeting he had with the Armenian priests by taking their photographs. Ocalan, considering that he is no longer comfortable in Syria or Lebanon, conferred with his guests on the possibility of moving to Armenia. The extremist Dachnak Party in Armenia has occasionally provided the PKK with funds and arms through the Armenian priests in Lebanon. Most Armenians are affiliated with the Gregorian Church, which has close links with the Orthodox faith. Its patriarch lives in Echmiadzin, which is near Yerevan. The Armenians in Lebanon have very strong links with Echmiadzin. The church in Echmiadzin has significant influence with the Armenian Government. Armenians reportedly make up a third of the PKK's 4,000-member mountain cadre and the Armenians in Syria play an effective role in the organization. The commanders of the PKK's mountain cadres are Armenian. Officials have said that this has been confirmed by the many uncircumcised militants the security forces have discovered among the PKK members killed or captured in operations. Orders To Kill Sakik The recent blows the security forces have dealt the PKK have created confusion among the leading members of the organization. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan has instructed his militants to kill Muslum Durgun, alias Dr. Baran, and Semdin Sakik, alias Parmaksiz Zeki. Both were among the most important members of the PKK. Sakik was the provincial commander of what the PKK calls Amed Province. He has been living in a camp in Danbak, north of Maku in Iran, since 5 April. Ocalan ordered his militants to kill Sakik because he criticized his decisions. Regarding Sakik's case, Ocalan reportedly instructed Cemil Bayik, commander of the PKK Kurdish People's Liberation Army, as follows: "Sakik has adopted a defeatist approach. He will pay for it with his head. Put him before a firing squad." It was Sakik who ordered a group of PKK militants to kill 33 unarmed soldiers in Bingol Province in 1993. But his remarks to a group of leading PKK members in the camp in Danbak on 8 May prompted Ocalan to order his militants to kill him. Sakik reportedly said: "Insensitive parasites who have a lust for luxury are as dangerous as the enemy. The cause cannot be maintained with leaders who fail to establish the enemy's tactics in the war and who are unable to give accurate and effective instructions. A wounded man cannot see the outcome of an action. It is a virtue to decide to withdraw."
