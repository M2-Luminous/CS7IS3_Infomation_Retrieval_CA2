Kokko and V. Gonchar from St. Petersburg's "Severnyy Zavod" Production Association; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] [Kokko over video of missiles] A couple of years ago TV crews could not even dream of gaining access to this enterprise. For many years the "Severnyy Zavod" Production Association produced nothing but missiles for air defense systems. Nowadays the need for conversion is felt even here, although views differ on how to tackle the problems which have arisen. According to the plant's director, owing to shortsighted government policy Russia currently has no real chance of entering the world market in defense weapon systems. Production is declining, but we simply must preserve our high-tech facilities. This gave birth to the project to build a spherical Tokamak. Previously this argon chamber was used to make wings for missiles. Now it is used to make titanium ice-axes for Norway. However, recently a project was drawn up in cooperation with physicists from the Ioffe Institute to build a spherical Tokamak for research in the field of thermonuclear reactions. Theoretical studies have already been carried out and a 1:10-scale model has been built. If it proves possible to translate the project to build a spherical Tokamak into reality, Russia will undoubtedly take up a leading position in the world in the sphere of thermonuclear fusion.
