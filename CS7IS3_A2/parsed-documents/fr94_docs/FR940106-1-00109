FR940106-1-00109 FR940106-1-00012 Federal actions that may affect the delta smelt or its critical habitat, should any be designated, include those authorized, carried out, or funded by the Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, National Marine Fisheries Service, and EPA. The Army Corps of Engineers funds projects and issues permits for water pumping and diversion facilities, levee construction or repair, bank protection activities, deep-water navigation channel dredging and dredge spoil disposal projects, sand and gravel extraction, marina and bridge construction, diking of wetlands for conversion to farmland, and tidal gate or barrier installation. The Bureau of Reclamation and California Department of Water Resources construct, operate, and/or manage water export facilities. EPA reviews State water quality standards and promulgates replacement standards, pursuant to the Clean Water Act, if the State standards are found to be inadequate. In 1991, EPA disapproved portions of the California State Water Resources Control Board's Water Quality Control Plan for Salinity for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary. Accordingly, EPA has prepared proposed replacement standards for those portions of the State's salinity standards that were disapproved. Measures to protect the federally listed winter-run chinook salmon, for which the National Marine Fisheries Service has jurisdiction under the Act, also may affect the delta smelt and may require consultation with the Service. Under section 4 of the Act, listing of the delta smelt provided a requirement for the development of a recovery plan. The Service convened the Delta Native Fishes Recovery Team to prepare a recovery plan for declining native fishes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Estuary. The recovery plan will develop a framework for Federal, State, and private entities to coordinate activities and cooperate with each other in conservation efforts. The plan will set recovery priorities and estimate the costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish recovery goals. Site-specific management actions necessary to achieve survival and recovery of the delta smelt and other fishes native to the Estuary ecosystem also will be described in this plan. Summary of Comments and Recommendations During the 4-month comment period following publication of the October 3, 1991 (56 FR 50075), proposed rule to list the delta smelt as threatened and designate its critical habitat, the Service received 360 comments (i.e., letters and oral testimony) from 348 individuals. The Service received several letters supporting designation of delta smelt critical habitat as proposed. Many local government agencies, water districts, business and trade associations, and other private interests submitted comments regarding the presumed economic effects of the proposed critical habitat designation on industries, planned activities, and development in specific municipalities or geographic regions of California. On March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14199), the Service published a notice that the public comment period on the proposed designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt was reopened until April 30, 1993, to allow the Service to consider any information that previously had not been submitted. In response, the Service received seven letters: two in support of critical habitat designation as proposed, four in opposition, and a letter from EPA requesting that the Service consider the biological and hydrological information described in EPA's draft proposed rule to promulgate Bay/Delta water quality standards. The proposed rule to designate critical habitat for the delta smelt has been revised to reflect the best scientific information currently available and to ensure that the Service coordinates its final actions with other interested Federal agencies. For this reason, the Service will address all comments previously received on the economic impacts, legal requirements, and interpretation of various provisions of the Act during preparation of a final rule. Additionally, comments received during the 60-day comment period following publication of this revised proposed rule will be used in preparing a final rule. Only comments addressing the issue of available scientific information used to revise this proposed rule are responded to in this document. In its final determination on the designation of critical habitat, the Service will provide a thorough discussion of all comments received in response to the original proposed rule and to this revised proposed rule. Comment: EPA requested that in its designation of critical habitat the Service consider the scientific information described in EPA's draft proposed rule to promulgate water quality standards for the Bay/Delta.
