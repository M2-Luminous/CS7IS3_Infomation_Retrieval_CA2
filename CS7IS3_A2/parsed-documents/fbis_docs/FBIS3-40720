The committee found Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, Health Minister B. Shankranand, and Village Development Minister of State Rameshwar Thakur guilty. It has also put Satya Prakash Maulaviya, minister of petroleum in former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar's cabinet, and the ministries of railways, civil aviation, petroleum, and fertilizers in the line of the accused. It appears that the whole structure of our economic system is rotten. Manmohan Singh was declared to be responsible for the horrible negligence by his ministry, banks, and financial institutions. Rameshwar Thakur is blamed for holding a circular letter written against Harshad Mehta for about one month and not taking any action on it when he was the minister of state for finance. What vested interests had forced then-Petroleum Minister B. Shankaranand to ridicule the rules of the Petroleum Industries Development Board and invest money in Canfina Bank and Syndicate Bank? Former Civil Aviation Minister Madho Rao Scindia is also accused of dragging his feet in investigating the Vayudut officials who had invested money without following procedures. The committee found that our economic system had started to corrode in 1982. One hand did not know what the other was doing. There was looting every where, and the vested interests were taking advantage of it all by ignoring all laws and procedures. The vested interests had found loopholes in the economic policies formed after 1982, and the administrations of Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, V.P. Singh, Chandra Shekhar, and P.V. Narasimha Rao all stood in "one posture in the bath house." Narasimha Rao was unfortunately accused of taking 10 million rupees in bribes in the Pratibhuti scam. This sent the message to every corner of the nation that if our major leaders are taking bribes and making money by spurious means, then why should not [the common people] also make money. A similar message was sent by the Bofors scandal. Anyhow, the joint committee has cleared the prime minister of the accusation of receiving 10 million rupees bribe. However, it has recommended investigation of Gold Star Company with the prime minister's son, Prabhakar Rao, is associated. Former minister Chidambaram can also be involved in this investigation because he was also associated with Gold Star. It is obvious that Manmohan Singh, Shankranand, and Rameshwar Thakur have been put on trial, and if they are even minimally ethical, they should either admit to their wrongdoing or offer believable refutation. Just below the line of the cabinet members, the parliamentary committee has lined up S. Venktaraman, governor of the Reserve Bank, and two deputy governors, Amitabh Ghosh and Janaki Raman with their heads bowed and hands joined in prayer. The fact is that if our Reserve Bank and the finance ministry had been alert, no one would have dared to break the laws and loot money. We do not know what special attraction was there for them to ignore established interest rates in the public sector and invest money in absurd places? And we do not know which one was sucking out billions of rupees each minute. The committee has given detailed information on how this scam was pulled, and who were the people who had their eyes closed to it when all this was happening. However, this report is silent about who benefitted from this scam and who were the real villains of this drama. Yes, they have identified four foreign banks and have recommended canceling their licenses. We should not, however, do things hastily. The present atmosphere in the nation and the image that our country has abroad can be hurt by any extreme action. What is necessary is that we keep a close eye on all banks, and not just these banks. The whole system was rotten, and one or two sharp people were influencing the investigation. It is proved by the mention of the CBI and other agencies in the report. These agencies, despite enough evidence against Harshad Mehta and others, did not register any case, and if they did start a case, the speed of investigation was kept very slow. There was no cooperation among these investigation agencies. Not only this, the personnel from these agencies who were invited by the joint committee, did not give full information. The committee has asked that cases be registered against the nationalized bank officials who were involved in the Pratibhuti scam. The recommendation made to investigate Gold Star Company and some public sector institutions should be followed up diligently so that the trust of the people is not broken. The report has also condemned provision of shares from the promotor quota to 531 government and banks officials. The tradition of bribing government employees needs to be curbed. Members of all political parties were included in the joint parliamentary commission, therefore, we should accept this report to be above all bias and have full debate on it in the House even if the session has to be extended by two or three days. The committee has presented the report after 16 months of very hard work and Ram Niwas Mirdha has included the letter which were not unanimous in this report, therefore, we have to believe that the committee has done a historical job by rising above prejudices. This work should be given proper respect and the guilty persons should be punished without delay. At the same time, we must make sure that no one damages our financial system again and embarrassing incidents like the Pratibhuti scams are not repeated. The country waited for a long time for the joint parliamentary committee's report. Now we wait for action on it.
