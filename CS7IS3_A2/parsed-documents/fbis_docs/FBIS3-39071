Kohl assured Clinton of German support for the position of the alliance, aimed at threatening the Serbs with air strikes and at continuing talks among the warring parties in Geneva. Kohl talked with Clinton about the statement that the president issued shortly afterward, in which he mentioned the two goals. As became known in Bonn, possible forms of indirect German participation in military operations were not discussed. Foreign Minister Kinkel announced on Thursday that nobody has approached Germany so far. He added: "We will do what we can from a legal viewpoint, and if we receive any requests, we will comply if we can." Kinkel mentioned considerations concerning logistic aid. "We cannot support the alliance partners morally and refuse to comply with requests that we can actually fulfill from a legal viewpoint." Germany will try to ensure that. Military participation is not possible because of the German constitution. Kinkel pointed out Germany's political efforts to come closer to a negotiated result on the basis of the Juppe-Kinkel plan. This concept is still being pursued. "Germany is not merely a passive spectator." In view of Germany's size and responsibility, Germans are participating in observer missions of the European Union. German pilots are taking part in the airlift for Sarajevo and the supply of other Bosnian towns by air. Also, the Bundeswehr is involved in AWACS surveillance flights. However, these flights will not be affected by "possible air strikes." Kinkel also mentioned the participation of the Federal Navy in monitoring the Adriatic Sea and the involvement of German customs officials in ensuring the observance of the embargo against Serbia-Montenegro on the Danube. Germany has so far paid 612 million German marks for humanitarian purposes, which is more than any other European country has provided. Nearly 400,000 refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina have been accepted by Germany -- twice as many as all the other Europeans states put together. On Wednesday, Kinkel spoke several times on the telephone to U.S. Secretary of State Christopher. Tarnoff, Christopher's under secretary, and Redman, the U.S. observer at the Geneva negotiations, visited London, Paris, and Bonn. A change in the cool U.S. attitude so far adopted toward the Geneva negotiations became apparent. According to Kinkel, the talks focused on how the "political process" might be revived through cooperation between the European Union and the United States on the NATO decisions. Bonn officials noted that Washington wants to assume a "more active role" and "participate in the political procedures." The "European plan of action" might serve as a basis. The "overall concept of the Europeans" includes the demilitarization of Sarajevo and its protection by the United Nations. German diplomacy will try to implement this concept together with Washington. Kinkel stated that Russia should be involved "as much as possible." The foreign minister called on the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims to contribute to "achieving a peaceful settlement" at the Geneva negotiations which resumed on Thursday. This is not possible without the parties to the conflict, he added. Kinkel expressed the hope that this time the cease-fire for Sarajevo agreed on Wednesday morning will hold. "It is in the interest of all of us that the decisions of the NATO Council and of the foreign ministers of the European Union do not have to be implemented." If the parties to the conflict take the warning seriously, what the NATO Council demanded might be achieved without air strikes. "If not, all those involved must know that NATO is serious this time." Kinkel stressed that UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali approved the decisions that evening in a telephone conversation with NATO Secretary General Woerner. The European members of the Security Council, England and France, did not consider any new decisions by the Security Council necessary. They believe that Resolutions 824 and 836 and the decision by the NATO Council are sufficient as a basis for action. A spokesman for the secretary general, who stated that a new Security Council resolution is required, has meanwhile announced that he did not have enough information. Kinkel described possible future developments as follows: "If it is considered necessary after the 10-day period on 20 February, the UN secretary general will make a decision and issue the combat order. If Sarajevo should continue to be shelled, measures will be taken on the spot by the UN commander in chief in cooperation with NATO." If Serbian guns "should reappear" after an air strike, "a second operation might be needed." Yet the foreign minister expressed the hope that the U.S. attitude and the NATO decision might form the basis of a political settlement. Besides Sarajevo, other towns are also hard pressed. However, the capital has a symbolic function. If the situation should deteriorate in other towns after an improvement in Sarajevo, "new considerations and new decisions" will be required. Kinkel hinted that he will hold talks and try to find out whether a meeting of the foreign ministers of the "troika" of the European Union -- Belgium, Germany, and Greece -- should be arranged next week. There were reports about plans that the three foreign ministers wanted to hold talks with Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev in Athens next week. It has now become known that Kozyrev's participation is "rather unlikely."
