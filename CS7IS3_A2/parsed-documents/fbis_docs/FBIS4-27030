Both sides exchanged views on Sino-Russian bilateral relations and other issues of common concern and discussed relevant questions in connection with President Jiang Zemin's visit to Russia. Qian Qichen said that he was very happy to have another opportunity to visit Russia, a friendly neighbor. He said: The main purpose of my current visit to Moscow is to make preparations for Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Russia this fall. The upcoming visit by President Jiang Zemin is a reciprocal visit following President Yeltsin's visit to China in December 1992. Because it is a great event in the relations between the two countries, it is necessary to make earnest preparations to ensure the success of the visit. Qian Qichen said: China and Russia are neighbors. The maintenance of the long-term, stable, good-neighbor relationship between them is not only very important to the people of China and Russia but also concerns peace, stability, and development in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world as a whole. Qian Qichen said that over the past two years since China and Russia established diplomatic relations, bilateral relations in the political and economic spheres and other fields have developed steadily. High-level exchanges between the two countries have increased. Foreign Minister Kozyrev visited China early this year. In May, Russian State Duma Speaker Rybkin and Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin successively visited China by invitation. The Chinese side is satisfied with the development of bilateral relations in recent years and reiterates that it will strictly observe the principles of the 18 December 1992 joint declaration on Sino-Russian relations. Qian Qichen stressed that the Chinese side values very much the hard-won, good-neighbor relations between China and Russia. China is willing to strengthen and expand bilateral cooperation in various fields on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and of the Sino-Russian joint declaration. Touching on Russia's joining NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program, Qian Qichen said: In recent years, a great change has taken place in the situation in Europe. It is understandable that European countries are concerned about their own security. We hope that every arrangement for security in Europe can be in accord with not only the wishes and interests of the nations concerned but also with international security, peace, and stability. He said that the idea and practice of forming a military bloc against a certain country in the time of the "Cold War" are now outdated and should be discarded. Kozyrev said that the Russian side attaches great importance to President Jiang Zemin's visit to Russia this fall and that it believes the visit will be of profound and far-reaching significance in expanding bilateral friendly relations and cooperation. Together with the Chinese side, the Russian side will work hard for the success of President Jiang Zemin's visit to Russia. Kozyrev said: As for Russia's joining NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program, Russia has also suggested that NATO transform itself into a new international organization in the new situation following the end of the "Cold War." Russia will not join any political or military bloc, whether in the East or the West, which is directed at a certain country. He said that Russia attaches great importance to Russian-Sino relations, which, it deems, are as important as those between Russia and NATO. Both sides also exchanged views on the situation on the Korean peninsula and on other international issues. Present at the talks were Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo, Chinese Ambassador to Russia Wang Jinqing, Russian Vice Foreign Minister Panov, and Russian Ambassador to China Rogachev.
