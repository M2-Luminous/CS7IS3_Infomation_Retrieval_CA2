Good morning to you. [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Good morning. [Woyciechowski] When will we see the new, beautiful money about which we hear so much? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] We can see the new and beautiful money at the beginning of next year. One can say that to some extent we have been deliberately preparing the public for the fact that the redenomination must take place, so as not to catch the public by surprise. A draft of the law is already prepared and let us hope that the parliament will debate it, then I hope the new money --that is the elimination of a few zeros--will take effect at the beginning of next year. [Woyciechowski] How many zeros will that be? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Four. [Woyciechowski] Okay, four zeros which means that 10,000 zlotys today will equal 1 zloty then. Why did it take so long to conduct the operation? Why was it not done on 1 January of this year? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] First of all, it is a very serious operation--as you might imagine--which must be conducted by NBP along with the government, or practically speaking with several of the government's ministries. Completely different statistics must be introduced adjusted to the new money, and that applies to every economic unit. So this kind of operation cannot simply be implemented just like that, because someone says it is time to do it, but instead, there would have to be a combined government effort. Well, it so happened that this government--practically speaking--was officially established at the end of last year, and that would be.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And that was the main reason for the delay--the fact that there was no one to talk to? Or was it the risk that this government would cause an increase in inflation and so forth? Was it a political risk, or.... [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, interrupting] There is of course always the risk of fueling inflation,but we try not to think about it, rather we think about convenience, so to speak, for people who use the money, the banknotes. We take into account the fact that currently various machines refuse to deal with the number of zeros that big, so we tend to concentrate our attention on the technical side, and we do not think that inflation has increased in Poland. [Woyciechowski] You mean it will be dropping? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I hope so--such are the assumptions made by the finance minister in the budget bill, and we also share [word indistinct]. [Woyciechowski] Who makes the decision on denominations--you, the government, or the president? Who decides? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] From a formal standpoint, it is the NBP that makes the decision, since according to a law on NBP its chairperson is responsible for introducing new banknotes and [word indistinct].... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So practically speaking, you could make the decision all by yourself? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Formally speaking--yes, but you know, some laws should be changed, such as the Penal Code and the Commercial Code since the figures included there will have to be changed, so from a formal standpoint, it would be a good thing if.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean fines and various other monetary amounts included in various laws? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Yes, so changing these laws I would say requires legislative action. [Woyciechowski] Is it true that the new money is beautiful to look at? You have seen it. [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, laughing] I guess one could say that, but that is a matter of state secrecy. [Woyciechowski] I know and I understand that. Is the money already printed and ready to be used? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, hesitating] That is also a state secret. [Woyciechowski] It is? But my understanding is that the money is already printed because if it was not, you would say so. But storing all this money must require using some incredibly huge warehouses, some incredibly vast amount of space. Is the money being stored in Poland, or somewhere like Switzerland or a Caribbean island? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] You know, of course I cannot reveal that either, but you have to keep in mind that we have some space for storing the money currently in circulation, I mean the million-zloty banknotes, as well as all the 500,000-zloty banknotes [laughing] if I got it right .... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And these probably take up more space than the new banknotes? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] That really takes up a lot of space and, by the way, I must say that practically speaking, ever since I took up this post, high-denomination banknotes have not been printed--I mean during my term of office--and sometimes we have to take upon ourselves the consequences of previous printing issues, and I mean not just a few times, but in the majority of cases. [Woyciechowski] What will happen to the dollar, I mean its radical devaluation [dewaluacja skokowa]? There is a lot of talk about it now--some would like to see it, others would not. Will it happen, and what does radical devaluation mean? And who needs it at all? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Well, I would say that is always the biggest problem to me and I do not like it very much when various lobbying groups--and also sometimes representatives of governments, unfortunately, take part in this, that was the case both with the previous government and this one--I mean I do not like it when they speak of a necessity for such a devaluation, since first of all, that decision is in the range of powers of the NBP chairperson.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That is you. [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Yes. [Woyciechowski] And do you want to see such a radical devaluation or not? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] No, I do not want to devaluate.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So will it happen or not? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I think there are no reasons whatsoever for this type of measure in the immediate future, and I will explain specifically why I believe that to be the case. It is not because I said so, or that [laughing] my word is the determinant factor here, but the fact is that since October of last year, there has been a process of very high increases in foreign-currency reserves. Let me give you an example: At the beginning of last year, we were planning to have an increase in foreign-currency reserves in the range of $200 million whereas in fact we already have $300 million at this point.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Foreign-currency reserves are represented by those dollars which [words indistinct]? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] The dollars which are in the banking system. [Woyciechowski] Where does that money come from? The situation is so bad, and suddenly we have more dollars? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I mean, fortunately--as in every country with a market economy--the foreign-trade balance is just one of the indicators, and just one of the sources of reserves. We happen to have a foreign-trade deficit, but there are many other sources of [word indistinct] I would say, for instance through privatization--for example the two recent bank privatizations mean big amounts of foreign-currency reserves, in this case the money is coming into Poland from abroad. And there is also the [words indistinct] that some people have savings in dollars.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So this is a kind of individual import--people bring dollars from abroad and they deposit them in banks, then exchange those dollars into zlotys.... [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, interrupting] Yes, that is a kind of individual import. So I would say there is a lot of concern in Poland about the Eastern border, but we know that there are constant purchases made from beyond the Western border, and that means an influx of foreign currencies into our country, like the German mark, which naturally is included on the list of hard currencies. So we are having an increase in foreign-currency reserves, and the previous devaluation in August took place only because reserves were decreasing.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But let me go back to the issue of the foreign-trade deficit for a moment. People say that the foreign-trade deficit is enormous, that imports exceed exports by huge amounts, and the recent figures are $2.5 billion per year--these are huge figures--but my understanding is that there is no problem because we have the money? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] We have the money. The most important thing for a central bank is its level of reserves, and not the most recent foreign-trade balance, I would say. The current balance of payments is more important. That payment balance also includes other sources apart from just the foreign-trade balance. That is quite a natural thing to happen. Let me give you an example that is perhaps spectacular: The United States has been having a [word indistinct] negative foreign-trade balance, and nothing bad is happening to that country as a consequence of that, and nothing bad is happening to the dollar--on the contrary, it keeps rising on foreign markets. So it is important not to link the foreign-trade balance to foreign-currency reserves. That is the popular thinking in Poland, but it is a relic of a centrally planned economy--at the time there were no other sources of income whatsoever.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean, of the socialist economy? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Correct. [Woyciechowski] So that means the situation is good? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Yes, it is, from the standpoint of.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] We have a lot of dollars. [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Besides it is a very good thing that we have the imports of technology, because an economy that is already reviving--we will have an increase of 4.5 percent in the gross domestic product--needs new technologies and it needs imports, whereas on the other hand consumption imports--according to data from the Central Office of Statistics--have been declining. So that is a natural and normal phenomenon for an economy that was behind other economies, in terms of technology, and that is now developing. [Woyciechowski] So there will be no devaluation of the dollar? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] For the immediate future, there are no.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What does immediate future mean? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, laughing] You know, that would be going into details. I can say this much: If we were to see a sudden decrease of foreign-currency reserves which would go on for a substantial period of time, then we would think about it. But what we do have even now is constant devaluation--and let us not forget that--every month, or practically speaking every day, the zloty is devalued by between 10 and 20 zlotys in relation to a foreign- currency index where 45 percent is taken up by the U.S. dollar. [Woyciechowski] That is simply a result of inflation. [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Exactly. And it is our view that there will be no need for an additional devaluation during this entire year, providing the foreign-currency reserves keep rising the way they have been since October of last year, and even if the rate of increase is slower, there will be no need for a devaluation, either. [Woyciechowski] How do you feel about the draft budget? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Generally speaking, it is good in the sense that the budget deficit is not too big--that is the most important thing to me--and also that the level of financing the budget deficit planned to be implemented by the NBP is acceptable to us, I mean the 30 trillion zlotys.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] The budget deficit will be 83 trillion zlotys--according to plans--and you will supply 30 trillion zlotys of that amount. [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Yes, I will lend the money, that is exactly [words indistinct].... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] How will you lend the money? Will you charge interest? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Yes, I will lend the government money at the standard market interest rate, and the market interest rate is in the range of approximately 30 percent.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So you will actually make money on the loan? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Correct, and the government will also be happy to see 80 percent of NBP revenue being transferred to the budget by me.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Wait a minute, it has gotten terribly complicated here. The government faces a budget deficit. You loan 30 trillion zlotys to the government charging a very high interest rate.... [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, interrupting] It is a normal market interest rate, not a very high interest rate at all. [Woyciechowski] And that 30 trillion is our money, belonging to all of us --our savings, our public money so to speak, is that right? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Naturally, what you said is included in there since the money I collect within NBP accounts are banks' mandatory reserves, whereas it is society that deposits money in the banks. [Woyciechowski] So in a word, you loan the 30 trillion zlotys charging a high interest rate, but the interest rate is then taken over by the government indirectly since the government is NBP's owner, as it were? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] No, the government is not the owner of NBP, but even despite that, I have to transfer 80 percent of NBP's revenue. The government is not the owner of other economic units that are legal entities either, but these units still have to pay a 40-percent income tax. [Woyciechowski] So this is like that pre-World War II Jewish anecdote: Somebody loans money and everybody benefits. The government loans money to itself, and it is our money--can one say that it is our money? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, laughing] Yes, one can say that. The method has been accepted in all those countries with market economies facing a deficit problem, and we must say here that even Germany is facing the problem of a budget deficit, and it is a usually accepted practice that citizens--or economic units--finance the budget deficit by lending money, and of course they make money on the transaction. [Woyciechowski] And if the Sejm increased the deficit, would you lend more money? I mean more than 30 trillion zlotys? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I must admit that for the time being I am not taking that possibility into account since the 1994 budget bill is the government's draft, the government enjoys a stable Sejm majority, and despite the debates or some complaints that various needs were not satisfied, I am strongly convinced the budget will be passed in the form it was proposed by the cabinet. [Woyciechowski] What is domestic debt? Recently there has been talk that our foreign debt--reaching into the billions of dollars--is really peanuts, and that what is really important is domestic debt. But few people know what the term means. Who lends whose money to whom? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Well, our foreign debt is not exactly peanuts. But it is true that the problem of domestic debt has been completely ignored up to now, simply because people thought that somebody gives money to finance the deficit--just like you used the word give here--it could be the central bank, or somebody else. The truth of course is that nobody just gives money to anybody. The government borrows the money and has to repay it later. And on top of that, in Poland the government borrows money for relatively short periods of time--if you take the United States for instance, there are treasury bonds there which are for as long as 30 years, for example. In Poland of course, no citizen or economic unit makes that kind of economic investment for that kind of time period, and that is why such instruments are impractical in Poland. As Finance Minister Borowski nicely described, the domestic debt has been snowballing, which means the more money you borrow, the more you have to repay. That is also a warning in terms of the magnitude of the budget deficit--there was talk that it could exceed 5 percent, or that we can allow to have it at the level of 6 or 7 or 8 percent--naturally, you can have such amounts if you have the money with which to pay it back. But it turns out that the problem is not that simple and that a government in debt simply has to repay its debt, and since the financial instruments in Poland are of a short-term nature--that is generally speaking up to one year and only some government securities are for three years, for which there is less demand than for the one-year securities--therefore the government has to plan in every subsequent budget the amount of money it will repay. Which is several dozen trillion zlotys. [Woyciechowski] And the figure keeps rising. [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Exactly. [Woyciechowski] So the domestic debt is about treasury bills, government securities, and what else? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Those are the two instruments--treasury bills purchased by banks, including NBP, and government securities purchased by the public at large. More and more people know now that if one buys government securities, one can deduct over 12 million zlotys from taxable income with regard to income tax, and that is why we had those lines of people at banks to buy securities, even on New Year's Eve. So you see, citizens lend money. [Woyciechowski] Do you gamble on the stock exchange? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, laughing] No, but I purchased government securities. [Woyciechowski] And is it worthwhile to gamble there? What is your view on all these jumps in share prices at the stock exchange, and on this massive demand to buy shares? Is it a normal phenomenon, or are we so preoccupied by this beginning of the stock exchange and the beginning of capitalism, that we spend too much money? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I think you are right on both counts there. I would say the question you posed is very good, but it should be addressed by Stock Exchange Chairman Rozlucki, not me. The exchange is a new institution of our market economy which is going through its development, and I would say the more economic units there are, the more stable and reliable the exchange will be. And then one will not be able to say that some profits made there are inflated or unrealistic, because the basis for the functioning of this whole capital exchange will be widened, that means speedy privatization. By the way, the government is heading in that direction. [Woyciechowski] Recently you gave customers of private banks quite a scare by saying that not all of them have NBP guarantees and that one should take a good look at a bank before depositing money there since it could go bankrupt. Could you explain a little bit on how [words indistinct]...? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, interrupting] The problem is that this is the way Panorama put it. But all I said was that it is a wise thing to keep money in different banks, just like it is a wise thing to keep it in different places as well. That applies to banks, but also to the stock exchange, for instance, or to trust funds. Simply put, it is not a wise thing to keep all the money you have in one place, or all on one shelf in a closet. But I would not caution generally against private banks because there are some of them that are very good and they are very active on the stock exchange, but even those that are not there can still be very good, and on the other hand there are state-owned banks that are very bad. According to the law, private banks do not have guarantees with regard to deposits the way state-owned banks do, except we will shortly have a law on securing deposits, but even despite that NBP, of course, pays out up to a certain amount in case a bank like that goes bankrupt, except that currently, basically speaking, because the Baltic Bank, which has declared itself insolvent, is being taken over by [name indistinct] Bank, so people will not lose any money in that case, and we hope that the other bank--which is Interbank--will manage to be saved nevertheless, so there is no such danger. But it is beyond dispute that there is also a bad situation in the cooperative sector, and in those cases, even though the state practically provides guarantees to all cooperative banks, unfortunately I had to declare one of them insolvent the day before yesterday, and that was the 18th case, and that despite the fact that there are guarantees by the state. One will still have to wait because the way the finance minister interprets his guarantees is that he will begin paying out, but only after the insolvency proceedings are over, which may last up to two years .... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So these customers face the danger of not being able to use their accounts for two years? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] In a way, it is really a danger, but the civil rights spokesman spoke out in defense of those customers and now the Supreme Court will issue a decision on that. [Woyciechowski] How does one tell a good bank from a bad one? You say there are good and bad examples both among private banks and state-owned ones, so the ownership question cannot be the way to tell. So what is it? Is it beautiful furniture, a lot of computers, and nice ladies waiting to serve you? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz, laughing] No, that is not the way to tell that, either--oftentimes they are banks that used to have problems in investments because they actually invested customers' deposits, not the banks' own capital. That is undoubtedly not a simple issue for an average man on the street--I mean the bank's balance or the solvency coefficient--it is like secret information, as it were. When interest rates are very high, that becomes dangerous. But the question is: What are extremely high interest rates? There used to be banks where there were extremely high.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean Grobelny's bank, or other cases as well? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Not just that, but also even Bogatyn's bank which we have taken over and now NBP is its owner. There was also the case of Prosper Bank of which NBP also became the owner now--they used to apply such flagrantly high.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And that becomes suspicious? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Only if they are flagrantly high. There have to be some differences among banks--that is what competition is all about. So I stress it that they have to be flagrantly higher than on the average in the banking system. [Woyciechowski] When will Polish banks be all beautiful to look at, stylish, and very efficient? When will they have a network of computer connections, when will they eliminate lines? There is a lot of talk now that making the banking system healthy is a major step toward the market economy. How much time will it take? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I am sure it is hard to predict that with precision, but I think the establishment of the National Clearing Chamber--which is a system of clearing accounts among different banks and currently more than 40 banks participate in it--represents major progress. I can say that the time required to have financial means transferred between banks was cut short from a week to about two days. I know that there are complaints voiced sometimes--indeed, some banks procrastinate, and we try to intervene, but that is not the fault of the connection system but of specific banks, I would say. I think that competition continues to be the best advancing factor. Besides, we also have the TellBank network, which also serves the purpose of settling accounts among banks. It is very modern and we currently even use a satellite--I say we, because NBP is the majority shareholder in TellBank, and it seems that there are really banks out there with which customers are satisfied, and where clearing accounts takes a very short time, and the others will unfortunately not survive the competition--that is just life. [Woyciechowski] And when will we have a situation like it is the world over, where everyone has a credit card, with all the money coming into the account, and one does not have to deal with all those huge amounts of cash? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Some measures have already been initiated. The PKO Bank has introduced such a card--I do not have one, but my colleagues there have shown it to me--and that also constitutes part of the competition. The banks that introduce such measures and make the customers' lives easier will gain customers. The products are already on the market. There are Visa and American Express cards all issued by.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But not by Polish banks? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] By Polish banks [as heard]. The most important thing is...[changes thought] Well, there is a Polish card issued by PKO BP whose extent is rather limited, but we are an open country, we can use foreign credit cards. Let us hope we will have Polish ones as time goes by. [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the conversation. Radio Zet's guest today has been NBP President Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz. Thank you very much. [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Thank you.
