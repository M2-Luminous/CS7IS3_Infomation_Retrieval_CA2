An explanatory note indicates that according to the law the taxation system is built on the principles of social justice. The law determines the conditions of taxation, the taxpayers, and the procedure of registering the objects of taxation. Two types of taxes are envisaged: state -- which are determined by the Supreme Council of Ukraine and are valid on the entire territory of Ukraine -- and local taxes and fees -- for example, advertisement fees, health resort fees, etc. The explanatory note indicates that the adoption of the law on the taxation system will promote the building of a taxation system that would comply with the demands of a transitional period. The deputies approved changes to the procedural code of Ukraine in connection with the adoption of the law of Ukraine on the election of people's deputies. The code is supplemented with the "Statement on the abrogation of the decision of the district electoral commission on the registration of a candidate for people's deputy" and the "Complaints about the decisions and actions by the Central Elections Commission." The deputies began considering a draft concept of developing the fuel and energy complex of Ukraine up to the year 2010. Deputy Minister of Economy Volodymyr Hureyev made a report. Minister of Power Engineering and Electrification Vilen Semenyuk and Mykhaylo Kovalko, the chairman of DerzhKomNaftoHas [state oil and gas committee], delivered the second and third reports. The deputies approved a resolution consisting of two points: agreement in general with the draft concept of developing the fuel and energy complex of Ukraine up to the year 2010 and charging the cabinet of ministers with elaborating and approving a national program for the "Implementation of Ukraine's energy policy" proceeding from the above concept. An explanatory note, signed by acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zuyahilskyy, indicates that in the future it would be expedient to satisfy the national economy needs for electric power through the use of coal -- 50 percent, uranium -- 40 percent, and the rest -- through the use of other energy sources. It is envisaged to satisfy the need for coal up to the year 2010 completely at the expense of our own resources. For this purpose it is necessary to begin digging 25 new mines. The possibility of building new thermal power stations is not ruled out, in particular, the building of a station in Chernigov Oblast that would solve the social issues of the collective of the Chernobyl nuclear power station, which will carry out intensive preparations for a stoppage. Ukraine's needs for oil and gas will be satisfied mainly at the expense of their import. Fifteen trillion [as received] karbovantsi are required for the development of the coal industry by the year 2005 at the prices of the first quarter of last year. The extraction of coal in 2005 will amount to 160 million tons. Nine trillion karbovantsi are required for the development of the gas and oil industry. This will allow the output of oil in 2010 to increase to 7.5 million tons and gas to 30 billion cubic meters. Expenditures for carrying out measures to develop electric power engineering will amount to approximately 25 trillion karbovantsi.
