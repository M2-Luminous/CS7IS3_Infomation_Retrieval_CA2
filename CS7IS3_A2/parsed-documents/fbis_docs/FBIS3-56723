Not less than 180,000 signatures must be raised for the referendum to go ahead. A session of the Kazan branch of the ITTIFAK Tatar party of national independence has expelled from its membership Flera Zaynullina, party secretary, who recently was awarded the title of "Valorous Daughter of the Tatar People." Observers believe that one of the reasons for this was her statement at the World Assembly of Turkic People (Washington, 2 through 5 December 1993) which abounded in attacks on Russians and representatives of other ethnic groups living in the republic. Meanwhile the first Russia-wide Tatar newspaper, BERDEMLEK (Unity), founded by the Tatarstan Government and ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, has been launched; this is the first ethnic publication in the Russian Federation with nationwide status (circulation over 1 million copies). BERDEMLEK will come out in Russian once a week as a supplement to ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and will be distributed in all regions of the Russian Federation with the view to give objective coverage of events in Tatarstan.
