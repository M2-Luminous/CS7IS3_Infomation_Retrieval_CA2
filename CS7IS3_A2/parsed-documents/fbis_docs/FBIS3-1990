The Chang Jiang River, China's longest, flows across Jiangsu and cuts by Nanjing, capital of the province, and Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Nantong, Changzhou, Wuxi and Suzhou Cities, to form a belt which covers an area more than 400 km in length and 100 km in width. This area has seven open ports which have more than 20 berths able to accommodate ships of at least 10,000 dwt [deadweight ton]. With thousands of industrial enterprises, it generates about 80 percent of the gross domestic product in the province. Since 1991 Jiangsu has invested billions of yuan in building up the industrial belt along the valley. So far, the seven cities in the valley have formed a chain of modern industrial installations, covering raw materials, energy development, processing and high-tech. They account for one tenth of the country's total industrial output. In addition, these cities boast complete telecommunications and transportation networks. A provincial official in charge of the economy said that Jiangsu has opened eight state development and bonded zones, as well as international tourism and holiday areas over the past few years. Investors from more than 100 countries and regions are busily setting up enterprises or exploring land for development. A survey shows that the provincial government has approved the establishment of 18,000 foreign-funded enterprises, involving a total investment of more than 16 billion U.S. dollars. Included are over 60 noted trans-national corporations. Meanwhile, China's first high-tech industrial chain has opened in the Jiangsu section of the Chang Jiang River Valley. With a total area of 38.38 sq [square] km, the chain includes four high-tech industrial zones in Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou, respectively. The chain also houses more than 700 high- tech project?nvolved in the fields of electronic information, the combination of machinery and electrical appliances, new materials and bio-engineering. The Suzhou High-Tech Industrial Development Zone has more than 100 projects run by both Chinese and foreign investors. Each of the projects has an investment topping 10 million U.S. dollars. According to the official, about 100,000 rural industrial enterprises in the Chang Jiang River Valley in the province are paying attention to upgrading themselves technically. The technology and equipment of more than one half of them have reached the advanced Chinese standard and even internationally in some cases. One tenth of them have co-operated with overseas business people in forms of joint ventures or technical co- operation. According to the latest statistics, the annual industrial output value generated by rural industrial enterprises in five counties, including Wuxi, Jiangjin and Wujin, in the river valley has surpassed 20 billion yuan each, ranking them among the leaders in the country. One new feature is the Sino-Singapore joint development of the Suzhou Industrial Park. The two sides have decided to spend 20 billion yuan on developing a 70-sq-km area into a industrial park consisting of a modern industrial zone, a high-tech zone, an industrial processing zone and an industrial town. So far, the park has concluded contracts on building more than 60 projects with Singapore, involving a total of 1.6 billion U.S. dollars.
