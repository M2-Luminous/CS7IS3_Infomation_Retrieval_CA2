"At present several nongovernmental organizations try to establish a normal economic mechanism of interaction between these countries and they undoubtedly will have future," he noted in his interview with INTERFAX Saturday [7 May]. At the same time Shokhin believes that Russia is to "overcome, in particular, the problems of debts" on the way to restoration of mutually beneficial cooperation with the countries of the Eastern Europe. He believes that there are some advances in Russia's relations with Hungary, Czech Republic, and Slovakia but "unsolved debt problems with respect to Poland and Bulgaria inherited from the USSR" still hinder restoration of "traditional ties." Shokhin believes that "the old mechanism of mutual relations, in particular, barter deals" represent "the second serious obstacle" on the way to restoration of mutual cooperation between these countries. Russia's previous partners are less interested in deliveries of their strategic resources in exchange for oil and gas, Russia's traditional raw materials. Shokhin is convinced that "large projects, as, for example, construction of the oil pipeline Yamal-Poland-Germany and then to the Western Europe" should become the basis for cooperation between Russia and foreign countries because these projects help to simultaneously solve the problem of employment "both for Russia and its partners." In addition, they help to implement "numerous private projects" which are "the locomotive for economic ties' restoration," noted Shokhin.
