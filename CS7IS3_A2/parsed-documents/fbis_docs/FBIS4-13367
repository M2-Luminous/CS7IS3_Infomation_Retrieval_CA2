FBIS4-13367 "drnes076_o_94001" FBIS-NES-94-076 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 SYRIA Envoy Comments on Kurdish State, Water Situation Envoy Comments on Kurdish State, Water Situation NC1604110794 Cairo MENA in Arabic 0800 GMT 16 Apr 94 NC1604110794 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Ankara, 16 Apr (MENA)--'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Rifa'i, Syrian ambassador to Turkey, has stressed that his country is against the establishment of an independent Kurdish state in northern Iraq, and that Syria will engage in methods other than diplomacy to prevent this from happening. In an interview with a MENA correspondent in Ankara, al-Rifa'i pointed out that Iraq must be united as any other Arab country. He noted that although the Syrian and Iraqi governments have differences, the establishment of a separate state in northern Iraq is another matter. The differences, he added, will not prevent Syria from using its means to stand alongside the Iraqi people in the face of this conspiracy. He also stressed his country will not use the Kurdistan Workers Party, which is outlawed in Turkey, as a source of pressure on Ankara to reach a water sharing agreement. Al-Rifa'i pointed out that Syria has as much right to the water in the Tigris and Euphrates as Turkey does, adding that the Syrian Government still wants an agreement among Syria, Iraq, and Turkey on the Tigris and Euphrates water, because the present situation cannot continue. He said his country is not against Turkey's selling water to Israel, but it prefers for Ankara to play the water card to put pressure on Israel to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories. Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said during his recent visit to Turkey that Israel is a democratic state. Ambassador al-Rifa'i said that these remarks are meant to pacify the Turkish people and to convince them that Israel is a peace-loving country and that it is the Arabs who are rejecting peace. The Syrian ambassador stressed that Peres lied, since more than 12,000 Palestinian prisoners are locked up in Israeli jails. He added that Israel has failed to implement the Gaza-Jericho agreement on time.
