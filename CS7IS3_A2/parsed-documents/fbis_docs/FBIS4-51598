The Cambodian delegation led by Fifth Army Region Deputy Commander Gen Duong Sokhon crossed the border from Poipet to Khlong Luk in Aranyaprathet where they met with the commander of the Burapha Task Force Maj-Gen Niphon Pharunnit. The meeting ended inconclusively but talks are expected to resume after the peace negotiations in Phnom Penh from May 2-7. Gen Duong told Thai reporters his troops commanded by Gen Lai Virak had successfully repulsed Khmer Rouge guerrillas from Highway 5. The highway is still closed to the public however. The general said guerrillas were grouping close to the Thai border at Ban Khok Sabang and Ban Nong Iam villages. Gen Duong promised to investigate if the mortar shell which landed at Rong Kula black market on March 26 leaving two Thai traders injured was fired by government troops or guerrillas. He said he was willing to offer compensation to the victims if it could be proven his troops were responsible for the shelling. The general insisted his forces did not fire deliberately on Thailand. Cross-border shelling is accidental, he said, and promised to instruct his troops to be more careful in the future. He also said he was willing to hold talks with the Thai military to resolve any border problems. General Duong complained the price of consumer products in Poipet had risen sharply since the closure of the border at Khlong Luk-Poipet. He said officials were trying to solve the problem. Poipet, he said, is now almost deserted with the majority of the people having fled elsewhere for fear of attack by the Khmer Rouge. Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday made clear that Thailand would decline any request for it to be the venue of talks among Cambodians. "Cambodia has a government of its own. The roundtable is an internal matter. There should be no need for (Cambodians) to meet in Bangkok. If they ask, it is not our affair," he said. The minister had been asked whether Thailand might be a venue if the Khmer Rouge refused to go to Phnom Penh. The guerrillas have cited security reasons for wanting the talks, set to start on Monday, to take place somewhere else. The Khmer Rouge regarded security as important, Squadron Leader Prasong said. "I think the Khmer Rouge should participate in the roundtable." But security measures should be well prepared, he said. The minister maintained that "preparedness" and compatibility in systems would be important to Vietnam's becoming a full member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). As a socialist country, Vietnam would need time to adjust, notably in terms of financial systems, including taxation and banking, he said. The minister was commenting on reports that Indonesia had expressed support for Vietnam's membership of ASEAN. Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh yesterday was winding up a visit to Indonesia. Asked about the prospects of competition, Sqn Ldr Prasong said this should not be an obstacle to Vietnam's membership of ASEAN. To beat the competition, the Thai private sector should improve quality and service, he said. "We have come a long way. Vietnam needs time, perhaps another three or five years." Sqn Ldr Prasong was reserved on reports that Indonesia is in favor of Vietnam becoming an observer to the Asian Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) forum. "It is a good idea to have friends in the Asia-Pacific region become observers," he said. But he noted that the APEC meeting in Seattle last November agreed not to receive new members for the next three years.
