The basis for the defense cooperation between Greece and Cyprus was agreed upon during his talks in Cyprus. Arsenis stressed that since the UN resolutions have not been implemented and the Turkish occupation troops have not withdrawn, Cyprus' defense should be reinforced as a condition for success in international negotiations.
