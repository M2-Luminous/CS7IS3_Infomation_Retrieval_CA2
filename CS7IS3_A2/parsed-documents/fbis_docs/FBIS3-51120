During an interview that lasted more than an hour with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, Kellenberger said he was also interested in learning about the dispute between the United States and Cuba. He expressed his government's sympathy with the complex situation the Latin American country is experiencing. The Cuban foreign minister, who made a technical stop in Bern before beginning his tour of five African nations, told PRENSA LATINA that, although informal, his stay had been very important and fruitful for the development of future bilateral ties. Besides his meeting with Kellenberger, who is also the political director of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, the Caribbean minister met with Heinrich Reimann, the ambassador and chief of the Department of African, Middle East, Asian, and Latin American Affairs at the Swiss Foreign Ministry. He visited the parliament of the Swiss Confederation, where he was briefed on that body's organization. Local authorities expressed their willingness to hold talks. In response, Robaina invited the secretary of state to visit Havana. Switzerland and Cuba are working on a bilateral agreement to promote and protect investments, similar to those Cuba has signed with other European countries. The Cuban foreign minister saw Nicolas Imboden, the ambassador of the Federal Department of Public Economy [name and title as received], before concluding his brief stay in this capital. Imboden, who is also in charge of commerce and investment, expressed his interest in some sort of trade exchange with Cuba. Robaina gave interviews to BERNER ZEITUNG, the leading newspaper here, and Radio Switzerland International. The Cuban minister will arrive in Ghana on Sunday, on the first leg of a venture through Africa that will take him to the People's Republic of Angola, then on to Zimbabwe, Zambia, and finally Namibia.
