Many people have begun to refer to this Sejm as a kind of a legislative voting machine--there are not enough fireworks, there is not enough friction. To cut a long story short, they say that this is a boring Sejm. Do you agree with that opinion? [Oleksy] I certainly do not agree with it. It depends on the particular idea of the Sejm that each of us has. One can say that the previous Sejms were a greater source of joy to the viewers and various observers because there really were many clashes. Even when they were about insignificant issues or so-called substitute subjects, they provided certain dynamics, the dynamics of disputes, quarrels, arguments. Well, this is definitely much more pleasurable to watch than the monotony of solid legislative work. [passage omitted] The Sejm is always some kind of theater; however, what should be taken care of is that this role of the Sejm is not its leading role, just as it used to be in the past. It so happens that the Sejm primarily works as the supreme organ of the legislative authorities; it defines the law, fulfills the controlling function; it watches the government, discusses reports prepared by the Supreme Chamber of Control, statements by the Constitutional Tribunal, and, finally, it passes laws in the complex legislative procedure. I believe that people who observe the work of this Sejm for a longer period will admit that there is less theatrical behavior, so it is perhaps not so interesting.... [Oleksy pauses] Well, but I must say that, actually, as far as some issues are concerned, this Sejm has already witnessed several heated discussions. [passage omitted] [Geryn] Let me now return to the issue of theatrical behavior. Indeed, the deputies themselves are more quiet, as it were, and the debates are held relatively quietly as well. However, there is some friction, which seems quite considerable, between the Belweder and the parliament. Right now this conflict seems to be dying down a bit. However, this is characterized by some fluctuation: At one point there is a conflict, then it dies down. Nonetheless, people who observe the political scene in Poland believe that a conflict does exist there. Can you confirm this? [Oleksy] No, I cannot. I think that this opinion is based on one or two incidents. There is no antipresidential or anti-Walesa atmosphere. Because this is true, which I know for sure, there is no reason for great friction. However, it sometimes happens that the president in enthusiasm uses phrases that concern the entire Sejm and are not really complimentary to it; of course, I do not want praise from the president. What I mean is a certain extremity in the president's interpretations of situations that are usual in the Sejm. Let us take the example of rejecting the presidential bills; this may happen more than once, and it happens not only to presidential bills. The parliament's task is to evaluate and discuss a bill and then make a decision in a ballot. Now, if the president makes a rapid, public evaluation and generalizes a given issue and thus issues an overall evaluation of the Sejm, it certainly may resemble a conflict, but there is no such conflict. I only fear that, as we draw closer to the presidential campaign, we may more and more often hear such sharp, firm, tactical statements; however, I would not like to see this occur. [Geryn] Immediately after being elected speaker of the Sejm, you said: I am open to contacts with the extraparliamentary opposition, with the parties that lost in the elections last September. What does this look like in practice? [Oleksy] In practice it looks quite miserable because my genuine political offer was treated by most extraparliamentary groupings as some kind of a game, tactics, as the parliament's attempt to legitimize itself, which, really, the parliament does not need. I would like to say that this is a bad approach. I think that this is detrimental to a dialogue in the state--a dialogue about essential issues, which is really needed. I think that the ideas that came up as a result of a lack of readiness to cooperate in the creation of the Constitution... [Oleksy pauses] I think they are not likely to be successful. They will only obscure the picture of some kind of joint thinking about the Constitution. I will say once again that the political offer of opening the Sejm to cooperation with extraparliamentary groupings is still a valid offer; however, the response to it is next to none.
