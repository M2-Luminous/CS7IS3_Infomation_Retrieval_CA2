Following Walesa's arrival, aboard a Polish Air Force flight which landed at the Ciampino military and civilian airport, the full delegation departed for Cassino, midway between Rome and Naples, for a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the World War II battle of Montecassino. In fierce fighting during the offensive mounted against a German stronghold by Allied troops, including the II Polish Army Corps, more than 2,000 Polish soldiers were killed. Cassino is also the site of Italy's largest Polish cemetery. This evening, the visiting president will return to Rome for a meeting with Head of State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. Tomorrow, Walesa will go to Rome's Catholic Gemelli Hospital for a visit to his friend and compatriot, Pope John Paul II, who is recovering from surgery following a broken leg. The president will return to Warsaw tomorrow in the early afternoon.
