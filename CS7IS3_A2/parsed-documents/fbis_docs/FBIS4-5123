Ranariddh -- who is excrement underneath the house, a U.S. and French puppet, and a puppet of communist Vietnam's puppets -- has said there is a picture of Pol Pot on a nice road in Thailand accompanied by a car and a convoy of trucks. The shit Ranariddh has said this shows Pol Pot escaping from Pailin when the two-headed government's forces entered Pailin. The shit Ranariddh has also said that he is not going to show this picture; he will keep it to himself. Liar! Stinking shit! 2. This is really shit. He is really a U.S. and French puppet; he is really a puppet of communist Vietnam's puppets. He says whatever his masters order him to say. In France recently, the chief of the French espionage agency (Coedes) and the American CIA brainwashed the shit Ranariddh into opposing King Sihanouk and the five-point plan for national reconciliation, continuing to fight the Khmer Rouge, and keeping this up. France and the United States say they will think about letting Ranariddh be a lecturer in France, that France and the United States will help him become king, and that France and the United States will not let Prince Sihakmoni reign. France and the United States have made efforts to spread propaganda about fighting against the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot, and Thailand. They say: Keep fighting to thwart King Norodom Sihanouk's national reconciliation plan, especially ahead of and during the king's return to Phnom Penh. 3. Who does not know that the shit Ranariddh is afraid of the puppets Hun Sen, Chea Sim, and Sar Kheng, as if they were tigers? Who does not know that the shit Ranariddh is a lackey of the United States and France? Who does not know that Ranariddh's soldiers were created by the United States and are U.S. mercenaries who serve the United States like dogs in killing the Cambodian nation and people? Who does not know that the shit Ranariddh is killing FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and crawls at the feet of communist Vietnam's puppets? Who does not know that the shit Ranariddh is corrupt and has taken millions of dollars in bribes; sold himself and the nation; killed the people; and is serving the United States, France, foreigners, and evil wealthy people? Who does not know that the people and masses in Phnom Penh -- even children -- never refer to Ranariddh as prince; he is usually called the shit Ranariddh, the shit Ranariddh, the shit Ranariddh [repetition as heard], because he stinks even against the wind. People detest him almost to the point of vomiting. As for the whereabouts and movements of Pol Pot, he is not going anywhere. He always remains on Cambodian territory. He can be found in Kampot, Phnum Kamchay, Phnum Kravanh, Kompong Speu, Kratie, Mondolkiri, Ratanakiri, Stung Treng, Kompong Cham, Kandal, Phnom Penh, Pursat, Battambang, Kompong Chhnang, Siem Reap, Kompong Thom, Preah Vihear, Takeo, Prey Veng, and Svay Rieng. His houses are in Rumchang and Ampil. If the shit Ranariddh wants to meet Pol Pot, he can go to Rumchang and Ampil. Pol Pot will not meet Ranariddh, though, because Ranariddh really stinks.
