Arseni also stated that the draft law on press is a draft pointed against the press; it violates the Universal Declaration on Human Rights stipulating the delivery of correct and uncensored information to people. "Under present conditions Moldova does not need a law on press," said Arseni. Vlad Darie, member of the PDMM Coordinating Council, mentioned that the governing party, PDMM, will be soon removed, and its place will be taken by the socialists and communists. Many mayors who did not support the PDMM during the electoral campaign were fired. Concerning this, the PDMM Republican Council made public a declaration calling "the extension of the results of the parliamentary elections on the local administrative organs a violation of the Constitution." "The PDMM informs the representatives of the CSCE, the European Council, foreign embassies and political parties and movements about the real threat of restoring totalitarianism and obscurantism in our country," says the declaration.
