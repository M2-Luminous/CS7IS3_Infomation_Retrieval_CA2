(Donen) (located in Tokai, Ibaraki Prefecture), the Science and Technology Agency [STA] announced on 10 June that it has reached an accord with the IAEA on reducing the amount of residue plutonium by 80-85 percent in two years through such measures as changing equipment. An STA official in charge, who visited Vienna to attend a regular IAEA board of directors meeting, briefed the IAEA on 6 June -- Vienna time -- on three possible measures to reduce the amount of residue plutonium, and he obtained an agreement from the IAEA. The three measures are: 1) to tighten control of collecting plutonium from processing equipment; 2) to promptly take apart the glove boxes [preceding two words in English] for producing fuel, which were formerly used at the plant and are now in safekeeping, and to collect plutonium from these boxes; and 3) to promptly adopt new glove boxes that are difficult for residue plutonium to stick to. The residue plutonium issue has come to the fore at the "third laboratory for producing plutonium fuel" of the plant, which has supplied fuel to fast breeder reactors "Joyo" and "Monju" since 1988. Plutonium powder sticks to facilities like glass-walled glove boxes, in which workers' gloved-hands handle plutonium to shape it into fuel.
