FR940831-0-00041 FR940831-0-00015 Deemed Filing Date of an Application in a Case of Misinformation We are adding new §§404.633 and 416.351 to our regulations to explain the rules we will follow in implementing sections 202(j)(5) and 1631(e)(5) of the Act, respectively. Sections 404.633(b) and 416.351(b) of the final regulations explain that we may establish a ``deemed'' filing date of an application for benefits under these sections of the Act if we determine to our satisfaction that_ (1) An individual failed to apply for monthly Social Security or SSI benefits for himself or herself because we provided such individual misinformation about his or her eligibility for the respective benefits, including misinformation about the amount or payment of such benefits; or (2) An individual who had authority to sign an application for another person under §404.612 or §416.315, as appropriate, failed to apply for monthly Social Security or SSI benefits for that person because we provided the individual misinformation about such person's eligibility for the respective benefits, including misinformation about the amount or payment of such benefits. In the first situation, we would deem an application to have been filed on the date the misinformation was provided to the individual or, if later, the date on which such individual met all of the requirements for entitlement to monthly Social Security benefits or eligibility for SSI benefits, as the case may be, other than the requirement of filing an application. In the second situation, we would deem an application to have been filed on the date the misinformation was provided to the individual or, if later, the date on which the person referred to in item (2) above, i.e., the person on whose behalf the individual was inquiring about getting benefits, met all the requirements for entitlement to monthly Social Security benefits or eligibility for SSI benefits, as the case may be, other than the requirement of filing an application. The regulations explain that we will apply certain requirements and conditions which are specified in the regulations in making the determination described above, i.e., a determination as to whether misinformation was provided. The regulations explain that before we may make such a determination and establish a ``deemed'' filing date of an application for benefits, an application for such benefits must be filed with us either by the claimant, i.e., the individual in item (1) above or the person referred to in item (2) above, or by someone who is authorized to sign an application on behalf of the claimant under §404.612 or §416.315. The regulations also provide that if the claimant dies after the alleged misinformation was provided but before an application is filed, an application for monthly Social Security benefits must be filed by a person who would be qualified to receive any benefits due the deceased. With respect to SSI benefits, if the claimant dies after the alleged misinformation was provided but before an application is filed, a person who would be qualified under §416.542(b) to receive any benefits due the deceased, or someone on behalf of such a person, must file an application for the benefits. This latter provision is consistent with the provisions of our final regulations on ``Payment of Benefits Due Deceased Recipients,'' which were published in the Federal Register on October 13, 1993, at 58 FR 52909. Our regulations on ``Payment of Benefits Due Deceased Recipients'' amended certain sections of the SSI regulations, including, as pertinent here, §§416.340(d)(2), 416.345(e)(2), and 416.542(b), to implement section 8 of Pub. L. 99&hyph;643. Section 8 of Pub. L. 99&hyph;643 amended section 1631(b)(1) of the Act to expand the circumstances under which SSI benefits due a deceased individual may be paid to survivors. Among other things, those regulations amended §§416.340(d)(2) and 416.345(e)(2) to permit, in general, a deceased claimant's surviving spouse or parent(s) who could receive the claimant's benefits under §416.542(b), or someone on behalf of such surviving spouse or parent(s), to file an application for SSI benefits for the claimant where the claimant dies after we receive a written statement indicating an intent to claim SSI benefits or an oral inquiry about SSI eligibility. The rule which we now are adding regarding who may file an application for SSI benefits on behalf of a claimant where the claimant dies after the alleged misinformation was provided, discussed above, is consistent with these earlier changes to the SSI regulations. We are amending §§404.612, 404.615 and 416.310 to reflect the provisions of §§404.633(b) and 416.351(b) concerning who may file an application if a claimant dies after the alleged misinformation was provided. Sections 404.633(c) and 416.351(c) explain that the provisions for establishing a ``deemed'' filing date of an application apply only to cases in which the misinformation was provided to the individual by an employee of SSA, including an officer of the Agency, while such person was acting in his or her official capacity as an employee or officer of the Agency. The regulations also explain that ``misinformation'' is information which we would consider incorrect, misleading, or incomplete in view of the facts which the individual gave to the employee, or of which the employee otherwise was aware or should have been aware, regarding the claimant's particular circumstances. Under these regulations, we will consider the information provided to be incomplete if the employee failed to provide the individual with appropriate, additional information which he or she is required to provide in carrying out his or her official duties. The misinformation may have been provided orally or in writing. However, the misinformation must have been provided to the individual in response to his or her request to us for information about applying for benefits, either for himself or herself or for another person for whom he or she could sign an application.
