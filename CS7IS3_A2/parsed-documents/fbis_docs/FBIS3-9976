This genocidal action came at a time when, despite the enormous obstacles still to be overcome, limited progress is being made in the slow and protracted process of negotiations between the organizations [as heard] and PLO representatives seeking to consolidate the agreement signed in September 1993 on Palestinian sovereignty over the Gaza Strip and the Jericho zone. Simultaneously, a number of rounds of negotiations were being held between Israel and its neighboring Arab states, encouraged in the objective of achieving a just and long-lasting peace that would benefit all peoples of the region, based on the full recognition of their inalienable rights. Savage actions like those carried out in Hebron do not contribute to the climate of mutual understanding and trust that could pave the way for the cherished peace; on the contrary, they stir up the passions of hatred and vengeance and deepen the wounds of the peoples, in this case, the long-suffering Arab-Palestinian people. Although the top Israeli officials have promised to investigate the events and to impose justice on the perpetrators of the crime, it will be very difficult to restore the climate of confidence that will promote the complex and difficult process of the quest for regional peace. It is unquestionable that the enemies of peace in the Middle East have inflicted a heavy blow on efforts being made in this regard. The Ministry of Foreign Relations of the Republic of Cuba wishes to extend to the friendly Palestinian people the feelings of solidarity and sympathy of the Cuban people on the occasion of this horrible tragedy; at the same time, it hopes that the Israeli Government officials will adopt immediate measures to prevent the repetition of such genocidal actions against the Arab-Palestinian people of the occupied territories. In this moment of sorrow and suffering, we want to reaffirm the irrevocable solidarity of the Cuban people and Government with the just cause of the Palestinian people, to whom we ratify our support of their efforts in the quest for peace and for the full recognition of their inalienable right to build their own independent and sovereign state. [Signed] Havana, 26 February 1994.
