As the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and Sakigake [Harbinger Party] work more actively for a so-called "tripolar" structure, Shinseito's concept of forming a new-new party by unifying all the ruling coalition parties has become improbable. It is now concentrating on unity with the Japan New Party [JNP], the prime minister's home camp, and working for the restoration of its leadership in the coalition. With regard to Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who has not appeared in public for some time, while some people think "he is beginning to distance himself from the prime minister" (according to a ruling party source), there has actually not been any change in his support for the prime minister. He is working on assisting the prime minister from the sidelines to effect a breakthrough in the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. Shinseito did not participate in the meeting of ruling party representatives on 7 March, and party chief Tsutomu Hata (deputy prime minister and foreign minister) alone attended the meeting of ruling party leaders. Ozawa was also absent from the plenary session of the House of Representatives on that day, and the explanation given by his office was: "(He is) tired and taking a rest." Hata said, "There should not be any problem since the party head was present," denying speculation about a Shinseito boycott. Another party official asserted, "Since Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura said he would act as the coordinator, then let him do so." This indicates that Shinseito is actually abstaining from steering Diet affairs. It probably intends to watch out for any misdeeds by Takemura in his coordination efforts, then take the opportunity to impair the trend of support for the "social democratic-liberal" bloc. However, close associates of Ozawa say that "Japan-U.S. relations constitute a national issue," and Ozawa is prepared to offer full cooperation. Ozawa has recently been busy circulating around, making contact with U.S. Government officials. He met with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale on 28 February. It is said that the reason Ozawa was absent from the meeting of government and ruling party leaders convened on the evening of 2 March to announce the cancellation of plans for a cabinet reshuffle was because he was discussing ways to bring about a breakthrough in the insurance sector negotiations with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii at a hotel in Tokyo. It is also true that this situation of "semi-boycott" (according to a senior Shinseito official) is making the party's strategy ineffective. Shinseito has been working on a strategy of accepting potential deserters from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] by urging the former Kato group [of the LDP], with which Shinseito forms a Diet floor group called the "Shinseito-Kaikaku Rengo [Reform Alliance]," and the "Kaikaku-no-Kai [Association for Reform]" led by Takeo Nishioka, former chairman of the LDP General Council, to form a floor grouping of independents. Part of the reason for this new group is that by allowing members of the group to participate in the meeting of ruling party representatives, they can join hands with Shinseito and Komeito to defeat the SDPJ, DSP, and Sakigake by numerical strength, in order to effect a change in the present balance of power. However, after passage of the political reform bills, while Shinseito "has been making secret contacts with LDP members, they are very unresponsive," (according to a senior Shinseito official). It seems that another split in the LDP is not forthcoming in the immediate future. Therefore, Shinseito's strategy for the moment is to, at least, take in the former Kato group in an effort to accelerate the momentum of political realignment. It will further work at winning the JNP over, and conducting more active exchanges with this party.
