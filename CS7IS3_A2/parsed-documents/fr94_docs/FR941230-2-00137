FR941230-2-00137 FR941230-2-00072 Truancy_$400,000 Truancy has been rated as one of the top 10 problems facing schools, with the daily absentee rate being as high as 30 percent in some cities. As a number of studies have documented, high rates of truancy are linked to high daytime burglary rates, auto theft rates, and vandalism. In addition to the impact upon the community and the school system, truancy has an even more important impact on students' learning gains, interpersonal relationships, and, ultimately, completion of school and employment. In fiscal year 1995, OJJDP expects to collaborate with the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) and the Department of Education to support a technical assistance program focused on combating the problem of truancy in the Nation's public schools. BJA will contribute $200,000 to this program. The parameters of this program will be defined in joint planning with the Department of Education and outlined in the final plan. Youth-Centered Conflict Resolution_$200,000 Violence in and around school campuses, conflict among students within schools, and conflicts between schools related to intramural activities have become increasingly problematic for school administrators, teachers, parents, and community leaders. While experts may debate the merits and impact of the varied contributing factors, most would agree that public school curricula, for the most part, do not provide for the systematic development of problem- and conflict-resolving skills. Inclusion of problem-solving skills in school curricula and community activities can be expected to provide a continuum in problem-solving skills and approaches that will enhance school discipline and lead to improved functioning in a democratic society. OJJDP proposes to award a grant to a qualified organization to develop, in concert with other established organizations currently providing conflict resolution services, a national strategy for broad-based education, training, and utilization of conflict resolution skills. In support of this task, the grantee would conduct four regional technical assistance workshops on the use of the joint publication being developed by the Department of Justice and the Department of Education, Conflict Resolution Programs in Schools: A guide to Program Selection and Implementation. A complementary task may include the compilation of a compendium of model programs for this publication. Pathways to Success_$450,000 This project will support a collaborative effort among OJJDP, the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), and the National Endowment for the Arts. The project will promote business entrepreneurial, education, recreation, job skills, and arts programs for after-school and weekend hours. This program would make available to at-risk youth a variety of opportunities outside the regular school curriculum. This program would be jointly funded with the BJA ($200,000) and the National Endowment for the Arts ($50,000). It would fund up to five applications at $40,000 each under the Safe Futures Program and up to five additional competitive sites at up to $50,000 each for the fist year of a two year project period. Applicants interested in applying for this program would need to demonstrate that collaboration has taken place with existing education, business, arts, and community groups and youth-serving agencies in the development of its program, including, where appropriate, collaboration with existing after-school and weekend youth programs. The Pathways to Success program would serve at-risk youth from age 6 to 18, but a project would not need to cover the full age range. Mental Health in the Juvenile Justice System_$500,000 This program would implement a two-pronged strategy to address the mental health and juvenile justice systems' lack of coordinated and adequate mental health treatment for at-risk and delinquent youth. The program would target juveniles with mental health problems and impairments (including learning disabilities), those who are at risk of becoming status or delinquent offenders, and alleged and adjudicated status offenders and delinquents with undiagnosed or untreated mental health problems, including those in residential care or juvenile detention and correctional facilities. The first phase, funded under the fiscal year 1994 plan, provides a two day conference for approximately 200 attendees to address the topics of at-risk juveniles and juveniles with mental health problems or learning disabilities in the juvenile justice system. The second phase, to be considered for funding in fiscal year 1995, would provide funds to the five jurisdictions participating in the Safe Futures Program. Their planning process would be expected to provide comprehensive, coordinated, and collaborative approaches among juvenile justice, youth service, and mental health agencies to improve mental health services for juveniles in these five communities. A particular focus of the fiscal year 1995 funding would be to target victims of child abuse and juvenile sex offenders. Youth Handgun Study/Model Juvenile Handgun Legislation_$175,500 Reducing and preventing gun violence is a primary concern of Federal, State, and local governments. This violence affects youth not only as perpetrators but also as victims and witnesses. There is a need to know about the various laws that States have passed concerning youth and handguns.
