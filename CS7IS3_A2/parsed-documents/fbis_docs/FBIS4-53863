Total recurring results for all 25 firms came in at a profit of 46.6 billion yen versus a loss of 352.3 billion yen for the year ending in March 1993. A recurring profit was recorded for the first time in three years for the group as a whole, and the number of firms recording profits increased from three to 13. A recovery in stock prices has led to an increase in brokerage fee revenues, indicating that overall revenues are recovering. Daiwa Securities experienced profits from securities trading activities and growth in investment trust sales fees and realized recurring profits of 52 billion yen, slightly exceeding Nomura Securities and ranking as the top performer for the first time. Operating revenues, which represent sales in most businesses, gained 22 percent for the 25 firms as a group and totaled 1.8928 trillion yen. The daily average volume of stocks traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange increased nearly 60 percent to a figure just below 400 billion yen, leading to an increase in commission revenues. Other factors contributing to improvement in earnings included favorable sales of government and industrial bond investment trusts, expansion of profits from bond trading activity and the effects of cost savings resulting from management improvement actions. Investment trust sales commissions at the four major securities firms reached 20 billion yen, while Daiwa, Nomura, and Nikko registered bond trading profits exceeding 30 billion yen. On the other hand, quasi-major and medium securities firms experienced a slowing in the profits recovery trend near the end of the fiscal year because of slow stock trading activity. Among the 21 quasi-major and smaller firms, nine firms recorded profits, and New Japan Securities, Wako Securities, Okasan Securities, and Marusan Securities resumed payment of dividends. On the other hand, 12 firms continued to record deficits and cancel dividends. Dai-Ichi Securities and Yamatane Securities recorded deficits for four straight years. All firms anticipate stock prices to remain firm in the fiscal year ending in March 1995 and expect recurring profits for the year. However, stock trading volume has been slow from the beginning of the year and the majority of quasi-major and smaller firms suffered losses according to the monthly earnings report for April. Now that cost savings from management improvement actions are nearing their limit and fierce competition lies ahead with the arrival of city bank securities subsidiaries, earnings prospects will remain dismal.
