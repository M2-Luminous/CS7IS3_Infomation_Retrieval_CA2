But the numerous changes in Russian legislation have turned this possibility into a utopia too. Yesterday the administration of the Mashinoimport VO [foreign trade organization]--one of the organizations which handles deliveries of commodities to pay off debts--received a letter from the RF Ministry of Finance which imposed work conditions which can be considered nothing but enslavement. The method of paying off the indebtedness of the developing countries with deliveries of goods, despite all its flaws, in principle could at least partially eliminate the difficult problem of paying the debt. On the one hand, Russia was supposed to receive various types of raw and processed materials, technological equipment, and consumer goods, thereby satisfying the most acute needs of our consumers in this sphere. On the other, the budget would have received a considerable amount of money. This practice gave perfectly positive results until 1993, but then the situation changed drastically. Among other things, the system of subsidizing imports was abolished and the term for transferring money earned from selling goods to the budget was limited to one month (according to specialists' calculations, this operation can sometimes take up to 6 months). In response to these measures, foreign trade organizations stopped fulfilling contracts concluded. And this year the situation involving paying off credits with commodity deliveries was aggravated even more by the March increase in import duty rates. In accordance with the new letter from the Ministry of Finance, the term for settling accounts with the budget is in fact increased--up to two months. But now firms must present the so-called guarantee obligation when Vneshekonombank (which, as everyone knows, services transactions on debt obligations of other countries) receives the shipping documents or a letter of credit is opened there. With this obligation, after two months time has elapsed, the associations grant the bank the right to deduct, on a nonacceptance basis, the shortfall from their own accounts, and if there are insufficient funds in the accounts, the organization is responsible with its fixed and working capital. In this way, when fulfilling a state order, the associations are inevitably threatened with bankruptcy. The Ministry of Finance undoubtedly had good intentions--increasing budget revenue, but the conditions it proposed on deliveries do not suit anyone, and that, in turn, in no way helps replenish the Russian treasury. For example, last year as a result of stopping deliveries of goods to pay off credits, according to rough estimates the budget had a shortfall of several tens of millions of dollars just from the unpaid customs charges and taxes from trade organizations engaged in importing these types of goods. As a result of the actions of departmental bureaucrats, not only is the fulfillment of intergovernmental agreements being disrupted, but the very possibility of credits issued by the former Soviet Union being returned is called into question.
