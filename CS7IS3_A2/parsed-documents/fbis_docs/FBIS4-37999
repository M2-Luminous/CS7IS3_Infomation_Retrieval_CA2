Foreign diplomatic sources in Israel told our correspondent that an agreement in principle was reached in a recent meeting King Husayn held with Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres in Elat. Jordan expressed its wish to set up direct links with Israel without the Palestinians, and the opening of these border crossings is an expression of that policy. Israeli sources said agreement has so far been reached only on the opening of the crossing between Elat and al-'Aqabah, and that while the other crossings are on the agenda, they have still not come up in actual talks.
