It has shown during all stages of the peace process that it is ready to respond to any effort to entrench the bases of a just and comprehensive peace that will ensure an end to injustice and occupation. AL-THAWRAH notes that Syria has repeatedly announced that the peace for which it is working and exerting every effort is the peace that can lead to Israel's withdrawal from the Golan and all other occupied Arab territories, that can entrench the values of right and justice, and that can lead to the restoration of all Arab rights. The newspaper adds: Syria has rejected phased steps and unilateral solutions and has stood firmly against Israeli attempts to divide the solution. This is because Syria depends, in its peaceful trends, on objective and logic realities, which no one can deny or ignore, foremost of which is the reality that peace cannot come in installments or stages and that if it is not just and comprehensive, it will not be a real and deep-rooted peace. AL-THAWRAH stresses that Syria has offered all it can to preserve the credibility of the peace process and to save the process from any deviation from its specified goals. Moreover, Syria has always resorted to UN resolutions and the law of international legitimacy to refute Israel's allegations, to prevent its calls for partial and unilateral solutions, and to prove the futility of these offers. Concluding, the newspaper says: There is no doubt that Syria's eagerness to provide a suitable climate to make the peace process successful comes from its concern about regaining all the Arab territories and rights and also from its desire to save the region from the whirlpools of confusion and instability that are threatening more war disasters and tragedies. Syria adheres to this noble goal that is sought by all nations and to the peace process as a valuable and important opportunity that should lead to a real and strong peace. The newspaper TISHRIN writes in its editorial on the atmosphere of disappointment and bitterness, which the occupied Arab territories are experiencing as a result of the signing of the self-rule accord. It points out that our kinsfolk in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are still in shock because the accord has resulted in certain arrangements and measures that have given Israel all it wants, including occupation; control of crossing points, bridges, and roads; security and protection for the settlers; and absolute Israeli sovereignty over political, defense, and foreign affairs. TISHRIN notes that the accord will protect and achieve Israel's goals in devouring and controlling territories. This, the paper says, indicates that by signing the self-rule accord, Israel has lifted a heavy burden from its shoulders, namely, its complete failure to guarantee security for its occupation and its settlers and to confront and limit the intifadah. TISHRIN adds: The accords' stipulations, annexes, and maps conflict with the Palestinian people's will, have made gains for the occupation, and are aimed at liquidating the Palestinian people's right to independence, freedom, and self-determination. This conflict, the paper says, will not last because nations' fate cannot be determined by fragile accords or unilateral policies that have nothing to do with nations' rights and real trends toward full independence. TISHRIN asserts that the current insistence in the occupied West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem on the continuation of the intifadah against the occupied forces and settlers is viewed as part of our people's determination not to bow to the policy of concession that began with the Oslo talks and that produced an agreement that emptied the peace process of its essence. Concluding, TISHRIN says: It is natural for the Arab parties taking part in the peace process, namely, Syrian, Lebanon, and Jordan, to hasten to coordinate their positions and stress their adherence to the principles of a just and comprehensive solution and to the Madrid conference formula that calls for Israel's total Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories.
