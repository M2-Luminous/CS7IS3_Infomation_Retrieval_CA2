In its comments on the results of the negotiations released late Wednesday, the ministry notes, that the surprise comes since a timetable "has been repeatedly promised by Russian spokesmen and was even mentioned in Russian President Boris Yeltsin's recent letter to Estonian President Lennart Meri". "Since Estonia has fundamentally accepted the August 31, 1994 final date offered by the Russians, the logical and necessary next step was for Russia to produce a detailed timetable," - Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik was quoted by the ministry as saying. Luik is now in Brussels, where he is to sign the Partnership for Peace agreement Thursday. "Estonia still expects Russia to live up to the international obligations it accepted by signing the Final Document of the Helsinki Summit in July 1992, requiring the early, orderly and complete withdrawal of foreign military forces from the territories of the Baltic states," -- the ministry notes, -- "Although there can no longer be talk of an `early' withdrawal, the pullout can still be completed completely, unconditionally and in an orderly fashion."
