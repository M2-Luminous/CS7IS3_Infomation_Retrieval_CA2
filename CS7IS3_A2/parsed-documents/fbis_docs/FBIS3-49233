The Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] notes with concern that the inventory of the exercise of power by the current coalition of political forces does not acknowledge the alarm signals being more and more clearly emitted by Romanian society. The economic crisis and the social crisis experienced by Romania thus turn into the nation's serious crisis of confidence in the political forces, which have assumed the responsibility to rule the country. The immobilism and uncertainty that those in power enjoy, the absence of a firm political desire for change, as well as voluntarism and arrogance do not offer tangible answers to the growing desperation of our citizens regarding the serious economic imbalance and the increasing and futile sacrifices, which an incompetent government has been perpetuating for more than a year now. Instead of protecting the standard of living and the security of citizens, those in power protect corruption and stagnation. Instead of making efforts to bring about change and structural reform that might put an end to our crisis, and instead of promoting truth, the executive power perpetuates confusion and stagnation that permit the preservation of the privileges of a petty and greedy political clientele. No generous project, no disinterested thoughts, and no respect for the interests of the citizen and for the sovereign interests of the nation inspires the policy of the current holders of the essential levers of our country's political activity. The CDR has done everything in its power to change this tense situation. It has always promoted a policy of supporting a firm policy of reform and has effectively supported all correct legal initiatives -- unfortunately too few so far. It has consistently and responsibly assumed the basic political task characteristic of any opposition, namely to criticize the errors made by the executive power. Through constitutional means at its disposal, it has drawn attention to the growing mistrust of citizens in the policy promoted by the coalition forces, which ensured the PDSR's [Social Democracy Party of Romania] majority in Parliament, and in the way in which the PDSR government has fulfilled its mandate. On several occasions, it proposed a program of stopping the crisis and it has shown its readiness for any dialogue that would have permitted the fulfillment of this program and the halting of the dramatic deterioration of the citizens' standard of living. The systematic rejection of these arguments, the demagogic and arrogant answer by the majority coalition, which did not heed these signals and continued verbal maneuvers and back-stage moves instead of firmly implementing at least its own reform program, have taken our country to a serious crisis of political confidence. It is clear for anyone that one cannot govern correctly with a majority of 13 votes in parliament and a proportion of confidence, without any precedent in the past four years. The PDSR is trying to persuade us that these are inevitable effects of any reform policy; it is obvious, however, for anyone that, on the contrary, these are the effects of lack of will to promote the reform process. Our citizens realize very well that stagnation and the absence of a consistent strategy for change generate a chaotic and uncontrollable development of the inflation and an unprecedented impoverishing of the majority of the population, and they realize that the government imposes useless sacrifices on the country; the electorate realizes very well that the government's lack of prospects takes all of us down a blind lane from which it will be more and more difficult to emerge. Within this context, the CDR calls on the entire nation not to lose hope. There are still a lot of competent people and generous ideas to put an end to this crisis. These latent forces have to become the essential vector of our political activity. Through our joint will, let us make the PDSR renounce the bankrupt policy that it continues to promote, and to adopt a new policy able to stir and involve all those who are waiting for a new wave in our country. We are calling on all responsible political formations, all trade unions and civic associations, and the entire Romanian society to rally around the CDR in order to impose a new political pact on those in power; a pact that will rally all forces favoring change and that will keep away reactionary, extremist, and antireform forces from the executive power; a pact that will ensure the responsible promotion of a clear-cut, generous, and intelligent strategy for coming out of this crisis; and a pact that will put an end to misery, poverty, corruption, and lies. Let us turn 1994 into the first year of a prosperous, powerful, and dignified Romania! [Signed] Emil Constantinescu, CDR president
