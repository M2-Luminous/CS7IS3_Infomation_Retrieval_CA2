The 81st ILO meeting also coincides with the celebration of the 75th founding anniversary of the ILO and the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Philadelphia. More importantly, the Thai tripartite committee will introduce Thailand's Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare to some 175 participating countries at the meeting so they will know that Thailand now has an official government agency to take direct responsibility for the care of its laborers. Regarding the main agenda, apart from consideration of various organization budgets and projects, there also will be a report presented by the ILO director general. The main contents of the report will be about the role of the organization in creating social justice and the organization's activities. The discussion also will touch upon the issues of part-time jobs, safety and health of workers in the mining industry, role of the private sector in market promotion, as well as a review of the Declaration on measures against racial discrimination in South Africa. The ASEAN group will submit to the ILO its consensus on international work standards and the linkage of the issues of social role with the international trading system. The ASEAN group feels that the linking of work standards to the trading system will adversely affect the economies of the developing countries rather than benefit them. In addition, ASEAN also feels that the ILO should improve international standards to make it suitable for modern times.
