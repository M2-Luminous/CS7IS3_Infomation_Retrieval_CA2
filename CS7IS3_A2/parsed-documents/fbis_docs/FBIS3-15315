More than 5,000 representatives of various parties and social-political movements, as well as 134 foreign observers from the Council of Europe, CSCE and other organizations have followed them. "Will these elections approach us to a real democracy?" wonders the author, estimating that the electorate had voiced for "memories of the past." Speculative political declarations on the independence of Moldova, national problems, the cynical game with "Russian-speakers" and pensioners gave the expected results -- the victory of agrarians and socialists, Afanasieva asserts. Forecasting an eventual evolution of social-political events, the quoted source states that the opposition does not haste to "take part in a coalition government," and neither do agrarians want to share the power with them. According to the author, the new parliament will stick in political problems -- the Constitution, Dniester, the south. Under economical aspect, realizing that reforms cannot be avoided, the Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova (PDAM) and socialists have striven for power in order to "direct the chaotic motion towards a free market, which the premier and president proudly call reforms, into their own pockets." The scandal between agrarians and the Privatization Department did not mean at all that PDAM is against privatization, it rather dislikes that this process does not belong to it. Eventual quarrels can occur between agrarians, socialists and social-democrats only concerning the destination of preferential credits. From the opposition's point of view, we should he happy: "The more definite is the victory, the sooner the unsolvability of winners will manifest," the authors concludes.
