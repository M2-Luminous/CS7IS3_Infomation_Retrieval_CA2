FR940524-1-00012 FR940524-1-00005 • Housing assistance means assistance provided by the Federal Government to be used in connection with the provision of housing, that is provided in the form of a grant, contract, loan, loan guarantee, cooperative agreement, interest subsidy, insurance, or direct appropriation; and does not include assistance provided by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; the Federal Emergency Management Agency; the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under the single family mortgage insurance programs under the National Housing Act or the homeownership assistance program under section 235 of such Act; the National Homeownserhsip Trust; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the affordable housing program under section 40 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; or the Resolution Trust Corporation under the affordable housing program under section 21A(c) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act. • Hazardous areas means those areas in a building referred to as hazardous areas in National Fire Protection Association Standard 101, known as the Life Safety Code ® , or any successor standard thereto. • Smoke detectors means single or multiple station, self-contained alarm devices designed to respond to the presence of visible or invisible particles of combustion, installed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association Standard 74 or any successor standard thereto. • Automatic sprinkler system means an electronically supervised, integrated system of piping to which sprinklers are attached in a systematic pattern, and which, when activated by heat from a fire: (a) will protect human lives by discharging water over the fire area, in accordance with National Fire Protection Association Standard 13, 13D, or 13R, whichever is appropriate for the type of building and occupancy being protected, or any successor standard thereto; and (b) includes an alarm signaling system with appropriate warning signals (to the extent such alarm systems and warning signals are required by Federal, State, or local laws or regulations) installed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association Standard 72, or any successor standard thereto. A critical issue regarding implementation of the Act involves the definition and determination of an equivalent level of safety. The Act defines the term as an alternative design or system (which may include automatic sprinkler systems), based upon fire protection engineering analysis, which achieves a level of safety equal to or greater than that provided by automatic sprinkler systems. The definition of an automatic sprinkler system is unique to the Act. In addition to describing the physical characteristics of an automatic sprinkler system, the definition sets a performance objective for the system. Automatic sprinkler systems installed in compliance with the Act must protect human lives. Sprinkler systems are generally not designed with this specific objective in mind. The General Services Administration must issue regulations to further define the term equivalent level of safety. The Act specifies that, to the extent practicable, these regulations be based upon nationally recognized codes. This document provides the further definition required by the Act. A general level of safety provided by sprinklers is established, and a framework for evaluating alternative methodologies for achieving this level is presented. II. Objectives of the Legislation Despite the widespread availability of affordable means of preventing fire losses, the United States continues to have one of the highest per capita fire death rates in the industrialized world. Fire is the fourth largest accidental killer in the United States, claiming at least 5,500 lives annually and injuring an additional 30,000 individuals. The fire vulnerability of office buildings and residential housing units can be reduced through strong fire safety measures. It is essential for the protection of life and property that effective technology be employed in detecting, containing and suppressing fires. When properly installed and maintained, automatic sprinklers and smoke detectors provide effective safeguards against loss of life and property from fire. According to the National Fire Protection Association, there is no record of a multiple death fire (involving the loss of three of more people) in a building with a fully operational sprinkler system. The Federal Government, in addition to increasing the protection provided its own employees and individuals living in federally subsidized housing, can set an example in the area of fire safety and, by its own actions, encourage the private sector to use technology that has been proven to save lives. The Federal Fire Safety Act of 1992 was created to serve as a model for local jurisdictions where the Congress believed not enough was being done to promote and provide for the fire safety of citizens. The evidence for the Congressional concern is clear. According to National Fire Protection Association data, there are about 30,000 fire departments in the country, yet according to the National Fire Sprinkler Association, only 7 states and 34 local jurisdictions have sprinkler requirements that affect existing buildings. These ordinances have exclusions, applying to only specific occupancies. Most of them exclude residential occupancies, the occupancy where most fire deaths occur. The Federal government chose to lead by example without imposing requirements on the states and local communities. Throughout hearings on the Act, many groups testified that sprinklers were not the only system component necessary for fire safety in buildings. In addition, Congress did not want the legislation to inhibit the development of new technology. They recognized the need to have legislation that proactively addressed protection of life from fire. Therefore, the law does not simply mandate the installation of sprinklers. Congress specified certain life safety objectives to be achieved by the sprinkler systems. In addition, an equivalency clause was provided to allow for the use of alternatives which satisfied the identified life safety objectives. III. Development of an Equivalent Level of Safety Concept A. General Issues The General Services Administration, in cooperation with the United States Fire Administration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Department of Defense, is required to issue regulations further defining the term equivalent level of safety. In developing the regulations, GSA has held meetings with a working group composed of representatives from the agencies named in the legislation and other affected Federal agencies. The Department of Veterans Affairs, the Social Security Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the U.S. Coast Guard were invited to participate because the Act's potential impact on their office space or housing.
