His announcement that, following a successful election, the Federal Government would eliminate significant portions of the trade tax in 1996 left a bad taste in the Chancellor's mouth. All discussions concerning taxes, thus Helmut Kohl directed, regardless whether they dealt with increases or decreases, were "taboo for the time being." Not until June may Finance Minister Theo Waigel announce the basic features of the future taxation policy of the black-yellow coalition. The chancellor's injunction comes too late. The debate on taxes is already in full swing--and it is as chaotic as it ever was. Rhineland-Palatinate Economics Minister Rainer Bruederle, for instance, who has aspirations to a higher office, is demanding that the corporate tax reform take place in 1995 already. His party boss, Klaus Kinkel, on the other hand, considers the room for maneuver for short-term tax decreases to be "extremely limited." For his part, Wolfgang Schaeuble, the leader of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] caucus in the Bundestag, again has his sights set on persons with higher incomes. Helmut Kohl's right-hand man sees further room for movement in the assets and estate taxes (see WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE 17/1994). The confused discussion concerning the future tax policy of the coalition does not bode well for the postelection period. The six leading economic research institutes have figured out in the their spring report that the Federal Government, the laender, the municipalities, and the Trust Agency, will incur debts this year to the tune of 200 billion German marks [DM], more than 6 percent of the total German GNP. Only if the economy grows at a faster rate in the coming years than expected will Waigel reach his goal of lowering the new indebtedness of the Federal Government to under DM40 billion by 1997. In the meantime, he and his colleagues in the laender and municipalities will once again reach deeply into the pockets of the taxpayers. In 1995, that much is already certain today, the tax burden will rise to the record level of 45 percent. It is not even clear if the already passed 7.5-percent solidarity tax will suffice to bring the horrendous deficits back to a tolerable level. The number of unemployed in Germany as a whole, the finance policy spokesman of the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] caucus, Hansgeorg Hauser, conjectures, has to drop well "below 3 million." Hauser: "If not, things are going to get tight." Against this background, it is small solace that the Social Democrats, as well, have little to offer. How Oskar Lafontaine, the candidate for finance minister in Rudolf Scharping's shadow cabinet, plans to plug up the gaps in the revenue receipts remains his secret for the time being. Scharping and his men must, after all, also come up with an answer to the question as to how they envision the future taxation system after the elections. For it is then that the Germans will be facing a revolution in the tax law. By 1996, the Federal Constitutional Court has decided, the government, be it black-red, social-liberal, or red-green, must exempt from taxation the minimum subsistence level of circa DM11,555 for single persons and DM23,111 for married persons. The costs of this measure: circa DM40 billion. And because the justices in Karlsruhe have gotten so nicely warmed up [are on a roll], the supreme German body of justice will probably topple another pillar of taxation by the end of the year: The specification in effect to date of the so-called standard values used for determining the worth of private and corporate assets, real estate, and single-family homes. Because the standard values for tax purposes comprise only between 10 and 21 percent of the actual sales values, jurists consider this method of calculation unconstitutional. The wealth-based taxes collected are of five different types: --Property taxes (revenues collected in 1993: DM10.8 billion); --Trade taxes (revenues collected: DM41.4 billion); --Assets taxes (revenues collected in 1993: DM6.8 billion); --Estate and gift taxes (revenues collected in 1993: DM3.1 billion). For property taxes alone, there is a gap of approximately DM65 billion between the actual and the tax value. Quite a shock to property owners: The owner of a single-family house worth circa DM500,000 would, instead of DM700, suddenly have to pay DM5,400 per year in property taxes. There is material enough here for a fundamental reform of the German tax law, which has meanwhile become arcane. But precisely now, at a time when the governing parties in Bonn are presented with an opportunity to thin out the jungle, they "fail to display an all-in-all convincing concept," as the fiscal researchers of the Rhenish-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research (RWI) note with polite restraint in their latest study. To be sure, representatives of the Christian-liberal coalition, such as Schaeuble, Waigel, and Kinkel, never grow tired of emphasizing that "tax increases after the elections are out of the question." Secretly, however, they have long since had their eye on surcharges on the tax on petroleum products and the value-added tax. Waigel wants to plug the DM8 billion fiscal hole with revenues coming from a reform of the railroad system. Schaeuble is looking for ways to finance the tax exemption of the minimum subsistence level. When there is an emergency, the politicians will grasp at any straw to save themselves. The warning of the German Bundesbank in its latest report, namely that the "further increasing tax burden" is becoming "the critical factor with respect to the operating location conditions for the German economy," is being ignored in the same way as the admonition by the six economic institutes in their latest spring [1994] report to gradually decrease the solidarity tax from 1996 on. Germany, the institutes demand, must drastically scale back its high taxation rates. As recently as 1990, according to an RWI study, the FRG, with a tax "bite" of 37 percent, occupied the "middle ground" among the OECD countries. Three years later, the picture has changed completely. While the United States and Japan take an average of only about 30 percent of incomes from their citizens, the FRG has now reached the same level as the traditionally high-taxation countries Netherlands, Sweden, and Norway. Instead of submitting a convincing plan for bringing the tax burden of 45 percent, which is unprecedented in the history of the FRG, back to a normal level, the coalition is tinkering around aimlessly with individual measures. For example: Income taxes. Since no one among the Christian Democrats and liberals knows where the DM40 billion are to come from that the Constitutional Court's minimum subsistence level resolution costs, Waigel's civil servants are resorting to deceptive packaging tactics. And so, for example, the finance minister wants to grant the tax exemption up to the minimum subsistence level only to the lower income groups. This, officials in his ministry have figured out, would result in a loss to the public coffers of "only" DM4 billion. Whether or not this is constitutional is questionable. If the finance minister establishes income limits for the granting of the tax-free minimum subsistence level, tax expert Professor Joachim Lang of Cologne fears, he will be violating the "uniformity of taxation" prescribed by the Basic Law. There would then be variable tax rate progressions, depending on the levels of income. However, Waigel's solution is controversial not only in a juristic but also in an economic sense. If the tax-free minimum subsistence income benefited only the lower income groups, hefty fault-lines in the tax rate structure would result--with a tax rate limit of more than 100 percent. Already now, Waigel has crafted a special taxation rate for recipients of incomes up to DM11,555 per year which leads to dubious results. To be sure, as the decision of the Constitutional Court prescribes for the transition period up to 1996, persons with low incomes do, in fact, not have to pay any taxes. At the same time, however, the tax offices, in calculating the amount of these persons' taxes, no longer use the taxable income as the basis, as in the past, but the total earnings, which closely follow the criteria used for making welfare payments. The fatal consequence: Whoever earns more will be taxed in accordance with the traditional tax tables--with the result that by going above this limit he has less in his pocket after taxes than before. "Very annoying," says CDU/CSU spokesman for fiscal matters, Hansgeorg Hauser. Now the price is being paid for the fact that the Kohl government did not raise taxes during the time of the unification boom. Then it would have been able, following the elections, to couple the tax computation reform that is being demanded with a general tax decrease. But the opportunity was missed. Kohl's tax policy experts are faced with the dilemma of either tightening the progression again or collecting the missing revenues elsewhere. Therefore, regardless who governs after the 16th of October, the Germans will have to prepare themselves for new tax hikes. Already firmly planned by the current coalition--all denials notwithstanding--are higher taxes on petroleum products and a higher value-added tax. "If we are to reduce income taxes perceptibly," says Hermann Rind (FDP [Free Democratic Party]), the chairman of the finance committee in the Bundestag, in defense of tax plans to that end, "we must speak openly about such reflections." Lower taxes on earned incomes and investments, higher taxes on consumption--that would indeed strengthen the much invoked growth forces of the economy. But currently it does not look as if that will happen. It may well be that, with the tills empty, the tax burden on incomes will decline hardly at all, but the treasury will help itself generously to increased taxes on gasoline and a higher value-added tax. How little the finance policy experts concerned themselves with economic interrelationships in the process is illustrated by the discussion of the assets tax. It is the unanimous opinion of almost all economists that this tax is completely superfluous, one which burdens economic savings in no less than three different ways by taking away from corporate assets, stock holdings, and incomes from property. For this reason, thus the pronouncements by economic policy experts of the coalition all over the country, this tax must be done away with as soon as possible. In actuality, the Christian Democrats and the liberals raised the tax allowances and doubled the rates only just last year. And Schaeuble does not want to rule out further increases. The Social Democrats, on the other hand, are pinning their hopes entirely on growth. Their supposed miracle drug: An employment pact between the state, the collective bargaining partners, and the Bundesbank. In the event of an SPD victory in the election, the labor unions are then to content themselves with moderate wage increases. In return, Lafontaine plans to lighten the tax burden of employees and investing enterprises, and the Bundesbank is to reward the restraint shown by the collective bargaining partners with low interest rates. If the economy grows strongly in the way that it has in the United States, thus the hope of the opposition party, the fiscal problems will automatically lose some of their acuteness. If the complicated SPD calculation does not work out, the Social Democrats must either go back to the long-standing tactic of tightening the tax screws again, or the public finances will go out of control. Events of the most recent past have shown, however, that the Bundesbank is allergic to growing budget deficits. And that will not change for the foreseeable future. In the persons of Hans Tietmeyer and Johann Gaddum, the monetary institute in Frankfurt is headed by no less than two CDU politicians.
