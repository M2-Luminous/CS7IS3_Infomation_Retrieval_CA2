Mitterrand said this in answer to a question from ITAR-TASS upon the conclusion of his two-day state visit to Turkmenistan. Mitterrand noted that he had participated in the war and in the events of 50 years ago. "In a certain sense those events inspired us to form a structure which we now describe as the European Union. Countries that were at war twice within one century have arrived at the conclusion that they should base their future on accord and durable union, even if with former adversaries. The creators of post-war Europe scored success." Mitterrand noted that he now tries to continue their undertaking. In the past, the balance of forces in the world was based on the existence of two opposing blocs, Mitterrand noted. The cold war that was in progress could have turned into a full-scale war any time. After the Soviet Union's dissolution, the military bloc opposing NATO disintegrated too. Many countries that were in that bloc and some former Union republics turned out to be "unprotected" to a certain degree. Europe is not a large continent and it is inhabited by many peoples. World history of many centuries is full of the clashes of their interests. What can be a guarantee against this in future? New states try to achieve real independence and ensure their security. "There exists the CSCE mechanism," Mitterrand said. "It expands beyond Europe and is based on a good idea. Remarkable documents have been signed. Still this is a cumbersome, intricate organisation with slow decision-making. Hence, it does not offer enough opportunities to avert new wars, cannot take multistage measures to prevent conflicts," Mitterrand said. The French president believes "CSCE is not flexible enough and not prompt enough in decision-making as this process requires a consensus. But can there be accord between countries that are ready to fight one another? The conflict in former Yugoslavia shows that such an accord is impossible." "This is why the French Government, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, in coordination with the president proposed a draft treaty described as a pact of stability. Its purpose is to avert possible conflicts. The pact must be open to all European countries and must become a pact of universal security under which no one will have advantages. The head of the French Government assessed the initiative of Paris as one of the most important intitiatives in security area in the past five years.
