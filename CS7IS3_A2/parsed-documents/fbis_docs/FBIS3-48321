At this meeting, pro-reform members and those advocating taking a cautious stance on the political reform bills engaged in heated debate for over three hours. Sozaburo Jimi, one of those taking a cautious stance, said since a joint meeting of both houses is a very exceptional case, matters cannot be left in the hands of the party executives. Toshikatsu Matsuoka, another member taking a cautious stance, said a joint committee of both houses is a form of closed meeting where the public is shut out, and, therefore, it should not be accepted so simply. On the other hand, Senpachi Oishi, a pro-reformist, said the currently-proposed bills are not perfect, but they must be enacted for the LDP to regain power. Former Deputy Prime Minister Masaharu Gotoda said efforts have been made to bring the current bills as close to the original LDP-proposed bills as possible, so the party should try to maintain its unity and work out a compromise with the coalition parties. Following the debates, LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said if the political reform bills were to be returned to the lower house for reapproval, the LDP would face the danger of falling apart. He asked for the understanding of party members on the need to agree to convene a joint committee of both houses, provided the coalition parties agree not to return the bills to the lower house for reapproval. The LDP General Council thus agreed to a plan to work out a compromise with the coalition parties. On convening a joint committee of both houses, Sadatoshi Ozato, chairman of LDP Diet Affairs Committee, at a news conference this evening: [Begin Ozato recording] Since a thorough and orderly discussion on the bills is to be conducted at a joint committee of both house of the Diet, I believe we can look forward to it in all sincerity, as I have already mentioned, and hope for its success. [end recording] Former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Gotoda, and other members who seek enactment of the political reform bills during the current Diet session, have also urged LDP President Yohei Kono to try to work out a compromise that would bring the bills as close to the original LDP-proposed bills as possible at the joint committee of both houses. Kono said he would do his best.
