With only 30 working days left until the cut-off date for applications, 250,000 of the 340,000 eligible applicants have failed to lodge the necessary paperwork. Immigration Department assistant director, Chan Ching-bor, said more than 8,000 applications would have to be lodged every day before March 31 if people were to change their travel documents from British Dependent Territories Citizen to BNO passports in time. He said the outstanding applications would far exceed the capacity of staff processing claims for BNO passports. Only 3,500 applications can be processed per day. We would obviously like more staff to process these applications, but we just can't get the approval for funding." Mr Chan urgently appealed for everyone eligible in phase two (those born from 1962 to 1966) to send in their applications. "It is only a two-page form and the best way is to post it to the Immigration Department. I urge everyone to act as quickly as possible on this," he said. Mr Chan was unable to explain the delay in the procedure. "Phase two just seems to have been much slower than phase one." In phase one, 1,500 late applications were received and of the 150 so far processed, all have satisfied the requirements and been confirmed for BNO passports. He said about 10 per cent of eligible applicants would probably not apply for BNO passports for a variety of reasons. "Some may have emigrated, may be living in countries that don't allow dual nationalities, or are people who don't think they will need such a passport after 1997." The phased programme for application is intended to help the 3.5 million British Dependent Territories citizens in Hong Kong to retain British nationality by having a BNO passport valid beyond 1997. The programme aims to enable an orderly flow of applications. Those who fail to apply before the designated deadlines may lose their British nationality unless they have special reasons for their late applications. There have been complaints from people living overseas that they could not register in time because of difficulties in getting the right forms in embassies. Mr Chan said any late application would be assessed on the reasons provided by the applicant as to why it was lodged late.
