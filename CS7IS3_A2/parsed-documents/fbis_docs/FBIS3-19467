However, this talk was "planned" anyway because of the preparations of [German Foreign Minister] Kinkel's official visit to Paris on 24 March, Deputy Spokeswoman Catherine Colonna told DPA. Concerning Bonn's claim that the ambassador had been "summoned," the spokeswoman said: "I would not describe it that way." She could not say, however, whether Sheer's comments to German journalists had led to his being invited to the Ministry "today and not yesterday or tomorrow." She said that Sheer's comments were "informal." The resulting reports that there is "slight distrust" between Bonn and Paris "really do not" reflect "our attitude." The foreign ministers of the two countries "know each other well, often talk on the phone, and cultivate trusting relations." This was shown over the past months during the difficult negotiations on the GATT Agreement, on Bosnia, and on the expansion of the European Union. Relations with Germany are "essential" for France, and "the basis for the stability and prosperity all over Europe." It is important to further deepen these relations, Colonna said.
