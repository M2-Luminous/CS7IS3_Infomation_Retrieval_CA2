Since the problems in Carinthia you have been acting like a spurned lover with a chip on your shoulder and are initiating an anti-EU campaign. [Haider] I do not have a chip on my shoulder. Our strategy has not changed. The term anti-EU campaign was used by the media. We just want to provide information. [Schima] About the disadvantages of membership. And then you tell the people that you do not care how they vote? [Haider] Of course, we care. I am just convinced that my arguments are the better ones and that no recommendation is necessary. [Schima] Will you disrupt the holding of the referendum on 12 June with tricks in the Nationalrat's standing orders or filibustering in Parliament? [Haider] We wanted a date in autumn -- but postponing the referendum by a week is pointless. Therefore, we accept 12 June now. [Schima] Will you also accept the result of the referendum? By pointing to the possibilities of challenging the results because of defects in the text of the treaty you have left yourself a loophole. [Haider] The FPOe will accept it. However, we cannot guarantee that the referendum will not be challenged by citizens who are critical of the EU. [Schima] Your prediction for the referendum? [Haider] A very narrow no. [Schima] A NEWS poll has shown that 52 percent of Austrians think it is right to isolate you. Is it not frustrating in the long run having to haunt the scene as a pariah? [Haider] I can live with isolation quite well. And it is not a shame to be isolated by Mr. Fuhrmann [parliamentary leader of the Social Democratic Party of Austria]. On the contrary: It is better to polarize than to leave everybody indifferent. It would be worse not interesting anyone. [Schima] However, your dream of becoming chancellor in 1998 seems to be over, which is also in the interest of Austrians. According to the polls, only 4 percent want you as chancellor, 43 percent would prefer you to continue in opposition. [Haider] The dream is more alive than ever. The FPOe will remain in opposition for another four years, and in 1998 it will overtake the Austrian People's Party. [passage omitted]
