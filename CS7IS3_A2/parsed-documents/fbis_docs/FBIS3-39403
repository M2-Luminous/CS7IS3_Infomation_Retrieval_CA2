Papoulias stressed: There is much hope that we can avoid the worst in the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, as reports on the withdrawal of heavy weapons from around Sarajevo are hopeful. However, he noted this process is not the exclusive obligation of the Serbs and the Muslims should do the same. Papoulias expressed Greece's fears for the chain reaction a general conflict would have in the Balkans and in Europe, and added that he does not believe air strikes can bring peace. The Greek presidency of the European Union [EU] also is contemplating calling a meeting of the EU Council of Foreign Ministers before the deadline of NATO's ultimatum, the Greek foreign minister said. Responding to a question if Athens will exercise a veto in NATO on the air strikes, he said that Greece is contemplating and will use all available means to avoid a wider conflict. Papoulias also stressed that he discussed the possibility of the war spreading to the south with Milosevic, and underlined that something like this would be a tragic development and the beginning of an armed conflict that would have wider consequences in Europe. Responding to another question, the foreign minister said that the Greeks living in Serbia are safe. They consider it their second homeland and have no need to leave.
