JPRS-CST-94-007, 3 May 94 p 19] [Summary] Beijing, 11 Mar (KEJI RIBAO report) -- Should not China seize the opportunity to formulate policies for yet another ``information revolution''--that of the ``information highways?'' To this end, KEJI RIBAO today convened an Information Highway Expert Symposium; at this forum, the experts unanimously agreed that our nation, faced with a rare opportunity in world history, should quickly take action appropriate to national conditions. These specialists also felt that China, compared to advanced nations--especially the U.S., with its National Information Infrastructure (NII) program--lags behind in economic power, but that China nonetheless should accelerate its strategic in-depth planning and concentrate its attention on this second information revolution that will inevitably foster future economic and social development. Specifically, the experts urged that domestic information resources be disseminated throughout the society, be market-oriented, and incorporate international developments--all in step-by-step, gradually accelerated fashion.
