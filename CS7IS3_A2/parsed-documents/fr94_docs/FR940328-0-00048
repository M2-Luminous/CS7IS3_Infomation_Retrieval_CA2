Meat and poultry are assumed to be responsible for 100% of foodborne parasitic diseases and 50% of foodborne bacterial diseases. 2Estimates rounded. 3Productivity losses are high for survivors who develop mental retardation or blindness as a result of toxoplasmosis. These costs exclude toxoplasmic encephalitis infections in 2,250 to 10,200 AIDS patients annually which are a significant cause of premature death (50% of cases may also have a foodborne origin). 4Costs are estimated at less than $0.1 million, although estimates do not include costs for cysterlcercosis which may have an indirect foodborne transmission.
