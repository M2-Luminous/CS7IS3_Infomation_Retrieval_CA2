What were the reasons for this? [Virsis] We could not manage to find a common language on some principal positions. First, regarding payments, second -- the social security of Russian Army pensioners. I would not say that the situation is tragic or dramatic. To move forward on these issues, both sides must change their instructions and positions. [Ozolins]Is it a question of extending their powers? [Virsis] Either extending them or providing different instructions. It does not concern us so much as it does the Russians; still, the Russians might think quite the opposite. [Ozolins]Does it mean that the Russian delegation is not authorized to agree with the change in the amount of the payment? [Virsis] It is apparent that [Russian chief negotiator] Zotov does not have such power. Naturally the way in which he explains it all -- why he can not, what is the balance of payments, that there is $4.5 billion left over -- this is their interpretation. Everybody has a right to express their opinion, but in this concrete situation, this is not a correct proposal. It is very difficult for us to permit the continued operation of the Skrunda radar station for another four years, and what we are talking about is not rent for the land, but direct usage of this facility. [Ozolins]In an interview with SM-SEGODNIA [as published], Zotov maintains that this agreement is probably more necessary for Latvia than for Russia, and that Russia is actually not interested in signing it any more. Could you comment on this? [Virsis] He did not say this to me. One may say different things when speaking to journalists, and something else when speaking officially. If this is the official position of Russia, then there would really be no point in continuing our talks. [Ozolins]In Zotov's view, much more important is the problem of ensuring the social security of retired military personnel. [Virsis] I think there are no grounds for such a linking of issues -- either Skrunda or military pensioners. Such an attitude on the part of Russia has developed historically. Since the beginning of the negotiations, Russia has consistently maintained these demands for the two agreements -- on social security of military personnel, and social security of war pensioners. At first, they were part of the main agreement. Later, to move forward with the main agreement, they were separated. From this point of view, they are connected with the process of military withdrawal, however they can by no means be connected with Skrunda. [Ozolins]What kind of a compromise would Latvia be inclined to accept concerning the military pensioners? What are Latvia's demands? [Virsis] Regarding military pensioners who have permanent registration and who therefore are living as permanent residents, it is a question of their choice -- whether they wish to become Latvian citizens and, in this case, they will have to go through the respective procedure foreseen by Latvian legislation, or if they wish something else. In the latter case, it will be a matter of Latvian laws concerning the stay of foreigners or stateless persons. The problem of military personnel who were retired later or arranged their stay during the last two years, will be more complicated. [Ozolins]Is the number of these people known? [Virsis] Different numbers are given. The Northwestern Army Group has the most precise information. We can speak about 420 people who have stayed here since 28 January 1992, when Russia took the Soviet Army under its jurisdiction. During this period, 2,800 were demobilized. At the same time, 2,500 officers left Latvia -- but I do not know how many of them were those who were demobilized. If these figures are true, than the above mentioned figure of 420 might be correct. The only question is -- whether the 2,500 people included those who were demobilized after 28 January 1992, because there is a possibility that those who were demobilized earlier could also leave. [Ozolins]Can we say that Russian foreign policy towards the Baltic states has undergone a change, taking into account, for instance, the statements made by Zotov in the beginning of February in IZVESTIYA, in which he expressed a much more aggressive attitude towards the Baltic states, using the opportunity of the incident between Rucs and the generals. [Virsis] In my opinion, the general attitude, since September 1991, though not expressed clearly, arises from the regret that the Baltic states are gone. This attitude has always existed, but it is being more and more stressed, defined, and specified recently, the accents are emphasized more clearly and are becoming more comprehensive for us, as well as for the Russian people and the Western world. [Ozolins]Do you think that these accents could become stronger and turn into a definite policy? [Virsis] It is difficult to predict it, but it is possible that things will develop that way. [Ozolins]Do you find the present interest in the security of the Baltic region shown by the Western countries short- lived? As soon as the agreement is concluded, the interest will die and we shall be left again, eye-to-eye with Russia. [Virsis] It is provided by us in the agreement that regarding Skrunda, first of all, the CSCE will be the institution to oversee its fulfillment. This means control, inspection, sometimes extra inspections if necessary. We should not think that we will be left alone. Of course, it was clear from the beginning that in terms of security guarantees from Western countries, we could expect such guarantees from none of them, regardless of how powerful they are. Besides, the bigger the distance from that country to the one that is seeking guarantees, the more difficult the realization of the guarantees would be. The best example would be Great Britain and Poland in September 1939. There were guarantees, but they could not be fulfilled. Therefore the question now does not concern direct guarantees, but the political "texture" which is being "woven" right now and in which elements of our security are also designed. It is very delicate as yet, but it can be developed further. It may seem paradoxical, but if not for the complicated situation with Skrunda... [Ozolins]There would be less interest in us? [Virsis] These were not my words exactly. Nevertheless, this could be one of reasons why the global powers and NATO -- and not only NATO -- should watch northeastern Europe more intensively. I do not want to single out Latvia, because it also applies to Estonia and Lithuania, as well as to our Scandinavian friends. Therefore, I shall cite Mao, who taught us that some value can be gained even from an unhappy situation. [Ozolins]The supervision of CSCE is very important, but most probably the attitude of the global powers will be crucial. Do you think they will maintain their interest for all four years and eighteen months? [Virsis] I hope very much that their interest will not be the same as it is now. At present, we see them in a very "pressed" situation. Many problems have yet to be resolved. In my opinion, the United States and the EC are interested in our settling the agreement with Russia, because it will allow us to integrate more quickly in Europe. This is really the only normal way to maintain their interest in security issues. One has to remember that the EC is not entirely a political or economic organization. This is simply a very tense and painful period in our relations with Russia. At the same time, the EC has already worked out some conditions of our movement toward integration, but surely they would be more definite and positive if our relations with Russia were regulated by an agreement. (Ozolins]Do foresee a possibility -- at least theoretically -- that we could be accepted to NATO even with the Skrunda radar station? [Virsis] No. Of course this is only my personal view. It may turn out another way. [Ozolins]So at least six years must pass before we will be able to speak seriously about joining this organization? [Virsis] There are also other political institutions for security. First of all, the Western European Union, to which Latvia and other Baltic and East European states belong as members of its consultative forum, but we can become associated members. It is a small but very heavy "brick." It is not NATO, but very near it. [passage omitted] [Ozolins]When could the agreement with Russia be signed? [Virsis] [passage omitted] Speaking about Latvia's attitude, we are not the ones that are in the mood to prolong it. [Ozolins]But this is just what Zotov accuses -- that we are dragging our feet. [Virsis] The interpretations of Mr. Zotov are also meaningful. He is a professional diplomat. I am a professional historian. I am fixing dates and facts, he interprets them.
