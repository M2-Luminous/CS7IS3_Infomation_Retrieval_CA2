On Saturday, the organization had sent a letter to National Defense Secretary General Antonio Riviello Bazan and 31st Military Garrison Commander Gaston Melchaca, informing them of the intention to make the visit based on Articles 6 and 11 of the Constitution. [Begin recording of human rights leader Martin Faz, indentified by caption] If a legitimate and well-grounded impediment exists which would keep us from carrying out this objective, please, let us know as soon as possible at the Plaza Domingo Hotel, telephone 8-19-27. The above statement is based on Article 8 of the Constitution. [end recording] About 16 of the organization's representatives, including five from the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights and other U.S. groups, as well as an Indian representative from that country, left in two station wagons and headed toward the military roadblock located on the road to Rancho Nuevo, followed by a motorcade of 50 cars of reporters. At the roadblock, they were told to return to San Cristobal to meet with CNDH [National Human Rights Committee] Chairman Jorge Madrazo. The press was advised to meet with Eloy Cantu Segovia, a senior official of the Government Secretariat. These officials would inform them of those places to which they are allowed access. In view of this situation, and because they were unable to locate Madrazo, the nongovernment groups left in the afternoon toward the roadblock on the Tenejapa road. On the way there, one of the vehicles ran over an Indian, but fortunately without major consequences. There are combat vehicles in midtown San San Cristobal de las Casas, which are reinforcing military surveillance. Cantu Segovia and Madrazo issued no statement on Sunday afternoon. It is worth mentioning that the area's military roadblocks do not merely consist of tangible objects.
