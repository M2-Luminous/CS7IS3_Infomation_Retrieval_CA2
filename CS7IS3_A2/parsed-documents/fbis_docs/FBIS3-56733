According to a reliable source, no documents shaping out a new cabinet have been signed yet. Conflicting media reports on Boris Fedorov's stance were clarified to some extent by Valentin Sergeyev, chief of the governmental press service. He quoted Fedorov as telling him by telephone at 15:30 today that he has "not formally asked to resign as a vice-premier". But he has "not accepted the prime-minister's offer to hold the post of finance minister in the reformed cabinet", Fedorov was quoted as saying.
