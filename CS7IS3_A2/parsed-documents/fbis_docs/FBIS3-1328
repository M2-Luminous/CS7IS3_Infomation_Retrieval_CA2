The 22-week course was completed in record time so the officers could be in South Africa in time for the April elections, the ZIANA news agency reported on Thursday [24 March]. The initial four-week phase equipped army officers with the knowledge and skills necessary for planning and supervising live firing. The second phase, of five weeks, equipped them with basic knowledge of conventional warfare and the employment of platoon weapons and other support arms within a company setting. They were also provided with practical experience in the handling of a platoon in the field. A third phase covered aspects of counter-insurgency and military law. Reviewing officer Maj-Gen Philip Sibanda said Wednesday's graduation ceremony was a milestone in the history of the African sub-continent because the Zimbabwean Army had trained officers from the African National Congress and Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] simultaneously. The officers and others who were being trained elsewhere in Zimbabwe would form the nucleus of South Africa's post-apartheid defence force. The officers are due to return to South Africa on Saturday.
