"The Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Certain Issues Relating to the Building of a Socialist Market Economy," unveiled a year ago, has been described by the press in a variety of bold and lofty terms: "a grand design," "a call to arms." While the man on the street felt inspired by these necessary comments, economists adept at independent thinking, having understood the content and implications of the "Decision," have begun to foresee the grim challenges facing China as it works to implement the document. Henceforth, as someone said, China has entered an era when "reform is an utterly mental exercise." Nineteen ninety-four happens to be the first year of rational reform. Rationality--The Soul of the Market Economy "Speed up reform, speed up development," so says the "Decision." It is clear what "speed up development" means both theoretically and practically. That "development is the way to go" is now deeply etched in the public psychology. But what about "speed up reform?" We must realize that reform in China has always been a gradual process, moving from the countryside to cities, from special economic zones and the coast to the interior, from the establishment of individual enterprises, township and town enterprises, and foreign-funded enterprises to the transformation of the mechanism of state enterprises, and from the price decontrol of some commodities to the abolition of command planning. In the 15 years since reform began, there have been ups and downs, twists and turns, but the upshot is a miracle that has caught the attention of the world, fueled the spectacular growth of the economy--and, by spawning a host of problems that are as distressing as they are stubborn, exacted a steep price. At the numerous seminars and conferences held in Beijing in the past half year, economists have enumerated, from a variety of perspectives, the costs of the current reform with its dual-track system: Cost 1: The boom-and-bust economic cycle. When controls are tightened, life is snuffed out of the economy. When things are eased up, there is chaos. Cost 2: The loss of state properties. Rising corruption. Cost 3: Urban-rural gap widens. Inequitable distribution. Cost 4: Financial disorder. The "bubble effect." Look more closely, and you can find the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and even twentieth costs. An article, perhaps even a tome, can be written on each one of them. There is probably not a single economist who believes reform comes without a price tag. There is probably nobody who fantasizes writing a cure-all prescription. We hope that in the future reform does not come with a price. Nevertheless, anybody remotely familiar with the theory and practice of the modern market economy knows that economic life characterized by arbitrariness, corruption, and disorder is not inherent in the market itself but is exactly the opposite. It is a sheer misunderstanding to think that a market economy is inevitably a filthy thing, "every pore oozing with blood from head to toe." The reason is that at the heart of the modern market economy is rationality, including the rational activities of microeconomic organizations and the rationalization and rationality of the social macro control mechanism and the legal framework. However, far removed the dual economic structure may be from the old order, if it fails to complete the transition to the market system based on the principle of rationality, at best it becomes an embryonic but distorted version of a market economy. This is precisely why those clear-headed economists earnestly hope and strongly call for reform to be accelerated and deepened across the board even as they praise the achievements of past reform without reservation. Some sharp words have been uttered. Dr. Du Runsheng [2629 3387 3932], the 80-year-old president of the China Land Institute, for instance, told reporters as early as last summer that we must start thinking about merging the two tracks of the dual-track system right now. Not that we do not need the dual-track system; in fact, it is essential. But there are two sides to everything in the world, even good things. Today we must accelerate the transition from the dual-track system to a market economy conscientiously and purposefully in accordance with a plan. Any more flip-flops and the masses will have little confidence in reform. Then, there is Fan Hengshan [5400 1854 1472], who has a doctorate in economics and works in the State Restructuring of the Economic System Commission. Not long ago he spoke to this reporter with the bluntness and intelligence of youth. "The negative effects of the conflicts and loopholes of the dual-track system have now outweighed the positive results of reform. We have reached the `uppermost limit' of tolerable reform costs. Whether or not we can swiftly go beyond the `uppermost limit' has become a choice which we must make without delay and which will decide the success or failure of reform." The "Decision" adopted by the 3d Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee and its appendices make up a lengthy document. In summing up the overall reform mission called for by the "Decision," economists use a variety of terms: "dual-track coexistence," "all-round coordinated reform," "reform of key areas," and "the macro policy environment necessary for the creation of a market economy." Perhaps more than the stirring eulogistic language -- "the great bridge," "blueprint," "call to arms"--used by the press, it is these honest down-to-earth characterizations by the economists which can better help us understand the nature of the "Decision" and the arduousness of the reform facing us. The call to "speed up reform" was made with the mission in mind. Not for a moment can one interpret it as an ordinary exhortation. Well, then, should the new round of reform be the "storming of a fortified position" or incremental reform? Some people look at it this way: Reform today still depends on a stable social environment. Thus the strategy of moving incrementally in general but going for breakthroughs at specific points should be continued. At the present stage, however, with its basic characteristic of "storming fortified positions," an over-emphasis on incrementalism and stability may cause us to miss opportunities and artificially lengthen the transitional period, ultimately making reform more risky and costly. We must zero in on the key links and grasp the favorable opportunity to achieve a breakthrough. Read the "Decision" more carefully and you will come across this line: "Push ahead on all fronts and go for breakthroughs where they really matter." Now we know. Over-Heating or Over-Anxious? It was a drizzly evening soon after the closing of the plenary session of the CPC Central Committee. Inside the professors' building, which is part of the faculty and staff quarters on the campus of Beijing Normal University, Professor Wu Jinglian [0702 2417 8834] was at his desk revising the commentary he had written for ZHONGHUA GONGSHANG SHIBAO. The title: "Take the First Step and Do It Right." Wu Jinglian, currently a researcher with the State Council's Development Studies Center, had just returned from South Korea four days earlier. As soon as he arrived back in Beijing, he telephoned Ding Wang [0002 2598], editor-in-chief of ZHONGHUA GONGSHANG SHIBAO. Even when he was on the road, this economist, who cares for the nation and the people, was thinking how to take the critical first step after the "Decision" was unveiled. The first thing that came to his mind was the economic climate. As he saw it, to ensure that reform measures already decided upon are implemented as planned, the foremost task is to continue to create a favorable economic climate and keep it that way, preventing the economy from overheating and inflation from coming back. Otherwise, the new reform may be derailed as soon as it is introduced and in the end we may, to our eternal regret, miss a splendid opportunity to push ahead with reform. These views were shared by a number of other economists. Not long ago interested experts from the Chinese Academy of Science and the State Statistical Bureau jointly conducted a study to analyze the economic situation and make projections. According to that study, the "soft-landing" of the economy in 1994 following the tightening of macroeconomic regulation and control in the summer of 1993 may produce any one of several possible outcomes: Outcome 1: The various regulatory and control measures are applied with the right degree of intensity and are coordinated from top to bottom, bringing the overheated economy under control. Inflation begins heading downward and the economic growth rate drops to 10 percent or so. Even in times of economic retrenchment, banking reform, fiscal reform, and tax reform are intensified, nudging state enterprises to enter the market. After a smooth transition, the economy enters a prolonged period of steady growth. Outcome 2: Macroeconomic regulation and control goes a little too far. Excessive retrenchment decelerates the economy a tad too much, forcing the economy to "hard land." Although the scale of investment and price increases are reined in, we fail to shift the focus of regulation and control to adjusting the optimizing the structure. In the end, economic development suffers. Not only that, but the seeds of a new round of "overheating" have been sown. Outcome 3: To avoid the disruptions of structural adjustment and yielding to pressure brought on by the string of problems resulting from decelerated economic growth, economic reform is stalled out. There is a lack of firm resolve in the face of a chorus of complaints from localities and enterprises. To stimulate an economic recovery, the government hastily adopts a liberal monetary policy, loosens its grip on the scale of investment, and boosts the money supply. The result is a premature expansion of the economy and the resumption of inflation, forcing the policymakers to readjust again by putting on the brakes. In their analysis the experts said that currently Outcome 1 is the desired outcome, Outcome 2 will not materialize in the near future, and we need to be on guard against a premature rebound of the economy, which is the last outcome. Wu Jinglian also said, "The rate of economic growth is merely the synergistic result of a variety of factors working together, such as institutions and policies that constrain economic growth, and not the cause of changes in economic development. In China, where idle resources available for retrospective investment are scarce, the rate of economic growth is directly proportional to the real gain in productivity. To avoid economic overheating, we should not use the economic growth rate as the central indicator to guide our work." Wishes and expectations, however, are no substitute for reality. Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan [1728 0587 0337], director of the Finance and Trade Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences [CASS], said after taking a sober look at the state of the economy, "If the present trends are any indicator, there is little hope that Outcome One in the above analysis can be realized in 1994. The likelihood of Outcome 2 materializing is also slim. In contrast, there is a good chance we may end up with Outcome 3: the economy taking off again without landing, finally leading to a hard-landing." He added, "The most likely scenario is a cross between outcomes 1 and 3. If it turns out to bear a closer resemblance to 1 than 3, we should consider ourselves lucky." Thus it is unlikely the new round of reform will be smooth sailing. Needless to say, some economists reject the "overheating" scenario. At Changchunyuan on the campus of Beijing University that same drizzly early-winter evening, Xiao Zhuoji [5618 3504 1015], a well-known economics professor, told this reporter unequivocally, "The fact of the matter is that we need not worry that the Chinese economy will overheat." Professor Xiao Zhuoji argued that economic development in China is cyclical, with each cycle lasting seven years. For three and one-half years, we have robust growth, followed by another three years and a half of adjustment. During the period of strong growth, the economy surges ahead at the rate of 13 to 14 percent, which is both inevitable and normal. When we analyze inflation, we need to look at the causes behind it. Inflation in China after 1993 has something to do with the lifting of price controls and the increase in the business tax, not the over-expansion of the money supply. Therefore, Xiao Zhuoji said, we should not exaggerate its danger. Xiao Zhuoji also produced some data showing that real household incomes outpaced inflation in the first half of 1993, when urban and rural household incomes still rose 12 percent and 4 percent, respectively, after adjusting for inflation. With income rising faster than inflation, the fear of some experts that "households may have unrealistic expectations" is quite redundant. What then would be an appropriate rate of economic growth in 1994? In Professor Xiao Zhuoji's opinion, not lower than 10 percent. Professor Xiao Zhuoji's opinion has quite a large following. His supporters say, "Don't worry about slow growth. The worst thing is standing still. The Chinese economy used to follow a stop-go pattern. To date it is galloping along, and that is normal. Moreover, the very concept of `overheating' is less than clear." In any case, it is both good and normal for reform-minded economists in China to disagree among themselves and debate with one another. All of them rightly wish to push ahead with the enterprise of economic reform in China. In the end, their arguments also will be tested in practice. Who Will "Weaken" Reform? Economists consider "overheating" in terms of its effects on the external environment for the next round of reform. But there is another concern, namely that reform would be "weakened" by purely internal human factors. Reform measures must be put into effect by human beings. The reform measures newly introduced by the CPC Central Committee directly involve a number of departments in charge of administration and management, the very same departments most deeply rooted in the old order. To ask these people to bid farewell to tradition and take the initiative to advance the re-invention of the economic system as well as the overhaul of the functions of their units is no different from asking them to take up the scalpel to operate on themselves. How can we ensure that they will make the first cut? Fang Fenglei [2455 7364 7191], a young economist who is deputy director of the Investment and Market Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Management Science and currently managing director of the Hainan Sanya Yinjian Company, recently convened and presided over an international conference in Shenzhen on banking reform. He summed up the upcoming macroeconomic reform in one sentence, "The difficulty lies in maintaining intensity and momentum." Fang Fenglei said, "It must be admitted that reform has fallen behind badly in such key areas as banking, foreign exchange, finance, taxation, and foreign trade. The inertia of traditional forces is exceptionally powerful. How can we be sure that people who operated in accordance with standard procedures under the traditional system will now take the initiative to spearhead reform in their own units energetically? If the new reform is stalled out even before it is launched because of some human factors, the impact on the creation of a market economy as a whole would be enormous." He agreed that we should certainly think strategically and phase in new reform measures gradually in stages. Be that as it may, the stress should be on the need to firmly implement the CPC Central Committee's "Decision" and prevent the departments involved from using all sorts of excuses to undermine the leadership's resolve in the course of implementation, thereby weakening the new reform and precluding the realization of the reform demands already put forward. Alternatively they may keep dragging their feet in launching the new reform plan. In the end, the latter may never see the light of day. Of course, the danger of weakening reform comes not only from conservative-minded operatives but also from vested interests who have benefited enormously and tangibly from exploiting the loopholes of the dual-track system in the past decade and more of incremental reform. This is something the experts all agreed on. Just open any newspaper or glance at the television and you can get an idea. Since when has white-collar crime in China meant cases involving millions, even tens of millions, of yuan? Since when have white-collar criminals in China been moving in and out of the country? Since when has white-collar crime spread all over the land, from north to south, from east to west, from Beijing to every province? It is impossible to uproot human greed, but what sort of external environment has given it such a hospitable breeding ground? Apart from those criminals who have committed the most flagrant crimes and been punished in accordance with the law, how many others have so far escaped the long arm of the law? Some of the data are shocking: -- In 1987 alone, the price differential of all controlled commodities amounted to more than 130 billion yuan, the interest-on-funds differential totaled about 20 billion yuan, and the foreign exchange price differential amounted to 50 billion yuan, for a combined price differential society-wide of more than 200 billion yuan. Since price differentials are on this mammoth a scale and there are so many institutional loopholes, the exploiters reaped a windfall of a whopping 10 billion yuan even if they pocketed only 5 percent of the differential income. -- Investment loans totalled 2,200 billion yuan or so in 1992. Because interest rates were so low and the demand for funds was so strong, private kickbacks accounted for 10 percent of that sum at least. Here alone we are looking at 220 billion yuan in hidden bribes. This is only the tip of the iceberg of economic opportunities available to the vested interests. Those who break the law are in the minority, but it is totally conceivable that all over China there are countless people who have made a fortune legally or not illegally by taking advantage of a policy or a law, who started out with quite modest expectations but ended up making a killing anyway because the distorted market "favored" them, who got caught up in the real estate speculation fever or stock market fever and who always hope to reap a bonanza from the current dual-track system even thought they have not done so yet... Referring to this situation, Lin Yifu [2651 3015 1133], a Taiwanese who holds a Ph.D. in economics and has come to China from the University of Chicago, made the following comment: "Reform no doubt entails the reshuffle of the old pattern of vested interests. But because a new environment of competition has not come into being even as the old interest structure is being reformed and shaken up, and because not every individual or interest group has been put on a level playing field even as new profit-making opportunities are being created, public expectations of reform have been skewed. Some people expect too much, and if their expectations are not met completely, they become skeptical and hesitant about reform. Other social groups who don't expect good things from reform may boycott a particular piece of reform. People in both groups may be tempted to think and act opportunistically and make a killing, rendering reform more difficult and risky." The fact of the matter is that the new vested interests created in recent years are definitely not limited to a particular trade, profession, or unit. Nor do they form any clear-cut interest group. Also, not every person who forms part of the vested interests joins the forces consciously opposed to the continuation of reform. However, it is a fact that vested interests are present from top to bottom, from the coast to the interior, to varying extents and in different forms. It is also a fact that vested interests not only exist in industry, commerce, and the agencies in charge of the economy, but have also spread to other government departments, to judicial and political circles, to the world of letters, to the cultural and theoretical circles, and to the media. In his analysis of this situation, Wu Jinglian said that by providing spectacular opportunities for people who abuse their office for private gain or who take advantage of a malformed market to reap staggering profits, the prolonged existence of the dual-track system has enabled corrosive vested interests to grow. The vested interests and their representatives, therefore, are not categorically opposed to reform, much less calling for a return to the old beaten path of the planned economy. On the other hand, pleased as they are with the dual-track system, they argue against abolishing administrative intervention and call on us to go slow with market regularization. Since reform revolves around the creation of a market system for fair competition, these people instinctively take unkindly to and oppose such reform. This is precisely why, Professor Wu Jinglian reminds us, that the vested interests, which are extremely powerful, may work to distort the new round of reform while holding high the banner of reform so as to create new opportunities to "trade power for money," "engage in insider trading," and "play money games." As a result, reform may become warped and distorted, in the end departing from the right course. As a matter of fact, similar things have happened many times in the course of reform in the past several years. In an analysis a year ago of the current situation in China, Ji Si Dao, chief Beijing correspondent for the NEW YORK TIMES, wrote, "Although things are going well now, it is hard to tell whether in the future China will become a dragon like Singapore or degenerate into yet another Latin American amoeba." Look at the world around us and we can see that after World War II a number of developing nations have fallen into the so-called "Malthus trap" and exhibit the "Latin American phenomenon." In those countries, an embryonic market economy combined with administrative intervention and bureaucratic privilege to give rise to a bureaucratic elite composed of the rich and the powerful who owe their wealth to "rent-seeking activities." The market economy was never developed fully and in the end the economy suffered a disastrous decline. Reportedly a Beijing doctor normally with no interest in politics blurted out this biting epigram when faced with bureaucrats who spout fine-sounding slogans but in reality pervert justice for a bribe, "I see what you mean by socialist market economy. People who used to have power now have money as well... that is `socialist market economy.'" As long as a theory remains empirically unverified, we can only make logical inferences. The socialist market economy will finally prove that this and other bitter sarcasms from the masses will not become a harsh reality. So far we can still congratulate ourselves on not missing the chance to effect the transition from the old system to the new system smoothly. There is no reason to believe that resistance by the vested interests can really block our march toward a market economy. But think more carefully. The inertia bred by 15 years of incremental reform is humongous. So there is indeed a possibility that the new round of reform may be weakened so much by human factors that it becomes deformed or stillborn. Come to think of it, clearly it is not because they have an identical power of visualization that almost all economists invariably refer to the coming round of reform as a "battle to storm a heavily fortified position." As we take the first step of reform in 1994, we should really interpret "storming a heavily fortified position" accurately as a scientific expression and not an example of poetic hyperbole. That way we will be more determined and firm in our resolve, summoning up even greater intelligence and courage to face up to the new reform tasks. Exploring Ideological Liberation, I: State Ownership After the "Decision" was made public, I talked to many scholars, experts, party and government cadres, and entrepreneurs. Their consensus: "It seems that the difficulties of implementing the `Decision' cannot be underestimated." Dr. Fan Hengshan, in particular, hit the nail on the head when he said "I think the main problem ahead is not that we don't have a well-defined reform philosophy, but that our thinking is not liberated." Ideological liberation is an old topic. Reformers harp back on it in the face of new reform tasks because they realize full well that the forces of traditional thinking cast a long shadow on the road to reform. Economists link the proposal of ideological liberation not only to the overall goal of reform as stated in the "Decision," which is to create and perfect a market economy, but also directly to other more specific major issues, which are of fundamental importance. Three matters are particularly worthy of mentioning. One is public ownership, more specifically, the property rights of state enterprises. Some economists ask, "With economic reform having gone this far, what should we concentrate on now so that the new system can take center stage?" Among the many priorities, the foremost is the reform of the state enterprise system. And it is the property rights issue that lies at the heart of the reform of the state enterprise system. At long last the "Decision" adopted by the latest plenary session puts forward a plan for a modern enterprise system and offers an innovative interpretation of the principle of upholding the predominance of public ownership, thus highlighting the issue of modernizing public property rights. However, the fact of the matter is that the dominance of the traditional way of adhering to public ownership remains stubbornly enshrined both on a conceptual level and in practical terms. China still had 13,600 large- and medium-sized state enterprises as of 1992 with a combined output value of 1,350 billion yuan. Two-thirds of these enterprises are losing money, while the remainder is marginally profitable. What are the negative effects of this situation on national economic development and on the overall drive to create a market economy? Fan Hengshan sums up the four characteristics of the existing way of sustaining public ownership: -- Emphasis on form, not content or result. In other words, the only thing that matters is whether or not property rights belong to the state, not whether an enterprise is being operated in a way that preserves the value of public properties and adds to such value. -- We are interested only in the overall size, never mind the actual results. That is, what concerns us is that the state economy accounts for over 51 percent of the overall economy, never mind whether or not it actually plays a guiding and regularizing role in national economic life. -- The emphasis is solely on state properties in the form of goods and materials, not state properties in the form of money. In other words, there is a belief that only state properties in tangible material form are real public properties. -- There is a preoccupation with the static, with preserving what already exists, while little is done to encourage fluidity and value appreciation. The belief is that the only way to prevent state assets from being lost is to leave them alone. He calls this a passive way of maintaining public ownership, the only consequence of which is to reduce existing state assets to an "empty shell" while weakening the ability to increase their volume. In the end, state assets will be lost in large quantities. After 15 years of reform, whither state enterprises? This has become a most thorny issue in the enterprise of reform as a whole. From the contract system of the mid-1980's to the proposal put forward two years ago to transform the operating mechanism of enterprises, state enterprise reformers have experimented in all sorts of ways within the framework of delegating power and sharing profits with enterprises and localities. But they have yet to turn the state enterprises around. At the heart of their predicament is the failure to come to grips with property rights. The time has come, Fan Hengshan says, to clearly define property rights relations and thoroughly overhaul the fuzzy public ownership model in which "everybody is an owner but nobody is responsible." As long as this issue is not resolved, the mission put forward by the "Decision" of creating a modern enterprise system will not be accomplished and the reform of large- and medium-sized state enterprises will only go around in circles. Actually, it is not hard to come up with a coherent set of thinking on resolving the property rights issue. What is hard is liberating our thought, transcending the limits of traditional thought, and proceeding from the general goal of establishing a socialist market economy to understand public ownership and the nature of the property rights of state enterprises correctly. It was the night before the closing of the 3d Plenary of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Yu Guangyuan [0060 0342 6678], the philosopher and economist of the older generation, spent the evening writing a short article at his home in Beijing. He said, "I hope reform will become more radical. Not only deeper, but also faster." He also believed now is the time to make a mighty effort to "wrestle with the reform of ownership structure." Reform of the ownership structure--state enterprise property rights--the modern enterprise system, that is, the company system. If we conceptually shy away from this fundamental issue, how can we even begin to talk about moving forward? Exploring Ideological Liberation, II: From "Overtaking" to Practical There is another issue which is probably just as fundamental: "choosing a development strategy," in the words of some economists. There is a small ordinary-looking building near Xihuangchenggen in Beijing. It is inside this unremarkable building that some economists seclude themselves in inconspicuous spots to study the mundane issues of agriculture. In fact, it is precisely here that a number of brilliant minds are watching China's future economic development model from the perspective of agriculture and examining the theories of development. Bear in mind that there are 1 billion peasants in China and that to this day China remains an agricultural country. These economists understand agriculture and hence China very well. Winter had arrived in Beijing; a cold front lingered in town for several days. Braving the snow and the wind, this reporter went to the small building to interview some of the experts there and ask them to analyze the difficulties that may be encountered after the "Decision" was introduced. It is clear what they think: To implement the "Decision," we need to liberate our thinking as far as development strategy is concerned. Dr. Lin Yifu talked about this in considerable detail. This young economist, who once studied under Theodore Schultz, a Nobel Laureate, at the University of Chicago and is currently a researcher at the rural office of the State Council Development Studies Center, has been involved in development economics research for years. Lin Yifu said, "The `Decision' is a very good document, the most comprehensive since reform began. In its design of the macro policy environment, the `Decision' is consistent with the premises of a market economy. However, if we, in implementing the document, still cling to old habits and ideologically favor the heavy-industry-first development strategy, it may be quite difficult to put the `Decision' into effect." The "Decision," for instance, calls for establishing markets for capital goods, allowing the market to set the prices of funds and raw materials, and decontrolling exchange rates. However, many industries will not make it if the dictates of the market are really followed in making choices. After decades of development, some industries now have existence potential, but a majority still don't. For some industries whose development is considered critical, overly high interest rates would be intolerable. For other industries which need to import equipment from overseas, excessively high exchange rates would also be a big problem. To support these industries, should we continue a coordinated policy of a welfare nature? Hence the need to change our thinking about development strategy. In practical economic work, that means jettisoning the old "overtaking strategy" of emphasizing heavy industry and embark on the road of development that is suited to China's conditions. Only thus can the various reforms proposed in the "Decision" be implemented. What kind of development strategic thinking, then, should China adopt? Lin Yifu's answer: the comparative advantage strategy. The so-called comparative advantage strategy means fully exploiting the comparative economic advantage in product technology and industrial structure at every stage of economic development as a means of generating fast economic growth. There is a perfect fit between the comparative advantage strategy and the macro policy environment described in the "Decision" with its full-fledged market economy. For instance, since China has a huge population but is short on arable land and funds, it should work harder to develop labor-intensive enterprises. Only by making full use of this comparative advantage--cheaper and internationally competitive products--can it accumulate funds fairly and swiftly. When it becomes capital-rich instead of fund-poor, China can then move onto the development of capital-intensive industries. Actually, the post-war economic history of a number of developing countries speaks volumes. The economies of India, the Philippines, and Argentina, have consistently been slow-growth economies. These countries have one thing in common: In hastening to overtake developed nations, they have overlooked their own comparative advantage; their sole preoccupation was to develop a capital-intensive industrial system against a backdrop of fund shortages. The result: more haste, less speed. Although they started out at a lower level than many countries in South and Central America, countries and regions such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and other latecomers like Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia either have taken off economically or are about to do so. These nations too have one thing in common: Following the principle of comparative advantage, they relied on labor-intensive or resource-intensive industries as the engine of economic growth and devoted themselves to developing an export-oriented economy. As a result, they accumulated a wealth of funds, making possible industrial upgrading. One other fact must be made clear: It is those very countries that made "overtaking" their goal with no regard to natural conditions that had no choice but to resort to anti-market policies and management systems. To rely on comparative advantage, which is more pragmatic, we must create a market environment that allows full competition. According to a number of young and middle-aged economists, China did adopt a development strategy that favored the development of heavy industry in the early days of the PRC but rethought its priorities as early as the 1960's, when the strategy of "agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry" was advanced. In the dozen years since reform went under way and the open policy was introduced, even less was ahead about giving heavy industry priority. In those same years, rapid gains were indeed made in agriculture and the textile and light industries. Even now, however, people have not risen above the mentality of "developing heavy industry first" as part of the guiding thought for economic work. This is actually at variance with the overall plan of creating a market economy put forward by the CPC Central Committee in its "Decision." Thus in thinking about the development strategy, we should liberate our thought even further. One other person has talked about using comparative advantage from yet another angle. He is Du Runsheng, who comes from an older generation of economists and is one of China's most authoritative experts on rural issues. I went to interview Du Runsheng just as a debate was raging within the economics community on the relations between reform and development. Asked about this, old Du Runsheng said, "Development and reform... Development is the right thing to do, but sometimes it should give way to reform. Development should slow down a little in some years if necessary." Then he said something very meaningful, "Some things both advance reform and speed up development. Given the situation in China today, we must come to grips with one thing, namely employment." In old Du Runsheng's opinion, China's ample manpower is both a burden and an opportunity. China should redouble its effort to develop enterprises which require little capital but provide lots of jobs, thus creating many employment opportunities. We should solve the problem of money-losing enterprises without delay and shift the resources to the development of enterprises that create many jobs. In the process we also put to use our comparative advantage. The employment issue lies at the very heart of the drive to change and develop Chinese society. While Du Runsheng did not expound on the theory of development strategy, it is clear he was on the same track as Lin Yifu and others. As China is perched on the threshold of a new round of reform, these economists' original but pragmatic thinking should be an inspiration to us all. Exploring Ideological Liberation, III: "Weak Government?" "Strong Government?" Since last fall a young man and his idea have shaken up the economics community and caused a good deal of controversy. The scholar is none other than Dr. Hu Angang [5170 7254 6921], a researcher with the state of the nation analysis group at the Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS]. The idea is that the power of the Chinese Government has been in decline steadily. For over two years Hu Angang and a Chinese scholar in the United States named Wang Shaoguang [3769 4801 342] conducted a quantitative analysis and comparative study in the United States. In a report completed last May on the state of the nation, they argued that because of the diminished ability of the central government in recent years to raise revenue, the Chinese Government has become a "weak government" in name and in fact. These young men came back from the other shore and touched a raw nerve in China: What should be the relationship between the central government and local authorities? For a while the debate was most heated, with arguments and counter-arguments flying back and forth between their supporters and detractors. As the Year of the Rooster neared its end, the "Decision" was published in pamphlet form and found its way onto our desks. This reporter sought out Hu Angang, who just returned from a trip to Australia. His frankness was a little startling. "I believe the major difficulty in reform next year will come from within the party, quite possibly strong opposition from local governments over some issues." He described the "Decision" as immensely significant, a sign that China has now entered a stage where reform revolves around institutional innovation. However, the implementation of the "Decision" is fraught with risk. What is worrisome is the introduction of the tax separation system in 1994 under the "Decision." Under that system, localities would still hold their own as far as revenue is concerned, but the central government would have trouble collecting taxes. These days every province or region thinks in terms of local interests, rarely considering the interests of the state or central government. It is like the social "beilun" in "Boyilun." Here we have what they call a "dilemma" in the English language. The boat can take only 15 people. If there are 30 people all demanding to board it, the ship may well overturn. Thus it is an uphill struggle to put the "Decision" into effect. It is hard to predict what will happen next. In a large country like China, Hu Angang said, the relationship between the central government and local authorities has been a problem since time immemorial. This problem has never been satisfactorily resolved even after the PRC was founded. During the past 44 years, the fiscal system affecting both the center and the localities has been extensively revised 15 times, in addition to several minor adjustments. The relationship has never been institutionally regularized and hence stabilized. Certainly the principle has been to "let the two sides each do what they do best," but there is still a lot of grey area, their respective jurisdictions having never been clearly delineated. Accordingly, the central-local relationship should be written into law explicitly and in detail. Survey the world today and take a look at China itself. In Hu Angang's opinion, what China needs is a strong central government based on the market economy. As he sees it, in the future China should follow neither a system of power sharing between the central and local governments, nor a centralized system, but a mixture of the two which would wed the two principles of unity and pluralism. In this context, unity means there are uniform macroeconomic policies, primarily financial policies and fiscal policies. The central government should be the only player responsible for macroeconomic policy-making; local governments must be mere executors. Social security must be integrated, domestic markets, including the markets for capital goods like funds and manpower, must be unified. Standards of public service must be uniform, as must the tax system. Everything else is pluralistic. In a nutshell, local governments can do anything not prohibited by the central government. The central government shall not exercise powers exclusive to local governments. Local governments have the authority to oppose regulations and orders from the central government which are not consistent with the written constitution. "This is the vertical checks and balances of power," said Hu Angang. Does it therefore follow that it was a mistake for the central government to delegate power to the localities and let them share revenue in the past 15 years of reform and openness? That kind of conclusion is unwarranted, Hu Angang said, noting however that it is a fact that the contract system is no longer viable. He said, "The most important thing about central-local relations is institutionalization and the most ideal form of such institutionalization is the tax separation system. Research shows that the existing financial contract system is un-modern, irregular, and unscientific. Its negative result is the current weak-center-strong-localities situation." He added, "Ultimately reform should take us out of the traditional 'power economy' and 'government economy' framework. If all we do is to divvy up power between the central government and local governments level after level, that will do nothing to end the bloated bureaucracy at the local level performing an endless variety of things and directly intervening in economic life. That is a far cry from the basic requirements of a market economy." China should swiftly introduce a full-fledged tax separation system. That is Hu Angang's proposal. Echoing Hu Angang's support for the tax separation system and his call for an end to the "power economy," a number of economists nevertheless disagree with some of his basic premises. One of them is Wu Mingyu [0702 2494 3842], the well-known economist. At his home on Liulinguan Nanli in Beijing, Wang Mingyu, currently deputy director of the Worldwatch Institute, produced about a dozen charts loaded with data and proceeded to explain his views to me at length. He said, "First of all, China has been highly centralized for decades. During the past dozen years or so, the central government took pains to give additional power to local governments and went out of its way to cultivate their ability to make decisions on their own, with spectacular success. Without local initiative, the achievements of reform and development over the past 10 years and more would not have come about and the brave new economic world with its special economic zones, development zones, and coastal open belt would not have materialized. None of that can be denied. Needless to say, it is absolutely not enough just to shift power onto local governments. Ultimately, we must transfer to enterprises such powers as properly belong to them. Having said that, removing to the localities some of the power that has hitherto been concentrated in the hands of the central government is without doubt a direct achievement of a decade of reform." Furthermore, what do we mean by enhancing national power? National power must not be interpreted to mean only the fiscal power of the central government. What is wrong with "storing wealth among the people?" What is wrong with "storing wealth among the enterprises?" What is wrong with "storing wealth among the localities?" Even before the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese economy grew as much as 6 percent a year, yet if we look at the chart for the 1952-1978 period, the line representing the savings of the masses was virtually flat. By late 1978, their savings amounted to just 21 billion yuan, a mere 20 yuan per capita. These days public savings have been soaring, increasing 50-fold by 1992. In October 1993 personal savings stood at 1,400 billion yuan. This is part of national power. Every form of economic strength is an expression of national power and government revenue represents only a small part of national income. In the past dozen years or so, has China become stronger as a nation? People at home and abroad would all answer in the affirmative. If China's national power has really diminished, as indicated by the research of Dr. Hu Angang and others, how can we explain the exceptional attention Chairman Jiang Zemin received when he visited the United States as invited? Besides, the relationship between the central government and local governments is not exclusively fiscal. It is unscientific to just look at the share of revenue going into the national coffers and call it "weak." In China, the central government is led by the CPC and based on longstanding unified party leadership. Local elections too must be approved by the central government. If some local authorities have too much power, the central government can take it back right away if it wants to. To suggest that there is now a "feudal economy" in China would cause unnecessary jitters. The new round of reform today certainly includes some power adjustment between the central government and local authorities. In Wu Mingyu's analysis, right now we must face up to four major issues: -- Legislation must be drawn up to spell out the division of labor between the center and the localities. -- Both the center and the localities must return power to enterprises, society, and intermediate organizations. Achieving this will be much more difficult than the transfer of power by the central government to the localities in the past 15 years. -- Take pains to encourage local initiative even as steps are taken to augment the regulatory and control abilities of the center as appropriate. -- Party-government relations at the local level should be further adjusted to ensure that policies and orders from Beijing are carried out. While revenue-sharing and the contract system, introduced during the decade of reform, have mobilized local initiative, they have also bred local protectionism in some respects, to the detriment of the formation of a nationwide unified market. The time has now come for the contract system to give way to the tax separation system. This idea is not a major point of contention among the economists. However, in what way should the "tax separation system," put forward in the "Decision," be implemented? Hu Angang wants to see it carried out "thoroughly" and "as soon as possible," but there is also a large number of scholars who advocate a more incremental approach. Wu Mingyu and others, for instance, propose a "win-win" strategy. As they see it, the tax separation system involves central taxes, local taxes, and shared taxes. In the initial period shared taxes must be handled cautiously, taking into consideration the local interests formed during the past 10 years and more. Certainly the status quo must not be maintained. When we talk about the risk of reform in the new year, this is probably what we mean. A most satisfactory solution is to make the pie bigger so that the center can take more as local revenue rises, thus gradually increasing its revenue share. In the final analysis, of course, the goal is to increase the central government's revenue-enhancing ability. When it comes to the relationship between the two poles--the central government and local governments--in the reform of 1994, some scholars are most meticulous thinkers. Besides the tax separation system, they say, other reforms would also disturb local interests. Nowadays, for instance, specialized banks have all become commercialized banks, but they remain essentially branches of banks at higher levels. Should we allow and assist to localities establish local commercial banks, which is what Guangdong has been doing? In the months and years ahead, moreover, the creation of a futures market, the reform of the enterprise shareholding system, and the issue of shares must also be approved. In the absence of standardization, should we also take care to avoid the effects of the old planned economy when we go about selecting a site and allocating quotas? The fact of the matter is that reform is an adjustment of interests. And the new round of reform is precisely the rationalization of interests at a deeper level. In the course of this process, the horizontal and vertical conflicts spawned by the old order for years and years would inevitably manifest themselves as a host of entangled problems. "Horizontally," local protectionism is a cause of concern, while "vertically" traditional inertia, low efficiency, and rigidity are equally worrisome. Even more important, as organs of government, both the center and local governments are faced with the daunting job of transforming their functions in a fundamental way. Failing that, Chinese reform will unavoidably suffer major setbacks, go astray, or beat a retreat to the old path. The scholars disagreed on specific ideas and emphasis and argued among themselves heatedly, but they all said that this is closely related to the deepening of political reform. This is precisely what makes reform today such a herculean task. Ignorance Is Archenemy The last issue I posed to the interviewees was also the simplest: On the eve of the launching of reform in 1994, how many people in China really understand the CPC Central Committee's "Decision?" As expected, the economists' response was to shake their heads and sigh. Many pointed out grimly that studying modern economics has become something of critical urgency to the completion of reform. Just think. Suppose we have liberated ourselves from all traditional ideological shackles. Suppose we are utterly devoted to the new round of reform sincerely and passionately. We still have to wrestle with one basic problem: understand the real implications of all the reform measures. In New York City, any teenager has a thorough understanding of things like credit card, shares, and commodities. Provided he is fairly intelligent and can write reasonably well, an American college graduate majoring in history can be a columnist for the Wall Street Journal effortlessly analyzing the stock market every day. What about China? All our direct experiences with the market are of the most elementary kind. All our education--never mind you went to a college or party school offering a solid education--consisted of political economy that merely described the early phase of capitalism and taught you the socialist planned economy. Even among experts in economics theory, let alone rank-and-file party and government leading cadres, public employees, people in industry and commerce, or the media, how many have really mastered modern economics theories? Ignorance may well turn out to be the worst enemy of the new round of reform in China. This is because what we are about to embark on is no longer elementary reform based on intuition and common sense, but putting up an edifice of an economic system which is complex and elaborate. After four centuries of development, the market economy has become a most complicated, most intricate gigantic machine of resource allocation. Economics too has blossomed into a science with numerous branches. To understand the reform plan in its totality, to create an ideal environment for reform, to implement reform one practical step after another, and to overcome the barriers to reform, we really do need knowledge, basic knowledge pertaining to the theories of the modern market economy. Fang Fenglei, the young scholar, did not mince his words, "China has three kinds of illiterates: people who can't read or write, scientific illiterates, and economic illiterates. Economic illiterates present the biggest problem. A majority of the cadres at all levels, particularly leading cadres, who will actually be in the field carrying out reform, don't know modern economics. This will create considerable difficulties for the implementation of the `Decision.' Today we must popularize the ABC of economics." In the commentary he stayed up late to write for ZHONGHUA GONGSHANG SHIBAO, Wu Jinglian made this appeal: "The time has now come for us to launch a study campaign among the cadres and masses, exhorting them to study the works of Deng Xiaoping and learn about the market economy. The market system, we often say, is the glorious achievement of the human civilization. And the best way to master this glorious achievement in the shortest time possible is through theoretical study. Only by standing on the high plane of modern human civilization, it may be said, can we grasp the spiritual essence of the `Decision' and establish a socialist market economy in China without delay." Related to the problem of widespread ignorance is another regrettable fact: the shortage of experts in modern economics. A number of young scholars pointed out that when it comes to the promotion of cadres in recent years, not enough economists were given key positions. The breakdown of expertise among leading cadres does not meet the requirements of building a modern market economy. Now we should truly put to good use this group of young talented people based on the actual needs of implementing the "Decision." They also cited a suggestion by Gao Xijun [7559 1585 0971], a Taiwanese scholar who is now an economics professor at the University of Wisconsin. There are now 50,000 mainland students studying in the United States, of whom at least 1,000 major in economics, including as many as 100 who have already earned their doctorates. China should do what Taiwan did back then, which was to attract the qualified personnel to come home. They may stay and work or they may be invited to come to China on short-term visit. These people would certainly make themselves very useful. Thus did China's eminent economists think long and hard and talk at length on the eve of the launching of reform 1994. For the past several years these people worked hard to drum up support for reform, directly or indirectly participated in designing the overall economic reform plan, appreciated the real meaning of reform most deeply, and most ardently looked forward to the smooth sailing of reform. Faced with the risks and difficulties of a new round of reform, these people now earnestly point out the challenges that may lie ahead and suggest possible responses. Being clear thinkers, they said solemnly, "There is no romantic song in reform in 1994. The first step will be an uphill fight." But who can say that as soldiers of reform they are not full of confidence and hope about success tomorrow?
