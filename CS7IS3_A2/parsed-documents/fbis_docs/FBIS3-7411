Recalling that at a time when the situation on the Korean peninsula was being aggravated by the anti-DPRK moves of the United States, the agency Secretariat adopted at a recent meeting of its board of governors an unfair "resolution" urging the DPRK to "promptly allow" all inspection activities of the agency equivalent to the full implementation of the safeguards agreement, which went beyond the inspection for the continuity of the safeguards, and submitted it to the United Nations Security Council, the news analyst of the paper says: The adoption of such a "resolution" is an improper act blatantly twisting the fact and another pressure kickup to attain a sinister purpose. The agency Secretariat must know that the DPRK is in a unique position after the temporary suspension of the effectuation of its withdrawal from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. When it adopted another unreasonable "resolution" against the DPRK at the meeting of its board of governors on the basis of an unrealistic, wrong conclusion, the agency Secretariat revealed once again to the world that it had cast away the principle of independence and impartiality. The United States and the agency Secretariat following it will have to bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.
