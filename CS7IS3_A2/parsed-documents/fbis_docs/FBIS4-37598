FBIS4-37598 "drnes121dd_94006" FBIS-NES-94-121 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Security Chief: 'Arafat Visit Not Before Mid-Jul Security Chief: 'Arafat Visit Not Before Mid-Jul TA2206163194 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English 1500 GMT 22 Jun 94 TA2206163194 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el English BFN [Text] Jibril al-Rujub, who is head of Palestinian security in the self-rule area, says Yasir 'Arafat will not come to Gaza and Jericho before the middle of next month. The reason for this is that the countries pledging aid to the autonomous regions appear to be in no hurry to make good their pledges for establishing an infrastructure in the areas. Al-Rujub said also that the issue of the release of Palestinian prisoners and IDF [Israel Defense Forces] security procedures at checkpoints were contributing to 'Arafat's decision to delay his departure. The Palestinian security chief pointed to recent incidents involving PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th. Al-Rujub said Sha'th was delayed twice at IDF security barriers and only allowed to move on after the deputy chief of staff intervened.
