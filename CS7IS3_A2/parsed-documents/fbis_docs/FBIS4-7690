Therefore, there is no problem with ethnic minorities here," states Minister Igor Nemec (ODS [Civic Democratic Party]), chairman of the government council for national and ethnic groups. The "Recapitulation of the Government's Attitude Toward the Issues of Ethnic Minorities," which was debated by the Cabinet last Wednesday, is clearly based on this conviction. The issue is a basic document for the given area. The Czech Republic does not have a special law on ethnic minorities, and the relationship with them is not even mentioned in the government's declaration of its agenda. Thus, the adopted doctrine "summarizes and clarifies the government's attitude toward these problems" (Nemec). The material was prepared by the Council for National and Ethnic Groups, where all minorities are represented. Nevertheless, it cannot be said that the text fulfills their hopes 100 percent: At the very least, representatives of the Polish, German, and partly also Slovak minorities had expected more. Nemec's document defines a minority as "an association of persons who permanently live in the CR [Czech Republic], are citizens of that country, yet share ethnic, cultural, and language characteristics that differ from the majority of the inhabitants and wish to be considered a minority." In its doctrine, the government guarantees the members of a minority the right to develop their culture, be educated in their mother tongue, unite in their own associations and political parties, use their mother tongue in official relations, and participate in resolving issues concerning minorities. The Cabinet considers all of these rights to be strictly individual rights. Consequently, it does not intend to permit, among other things, different rules to apply to minorities in elections. Only representatives of those minorities whose parties get more than the five-percent minimum may sit in parliament. Considering the number of possible voters, however, none of the present "minority parties" can do this. Therefore, some of their leaders and speakers are striving to bring about a change in attitude. The first to propose a different election device for minorities was Dana Branna, the representative of the Czech Poles. This occurred at the end of last year during the meeting of the Council for National and Ethnic Groups, and the idea was instantly supported by the former member of the CNR [Czech National Council], Walter Piwerka, from the Assembly of Germans in the CR. "Parliament deals with a large number of laws that could affect minorities, and yet the delegates may have insufficient information and could easily overlook some dangers" is Dr. Branna's explanation for her action. "Our representatives could watch out for such dangers and point them out." According to Piwerka, the representatives of minorities who hold parliamentary seats could "influence all kinds of issues and also prevent all kinds of disinformation in the present transition period, when a civic society is being formed in our country, but the Czech nation and the minorities are still burdened by nationalism." Nada Vokusova, who represents the Slovak Community in the Council, also agrees with Dr. Branna's proposal. According to Jozef Horal, of the rival Slovak Democratic Alliance, it is "absolute nonsense." This would totally deny the principles of a civic society. "The Slovaks in the Czech lands are voluntarily living in the diaspora and not in a ghetto," says J. Horal. He is convinced that, during the next elections, almost every party will place Slovaks on their list of candidates: According to unofficial data, the Slovak minority in Bohemia and Moravia now numbers 600,000 people, which constitutes a sizable electoral potential. According to Czech experts, the disagreement with a "ration" for parliamentary seats is more than the simple attempt to keep a few unfathomable voices out of parliament. "Collective rights, which include such demands as the demand for a seat in parliament on the basis of adherence to a specific national or ethnic group, is often linked to demands for autonomy in the areas of education, administration, and territory," says Hana Fristenska, of the Secretariat of the Council. "Furthermore, the right to a seat signals that minorities need special protection. Therefore, if one takes a civic approach, representatives of all definable groups--for example, invalids or homosexuals--should theoretically have a seat in parliament. On the whole, one could say that collective rights are political in character, while individual rights are a matter of the legal protection of the individual." However, the chairman of the movement Coexistencia-Souziti [Coexistence], Stanislaw Gawlik, states that the government's attitude toward minorities does not conform with international conventions, which the CR has joined. "According to the European charter on the rights of minority groups, minorities cannot be defined as an aggregate of individuals. On the contrary, collective rights are mentioned. The charter clearly states that minorities should participate in power at all levels in elected agencies," says Gawlik. The answer to whether the Czech legal code adequately protects against discrimination against all minorities was to be provided by a special analysis, which the council intended to commission in the fall of last year. Subsequently, however, the task proved to be too demanding and expensive, and the idea was dropped. Minister Nemec admits that, when preparing the materials, the government was not inspired by any foreign model, but, in contrast to Gawlik, he considers this to be an advantage: "We have the opportunity of letting a fresh wind blow across Europe."
