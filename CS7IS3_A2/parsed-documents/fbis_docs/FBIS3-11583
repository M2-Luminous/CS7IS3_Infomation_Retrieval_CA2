In fact, the administration that will take control of Panama's destiny will have to face the crucial dilemma of efficiently consolidating the canal management transition process. The new government will also have to dodge neoliberal impositions that could undermine the gradual integration process of the canal infrastructures, which will revert to the national economy. The new government will face a new plan regarding relations with the United States, which will be driven by the imminent withdrawal of military troops and the progressive nationalization of the canal. This situation is being conditioned by cuts in the defense budget with the end of the Cold War. The issue of national security is not a priority for the region yet simply because the international financial system replaced the confrontation of ideologies. As the United States readjusts its economy to consolidate the 360 million people market that NAFTA, an agreement also signed by Mexico and Canada, will create, its regional priorities deal with the eradication of drug trafficking, as the new Southern Command chief proposed, and trade deregulation, as international financial institutions are promoting. Under the circumstances, it is necessary to redefine bilateral relations not only politically and economically, but also jurisdictionally to ensure a trouble-free transition of the canal administration; that is, a transition that will not be at the mercy of the country's political stability. This is why the new government will have the prerequisite of restoring the part of the Panamanian state's self-determination that the 20 December 1989 invasion removed. On those grounds, leaders will have to apply daring solutions to the problems that bilateral diplomatic relations have exacerbated over the last few years, namely the post-invasion upheaval, collective mechanisms against drug trafficking, and the transition of the canal administration. In the regional arena, leaders must use dynamic solutions to reinforce the nation's presence in organizations of political consensus like the Rio Group. Leaders will even be compelled to improve hemispheric relations, which visibly deteriorated after the invasion because of the regime of rigid bilateral foreign policies. At the multilateral level, the new government will have to determine its position on GATT, not just because of the timid interest the current administration has showed, but also because of its inability to reconcile the interests of the economic sectors, which favor trade deregulation, and the industrial sectors that remain skeptical because of the uncertainty that joining this organization will generate. Given such a big challenge, there is a need for a government with leadership and the ability to establish consensus at the lowest social cost possible; a consensus that will explain in equitable and balanced terms the competitive advantages the country will have upon joining the integrationist movement. The approval of the Sea Convention Law [Convencion sobre Derecho del Mar], which was postponed for the last few years, is another pivotal issue in foreign policies because Panama holds first place in world merchant marine tonnage and is on the threshold of managing an interoceanic canal with the potential to tap maritime resources. Integrationist initiatives are usually the result of a historic process of accumulation by which states modernize their production processes by systematically embarking in international trade to seek competitive advantages to ensure strengthening their economies. These assumptions in Panama have yet to materialize. That is why it is necessary to consolidate the national economy, to bring it closer to the countries with negotiating capabilities in the integration dynamics. This is why we cannot conceive of separating political integration from economic factors, nor can it (Central American integration) be the result of rhetorical pronouncements that do not come from objective analyses of the country's political and socioeconomic realities. Therefore, by being aware of the country's potentials and needs, the new government will have to adopt measures aimed at increasing plans for regional participation. With this in mind, it will have to establish a series of foreign policy priorities by modernizing the political mechanisms of negotiation at the foreign ministry. Given the challenges inherent to the canal administration, this modernization necessarily means optimizing foreign services as the key instruments to incorporating Panama into the Latin American integration process.
