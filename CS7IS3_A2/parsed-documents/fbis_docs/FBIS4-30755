[passage omitted] [Havel] A process of shaping views, political shaping is under way there. It is a new phase of shaping democracy in Slovakia. It is very important that we are aware of all this. However, at the same time, we should be very careful when commenting on individual political entities. The fact that the standard norm among states is not to intervene in others' internal affairs is one reason for us to observe this. The other reason is that both sides, and especially the Slovak side, are still very sensitive. It is difficult to guess what intention, be it even a good intention, might produce opposite results--whether a statement in support of someone will not be used by someone else against the person in whose support the statement was made. The current situation in Slovakia, especially in the pre-election period, simply demands certain restraint, certain caution, and calls for work on specific issues. At the same time, no scope should be given for turning any Czech step, or any step taken by a Slovak official concerning the Czech side, into something that causes an emotive playing of the so-called Czech card on the Slovak internal political scene. I would like to add that my meeting with President Michal Kovac concentrated on the theme of spiritual, cultural coexistence. [passage omitted] During my talks on coexistence I came across interesting phenomena. On one side Slovakia has achieved its own statehood and many citizens have begun to feel part of that community. Regardless of their previous support or lack of support for Slovakia's independence, nowadays they perceive Slovakia as their own state. They have begun to feel proud of their state. This of course is all right. However, at the same time, they seem to miss something they were used to, something as natural for them as breathing--that is the common Czech-Slovak spiritual dimension. [passage omitted] An interesting thing is that this loss is paradoxically felt more intensively in Slovakia than in the Czech Lands--this a bit of a paradox given the fact that it was above all Slovakia that expressed the desire to have its own state. This situation is as it is because our relationship has always been a bit asymmetric, as if Slovakia was more used to receiving impulses from Bohemia than the Czech Lands receiving them from Slovakia. [passage omitted] However, I think that it is also in our interest not to allow links to be severed that do not need to be, and whose severance will be damaging to us, in fact. [passage omitted] [Hulkova] Let us take a look at one, I would say, highly contentious moment in your work, at least in terms of the reaction. You signed a document that put a definitive seal on the restitution of property to physical Jewish persons. It aroused a very lively array of rather negative reactions. So what do you think about it? [Havel] [passage omitted] Citizens of Jewish belief or nationality had their property confiscated during the war by a law derived from the Nuremberg laws. In addition, other property was also seized, but this was usually done by executive means and such cases were more a minority. After the war, President Edvard Benes issued a decree from which there later stemmed legislation rectifying injustices concerning property. It is stated in the original decree that property must be returned to people persecuted because of their race, nationality, or politics. This amendment applies to restitution of property solely to those people who were persecuted for reasons of race. This is because on account of the Communist coup in 1948 it proved impossible to realize. Even though claims were laid, they were never finally met. Objections to this law referred to the fact that the law applies only to people persecuted for reasons of race and not those others who were persecuted for reasons of nationality or politics. I would naturally also prefer it if the law applied to all groups of people referred to in the original Benes decree. It would be cleaner. Nevertheless, there is no reason why a law should not be ratified that refers to only one group of these people. The fact that it uses the expression that they were persecuted for racial reasons is entirely unavoidable because that is how this group was defined even in the original Benes decree, in spite of the fact that there were other groups in addition. If we wish to rectify this injustice, we must use this definition again. This group was by far the worst affected. The use of the word racial does not constitute introducing any kind of racial criteria into the law, but it is not possible to rectify injustice inflicted on somebody without using the same term, whereby that person was defined when the injustice was committed. In other words, there was no reason of principle nor any moral or constitutional reason for not ratifying such a law, the more so given that if I had not ratified it and returned it to parliament it is questionable whether it will ever have been passed a second time. Let us go to a more general question now. As it is known, we do not have a Senate. One of the Senate's tasks is to monitor the work of the Chamber of Deputies and act as a safety net should some laws not be very good. [passage omitted] Because we do not have a Senate, many expect the president to play the Senate's role, they expect the president will somehow improve the laws or propose various changes in the laws. There are always some who frequently criticize the laws I sign. They reproach me for signing them. But this boils down to the fact that these people do not understand the essence of the right of veto. [passage omitted] The president's task is not to veto laws just because he dislikes this or that in them. Although, in this particular law there are things I quite dislike, it is not a good enough reason for me to return the law. Thus, the president cannot be continually required to play the Senate's role. The parliament will have to make a decision whether or not we should have the Senate and on ways of electing the Senate. But it is impossible to have the Senate equipped with certain powers written in the Constitution, and yet to fail to form the Senate and, at the same time, to unwittingly expect that its powers should be executed by some other constitutional institution. [Hulkova] Your claim that you are going to veto the laws only if they seriously fail to meet your ideas seems to me to be a bit of an excuse because the legislators in this country do not greatly differ from you and will not create something where there will be a chance of you absolutely disagreeing with it. I fear that (?given this context) you will never use the right of veto. [Havel] I will use it. I have already done so on one occasion. Other situations when I will use it will undoubtedly arise. But to a certain extent these will always be exceptional situations. That is how I understand this Constitution and that is how things should be, I think. [passage omitted] [Hulkova] Do you really think it is bad that since there is no Senate, you are expected to play a certain role that will temporarily replace the Senate, as it were? Is this such a bad situation? [Havel] I think it is. The roles of individual constitutional institutions should be clearly defined, they should be indisputable, and should not be confused. [passage omitted] [Hulkova] So we have returned to the topic of the Senate and I reckon we could launch another edition of Conversations from Lany. [Havel] [passage omitted] There is one thing I would like to say about this topic, though. I think that to maintain the present state of affairs is untenable from the long-term viewpoint. This means that on the one hand, the Senate has been written into the Constitution, and yet we do not actually have one. There are yet other consequences of this state of affairs. At the time when the Chamber of Deputies is dissolved, it is the Senate that takes over its work. Since we do not have the Senate, it appears there is no one to take over the role of the parliament if it is dissolved and that is why the final clauses of our Constitution say that our Chamber of Deputies cannot be disbanded. But this state of affairs is unthinkable in democracy. It means we lack one of the basic instruments for solving possible political crises. [passage omitted] That is why I think that the present, very turbulent climate surrounding the issue of the Senate in political circles is a genuinely important factor for this country. At first glance it appears that citizens are not interested in it, that it does not concern them, and that they are not experiencing it as a burning issue of paramount importance. I absolutely understand it. But the consequences of it could very seriously affect society later. [passage omitted]
