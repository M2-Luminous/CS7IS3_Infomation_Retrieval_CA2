He termed the recent accusations levelled against Iran by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher as baseless and false. "Yes, Iran supports freedom fighters and Muslims in Lebanon, Palestine and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and if those who struggle for freedom and for liberation of their lands are terrorist in the U.S. view, then Americans are also terrorits because they fought the British colonizers," Fadlallah argued. He said Iran does not support terrorism, but it has supported the liberation movements. Under the pretext that Iran has taken a negative stand towards the peace process, the U.S. has always called to ostracize and impose sanctions on Iran, but Iran's view is to create peace among the oppressed nations.
