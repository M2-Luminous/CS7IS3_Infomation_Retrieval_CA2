What does this overwhelming Austrian support mean for Europe? [Delors] Well, first of all I would like to welcome our Austrian friends, regardless of how they voted in the referendum. I would like to say that this overwhelming support for Europe is most encouraging for our project. Austria is a people of free citizens who have witnessed how Europe has been built, with all the advantages and disadvantages, all nice and not so nice sides. These people have finally decided to join us. This has an impact that goes even beyond the decision of the Austrian people in favor of Europe. [Schmidt] Some have said that enlargement would obstruct or slow down the further deepening of European integration. Do you share this view? [Delors] The thing is that we do not have a choice. You will certainly remember that those who started this European adventure were pursuing two main objectives. First of all, there should never again be war between us. Second, they wanted to strengthen the peace values, the values of mutual understanding between the people through cooperation. Unity makes you strong. So how could we limit ourselves to 12 European states, how could we be against other countries joining us, especially a country like Austria, considering that Vienna has always been one of the major cultural capitals of Europe, a city that was host to great historic events so important for our continent. The message to our generation now is: You must extend the values of peace and mutual understanding. And Austria can contribute to this process. Located in the center of Europe, it is the ideal link between West and East. For all those reasons there was no other choice. We had to discuss Austria's membership application. We will have to see how we can reconcile enlargement with a capacity of deepening that reflects our ideas and desires. [Schmidt] You have said that Austria was in the center of Europe and that it is a bridge between East and West. You also mentioned that the future of the European Union would also mean securing peace in East Europe. In this connection, do you perceive any special role Austria might play as a bridge, as a mediator? [Delors] As a result of the friendly relations that I have with the Austrian chancellor and the numerous talks I conducted with the foreign minister, I have realized how sensitive and receptive your country is to everything that is going on in Europe, and how much it knows about the things that might threaten the stability of our continent today and tomorrow: the rejection of the other -- which is the case in the tragedy in Yugoslavia, ethnic groups that regard themselves as nations, the religious wars, racism, populism. Austria is really in a good situation to know all those things. I do not have to recall how much Chancellor Kreisky fought for major issues that went beyond Austria. Austria is a great nation, it will make its contribution to Europe, and, nevertheless, remain Austria with its unmistakable personality. [Schmidt] Mr. President, looking into the future, one can see one major economic and social problem -- unemployment. You have suggested an initiative for more growth and the struggle against unemployment. It looks now as if this initiative would be further delayed before concrete steps are taken. What can be done, what ought to be done to implement this program more rapidly? [Delors] Since the summit of heads of state and government adopted my proposals contained in the white book, we have done a lot of work. The next European Council will be held in two weeks time in Corfu under Greek chairmanship. There we will have to take further steps. What can prevent us from taking those steps? Well, shortsightedness might be an obstacle, the fact that actions are taken shortsightedly, that people might say: Well, now that we have the first signs of economic growth again we might as well let things stand where they are. But this is wrong. All countries of Europe now have to come to terms with three major changes: A change of the international economy with the emergence of new competitors -- the East Asian countries and, in the future, also China; then a technological change that we have to get under control -- from economic but also social aspects; the new technologies -- these are ethical problems but also problems of organization for society; and a change in the values of our society. The advantage of the white paper is that it opened the windows to the medium-term sphere, that it initiated a debate. If one follows the guidelines of the white paper then one can hope that unemployment will decrease by half at the end of the century. I deliberately said at the end of the century. This means that these efforts will take another five or six years. Still, the possibilities are there, and the Commission must now try to convince the governments and public opinions of the need to tackle the changes. Otherwise, Europe would be overtaken by history, and, for the first time in Europe, be marginalized -- and all this after we have contributed so much to history. For us this is a question of survival. [Schmidt] Mr. President, 10 years ago you brought a new vision to Europe, the vision of the single market. This vision of a Europe without borders has become reality. What is your new vision today for the future of this continent and the EU, in particular? [Delors] As I said before, I think that we have to make sure that in this European continent, which will soon have a population of 500 million, the values of peace and mutual understanding will prevail, that our methods remain valid, and that we will continue to have cooperation, the exchange of people, of ideas, town partnerships, economic cooperation and, I hope, political cooperation in the near future. These are imperatives. If we fail to put them into practice, then the postcommunist era, the post-Cold War era will become an era characterized by conflicts that we are unable to settle. Then all the negative things will come to the surface -- racism, populism, the rejection of the other, inaccessibility, intolerance. We must together turn this Europe of 500 million citizens into an example for peace. At the same time, we also must not forget that some of us are seeking a political Europe. This means that we would like sovereign states to join forces and take actions in the world together, to protect our interests, and to serve our ideals. This will probably make it necessary to strengthen and change the institutions in 1996. You have just asked me how one could make enlargement and deepening compatible. The question will still have to be answered. Yet, it would be bad to say that we can only have one or the other, when we have to achieve both objectives. Will there be one or two Europes in the future, a large Europe in the way I have just described, or maybe even a smaller group of countries that are moving toward political union? This is possible. Yet, I am against saying enlargement or deepening when we need both. After all, for me 1989 was the most important date I have experienced apart from the war. Communism collapsed and we must now be generous toward those who lived under the communist yoke before, and we must be ready to accept them into our community. [Schmidt] Mr. President, thank you very much for the interview.
