Deputy Prime Minister Sergej Kozlik said that, on the basis of these legislative amendments, the so-called old bloc should be abolished and a one-bloc clearing system of accounting should be introduced. According to Kozlik, there were no direct talks at the government session today about the Slovak budget deficit. At a news conference, however, he said that the government had to grant 6 billion Slovak korunas from the state budget to commence independent activity of the National Insurance Company, which hugely increased the state budget revenues for January.
