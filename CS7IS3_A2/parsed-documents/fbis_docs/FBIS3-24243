Taran: "The Stockholders of Tatpromstroybank Did Not Miscalculate"] [Text] The news that the joint-stock industrial construction bank of development of the Republic of Tatarstan (Tatpromstroybank) was among the top 100 banks of Russia for the second time in a row (it is the only representative of Tatarstan financial institutions on the rating chart) arrived just in time--a conference of the stockholders of Tatpromstroybank convened yesterday at which the results of last year's operation were summarized and reference points for the current year were charted. Rafael Mingazov, chairman of the bank's board of directors, had no reason to be ashamed in front of the founders and stockholders when presenting his report on the work accomplished. The bank's balance sheet turnover, total assets, and credit deposits increased fivefold. While bank profits grew twice as fast as the volume of credit extension, increasing by a factor of 11. In the words of R. Mingazov, the bank succeeded in achieving this primarily by accelerating monetary turnover, not by setting high rates for credit. The reliability and prestige of Tatpromstroybank is confirmed by the fact that more than 2,000 enterprises and entrepreneurs became its clients last year and 17,000 individuals became depositors. As we know, it was decided at the previous stockholder conference to increase the bank's authorized capital to R1.5 billion. In July of last year this task was accomplished, and towards the end of 1993 the authorized capital of Tatpromstroybank had grown to R3 billion. The bank directors have proposed to the stockholders that the level of authorized capital be raised to R10 billion, especially since the Russian Federation Central Bank adopted a resolution establishing the minimum amount of capital at R2 billion, to be increased over the course of five years to R10 billion. Tatpromstroybank's borrowers are predominantly state enterprises. They account for more than 63 percent of the credits, mainly short-term credits. Long-term credits increased fourfold in terms of absolute amount, but their rate of growth decreased. This is explained by virtue of the overall crisis in the economy and the striving of bank directors to accelerate the turnover rate of resources. The share of long-term credits was reduced from 10 to 7 percent. Nonetheless, R. Mingazov states that the bank saddled itself with obligations to distribute long-term resources for providing credits to the Yelabuga Motor Vehicle Plant and defense enterprises amounting to over R12 billion. The bank's income from these transactions is entirely minimal, however--3 percent annual interest. In order to soften the blow inflicted upon enterprises by the nonpayments crisis, Tatpromstroybank has established direct corresponding accounts with 16 banks of the near abroad and 15 of the far abroad, which include financial enterprises of the United States, Germany, England, Switzerland, Turkey, and Korea. In order to regulate the use of ready cash in 1994, it is planned to introduce plastic cards for obtaining cash through automatic teller machines.
