Paz Zamora was distressed by the numerous accusations that he permitted the creation of a drug trafficking network within his administration and that many of the leaders of his party participated in it. Jaime Paz Zamora sent the media a recorded message in which he said he did not commit any crimes, he only made mistakes in good faith. [Begin recording] [Paz Zamora] My dear fellow countrymen, from the day of my last speech during the inauguration on 6 August of 1993... [Unidentified reporter, interrupting] Paz's face was slimmer. The dramatic moment showed on the former president. He is obviously affected by the drama afflicting his party and many important MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] leaders. Jaime Paz Zamora faced the camera sure that millions of citizens would hear his definitive decision to withdraw from political life. He was overwhelmed by the accusations made by the Special Antinarcotics Force [FELCN] that he permitted the alleged coverup of drug trafficking activities during his government and that some of the leaders of his party had direct participation in it. He was firm at the beginning of his message and had a hopeless look at the end. The former president used his farewell speech to try to instill hope in citizens who today have major doubts about his performance as head of state. [Paz Zamora] I want to give my version of the latest reports linking us with drug trafficking that have shocked the country. The first thing I want to say on this matter, with all clarity and firmness, is that we never committed any crime. But just as clearly I must recognize, dear fellow countrymen, that there were mistakes, lack of prudence, or incorrect appreciation of situations and behavior. I also must admit to maintaining relations with some people in a good faith that was close to naivete. [Reporter] Jaime Paz Zamora later said that it seems there are too many ill-intentioned attitudes. It seems that it is not important to seek the truth but to inflict political damage, he added. I cannot permit, he said, that by tarnishing my dignity as a former president that the issue will continue tarnishing my country's dignity. [Paz Zamora] Dear fellow countrymen, listen to me well. With the same love and respect I always had for you, with calm and firmness, I want to announce that I have made the undeclinable decision to withdraw from the party leadership and national political activities. You have known me for many years. I have always acted in good faith, with good will, in all matters and with all people. I have acted under the guidance of moral principles that I learned from my family and the Bolivian people. Achievements have a prize; mistakes produce consequences that must be admitted with honor and dignity. [Reporter] This is what Jaime Paz Zamora said on 26 March. He did not want to answer questions. This is why he sent the recorded message to the most important radio and television stations and newspapers. The man who founded MIR on 7 September 1971, who for many years was an active and charismatic leader, who was almost killed during an attack because he was an alleged nuisance to the 1980 dictatorship, the man who on 6 August 1989 was sworn in as president of the Republic, was thus withdrawing from political life. He assured and admitted to the people that he had made mistakes but did not commit any crime. [end recording]
