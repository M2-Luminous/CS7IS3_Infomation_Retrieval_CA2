Qatar became the pioneer of this latest innovation when it announced that it had invited an Israeli delegation to participate in the multilateral talks on the nonproliferation of weapons expected to convene in Qatar in Ordibehesht [21 April-21 May]. Accordingly, Oman has also announced that an Israeli delegation will visit Muscat in the next few days to participate in a multipartite working group session regarding water resources. Thus, Oman becomes the first Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] member country to host a delegation from the Zionist regime. The following points may be noted with regard to this latest dangerous innovation: 1. It can be conceded without doubt that the convocation of the so-called experts' sessions with the inclusion of the Israeli regime's representatives has only one objective, that is, to pave the way for normalizing relations between the GCC countries and this regime. This can be confirmed in the context of the remarks of an Arab diplomatic source who stated that the United States is trying to persuade the littoral states to lift the Israeli boycott in their multipartite talks. Thus, the U.S. pressure to normalize relations with the Israeli regime has increased and recently, reports have been disseminated of covert contacts between the littoral countries of the southern Persian Gulf and Israel. Thus, they are seeking to bring them out of the closet and make these covert ties overt. 2. In circumstances when the Zionist regime, officially and in full view of people everywhere, makes innocent Palestinian civilians wallow in blood and dust and when little time has elapsed since the al-Khalil debacle, what does the presence of Israeli delegates at sessions held in Islamic countries mean? Is this anything but the treachery of these countries to the Islamic aspirations or at least Arab aspirations that have been bandied about for years? What answer do these littoral countries of the southern Persian Gulf, which will host representatives from the most rootless and illegitimate regime, have for the world's public, especially the Muslims, whose hearts are still bleeding from the heinous slaughter of the fasting worshippers while they were prostrating themselves in the al-Ibrahimi mosque? 3. The Persian Gulf shaykhs have chosen the worst and most dangerous path for protecting their thrones and diadems. Permitting the ingress of the Zionists into the Persian Gulf region will not benefit them; it will certainly generate sentiments opposed to this action among the awakened societies in their respective countries, which will certainly not be very pleasant for their rulers. The sins of the Persian Gulf shaykhs are unforgivable and Israel's presence in the region will never be tolerated by the Arab and Muslim public in the region. Subservience to the U.S. policies on normalizing relations with the Zionist regime will harm all the countries involved in this trend, harm that will be too costly to redeem.
