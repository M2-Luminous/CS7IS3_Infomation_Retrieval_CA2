This came in the interview assistant special representative of the UN secretary general for the Sahara and Chairman of the Identification Commission Eric Jensen had with Moroccan 'L'OPINION' daily. Jensen said some of the criteria are simple while others are not. The simplest one is that of the persons on the lists of the Spanish census of 1974. The identification process is meant to check up if the persons are actually eligible to vote in the referendum, he said, adding that "there are difficult cases, because some times the documents produced are very old, so it was necessary to associate chioukhs who know the [word indistinct] in the identification operation." To a question on the duration of the operation, Jensen said "it is too early to tell. We have nearly 56,000 registered persons, but we expect much more." "For the time being, I do not see any political difficulties." The two sides "ensured me that they are ready to apply the Security Council resolutions." "This means that we will actually start the identification process," he said. The five criteria required for participation in the referendum are that people's names be on the lists of the Spanish census of 1974, the people who were living in the territory as a member of a Sahrawi tribe at the moment of the census of 1974, but who could not be covered by the census, the relatives of these two first groups (the father, mother and children), the people born to a Saharawi father born in the territory, the people, member of Saharawi tribes belonging to the territory, who lived in the territory for six consecutive years or intermittently during a cumilative period of 12 years before December 1st, 1974.
