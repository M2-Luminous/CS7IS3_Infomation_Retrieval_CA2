FBIS4-10971 "drlat077__a94010" FBIS-LAT-94-077-A Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 ANNEX Brazil Ricupero Seeks `Turnaround' in Constitutional Revision Ricupero Seeks `Turnaround' in Constitutional Revision PY1904135394 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 18 Apr 94 p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY1904135394 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Portuguese BFN [Text] Brasilia -- Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero yesterday stated that the constitutional revision process is not over yet, and announced that the government will make a major effort this week with congressional leaders to effect a turnaround before 31 May, the established deadline for the conclusion of the Constituent Congress. Drawing a comparison between the revision process and a soccer game, he said: "We are perhaps already 20 minutes into the second half of the soccer game, but we can still turn the game around." Speaking during a news conference he called yesterday afternoon to discuss the subject, he added: "I believe one is only truly defeated when one considers oneself to have been defeated." Ricupero urges a greater effort by those running for office in the upcoming elections with a view to influencing the constitutional revision process. He said: "Those candidates who believe they are likely to win are the ones who should undertake this effort." He voiced his belief that Itamar Franco's government has already discharged its duty in this regard. He added that the lack of structural reforms will render the future government inoperative. To make this turnaround possible, Ricupero announced that he and four other ministers -- Planning Minister Beni Varas, Industry and Commerce Minister Elcio Alvares, Justice Minister Alexandre Dupeyrant, and Social Security Minister Sergio Cutolo -- will have lunch on 19 April with all congressional bloc leaders to establish those topics the government considers to be essential for its economic reform. Upon urging the virtual presidential candidates to support the revision process, Ricupero mentioned the drafting of the 1996 budget, which he believes will be the first task the new government will have to undertake. He said: "How will the new government finance public accounts with all those restrictions if it can no longer count on the Social Emergency Fund [FSE]?" He noted that the FSE stemmed from an amendment approved by the Constituent Congress, and that it will be valid for financing social spending only in 1994 and 1995. Ricupero stated that the government will not overlook congressional authority in outlining the points of a possible negotiated minimum agenda. He made it clear, however, that he is going to fight to prioritize issues such as tax, fiscal, and social security reform, as well as related restrictions. He described issues such as the definition of national enterprise and the opening up to foreign capital as important for Brazil's future development.
