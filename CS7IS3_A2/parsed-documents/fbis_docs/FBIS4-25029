Since November 1993, Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province, a rising economic giant in south China, has used the reserve system for major commodities to regulate the market, he said. Now the system covers a variety of commodities, including pork, food grain, cooking oil, sugar, frozen fish, eggs, chemical fertilizers, pesticides and farming-related plastic sheets. The city government has spent about 100 million yuan keeping these commodities in stock, the official said. The city government has also raised nearly 120 million yuan for the establishment of regulatory funds covering risks related to grain prices, he added. It has decided to spend 20 million yuan this year to subsidize vegetable production, he revealed. "The reserves of staple commodities have proved effective in stabilizing the market and curbing excessive rises in prices," he said. For example, last year state-owned grain stores in Guangzhou succeeded in bringing grain prices down by selling grain in large quantities. In mid-February this year, the city government cut wholesale pork prices twice and increased pork supplies, thus pushing pork prices down. Guangzhou's retail sales amounted to 11.3 billion yuan in the first four months of 1994, up nearly 26 percent over the same period in 1993, the official said. Its price index rose about 18 percent during that period, lower than the nation's average, he added.
