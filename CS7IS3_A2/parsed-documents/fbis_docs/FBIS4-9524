"In the course of a visit by Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs Karolos Papoulias some time ago we accepted with pleasure an offer by our guests to open a Greek consulate in Montenegro," Bulatovic said, adding that according to what he had learned, the Greek parliament has approved such a decision. Replying to a question on the possibility of the opening of the consulates of other countries in Montenegro, Bulatovic said at a news conference that there was also interest in the opening of an Albanian consulate. Unfortunately, he added, "because of the current political situation, this idea has not yet reached the phase of realization." The Montenegrin president stressed that the foreign policy orientation of the government and the leadership of this republic is "to accept offers and set up a consular network", which would also make the entire diplomatic communication of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia more efficient.
