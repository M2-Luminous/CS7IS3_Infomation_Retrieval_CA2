In an interview with XINHUA over the weekend, Premier Li analyzed the international situation and spoke on China's relations with other countries and its policies towards Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. He noted that in 1994, the third year following the end of the Cold War, the international situation would go towards relaxation, with the world moving more rapidly to multi-polarization. But on the other side, he warned, there are still many destabilizing factors in the world, and the two main themes, peace and development, remain unsettled. He continued that in today's turbulent world, Asia, and east Asia in particular, remains relatively stable and its economy is growing continuously. He described this phenomenon as "an important feature of the world situation today" and predicted that east Asia will continue to improve its standing and have a greater influence on the whole world in the new year. Li was also confident that China will improve its international standing and further expand its relations world-wide in 1994. He believed that China will make marked improvement in its relations with the European countries as a group. The Sino-U.S. summit in Seattle last November provided a good opportunity for the improvement of bilateral ties, Li said, adding that it is possible that such ties will see new development in the new year. "Facts show that there exist wide-ranging common interests between China and the Western countries, which form the basis for improving Sino-Western relations," Li stressed. The premier said that 1994 brings China nearer to recovering its sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao. No matter what happens, he said, the Chinese Government has the ability to restore its sovereignty over Hong Kong as scheduled, uphold the "one country, two systems" policy and the Basic Law for Hong Kong and maintain long-term stability and prosperity in Hong Kong. Hong Kong and Macao are more closely connected with the mainland economically, he noted, adding that the continuous economic development in the mainland will ensure increasing prosperity in Hong Kong and Macao. Premier Li continued that the peaceful reunification of China is the general trend of historical development and a popular wish of all the Chinese people. The attempt by some people to create "two Chinas," or "one China, one Taiwan," or "one country, two governments," runs counter to the development of history and to the fundamental interests and wishes of the people on the mainland and in Taiwan, Li said. He called on the Taiwan authorities to place the interests of the Chinese nation above everything else and do more practical things for the reunification and prosperity of the motherland. In conclusion, Premier Li urged all the Chinese in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, the Overseas Chinese and those Chinese residing abroad to work for the prosperity of the Chinese nation.
