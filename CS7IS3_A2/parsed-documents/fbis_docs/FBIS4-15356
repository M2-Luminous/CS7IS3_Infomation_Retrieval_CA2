On Wednesday, Russia removed the clause in the draft Russian- Estonian troop withdrawal agreement obligating Russia to pull its troops out of Estonia by 31 August 1994, saying the final date would reappear in the draft agreement if Estonia altered its legislation on military retirees, Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed ETA yesterday. In essence this move set talks back to last August, before Russia had proposed a final withdrawal date, the Ministry said in its statement. "There is always sense in continuing the negotiations," Luik said, recalling that already after the 17th round the negotiations were almost broken, but stressing that the negotiations had to be continued with the aim of 31 August as the Russian troop withdrawal deadline. He added that in case of a wish from the Russian side Russia could pull out its 2,500 troops from Estonia much quicker than August 31. "There are no practical obstacles to troop withdrawal, there is only a political inability from the Russian side," he said. Ago Tiiman, the secretary of the Estonian delegation at the negotiations explained a press conference on Thursday that the Russian delegation had made a proposal to grant residence permits automatically to all retired Russian military, including "the officers that will resign e.g. tomorrow". He said that the Russian side demanded that Estonia give the flats used by the retirees to their private ownership, saying that a privately owned flat could be sold much more favourably by those that leave than only the so-called "propiska". Tiiman said that the Russian delegation made its proposals in "a sharp ultimatum style". As the demands were similar to those adopted in the Russian-Latvian agreement, the text of which Estonian delegation had at hand, Estonia was prepared to the pressure of the Russian side, he added. Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed ETA on Thursday that 30 House members of the US Congress sent letters on April 4 to President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher urging the Administration to insist that Russia honor its commitment to withdraw from Estonia and Latvia by August 31, 1994. "If we abandon our insistence that Russia remove its troops from the Baltics on schedule, we will only strengthen the hard-liners in Russia who wish to expand their influence and regain lost territory. The removal of all Russian troops from the independent yet fragile Baltic countries is crucial for stability, peace and democracy in the Baltics, and for continuing good relations between the United States and Russia," reads the letter. Russian allegations of human rights violations in Estonia and Latvia, a claim Moscow uses to justify Russian military presence, were rejected in this letter. Signatories also agreed that Russian demands for housing, pensions and resident status for former Russian officers are "completely unjustified, and are simply intended to prolong the Russian occupation of the Baltics." Estonian Minister of Population Peeter Olesk told ETA, however, that it was to be expected that Russia will "increase pressure on Estonia at the final phase of the bilateral negotiations" and "dispute Estonia's belonging to European states". "Russia has always been interested in destabilizing our independence and will not step back on the issue," he said.
