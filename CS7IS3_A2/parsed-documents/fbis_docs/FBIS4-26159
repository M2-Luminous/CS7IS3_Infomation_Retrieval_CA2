About 200 workers were inside searching for material when the Hong Kong-Chinese joint venture factory collapsed. Ten people are still missing and people at the scene said five supervisors from Hong Kong were among those still buried under the rubble. The injured Yu Xin Printing and Dyeing factory workers, who asked not to be named, said they had been told to check the six-storey building for unburnt cloth 10 hours after flames left it a burnt-out hulk. "About 300 workers were lined up outside the burnt building at around 1 pm," one woman said. "Our manager told us to collect any unburnt material, otherwise our salaries would be deducted." A number of workers ignored the management's order. "Some of the workers and I were picking up some of the unburnt cloth on the second floor," the woman said. "An hour later the building suddenly collapsed and I was buried." The woman, who was admitted to the Zhuhai Municipal Government Hospital suffering from minor head and leg injuries, said she was lucky to escape alive. "Nobody came to rescue me. I climbed out from the debris by myself. I don't know how many of my colleagues have been buried," she said. According to Shenzhen Municipal Authority spokesman Yang Shuiping, 17 bodies had been recovered by last night and the search for other victims was to continue today. She said the workers had heard nothing from the Hong Kong owners about compensation for their injuries although management had sent two people to visit the victims several times telling them to "take care". Other workers at the hospital said a Hong Kong factory manager gave the order to enter the building to salvage cloth and begin a site clean-up. The woman said: "Even the factory fire did not kill anybody. But his order did." The spokesman, a Mr Yang, [as received] said of the 158 people hospitalised, 101 were still receiving treatment while another 15 were in a serious condition. Yesterday piles of debris from the collapsed factory reached the third floor of an adjoining building. Smoke still poured from the rubble despite heavy rain and the fire being extinguished more than 24 hours beforehand. Witnesses said half the building was like "carbon" and believed heavy rain contributed to its collapse. It was the second time in as many weeks that an industrial building in China's most dynamic region collapsed. A partially-built Shenzhen factory collapsed earlier this month killing 11 people. The Governor of Guangdong province, Zhu Senlin, visited the disaster scene yesterday. Mr Yang said the government had vowed to find those responsible for the disaster. He said three welders had been arrested. The workmen allegedly caused the fire when sparks from equipment they were using to install fire safety measures ignited cotton bales. The fire broke out on Thursday in the factory's number three workshop. No one was injured in the blaze which was put out by Friday morning. The Yu Xin factory, located inside Zhuhai's Qianshan Textile City, is a joint venture between a Hong Kong merchant and the Zhuhai Qian-shan Industrial Co.
