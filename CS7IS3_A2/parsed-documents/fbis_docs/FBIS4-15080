"Kalmykia has raised to a new level in its development. A new historic step was made. Only unity can help us survive," President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov stated. Ilyumzhinov had earlier announced his intention to abolish the republican constitution, which caused a mixed reaction in Moscow. According to the Russian Constitution, republics within the Federation have their own constitutions, while regions and territories have their charters. The status of a subject of the Russian Federation can be changed only upon agreement with the Federation.
