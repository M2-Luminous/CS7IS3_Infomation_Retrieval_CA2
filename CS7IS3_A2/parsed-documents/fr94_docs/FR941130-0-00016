FR941130-0-00016 FR941130-0-00002 Based on the comments received and an internal review of this issue, the Board has decided to consider, as part of its review of proposed mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks, how the bank intends to serve, or continue to serve, the convenience and needs of its community. This provision adds a convenience-and-needs component to the factors the FDIC considers in reviewing proposed conversions of State Savings Banks, but does not impose a convenience-and-needs or CRA requirement upon banks proposing to convert. In that regard, the FDIC will review the bank's business plan to determine how the bank intends to serve, or continue to serve, the needs of its community. The final rule amends the applicable provision in the Interim Final Rule to state that the FDIC will ``consider the bank's plans to fulfill its commitment to serving the convenience and needs of its community''. To avoid confusion about whether a converting bank is required to use conversion proceeds for community purposes, the reference in the Interim Final Rule to ``planned contributions or investments in the community'' is deleted. Also, as indicated in the Proposed Rule, the ``convenience and needs of the community to be served'' by the applicant is one of the statutory factors required to be considered by the Board in acting on applications for deposit insurance (12 U.S.C. 1816). Thus, in connection with the review of mutual holding company reorganizations of insured depository institutions_in which a deposit insurance application is required to be filed with the FDIC_the FDIC already does, and will continue to, apply a convenience-and-needs test. 10. Comparison With OTS Regulations The requirements imposed by the final rule essentially parallel the OTS Revisions. As indicated in the Proposed Rule, there are numerous other provisions in the OTS' mutual-to-stock conversion regulations (12 CFR 563b) that are not included in either the FDIC Interim Rule or the Proposed Rule. Those OTS regulations include specific and detailed requirements on, among other things: Items to be included in the plan of conversion, stock purchase priorities, percentage limitations on stock purchases and MRPs, proxy solicitation and the form and content of proxy statements, the form and content of offering circulars, accounting rules, liquidation accounts, notices of filing, availability of conversion documents and pricing and sale of securities. In the Proposed Rule the FDIC requested specific comment on whether, in order to achieve greater uniformity with the OTS's conversion regulations, the FDIC's conversion regulations should be expanded to match the scope and depth of the OTS rules. The FDIC received very few comments on this issue. One argued that, because conversions overall are a matter of state law, the FDIC should not issue detailed, OTS-type regulations. A national consumer group argued that the FDIC regulations should be as encompassing as the OTS'. A law firm commented that the FDIC regulations should include the anti-takeover provisions in the OTS rules. The Board continues to believe that the requirements imposed by the final rule will enable the FDIC, in accordance with its governing statutes, to monitor the conversions of State Savings Banks for issues involving safety and soundness, fiduciary duty and violations of law. Under the final rule, the FDIC will continue to use the OTS regulations as a frame of reference in reviewing proposed mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks. The FDIC also will continue to look to the applicable state law and regulations in reviewing proposed conversions. The FDIC has a different statutory basis for exercising its authority in this area than does the OTS and has not identified a need to adopt a more comprehensive set of regulations addressing all aspects of the mutual-to-stock conversion process. 11. Mutual Holding Companies The Proposed Rule provided that the FDIC's mutual-to-stock conversion regulations also would apply, to the extent appropriate, to reorganizations of State Savings Banks into the mutual holding company form of ownership. The FDIC received few comments on the applicability of the Proposed Rule to mutual holding company reorganizations and corresponding issuances of stock. One said that the final rule should either provide special rules for mutual holding companies or defer to state laws on such reorganizations/conversions. Another person noted that the Proposed Rule was unclear to what extent, if any, the FDIC would rely on OTS regulations regarding mutual holding company reorganizations. The FDIC also received three comments that mutual holding companies should not be prohibited from waiving rights to dividends paid by the subsidiary State Savings Bank. The final rule retains the statement included in the Proposed Rule that the FDIC's mutual-to-stock conversion rules apply, where appropriate, to mutual holding company reorganizations of State Savings Banks. The Board continues to believe that the FDIC's rules on mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks should apply, where applicable, when a State Savings Bank reorganizes into the mutual holding company form of ownership. The valuation and insider benefits issues in mutual holding company reorganizations are essentially the same issues present in standard mutual-to-stock conversions. Thus, the FDIC has the same concerns about safety and soundness, breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law in the context of mutual holding company reorganizations as it does regarding traditional mutual-to-stock conversions. In this connection, the FDIC will use the applicable state law and the regulations issued by the OTS (12 CFR 575) as a frame of reference for reviewing proposed State Savings Bank mutual holding company reorganizations and (contemporaneous and post-reorganization) stock issuances. The FDIC also is directly involved in the mutual holding company reorganizations of federal and state savings associations. That involvement entails FDIC action on the application for deposit insurance required to be filed with the FDIC in such transactions for the de novo stock depository institution organized to facilitate the reorganization. In acting on applications for deposit insurance the FDIC must consider the factors listed in section 6 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1816), one of which is the ``general character and fitness of the management of the depository institution''. In the course of that review the FDIC considers, among other things, the same issues of fiduciary duty that it considers in reviewing proposed mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks. Because of the typical interrelationship between the management of a mutual holding company and its subsidiary bank, the FDIC will closely scrutinize for potential conflicts of interest mutual holding company reorganizations of State Savings Banks and stock issuances simultaneous with or subsequent to a mutual holding company reorganization.
