[Gelo] I consider the internal arrangement of federal Bosnia and Herzegovina very important in this regard. Unless the boundaries between the two nationalities are relatively well-drawn, that is, unless the space belonging to the respective nationality is set off so that the Croats have their sovereignty in a specified part, we can expect emigration of Croats from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The central government in Sarajevo need not be supreme to cause that: economic reasons will be paramount in motivating Croats to leave Bosnia and Herzegovina, as they have up to now. Unless Croatia is able to conduct a differentiated economic and demographic policy toward the part of Bosnia and Herzegovina where the Croats live, that is, unless there are special economic relations between the Croatian cantons and the Croatian state, over the next 10 years, while a true market is coming to life, we could lose all the Croats in Bosnia. That is why as a demographer and statistician I consider it very important to have precise territorial and political definition of the area and rights of the Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina where as a sovereign nation they will decide the essential matters concerning their future. [DANAS] How do you make the case for that fear? [Gelo] The area where the Muslims live is the most heavily populated, but not the most highly developed. Two-thirds of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina live in that area. Demographic trends show that the Muslims will continue to increase numerically. Unless there are precisely defined limitations on moving from one place to another, the Muslims will spread not only to the territory of the federation, but even to the territory of the confederation, that is, Croatia. They will have a hard time integrating with the Croats, because in religion, customs, and culture they belong to a different cultural context. Experiences in the past show that with respect to those criteria the Croats and Serbs are closer than the Croats and the Muslims. And when it comes to moving from one place to another, certain restrictions have to be set up between the cantons in the federation, not only concerning the Muslims, but this should also be done concerning the Croats from Bosnia and Herzegovina. They are the smallest nationality in Bosnia and Herzegovina, they live in the least developed area, they have a less promising demographic trend than the Muslims, and they naturally tend to move to the parent state. That is why from the economic standpoint Croatia must fight for its right to bypass the central Bosnian government in its relations with the particular cantons. Unless it succeeds in doing that, this federal-confederal framework will result in disappearance of the Croats from Bosnia and Herzegovina and a threat to the present composition of the population in Croatia. [DANAS] What would be the ethnic composition of that confederation? [Gelo] The confederation would have a population of 7.5 million: 4.5 million Croats, 1.9 million Muslims, 500,000 Serbs, and the remainder are other nationalities (see the table [not translated]). So, the Croats would represent about 60 percent in that community of states. Demographic developments, which cannot change in a few years, but only over decades, indicate that the non-Croats will have a stronger population growth, which in time could have the result that there are more non-Croats than Croats, which means a threat to the stability and survival of the Croatian state. Regardless of the war, Croatia has a decline in population, for two years now there have been more deaths than births. And the demographic process, as I said, cannot be changed that fast. [DANAS] But what if the Bosnian Serbs join the federation and then the confederation? [Gelo] Add to that number of 7.5 million the 1.3 million Bosnian Serbs, and if we take into account demographic processes which are unfavorable for the Croats, the Croats would very soon be a minority in that structure. [DANAS] What needs to be done to change the process? [Gelo] A population policy, which has been lacking up to now, has to be established in order to correct those negative demographic trends. And then a migration policy to distribute the population on economic and strategic grounds. The Adriatic islands, parts of Slavonia, and the Lika Plateau have a trend of population loss. We also need to include the return of Croats, for example, from Kosovo, from Vojvodina, Kotor Bay, Romania, Hungary.... [DANAS] How do you evaluate the Washington agreement as a whole? [Gelo] If it is implemented and if the sovereign Croatian cantons in Bosnia and Herzegovina are not delineated, and if the right of the Muslims to move into those cantons or to Croatia is not limited, and then if Croats are not prevented from moving out of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Washington agreement is a bad decision from the demographic standpoint. It most likely will cause a new wave of emigration of Croats not only Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also from Croatia, because renewal not only of its country, but also of the much more devastated Bosnia, will be placed on Croatia's shoulders. Unfortunately, those are the indications of the science of demography.
