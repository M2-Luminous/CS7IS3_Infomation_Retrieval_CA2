Wu Jichuan, Chinese minister of posts and telecommunications, said here today in an exclusive interview with XINHUA that since 1984, the ministry has used foreign funds of 5.67 billion U.S. dollars. The ministry hopes to use another batch of 2.1 billion U.S. dollars of foreign funds by the end of 1995, while the planned sum of foreign funds for the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) period is five billion U.S. dollars, Wu added. He said that in the past 10 years, with loans on favorable terms from foreign governments, international financial organizations and other overseas organizations and institutions, the ministry introduced some 16.8 million lines of program-controlled city telephone switch equipment and one million lines of long-distance switch equipment; constructed about 20,000 km of high-grade optical telecommunications cable lines and 15,000 km of digital micro-wave telecommunications lines; and set up 18 land satellite stations and 28 automated letter distribution lines. "Foreign capital has given a great push to China's telecommunications construction," he said. He said that China's fast economic development in the past few years has brought about a nice opportunity for the country's telecommunications development. However, being a basic industry, telecommunications has been suffering from insufficient infrastructures, which has, to some extent, also hampered the country's economic development. To step up the construction of telecommunications infrastructures, the central government has drafted a series of preferential policies, and priority has been given to the industry in terms of using foreign funds. Considering the scale of China's telecommunications market, the ministry will be fully capable of repaying foreign investment, the minister said. Telecommunications is one of China's industries with the fastest development speed. In 1992 its business volume increased by 42 percent; last year its growth rate rose to 59 percent, while in the first five months of this year the rate of increase was 49.5 percent. The high speed increase is closely related to China's huge input in this field. Last year the industry finished an investment of 40.4 billion yuan in fixed assets construction, and this year's budget rose abruptly to 53.6 billion yuan. The Eighth Five-Year Plan (1986-1990) will finish a total investment of 160 billion yuan, while in the newly-drafted Ninth Five-Year Plan the budget is a hefty 360 billion yuan. Aside from a small amount of state allocations, most of the funds will come from domestic and overseas loans or be raised by various localities, Wu said. He said that China will be the world's largest telecommunications market in the 21st century. So far nearly all of the world's large telecommunications groups have established cooperative relations with China, and some medium-sized and small enterprises are also preparing to have a share in this large market. This is really a good opportunity for China's telecommunications development. Talking about foreign cooperation, Wu said that besides engaging in direct management of telecommunications businesses, or management through buying stock, overseas businessmen are welcome to cooperate in the fields such as scientific research, education, product development, engineering and design, and equipment production and supply. He said that China especially welcomes overseas businessmen to invest in telecommunications construction projects. The Chinese side will ensure their interests according to the rule of mutual benefit. He said that the production of telecommunications equipment is fully open to foreign businessmen. They can construct cooperative enterprises as well as solely-funded enterprises in China. So far all of China's newly-built advanced telecommunications equipment production lines are fruits of Sino-foreign cooperation, such as the Sino-Belgium Switch Co. in Shanghai, Tianjin-NEC Co. and Beijing Siemens Co. Presently Guangdong Province is negotiating with Canadian Northern Telecommunications Co. on cooperative projects. Wu, 56 years old and a senior engineer of telecommunications, was appointed minister of posts and telecommunications last year.
