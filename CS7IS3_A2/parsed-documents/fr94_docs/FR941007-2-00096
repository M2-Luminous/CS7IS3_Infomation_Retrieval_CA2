The certification notice was published in the Federal Register on November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59492). The certification was amended on August 11, 1994 to include Rowan Bay Logging in Sitka, Alaska. At the request of the State Agency, the Department again reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. New findings show that the Wrangell Sawmill Division is owned by the Alaska Pulp Corporation and a substantial portion of the production at Wrangell consisted of wood chips which are integrated into the production of wood pulp at the Alaska Pulp Corporation In Sitka, Alaska. The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports. Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to include the Wrangell Sawmill Division in Wrangell, Alaska.
