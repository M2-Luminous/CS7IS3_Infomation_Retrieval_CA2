According to him, Moscow welcomes the statement by the chairman of the U.N. Security Council, which urges Pyongyang to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to conclude its inspections in North Korea in accordance with the agreement reached between them on February 15th. "Russia views the statement, which was adopted by consensus, as a timely action reflecting the world community's concern about the situation connected with the North Korean nuclear problem. We hope that Pyongyang will pay due attention to the recommendations given in the statement," he said. ...AND DISMISSES THE ALLEGATIONS THAT LARGE CONSIGNMENT OF RUSSIAN TANKS WAS DELIVERED TO CHINA As Karasin said, "the allegations that a large consignment of T-80 tanks was delivered to China from Russia are absolutely groundless." According to the diplomat, "the development of military- technical ties between Russia and China is a normal component of their relationship." Such ties "are effectuated through state structures and under appropriate control." "In the area of military equipment deliveries to China, Russia observes the generally-accepted principles of transparence, including the despatch of the necessary data to the U.N. Conventional Weapons Register," said the spokesman for Russia's Foreign Ministry.
