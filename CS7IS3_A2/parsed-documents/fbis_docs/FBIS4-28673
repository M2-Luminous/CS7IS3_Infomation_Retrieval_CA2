FBIS4-28673 "dreas113_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-113 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 North Korea Blames `Unreasonable Sanctions' Blames `Unreasonable Sanctions' SK1306154594 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1531 GMT 13 Jun 94 SK1306154594 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry in a statement today said the DPRK Foreign Ministry has been authorized to declare a countermeasure on the unreasonable "sanctions" taken by the IAEA against the DPRK and, moreover, on its insolent attempt to intrude even into military sites of the DPRK. The statement says: Firstly, we will immediately withdraw from the IAEA. We will consider invalid all the unreasonable "resolutions" adopted by the agency with regard to our issue up until now and will not be bound to any rules or resolutions of the agency hereafter. Secondly, we declare that the inspections for the continuity of safeguards which we have accepted in our unique status will no longer be allowed. Any unreasonable inspection can never be allowed till it has been decided whether we return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or completely withdraw from it. Hence, the agency's inspectors now will have nothing to do any further in our country. Thirdly, we strongly reaffirm our position that UN "sanctions" will be regarded immediately as a declaration of war. "Sanctions" and dialogue are incompatible. It is our inevitable option to counter expanded "sanctions" by hostile forces with expanded self-defence measures. This stand of ours will never change until our nuclear issue has been solved fairly through dialogue and negotiation. We will keenly watch the development of the situation in the days ahead.
