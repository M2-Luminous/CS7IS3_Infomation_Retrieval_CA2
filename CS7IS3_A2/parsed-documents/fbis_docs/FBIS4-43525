The Twelve in principle favor expansion to the east, but the Union's difficulties are forcing them to delay its implementation, even if this means accumulating risks and resentments. Politics? It is the object of Jirina Hinnerova's ridicule. Like all Slovakian youth, she retains an exalted memory of the events of the autumn of 1989. "We were all in the street demanding that the government resign," she says. The Berlin Wall was coming down, and the Iron Curtain was parting all the way from Budapest and Bucharest to Prague and Warsaw. "We did not know much about Europe and the West, but we thought everything would go forward rapidly," the young Slovakian woman recalls today. Five years later, Jirina has succumbed to skepticism. "Nothing has really changed where the economy is concerned," she says. "We will have to wait another two or three years to join the European Union." That may be a self-gratifying illusion, inasmuch as the member states--which following the Copenhagen summit in June 1993 embraced the principle of a greater Europe--expect that it will be at least another 10 years before the countries of Central and East Europe join the EU. Although Germany is seeking to accelerate the process, the consensus is to proceed slowly. This cautiousness, however, could prove to be disastrous, because the opening to the East is an urgent necessity for the continent as a whole. It goes without saying that the opening to the East is an urgent necessity for the countries involved. Weakened by the transition that is taking place in their respective economies, they are also worried about the resurgence of Russian imperialism and about the problems of ethnic minorities inside their own borders, given that the end of the Cold War has revealed many wounds that have not completely healed. They view an accelerated rapprochement with the EU as a means to obtain the guarantees they need. "Why add partners who are so different from us, when we already have difficulty managing a 12-nation Union?" the EU "realists" counter--but they are forgetting three things. First of all, EU membership for the countries of the East--from Lithuania to Romania--is the concept cited at the very beginning of the preamble to the Treaty of Rome. Second, Europe encouraged these countries to rid themselves of Soviet tutelage and therefore can hardly play the role of a Pontius Pilate today. "In 1989 we aroused a feeling of euphoria in these countries," notes Pierre Lellouche, diplomatic adviser to Jacques Chirac and a fervent advocate of the rapid integration of the countries of East Europe. "We no longer have the time to play legal games," he explains. Lastly, the EU's opening to the East represents an insurance policy for Europe itself--provided it is not delayed, because the opportunity that arose in 1989 with the collapse of the Berlin Wall could one day be lost, inasmuch as Poles, Czechs, Hungarians, and Balts perceive the Russian threat to be much greater than we do. Moreover, the threat of an economic recession would inevitably exasperate the problems of minorities and therefore provoke a demographic afflux to the West that is in fact just over the horizon. "In any event, we shall either integrate the East politically or integrate it demographically," says Patrick Devedjian, RPR [Rally for the Republic] deputy and mayor of Antony, who is one of the most active parliamentary supporters of the concept of Greater Europe. The opening to the East is also a factor for stability, in that it represents an economic opportunity for the Union--a market of 70 million to 100 million consumers to satisfy; a market for the rebuilding of factories; and a geographically proximate area whose capacity for imports is growing more rapidly than its ability to export. "In less than one generation," Patrick Devedjian concludes, "the problems relating to adaptation will be solved and these countries will become new markets. We have the opportunity to open our doors to new markets that we can win and that are culturally close to us. Let us aid these markets." There remains the question of how to aid them. The obstacles encountered during the negotiations for expanding the Union to include the Scandinavian countries and Austria--which are prosperous and democratic nations--bear witness to the resistance to be overcome. "Europe must be prepared to cease being a club [preceding word in English] of rich people," Pierre Lellouche warns. Quite frankly, a Europe consisting of 20 or more countries will be unable to function on the model conceived by the signatories of the Treaty of Rome. Not just the economic, institutional, and political aspects but the entire complex of Community mechanisms is in danger of flying into pieces, thereby putting an end to a very French concept of European integration. Conscious of the sacrifices to be made and the disputes to be resolved, Europe is moving forward hesitantly. Are its fears justified? In the economic area, it is doubtful that these fears are justified. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the countries of the East would probably not be the only beneficiaries of a free-trade zone. As exporters these countries are lightweights, inasmuch as they account for less than 4 percent of Community imports. For the immediate future, no tidal wave of exports from the region is expected to occur, because the EU is already taking between 50 and 75 percent of its exports, which--for a broad range of products--still come into conflict with Western quality standards. Although the East's sales to the West jumped 56 percent between 1988 and 1992, trade in the other direction registered an even sharper rise of almost 90 percent. The EU--which in 1990 recorded a trade deficit of 957 million ecus with the East--posted a surplus of more than 4 billion ecus for the first three quarters of 1993. In the case of France, the trade balance went from a deficit of 245 million ecus in 1989 to a surplus of 650 million in 1992. This imbalance, however, was nothing extraordinary: deprived of Western products ever since 1945, the consumers and manufacturers of the East are making up for lost time. "The balance is so heavily in our favor that it is becoming almost awkward," a European official acknowledges. At Bercy [Finance Ministry], the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry], and Brussels it is emphasized that the association agreements have already brought progress. Signed between 1991 and 1993, they have made it possible to ease trade restrictions with a view to creating a free-trade zone five to 10 years from now. Unfortunately, these agreements do not cover certain sectors that are vital for the countries of Central Europe but that are "sensitive" sectors for the West--the agricultural sector (which is totally excluded except for a few concessions) and the textile, clothing, and steel sectors, for which additional time is allowed for implementation--and fail to include clauses that would provide safeguards and antidumping restrictions. These sectors are indeed vital for the countries of the East, inasmuch as they account for 40 percent of the East's exports to the West. Indignant at being accused of practicing a form of "disguised protectionism," the Commission counters that Europe has made efforts that are unmatched by the other developed countries. In private, however, the opening is acknowledged in Brussels to have been a modest one. In 1991--when the association agreements were being prepared--the commissioner then in charge of the dossier, Frans Andriessen, tried unsuccessfully to obtain a more generous mandate. The Opening Would Require an Additional 45 Billion Ecus for the Structural Funds This is a sensitive issue among the various national constituencies, especially in France. First of all, the countries of the East frighten European farmers. "Even though they do not compete with us today, they are potential rivals in markets that are saturated," explains former Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume. However, was not the end of French agriculture predicted when the negotiations for Spain's admission to the Community were taking place, whereas Spain has actually become a market for--and net importer of--agricultural products? Employment has become another cause for concern, because of the relocations to the East that are feared by Senator Jean Arthuis. It has not been proved conclusively, however, that the balance in respect to employment is unfavorable for the West. A study made by the economist Claude Vimont concludes that trade relations with the countries of East Europe translate into a positive balance in terms of jobs. While acknowledging the effort at adaptation that is necessary, UDF [French Democratic Union] Deputy Willy Dimeglio argued in a recent report that these relocations will not lead to a loss of jobs in France, because the companies that are currently involved in relocation are maintaining and developing activities in France which have a high added value. The financial and institutional questions are considerably more sensitive. If the EU opens up to the countries of the East, it will have to revise its operations and its policies from top to bottom. The structural funds--which are dedicated to the development of disadvantaged regions--would require a trifling 45 billion additional ecus per year. That would break the European budget, which has already reached 73.5 billion ecus in 1994. All in all, the European Commission believes that the budget for the structural funds and for the Common Agricultural Policy would have to be doubled if the countries of the East were to be allowed the same criteria for aid as those granted to the countries of southern Europe. Are the member states prepared to make such a financial outlay? Although the Germans are the ones most agreeable to the opening, they complain that they are putting too much into Europe's common pot at a time when the rebuilding of their new laender has not yet been completed. The solution--which would entail the exclusion of the newest members from the aid provisions--is politically unfeasible. The expansion accordingly involves a proportional reduction in the amounts of the structural fund packages, in order to make room for the newcomers without overloading the boat. Spain, Portugal, and Greece--which are major beneficiaries of the Community's ecus--remain to be convinced. The threat of a paralysis of the European institutions may be even more difficult to avert. "Already, with 16 member states, just going around the table will take at least 3 hours," an adviser to Edouard Balladur emphasizes. In order to work with 20 states, the Europeans will be unable to limit themselves to remedies that are merely cosmetic. The entire complex of decision-making mechanisms will have to be revised, but the expansion now under way has already given rise to disputes over the respective powers of the large and the small countries. Strengthening the authority of the European Commission would inevitably complicate the problem. Aware of the difficulties, the Twelve would rather push back the deadlines. To be sure, initiatives designed to prepare for the rapprochement are being presented. The Commission has given the former Socialist minister of agriculture, Henri Nallet, the task of preparing a report on the Common Agricultural Policy vis-a-vis the countries of the East. The Phare aid program should undergo a lifting [preceding word in English] and be endowed with a mechanism for investment and training. It is also a matter of associating--in the near future--the countries of the East with certain common policies on energy, communications, transportation, and the environment. The real difficulties, however, will not be attacked until 1996, the date of the intergovernmental conference that is on the Maastricht calendar. Preoccupied with the applications of the Scandinavian countries and Austria, the Twelve are--for the present--satisfied to take temporary expedients. The final difficulty is the security problem. Desirous of joining NATO, the countries of East Europe have had to be patient and accept the concept of Partnership for Peace, for want of anything better. Disappointed, these countries are turning toward Europe in the hope of obtaining a place within the Western European Union (WEU), the future military wing of West Europe. "No responsible government is ready to accept their total admission to the WEU," is the off-the-record comment at the Quai d'Orsay. Explanation: the WEU provides for automatic intervention in the event of aggression against one of its members. Are the French or the Italians ready to die for Riga? By way of a response, the Twelve are suggesting to the countries of the East that they accept the status of WEU "associates." It is a symbolic decision that imposes no obligation. Still another European initiative is the conference on stability that will be held in Paris from 26 to 27 May. It will bring together the foreign ministers from East Europe and the Baltic states, with the intention of promoting good-neighborly relations among them. According to one of Edouard Balladur's advisers, the conference should be the occasion for a strong political signal, provided it is followed by negotiations. In the final analysis, however, West Europe's responses with respect to security do not meet the East's expectations. "We will of course participate in all the initiatives that the Union sends our way," a Polish diplomat comments, "but what we want are guarantees." In other words, what they want are the rules of the game, and a timetable. West Europe coolly calculates that the negotiations for WEU membership cannot begin before the end of the century. "We backed into the East European case," says Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of the Center for International Public Opinion and Information Research (CEPII). "There is a lack of imagination and a lack of political will," adds the East Europe expert Jacques Rupnik, who is disturbed at the wave of disillusion currently sweeping over these countries. The proposal that the Community has made to the countries of East Europe to the effect that they strengthen their mutual ties within a framework of regional cooperation cannot satisfy them; they are afraid not only of forming a new CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] but also of creating a purgatory that would indefinitely delay their entry into the EU. Given these commercial, financial, and political constraints, could Europe move any more rapidly? No, its leaders reply, for they seem to believe they have all the time in the world to take action. By burying their heads in the sand, however, the Twelve risk being overtaken by history and forced to make agonizing reappraisals without having had time to prepare for them. [Box, p 65] Reciprocal Trade in Textiles East Europe's share of the West European clothing market rose to 13.3 percent in 1992 from 8.8 percent in 1989. France's trade balance with the East in the clothing sector continues to show a large deficit (of more than 1.5 billion francs [Fr] in 1992), but this deficit is partially compensated by our favorable trade balance of more than Fr500 million in the sector of textile products that are used in the manufacture of clothing. This phenomenon is the same in all of the countries of West Europe, because in order to profit from the reduced customs duties the East European manufacturers must in practice use EU textiles. Georges Jolles, president of the Union of Textile Industries, is also not overly worried. "In our view," he says, "it is a less serious threat than that posed by the Asian countries. We will suffer if these [East European] countries do not genuinely open their markets, but if they do, the relocations will be a positive factor and will enable us to sell more products that have a high added value." [Box, p 66] Brussels Redoubles Its Vigilance With Respect to Steel The customs barriers against the steel products of the East European countries will come down in 1996. The entry of these new suppliers into a market that is increasingly open disturbs those Community steel producers who are fully involved in restructuring. Trade in steel has benefited the East European countries, inasmuch as their trade surplus rose from 382 million ecus in 1988 to 817 million in 1992. The competitive prices of these countries are frightening. "How can they justify steel prices that are 30 percent below those of the market?" asks Francis Mer, the PDG [CEO] of Usinor-Sacilor. Mer says the real costs of production (transportation, energy, and raw materials) are not factored into the price of their steel. Brussels has not remained insensitive to the calls for help from its steelmakers, and penalties were assessed in 1992 against steel from Czechoslovakia. For even though customs duties are being lowered, the Community has recourse to clauses that provide safeguards--and antidumping clauses--with which to defend itself. Above all, however, it is the volumes of trade involved that should reassure the steel producers, for only 4 percent of all steel imported by the Twelve comes from the East European countries.
