Established on 14 December 1990, under a law adopted by Parliament, Romania's Supreme Council of Defense assumed responsibility to analyze the state of national security and to approve organizational structures and rules on the functioning of the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI]. The council gathers the country's president, the prime minister, and several members of the executive (the defense minister, the minister of the interior, the foreign minister, and so on,) the head of the president's political analysis department, the director of the SRI, the chief of the Foreign Information Department [DIE], and the chief of general staff. The document elaborated by the Supreme Council of Defense views as domestic risk factors "a negative influence that the lack of national political consensus can have on major issues confronting Romania," "the lack of will to solve conflicting interests between various social groups to the national interest and in a democratic manner," as well as the decline in production, the devaluation of the national currency, the budget deficit, the high rate of inflation, the growing rate of unemployment, and so on. "Even if the risk of a foreign armed aggression has considerably diminished, threats are still persisting generated by pressure and foreign interference directed against Romania's sovereignty, independence, integrity, and territorial unity," the document reads. The supreme council's document enumerates among the external risk factors: The losing of several traditional markets and sources of strategic raw materials, the emergence of preferential areas of financial and commercial influence, signs of revisionism, attempts to approach the issue of the borders, higher pressure and actions from abroad having in view the granting of collective rights to national minorities, tendencies favoring artificial self-rule in several areas on ethnic criteria, the uncertain evolution of the situation in the former Soviet territories, the expansion of the conflict in the territory of former Yugoslavia, and so on. The chapter titled National Security Strategy stipulates that "Romania has its own military potential for the military defense of the country." The defense of national interests is ensured "by its own forces," but "political, economic, and military support coming from states or international bodies supporting its cause would be welcome." The document reads that "the Romanian state is viewing no state as potential enemy," pointing out that under no circumstances Romania is to be the first to start military action and shall not allow use of its force for such actions.
