FR940405-1-00067 FR940405-1-00013 Work breaks and meals at work were the work activities most closely associated with ETS exposure, 51% and 35% respectively versus 27% for work per se [Ex. 4&hyph;271]. In other words, nonsmokers experienced ETS exposure in break areas more than in general work areas. When white collar versus blue collar workplaces were compared, 37% of factories/plants versus 22% of offices had episodes of ETS exposure, suggesting that blue collar nonsmoking workers have a greater exposure to ETS than white collar workers. For the CAP population, twice as many workers were employed in offices as were in factories [Ex. 4&hyph;271]. The most ETS exposed nonsmokers were those with 10 or more hours per day of work (especially at plants/factories), more than 2 hours per day of restaurant time, and more than 1 hour per day of bar or nightclub time. Robinson et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;271] concluded that the probability of passive smoking is highest for a combination of various social and work activities, consistent with the notion that activities that involve more people involve a greater chance of contact with people who smoke. A limitation of the CAP survey is that the data do not provide information on the intensity of exposure in the various microenvironments [Ex. 4&hyph;271]. In summary, the CAP study showed that the most powerful predictor of potential exposure to ETS was being employed. Respondents who spent more than ten hours a day at the workplace were found to report more ETS exposure than those working less than 10 hours a day or not at all. Further data from this study show that the workplace is the location with the highest reported exposure to ETS in enclosed environments, and such exposure is on average nearly three times more prevalent at work than at home. Another relevant data source for assessing ETS exposure in the workplace is the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In its Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NHIS-HPDP) supplement, CDC collected self-reported information on smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. population [Ex. 4&hyph;51]. The results suggest that at least 19% of employed nonsmokers experience ETS exposure at work. The CDC study results represent the prevalence of occupational exposure among nonsmoking adults [see section IV for further discussion of this study]. In a smaller study, Cummings et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;67] studied the prevalence of exposure to ETS in 663 (44% male) never- and exsmokers aged 18&hyph;84 years, who attended a cancer clinic in Buffalo, New York in 1986 (see Table IV&hyph;9). The study employed questionnaires and analysis of urinary cotinine levels. The subjects were asked if they were exposed to passive smoke either at home or at work in the four days preceding the interview. A further analysis of this data focusing on workers from this survey determined that overall, 339 subjects were currently employed. Of these 264 (77%) reported ETS exposure at work. The percentage of subjects exposed to ETS at both work and the home was 29% (n=99). The percentage of subjects exposed at home, but not at work was 7% (n=23). The percentage of subjects exposed at work, but not at home was 49% (n=165). The percentage of subjects exposed neither at home or work was 15% (n=52). This further analysis indicates that the workplace is a significant source of ETS exposure for nonsmoking, employed people. Emmons et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;98] reported on a study of 186 nonsmoking volunteers from workplace settings selected to have a wide range of exposure to ETS. The subjects were asked to keep a 7-day exposure diary. The worksites ranged from those with minimal restrictions and high levels of exposure (long-term care and psychiatric facilities, chemical dependency and treatment centers, and a VA Hospital) to those with extensive restrictions and low exposure (e.g., state health department and community hospitals). Seventy-six percent of the subjects reported being regularly exposed to ETS in the workplace. The percentage of subjects reporting exposure at work is similar to that found by Cummings et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;67]. Nonsmokers encountered significantly more exposure to ETS at work (50%) as compared to home (10%). When the data set was examined by the presence or absence of smokers in the home, however, subjects who lived with smokers had virtually equivalent exposures across all three settings: work (34%), home (36%), and ``other'' (31%). Nonsmokers living with smokers received 29 minutes per day of exposure at work and 31 minutes per day at home and 27 minutes per day in other settings. On the other hand, subjects who did not live with smokers had the majority of their exposure at work (36 minutes per day) and very little at other settings. Additional studies verify that the workplace is an important source of exposure to ETS, particularly for nonsmokers unexposed at home [Exs. 4&hyph;172, 4&hyph;262, 4&hyph;315]. A U.K. study of exposure to ETS in 20 nonsmoking men whose wives smoked showed that 78% of the men's reported hours of exposure came from outside the home; by contrast, 90% of the ETS exposure of 101 nonsmoking men whose wives did not smoke was reported to come from non-domestic microenvironments [Ex. 4&hyph;315]. Repace and Lowrey [Ex. 4&hyph;262] estimated that 86% of the U.S. population was exposed to ETS, and that the workplace was more important than the home as a source of ETS exposure, when weighted by the duration, exposure intensity, and probability of exposure. Kabat and Wynder [Ex. 4&hyph;172], in a study of 215 sixty-year-old U.S. women nonsmokers, found that 65% reported exposure to ETS at home and 67% reported exposure at work, averaged over adulthood. The conclusion that can be made from the activity surveys is that the workplace is a major location of ETS-exposure to nonsmokers. Human activities that involve contact with a greater number of people increase the probability of contact with smokers, and thus with ETS. These studies indicate that the workplace, with its high person densities relative to other microenvironments, including the home, appears to be a major factor in the working nonsmoking population's ETS exposure.
