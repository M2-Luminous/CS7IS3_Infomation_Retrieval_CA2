"For this reason, I hope the political state of Japan stabilizes as soon as possible," Kim said in an interview with the ASAHI SHIMBUN at Chongwadae (the presidential office) in Seoul. China firmly opposes North Korea's possession of nuclear arms, Kim said, citing talks with Jiang Zemin during his visit to Beijing last month. Noting the military threat posed by North Korea cannot be overlooked, he said Seoul and Washington are prepared to act under any circumstances. However, he told the Japanese vernacular daily that there are no signs of an imminent North Korean attack. "The foreign media's reporting on tension on the Korean peninsula is too exaggerated to some extent," he added. Kim said Washington would not make a decision on the North Korean nuclear issue and announce it without consulting him first. He said he anticipated substantial results at the upcoming North Korean-U.S. working-level negotiations. "North Korea wants better relations with the United States to escape from its economic straits, but the United States is unlikely to agree unless full nuclear inspections are complied with," he told ASAHI. He noted that China can influence North Korea more than any other country but does not want to unnecessarily provoke its communist ally. "But China holds the firm position that North Korea absolutely should not have nuclear arms and I think its stance is stronger than any other country in the world," he said. Kim said he hoped to see the Japanese political situation soon return to normal as the Seoul-Washington-Tokyo front was very important in blocking North Korea's nuclear program. During his summit in Toyko last month, Kim said, former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had told him that Japan did not wish to seek a permanent seat on the UN Security Council at present, but would support Seoul's bid for a non-permanent seat in 1996. He predicted that North Korean leader Kim Il-song was unlikely to attend the United Nations General Assembly session in New York this fall. "Time is on our side, not on North Korea's side. I believe an inter-Korean summit will take place naturally some day," he said, adding that Seoul would not approach Pyongyang first.
