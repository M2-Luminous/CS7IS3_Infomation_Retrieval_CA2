Most likely, the Federation Council and Duma will hold separate sessions on that day. A presidential administration spokesman has told INTERFAX that the Federation Council and State Duma Organizing Committees, led by Vladimir Shumeyko and Sergey Filatov, will submit to Yeltsin shortly their recommendations on how parliamentary sessions should be held. Their guidelines will make up the basis of an appropriate instruction. Duma is due to meet in the former building of the Mayor's Office on New Arbat, 36, and the Federation Council -- in the former Russian Press House on Bolshaya Dmitrovka, 26.
