FBIS4-27103 "dreas104_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 29 May 1994 North Korea Comments on Country's `Unique Status' on NPT Comments on Country's `Unique Status' on NPT SK2905084994 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0840 GMT 29 May 94 SK2905084994 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Attempt of Seditious Force To Undermine DPRK's Unique Status"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) -- The Russian ambassador to South Korea, Kunadze, recently contended that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea "must observe all its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], since it is its signatory." Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says that Kunadze and others who view the matter this way are, without exception, persons who ignore hard facts, swayed by prejudice. The analyst says: The DPRK Government decided to withdraw from the NPT on March 12, 1993, according to paragraph 1, article 10 of the treaty to defend the supreme interests of the state. Later, it temporarily suspended the effectuation of this withdrawal. It is a political commitment we made to the United States for the sake of the DPRK-U.S. talks and it does not mean our return to the treaty. Therefore, we are not under obligation to fulfill the treaty as its signatory. Practically, we have undergone only an inspection suited to our status following the temporary suspension of the effectuation of our withdrawal from the treaty on June 11, 1993. Our unique status has been recognized by the United States and the secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency. In actuality, the world recognizes our unique status. To ignore our unique status and refuse to reconize it is motivated by the sinister purpose of creating the impression that we remain in the treaty with a full status, not using the word of return to it, and thus finding a pretext of interference and pressure and stifling our Republic. And Kunadze has joined in it, we dare say. We cannot but pay a special attention to the fact that the clamor for denying our special status timed to coincide with the refueling at our 5 megawatt experimental atomic power station. Our unique status is not dissolved, even if some quarters deny and refuse to recognize it. This unique status is not what we wanted, but was imposed on us by the United States and the agency. We do not intend to maintain the unique status forever. It will be dissolved when DPRK-U.S. talks open and a package solution is achieved.
