FBIS3-29049 "dreas031_d_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-031 Document Type:Daily Report 15 Feb 1994 South Korea Dailies Comment on North Korean Nuclear Issue SK1502115494 SK1502115494 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Local vernacular dailies on 15 February carry articles discussing the North Korean stance in connection with its nuclear issue with the 21 February International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Board of Governors meeting approaching, which reportedly would lead to referring the issue to the UN Security Council and then to sanctions on North Korea by the UN Security Council. The conservative CHOSON ILBO on 15 February carries on page 4 a 1,000-word article by Ottawa-based correspondent Pak Tu-sik entitled "North Korean Nuclear Issue Heading for the UN Security Council--China and Japan Openly Revealing Their Intention of Seeking Practical Profit." The article refers to the remark made by Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa at the U.S.-Japanese summit talks held in Washington on 11 February. He is quoted as saying: "If the North Korean nuclear issue is referred to the UN Security Council, Japan will cooperate with the United Nations within the scope that our local laws permit." The article notes that Japan's attitude in attaching a string to the issue suggests that Japan is seeking a reward for its cooperation with the United Nations in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue. The article then notes the Chinese position of delaying the UN Security Council's moves toward resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and says, "China makes it clear that China does not want the UN Security Council to take up the issue directly. China may not want the North Korean nuclear issue to be referred to the United Nations, which may well create a crisis near China and expose the Chinese position to the judgment of the international arena. Meanwhile, it is also true that China regards the present situation as a golden opportunity to expand its influence on the Sino-U.S. relations and on the Korean peninsula." The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 15 February carries on page 2 a 600-word article dispatched by reporter Chong Pyong-chin from Washington in the "Reporter's Eye" column entitled "Facsimile Dispatched by Ho Chong." The article notes two different pieces of North Korean reactions reaching the ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's Washington field camp dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue around noon on 13 February [EST], one being the North Korean NODONG SINMUN and Central Broadcast's bellicose warning "We will regard any sanctions and pressure on Korea as an act of war provocation," and the North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman's negotiation-seeking comment "The U.S. Government should make clear its correct position toward the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks." The article notes that Ho Chong, North Korean representative to the United Nations, sent facsimile of the latter, namely, the North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman's comment, to the news agencies and even to the residences of correspondents from around the world in Washington. The article notes that North Korea did not show such a kindness for the former, namely, the NODONG SINMUN and the Central Broadcast's warning. The article concludes, "We may be able to discern the North Korean `nuclear strategy' from the behavior of the North Korean UN mission distributing door to door the `proposal aimed at negotiation,' instead of the `warning,' with the deadline for the UN Security Council decision on sanctions approaching only several days away, timing it with the ROK foreign minister's visit to the United States." The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 15 February carries on page 5 a 1,300-word article by Ottawa-based correspondent Chong Pyong-chin entitled "What Is the True Intent of the North Korean Foreign Ministry Spokesman's Comment--North Korea Tries To Get Open Confirmation of Its Behind-the-Scenes Agreement With the United States." The article notes the meaning of the North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman's comment issued on 12 February and says: "the ROK and the United States regard it as the North Korean proposal that the United States confirm the secretive and intermittent exchange of views between the United States and North Korea." The article goes on to note the remarks by an ROK Government official who accompanied Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu on his visit to the United States, who is quoted as saying: "We think that North Korea openly asked for the card which the ROK and the United States was going to present. This seems to be the North Korean intention of leading the situation positively rather than negatively." The article then notes, "North Korea is, in fact, asking the United States to help North Korea establish its justification for its own people at home, in allowing the IAEA inspection team to visit North Korea, that the inspection team could come to North Korea because of its own good will" rather than being forced by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty obligations. The article also notes that North Korea wants to have the U.S.-North Korean behind-the-scenes exchange of views notarized so that it can secure the anticipated fruits if the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks are held." The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 15 February carries on page 5 a 900- word article by reporter Yu Sung-u entitled "Why Is North Korea So Indecisive Between Hardline and Dialogue?--Hardline and Moderate Negotiation Strategy Utilizing Time Before International Sanctions." The article notes the background behind North Korea's sending two different messages one after the other in connection with its nuclear issue, that is, while it maintained a stiff stance for some time on the nuclear inspection by the IAEA, North Korea hinted on the possibility of resolving the issue through dialogue at the last minute. The article notes, "Some North Korean watchers believe that North Korea takes this position because it thinks there is still some time left before actual sanctions are taken." The article then notes the opinion of another group of watchers that says that "North Korean President Kim Il-song may have tentatively taken back the authority on diplomacy and economy from his son Kim Chong-il to institute the authority himself. This may have caused the issuance of the apparently conflicting messages." The article notes the opinion of yet another group of watchers that says "North Korea is trying to fully use the time before the actual sanctions are taken," because it could still use the double tactic of negotiation of hawk and dove before the sanctions can actually produce effects. The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 4 an 800-word article entitled "The Last U.S. Persuasion To the North" by correspondent Nam Chan-sun from Washington. The article reports that the United States is making its final persuasive move through the North Korean mission in the United Nations and the PRC is also doing everything possible to join the effort to persuade North Korea. The article reports that such persuasive efforts are based on the analysis that North Korea values the clue for dialogue [taehwaui pulssi] as has been revealed through the remarks of a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman on 12 February. The article notes the fact that most conditions except one or two were agreed upon between North Korea and the IAEA and that the ROK foreign minister's "appeal" during his recent U.S. visit encouraged the United States to continue to be persuasive. The article notes that "the persuasion does not mean any more concession but is focused on having North Korea realize the situation after the nuclear issue is referred to the UN Security Council." The article reports that the ROK Government is criticized for having weakened the "stick character" of the persuasion by announcing that it will continue dialogue with Pyongyang even after the North Korean nuclear issue is referred to the UN Security Council. The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 4 a 1,200-word article by correspondent Yang Sung-hyon from Ottawa. Comparing the two communications made by North Korea on 12 February--the hardline toned NODONG SINMUN commentary and the moderate remarks of a Foreign Ministry spokesman--the article reports that the government analyzes the former as "for domestic use" targeting the hard-liners and public opinion inside North Korea, and the latter as a message to the international community. The article analyzes that "ROK Foreign Minister Han's visit to the United States provided North Korea with a pretext for changing its direction" and adds that government officials believe there is a great possibility that North Korean working-level officials reported such moves of the ROK and the United States as an "achievement of the Republic's demand." The article notes that it is still too early to be optimistic because the United State and the IAEA have yet to assess North Korea's true intentions and North Korea has to confirm with the IAEA if the IAEA's expression of "inspections for the continuity of safeguards" coincides with North Korea's demands. The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 700-word entitled "Attention on North Korea's Last Nuclear Card" by correspondent Yi Sung-chol from Ottawa. The article notes that ROK and U.S. officials agree that North Korea will soon suggest the resumption of dialogue with the United States and that the attention is focused on when and what the contents will be. The article quotes an ROK Government official as saying: "Analyzing the 12 February remarks of the North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman, North Korea is focusing on facilitating pretexts rather than insisting on their demands." The article reports the official also added that North Korea has finally realized that it is impossible for the United States to pressure IAEA more to ease inspection conditions. The article reports the ROK and U.S. authorities are discussing the optimum level of pretexts available to the expected demands from North Korea. As to the timing, the article reports that related officials expect North Korea will request the United States to hold a dialogue on 19 February at the latest and that a high-ranking ROK Government official expects that the IAEA's resolution to refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council will be adopted on 23 February. The article reports the ROK and U.S. Governments are studying countermeasures based on three assumptions before 19 February: First, when North Korea expresses its willingness to accept nuclear inspections; Second, when the nuclear inspections begin; Third, when no agreement is reached. The article reports that an ROK Government authority said if North Korea agrees to accept nuclear inspection, there is a great possibility that the United Nations will adopt a resolution to impose sanctions with a deadline for nuclear inspections.
