It elected the new SOU [Ukrainian Officers Union] chairman -- Major General Roy, approved the composition of structural bodies, and introduced changes to the statutes. Our correspondent had a conversation with delegates of the congress -- Ivan Merinchyk, chairman of the oblast organization of the Ukrainian Officers' Union; and Mykola Kadrashchuk, chairman of the SOU Committee for the Military and Patriotic Indoctrination of Young People. [Vivchar] Lately, much pressure has been exerted upon the Ukrainian Officers' Union and patriotically minded servicemen. This found its expression in the replacement of Defense Minister Kostyantyn Morozov, who supported the SOU, and in accusations that the Union was involved in political activity. [Answer] National chauvinist forces in parliament, headed by such notorious figures as Marchenko, Moroz, Charodyeyev, Izmalkov, and others, are doing everything that they can to discredit the SOU and mainly to eliminate it or, at least, to isolate officers on active service from it. What is their goal? To prevent the establishment of an independent Ukrainian state through the building of strong armed forces. As long as intentions are announced and declarations are made, our opponents are still ready to listen to them. However, as soon as specific steps are made toward their implementation, the entire communist gang immediately goes into opposition. Over the time of its activity, the SOU has returned to Ukraine more than 10,000 Ukrainian officers and has prevented the removal of military property worth billions of U.S. dollars from the state. It conducts a relentless struggle against those who do not like the idea of building strong national armed forces. [Vivchar] The SOU was also against the signing by President Kravchuk of the Massandra agreements with Russia.... [Answer] Yes, we supported Defense Minister Morozov's position regarding those actions. Nobody has any doubt that this person is a patriot who did everything to enable our young state to have a strong army, based upon national principles and the interests of an independent Ukraine. Morozov opposed the creation of a military alliance, resembling the Warsaw Pact, among the CIS countries. At that time, the idea failed. By removing Morozov from his post as defense minister, these chauvinist forces are planning to draw Ukraine into a new military alliance. [Vivchar] How did the congress proceed? [Answer] Let us point out that the destructive forces did everything that they could to undermine its work. For example, it was only at the last moment that delegates representing the regular army were allowed to attend the congress. The atmosphere that prevailed at the congress was one of unity regarding ways of building up the Ukrainian Army and state and emerging from the economic crisis. The participation of the SOU in the Supreme Council elections was also discussed. It was proposed that the Officers' Union consolidate its ties with parties and movements of the democratic bloc, so that in the case of a threat to the independence of our state, a single front could be formed, not ruling out the revival of the UPA [the Ukrainian Insurrection Army]. These ideas were mainly expressed by delegates from eastern regions of our state and were approved by guests of the congress, including representatives of Russian Cossackdom and Cossacks from other CIS countries, who stated their support for the struggle of the Ukrainian people for Ukrainian independence. [Vivchar] The congress expressed a readiness to participate in the forthcoming elections? [Answer] Yes, the SOU will nominate its candidates in all the regions of Ukraine. It has called upon all citizens to take part in the elections and to elect to parliament people who will be able to extricate Ukraine from the crisis and to build up our state. Representatives from the army are needed there. For example, a tank that has no equal in the world was designed and tested in Ukraine. For a whole year, the Cabinet of Ministers did not find it possible to make a single step toward manufacturing this machine and equipping the army with it. Ukraine is destroying and scrapping tanks, and, at the same time, the government refuses to sell them to other countries. Instead, Russia is now selling them. This deal would have earned our state the hard currency that we need so badly: By selling 100 tanks, we would have obtained that same $175 million that we are now begging from the United States. [Vivchar] Such a policy also prevails in aircraft building, space technology, and missile building. It is high time that order were established in the state and something were done in the interests of the people, instead of picturing us before the world as beggars and turning us into genuine paupers. It follows from everything that there exist influential forces that want, at any price, to bring Ukraine to its knees, so that we will again ask "Big Brother" to be our guardian. [Answer] This is precisely what the Officers' Union is trying to prevent. Had the power structures, starting from the president and the government, fought for their own state and against anti-Ukrainian forces in the Crimea and in other regions with the same ardor as they struggle against the SOU, we would by now have definitely made serious steps toward our statehood and independence. However, despite everything, nobody will manage to eliminate the Officers' Union, split it up, or divert it from its goals. The decisions adopted by the recent congress confirm this. The SOU is again ready to defend Ukraine.
