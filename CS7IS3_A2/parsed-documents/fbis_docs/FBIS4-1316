FBIS4-1316 "drafr080_cs94014" FBIS-AFR-94-080-S Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Voting Material Said Arriving Late Voting Material Said Arriving Late MB2604103094 Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network in English 1000 GMT 26 Apr 94 MB2604103094 Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network English BFN [From the "Newsbrief" program] [Text] Voting at various polling stations has not gone as smoothly as intended. The latest on the conducting of special voting in the Northern Transvaal is that voting materials are being delivered to polling stations in drips and drabs. District voting officials have complained that voting material, such as ballot papers and marking ink, are being delivered at random and at the wrong points. Meanwhile, the situation at several polling stations in Natal is reported to be chaotic. A short while ago officials at Newcastle appeared to have no idea where their ballot papers and equipment were. And in Durban's Wentworth hospital no votes were cast a few hours after the official starting time. The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] ascribed part of the delay to a sit-in in its offices last night by members of a voter education organization. The IEC says it will try to iron out all of the problems today to ensure a smooth run tomorrow.
