It indicates that compared to the poll conducted in May, support for Workers Party candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has dropped by 5 points. His support dropped from 41 percent to 36 percent, but the votes lost by Lula have not been absorbed by any of his main rivals. Support for Fernando Henrique Cardoso, of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, remains at 17 percent and he continues in second place. Democratic Labor Party candidate Leonel Brizola still holds third place and is supported by 7 percent of the voters. Those who will annul their votes or who still do not know for whom they will vote total 29 percent. The poll also indicates that President Itamar Franco's support for Cardoso is important and that strikes staged by the Sole Workers Center harm Lula's image.
