FR940513-0-00048 FR940513-0-00011 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket Nos. 91&hyph;ANM&hyph;14, 91&hyph;ANM&hyph;16, 91&hyph;ANM&hyph;17, 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;1, 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;2, 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;3, and 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;5] Establishment of Class E Airspace and Alteration of Class D and Class E Airspace Areas, VOR Federal Airways and Jet Routes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; delay of effective date. SUMMARY: On September 7, 9, and 10, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published final rules altering the Class D airspace area in Broomfield, CO; altering the Class D airspace and establishing Class E airspace in Aurora, CO; altering Class D and Class E airspace areas in Englewood, CO; altering the Class E airspace area in Denver, CO; altering VOR Federal airways in Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming; and altering jet routes in Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. These actions support the new Denver International Airport airspace reconfiguration. In view of the delay in the opening date of the new Denver International Airport, this action delays the rules' effective date indefinitely. EFFECTIVE DATE: Effective May 13, 1994, the effective date of the final rules at 58 FR 47041, 58 FR 47371, 58 FR 47372, 58 FR 47373, 58 FR 47631, 58 FR 47633, 58 FR 47635, as postponed at 58 FR 60552, corrected at 59 FR 1472, 59 FR 5080, 59 FR 6217, and as postponed at 59 FR 10743 (March 8, 1994), is delayed indefinitely. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Norman W. Thomas, Airspace and Obstruction Evaluation Branch (ATP&hyph;240), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9230. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 7, September 9, and September 10, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published final rules altering and establishing Class D and Class E airspace areas, VOR Federal airways, and jet routes to support the new Denver International Airport airspace reconfiguration. On January 11, 1994, a correction was published on Airspace Docket No. 91&hyph;ANM&hyph;14 to incorporate a recent amendment to V&hyph;220 between Grand Junction, CO, and Meeker, CO. Additionally, on February 3 and 10, 1994, corrections were published on J&hyph;54 in Airspace Docket No. 91&hyph;ANM&hyph;16 to reinstate a segment from Cherokee, WY, to Laramie, WY. Most recently, the FAA had delayed these rules until May 15, 1994. The official opening of the Denver International Airport has been delayed indefinitely due to the automatic baggage system difficulties. Accordingly, the effective date of the related final rules should be delayed indefinitely. Once the opening date of the new airport is determined, the FAA will publish another rule indicating the effective date of these rules. Because the public needs to be made aware of this delay immediately, notice and public procedure are impracticable and good cause exists for making this action effective in less than 30 days. In consideration of the foregoing, effective May 13, 1994, the effective date of Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;1 modifying the Class D airspace area in Broomfield, CO (58 FR 47041; September 7, 1993); Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;2 modifying the Class D airspace area and establishing a Class E airspace area in Aurora, CO (58 FR 47371; September 9, 1993); Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;3 modifying the Class D and Class E airspace areas in Englewood, CO (58 FR 47372; September 9, 1993); Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;5 modifying the Class E airspace areas at the Denver Centennial Airport, CO, Denver, CO, and Erie, CO (58 FR 47373; September 9, 1993); Airspace Docket No. 91&hyph;ANM&hyph;14 altering VOR Federal airways in Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming (58 FR 47631; September 10, 1993) as corrected at 59 FR 1472 (January 11, 1994); Airspace Docket No. 91&hyph;ANM&hyph;16 altering jet routes in Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming (58 FR 47633; September 10, 1993) as corrected at 59 FR 5080 (February 3, 1994) and 59 FR 6217 (February 10, 1994); Airspace Docket No. 91&hyph;ANM&hyph;17 altering VOR Federal airways in Colorado and Wyoming (58 FR 47635; September 10, 1993), and as postponed at (59 FR 10743; March 8, 1994); are delayed indefinitely. Issued in Washington, DC, on May 10, 1994. Harold W. Becker, Manager, Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division.
