In a statement distributed here today, Khalid expressed his convictions that the Oslo negotiators no longer have ample room for maneuvering. He added that they must halt the current negotiations and abrogate the Oslo and Cairo agreements. They should not return to the negotiations unless the Rabin government pledges to honor international legitimacy's resolutions on settlements and comply with the terms of reference agreed upon for the negotiating process. Khalid asserted that it it fails to take such measures, then the Palestinian leadership must tender its resignation and call the Palestine National Council into session to elect a new leadership. For his part, PLO Executive Committee member 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh has said: We reject Yitzhaq Rabin's perception of international protection for our people in the occupied territories. He indicated that Israel is attempting to absorb the indignation elicited by the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, and to cover up for this heinous crime. Malluh asserted that the meetings held by the PLO Executive Committee to consider its negotiating position in the aftermath of the Hebron massacre were illegal. He added that the members attending these meetings were a minority, and that most members did not attend.
