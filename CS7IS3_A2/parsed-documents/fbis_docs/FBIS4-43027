Relief, partly because most of them must have felt war-weary after eight years of reading about seemingly interminable negotiations and partly -- perhaps predominantly -- because they understood just how vital the deal really was. The results of those negotiations will be implemented as from January 1995 when the World Trade Organisation [WTO] comes into being. One can only hope that the major players will not make the process of ratification -- which is required before we can finally confirm the implementation date -- into an agony of indecision and delay. The birth of the WTO should not be held hostage to domestic political in-fighting nor to transient trade squabbles, which tend to be of mind withering inconsequence when measured against the crucial importance of the new multilateral trading system. But even when the WTO is in place there will be a temptation, in some capitals at least, to revert to "business as usual"; perpetuating the same kind of preoccupations, justified or not, with respect to bilateral trade balances alleged "unfairness" in trading practices and so on. It is important that we recognise that the WTO is a response to continuing global changes, economic and otherwise, and that, as a consequence, its activities have to be seen against a background of much more than big power trade politics. It will be a truly multilateral institution seeking multilateral responses to the economic problems faced by a large continuum of countries. This is not to talk of "world government"; it is simply to face up to the inter-linkages between economies. It is also to reassert the spirit of the Uruguay Round in finding meaningful, practicable approaches, acceptable to all, which drive forward the creation of wealth and sustainable development. Establishment of the WTO does, though, call for a new commitment to co-ordination in economic policymaking. Why? Think for a moment about one key preoccupation of most governments at present: education and training in the context of unemployment. There is a convincing argument that expanded trade between the developed and developing worlds has, in the past few decades and particularly since the mid-1980s, led to significant employment shifts in both. And it is not a simple matter of jobs lost and gained. While the extent of jobs lost in certain industries and gained in others in the developed countries can be debated, it seems clear that trade with the developing countries has tended to favour the skilled against the unskilled and exacerbated the gap between them. At the same time, in developing countries, export-oriented policies have encouraged a faster rate of learning and investment in education. This has opened up a gap between those with little or no education, who are unlikely to be involved in anything but the most rudimentary manufacturing activity, and those with at least a basic level of education. This is an important observation. The results of the Uruguay Round, and particularly those related to increased market access for goods and services, are designed to expand trade; certainly between developed and developing countries and those countries in the process of economic reform. Thus the impact of recent trade growth on skill demands and on the gap between skilled and unskilled, educated and uneducated may be reinforced and, perhaps, accelerated over several decades. Nor is it just concessions on market access which will spur demands on education and training. New opportunities will be opened up through the intellectual property agreement -- encouraging technology transfer, for instance -- and the services deal will lead to the establishment of foreign service providers requiring skilled, educated employees. And this should not be seen as a one-way process; opportunities for the development of new skills will be as great in industrialised as in developing countries. The real question that arises is whether we are thinking hard enough about the machinery which will help governments identify and respond to such trends. After all, it is evident that the most important influences on national economies are now, and will be increasingly, outside their borders. As a consequence, most governments will be left with few policy instruments with which to attempt to affect the performance of their own economies. If that is the case then it is vital that the international machinery be effective. I have argued previously that the present machinery of the G7 is now inadequate. On almost every measure, it is an unrepresentative organism and, consequently, its deliberations seldom have meaning or relevance for countries outside the select group -- not always, indeed, for those inside. That is a big loss. The fact is that the G7 countries must recognise that they cannot take sole responsibility for the broad thrust of economic management without adequate participation of the countries representing new dynamic markets in the developing world. There is a need for a grouping of countries that can be more effective and representative with some participation, perhaps, on a rotating basis. But the key to making such a group effective is not only representation but the input participants receive. Here, the multilateral institutions must now get their act together. At present we have a multitude of researchers and analysts in a multitude of organisations producing countless papers and reports to be added to those produced by governments themselves. Why should the organisations concerned with money, finance and trade -- the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the WTO -- not evolve a single coherent statement on issues of economic concern to a representative forum of the world's leaders? And in order to ensure implementation of the decisions reached, the same organisations should co-ordinate more effectively to give strong institutional support. One thing is for sure. We must concentrate on the long-term implications of the agreements which have been reached and must be implemented by the WTO and on the way in which this new multilateral trading system will spur new approaches to global economic management.
