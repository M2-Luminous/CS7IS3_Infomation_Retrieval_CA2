The first communique addresses who must ask for pardons and who can grant them. That is the title of the communique, which ponders why amnesty makes sense in some aspects but not in others and who should do the pardoning, wondering if it should be the peasants and Indians who for years have been humiliated and exploited. The EZLN communique also questions wealth in Chiapas; that is, why there are big landowners -- people who have always had everything, like better food and medical services -- while there are Indian communities where smallpox or any other disease means death. The communique notes that many people sit at well served tables with food for all family members, while Indian and peasant families must sit with death at their side because death is their daily companion. That is why we took up arms, the Zapatists explain. The next communique is very important. It deals with the amnesty bill that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has sent to Congress. In this document the EZLN states that some conditions must be met so the amnesty will be real. The document states that so far the Zapatists have not seen an original text of the bill, something they had been promised and which they were supposed to receive through San Cristobal de las Cases Bishop Samuel Ruiz from Manuel Camacho Solis, the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. One of the points of the communique states: Judging from what we have heard in the media about the amnesty bill, we can only give general opinions, considering that the position toward amnesty is premature in the face of the current dialogue process, which so far has not really entered the essential phase. The EZLN notes that once this phase arrives, one fundamental step would be to make statements available to the Zapatists in writing so they can be analyzed. The EZLN adds that there are still fierce clashes between units of the Mexican Army and the Zapatists. The document notes that one of the EZLN's demands has not been met; that is, the withdrawal of the Armed Forces to their quarters. Today we visited some places near San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, where we knew the Mexican Army had been mobilized, and we noticed that right now there are fewer soldiers guarding the city. As we reported yesterday, Army elements in some sites will remain. Some camps will be built to provide security to the towns. The EZLN reports that the Zapatists are not opposed to a dialogue. On the contrary, they say they are amenable to making it an increasingly open process. The communique notes that right now the EZLN wants some time to analyze the points of the amnesty. The communique states: We are open and prepared to negotiate. There is also a third communique that is very, very, important. Here the EZLN acknowledges Manuel Camacho Solis, the special commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, as a valid interlocutor for these talks, an interlocutor for peace, as they call him. In this communique they explain that Camacho Solis has positive characteristics for engaging in this dialogue with the EZLN. The communique adds that Camacho Solis has demonstrated, with his words and deeds, that he has goodwill and good intentions to reach a dialogue that could be fruitful and bring to Chiapas the justice it needs.
