This decision was made at a time when not only the majority of OPEC members but the eight non-OPEC members had announced their willingness to reduce oil production. However, Saudi Arabia's disagreement on dropping production compelled OPEC to renew the agreement that was adopted six months ago on a daily production of 24.52 million barrels a day until the end of the current Christian calendar year. Commenting on the renewal of OPEC's existing production ceiling, several petroleum ministers--the Qatari petroleum minister who also heads OPEC, the Libyan petroleum minister who is also a member of the three-man committee that studies possible violations by members, and the petroleum minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran--made separate statements criticizing Saudi Arabia. They also said that the decision was made to renew the production ceiling to avoid indecision. Following Saudi Arabia's refusal to reduce its production, the OPEC secretary general and some members said that the renewal of the production ceiling was the only decision that members could practically and collectively agree on. Our correspondent Hafezi has prepared the following report on the impact of this decision on oil prices and on our country's economy. [Begin Hafezi recording] Following OPEC's recent decision, incoming reports from oil markets show that the continuation of oil production at the former production ceiling during a season when OPEC would have normally reduced production has led to an estimated $1 drop in oil prices in comparison with the period before the OPEC session. Meanwhile, a number of oil market analysts have noted that since the oil market foresaw a renewal of the agreement even before the current session, prices have sufficiently dropped and the official announcement will not reduce oil prices more than one more dollar during the next six months. Meanwhile, OPEC members have agreed to maintain the former official production level even during the three months of autumn when oil demands increase. In this case, oil prices can be expected to strengthen during the three months of autumn. As for the recent OPEC decision's impact on the Islamic Republic of Iran, domestic observers point out that since oil incomes in the 1373 budget law [year beginning 21 March 1994] were less than the estimates in the budget bill and are based on $13 per barrel, lesser foreign exchange expenditures have been foreseen for projects in that year. These observers have pointed out that determining two separate methods for foreign exchange expenditures, which are in ratio with oil prices, can help the government confront the drop in foreign exchange income. The observers add that it is ultimately an increase in domestic production and more use of domestic products that can help drop foreign exchange needs. [end recording]
