The decision came after no candidate was able to win the necessary majority of votes to fill the offices of president and vice president in the March 20 elections, resulting in another election set for April 24 to pick the nation's two top leaders, the chief government spokesman told reporters. Japan sent a 15-member team to monitor the last polls in the central American country. The Japanese observers returned home on March 25. Tokyo will again dispatch 15 election monitors to El Salvador for about a 10-day stay, a government official said. Most of the participants will be picked from those taking part in the last mission, the official said. El Salvador is the third country to which Japan has sent election observers in accordance with the UN Peacekeeping Cooperation Law, following Angola and Cambodia.
