FBIS4-15428 "drsov068_u_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 Latvia Cabinet Issues Statement Cabinet Issues Statement WS0704153994 Riga LETA in English 1423 GMT 7 Apr 94 WS0704153994 Riga LETA English BFN ["Unofficial translation" of statement issued by the Latvian Cabinet of Ministers in Jurmala on 6 April] [Text] On April 6, 1994 of this year, the Government of the Republic of Latvia received at its disposal decree No. 174 signed by Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin on April 5, in which the Russian Federation President has consented to the Russian Federation Ministry of Defence proposal, approved by the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs, concerning the establishment of military bases in the territories of the CIS and the Republic of Latvia, in order to ensure the security of the Russian Federation and the previously mentioned nations, as well as to test new armaments and military equipment. The Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with the Ministry of Defence and other interested Russian Federation ministries and departments, has been charged with negotiating with the CIS and the Republic of Latvia, and to conclude the reached agreements by means of the appropriate documentation. In this connection, the Government of the Republic of Latvia states that the substance of the decree by the Russian Federation president is in stark contrast with the draft agreement on Russian troop withdrawal from the Republic of Latvia prepared by the delegations of the Republic of Latvia and the Russian Federation, and initialed in Moscow on March 15, 1994. It can be regarded as an unwillingness by the Russian Federation to sign these jointly prepared and initialed draft agreements, and subordinate covenants. The Government of the Republic of Latvia categorically states that it has not agreed to, does not agree to, and will never agree to the establishment of Russian Federation military bases, or to the testing of new armaments and military equipment in the territory of the Republic of Latvia, and rejects the possibility of any discussion on these issues. The Russian Federation does not have the right to wailfully undertake to guarantee the security of the Republic of Latvia. The decree by the Russian president fundamentally changes the international political and military situation in Eastern Europe. The Government of Latvia regards this decree as open submission to pressures from Russia's reactionary imperialistic circles. That Russia wants to establish its military bases in Latvia proves that the goals of specifically these forces were not met in the March 15 initialed agreements. They are now attempting to make these agreements inconceivable. The fact that these intentions have gained support in the Russian Federation president's decree, is a heavy blow to the international community's and the Republic of Latvia's ability to trust in the course of Russia's foreign policy and the foreign policy's compliance to internationally accepted norms. The Government of Latvia is evaluating its further policy in relation to Russia and will take commensurate countermeasures to any attempts to threaten Latvia's sovereignty. The Government of the Republic of Latvia requests explanations from the Russian Federation regarding this decree and reserves the right to inform the governments of countries around the world and international institutions about the changes of Russia's position on the issue of Russia's troop withdrawal. The Government of Latvia once again requests that the Russian Government without delay and unquestioningly withdraw all army and military personnel who are located illegally in the territory of the Republic of Latvia.
