FR940920-1-00010 FR940920-1-00002 II. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Chairman of the Commission has certified that the proposed amended Form will not, if adopted, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification, including the reasons therefor, is attached to this release. III. Costs and Benefits The proposed amendments to Form U&hyph;13&hyph;60 would enable the seventeen service company subsidiaries of registered holding companies to prepare income statements and balance sheets that properly reflect the accounting of the billings to their utility customers. The enhanced ability to properly classify billings should ease the record keeping burdens presently incurred by the service companies and would permit service companies to classify costs more accurately. In addition, the proposed amendments would provide the service companies the flexibility to use FERC Accounts as appropriate given the nature of the services provided their customers. The Commission anticipates that these benefits will reduce the accounting costs of a service company by $10,000 to $20,000 per year. IV. Paperwork Reduction Act The proposed amended Form U&hyph;13&hyph;60 is subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act and will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget. V.
