The U.S. Department of State announced that the United States would be ready to start a third round of talks with the DPRK as soon as the DPRK froze its nuclear program. On 22 June, Clinton made another announcement: the United States would hold a new round of talks with the DPRK in Geneva. Meanwhile, DPRK President Kim Il-song proposed a summit between North and South Korea, and ROK President Kim Yong-sam immediately responded to his offer. Now the two sides are discussing arrangements for the summit. All these developments indicate that the DPRK nuclear issue, which has dragged on for several months, has now arrived at an important turning point. The basic approach to the settlement of the DPRK nuclear issue is by holding dialogue rather than by exerting pressure. Whenever it faces a new crisis, the United States always resorts to such coercive means as exerting political pressure and imposing economic sanctions. Such measures will not bring a solution to the problem but will further aggravate the crisis. Nowadays, as the Cold War has already ended, power politics has become still more unpopular in the world. People of insight in the United States, those in opposition or in office alike, have spoken unfavorably of this practice. Former U.S. President Carter, who makes nothing of hardship, has shuttled between Pyongyang and Seoul and mediated between the DPRK and the United States. His efforts have helped enhance mutual understanding between all of the parties, eased the hostile atmosphere, and paved the way for a political solution to the DPRK nuclear issue. It is hoped that all the parties involved will keep working in this direction, on an equal footing, and in a realistic and calm attitude. Setback in the Reconciliation Process in Cambodia After the Cambodia roundtable conference for peace and national reconciliation in Phnom Penh broke down on 16 June, the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia asked Democratic Kampuchea [Khmer Rouge] to close its representative office in Phnom Penh. All the staff of the Democratic Kampuchean representative office left Phnom Penh on 20 June and returned to zones controlled by Democratic Kampuchea via Bangkok. Meanwhile, the battle has burst out again between government troops and Democratic Kampuchean troops. The United States has sent two military delegations to Cambodia and has agreed to consider extending military aid to the Cambodian Government. The bloody conflict between the two sides has already caused severe losses in lives and property over the past several months. Furthermore, wars have caused price hikes as well as decreasing trade. Consequently, foreign investors are planning to pull out, and the country's economic reconstruction process will hardly be able to carry on smoothly. The Cambodian people, who have endured untold suffering, are very worried about the deteriorating situation. Even some government ministers object to giving up efforts for a political settlement. To be sure, there are still great obstacles in the way of national reconciliation in Cambodia, but, after all, this is the only way out for peace and reconstruction in this country. All the parties concerned should set store by national interests and return to the negotiating table. Why Does France Send Troops to Rwanda At France's request, the Security Council, after several days' of discussion, adopted a resolution on 22 June by 10 votes with five abstentions, which authorizes France to dispatch a 2,000-strong force to Rwanda to protect civilians and refugees threatened by war. French Minister of Defense Francois Leotard later announced that France would start its military intervention in Rwanda in the early morning of 23 June, with 2,500 servicemen, 500 military vehicles, and 40 airplanes sent to the country. So far, the war in Rwanda has caused several hundred thousand people to die and has left millions homeless. However, in view of the failure of the peace-keeping mission in Somali, the West is now extremely cautious about military intervention. France has maintained close economic and military ties with the Rwandan Government in recent years. France's purpose in sending troops to Rwanda at this moment is to show people that "France is playing an important role in Africa." The Organization of African Unity summit recently adopted a resolution on Rwanda, but some African countries which agreed to send troops to Rwanda do not have the means to carry out the mission. This being the case, the timing of the French mission is a well though out decision. As France has limited resources and to minimize the risk, France has called this mission a limited "humanitarian rescue operation."
