An ITAR-TASS correspondent learned today from the Chechen president's press service that Zviad Gamsakhurdia's wife Manana had noted that the place where Zviad Gamsakhurdia spent that night had been surrounded by unknown persons. According to her version, "the Georgian authorities had information about Gamsakhurdia's death but carefully concealed it and are still concealing it to this moment." A statement issued in Groznyy today by Zviad Gamsakhurdia's press service notes that a few minutes before his death he said that "he is committing this act in full awareness as a sign of protest against the existing regime in Georgia and of his inability, as president, to improve the situation and to restore legality and law and order."
