The same sources recall that Russia and the United States will have the final say on conditions for peace in Bosnia at the G-7 summit in Naples from July 8-10. There are indications that Russia and the United States could present their own peace plan independently of the "Contact Group," although they, themselves, are represented in it. This creates further confusion in connection with the international community's anyway frail initiative for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. British political analysts on Thursday said they were surprised by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's statement that he did not rule out the possibility of the exemption of the Bosnian Moslems from the U.N. arms embargo. The change in the Russian stand has increased fears that the arms embargo could be lifted, which would almost certainly lead to the continuation of the war, according to British assessments. It is recalled in London that the U.S. Senate is on Thursday to adjust its decision on the exemption of the Bosnian Moslems from the arms embargo with a similar decision taken by the House of Representatives. The U.N. protocol and, indirectly, U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, himself, have made it impossible for U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina Gen. Michael Rose, who is best acquainted with the situation in the field, to explain to the U.S. senators how disastrous such a policy would prove to be. Under the U.N. protocol, only the head and the commander of the U.N. Protection Force for the former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) can present their views on the matter.
