During his visit in the Russian capital, the Greek foreign minister will meet with his Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev, and discuss the improvement of bilateral trade and economic relations, the Bosnian crisis, and the Balkan situation. Shortly before his departure from the eastern terminal of Ellinikon Airport, the foreign minister told correspondents: I can only stress once again the importance of this visit. Our relations with Russia are excellent. I believe that we have quite a few questions on bilateral relations to discuss in a positive context and promote them. Mr. Papoulias added: I refer to natural gas and the oil pipeline. If we reach an agreement on these, and I am certain that we will, they will be two important projects for Greece's economy as well as for Greek-Russian economic relations. The foreign minister added: Of course, Russia is playing a pioneer role in the peace process for the former Yugoslavia. Many of our own positions are similar to those of Russian foreign policy. I believe that we will hold detailed discussions and that we will probably undertake joint initiatives, such as convening again the five-member conference between the United States, Russia, France, Great Britain, and the European Union's troika, which was held in Geneva on 13 May.
