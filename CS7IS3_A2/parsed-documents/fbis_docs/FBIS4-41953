This estimate was made by a leading figure at the center Vladimir Zhukov at a current Moscow seminar on Western investments in the Russian defense industry. He said it is based on consultations with Western exerts. Representatives of companies and analytical centers said that the existing plans of attracting investments from Russian commercial banks and for formation of a special export-import bank cannot guarantee the volume of investments needed to restructure the defense industry. According to Zhukov, in conditions of galloping inflation, mutual debts, and low turnover as many as half of all defense plants are on the verge of ruin and the number of jobless in the industry might grow to several million by the end of the year. The conversion program affects almost 80 percent of the industry: in the Soviet Union military spending amounted to 30 percent of the GNP.
