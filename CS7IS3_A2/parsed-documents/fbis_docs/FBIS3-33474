Reconsidering a ruling made last December, Judge Novely Vilanova of the Seventh Federal Court granted an injunction on the suit filed by the Attorney General's Office against former President Fernando Collor, Paulo Cesar Farias, Claudio Vieira, and 24 companies for illegal amassment of wealth. Judge Vilanova's decision means that any contract signed between those companies and the government since the injunction was granted are suspended. Among the companies affected are the Andrade Gutierrez, Norberto Odebrecht, and Tratex construction companies, as well as Mercedes Benz do Brasil, Votorantim, and the Cooperativa Regional dos Produtores de Acucar e Alcool de Alagoas. Late yesterday afternoon Attorney General Aristides Junqueira sent notes to Ministers Elcio Alvares (Industry and Commerce) and Romildo Canhim (Federal Administration Secretariat) notifying them on the court's decision. Beside suspending contracts and reallocating budget resources, the government must now prevent those companies from winding up, changing their business status, or merging with others. Reconsidering the first ruling on a request from the Attorney General's Office, Judge Vilanova emphasized the existence of evidence in the law suit against the companies. Pointing out the urgency of "mechanisms of morality," Vilanova observed that the injunction does not assume guilt. He criticized the government, saying: "In face of the illegal actions attributed to the companies, the government could have temporarily suspended the participation of those companies in new bids. A court decision was unnecessary." The companies may still resort to the Federal Regional Court. The companies may not engage in contracts with the government for 10 years. While Collor, Farias, and Vieira have not been punished, yet they may have their political rights suspended for up to 10 years in addition of losing their assets and being fined. The 24 companies affected by the injunction are: 1. Construtora Tratex Inc.; 2. Construtora Andrade Gutierrez Inc.; 3. Construtora Norberto Odebrecht Inc.; 4. Cetenco Engenharia Inc.; 5. Mercedes Benz do Brasil Inc.; 6. Industria Votorantim Inc.; 7. Companhia Catarinense de Cimento Portland; 8. Companhia Cimento Portland Gaucho; 9. Companhia Cimento Portland Rio Branco; 10.
