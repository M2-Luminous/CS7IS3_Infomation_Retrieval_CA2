ADDRESSES: Submit written requests for the architecture documents and the Phase I Summary Report by October 3, 1994, to Mr. George Beronio, Federal Highway Administration (HTV&hyph;10), 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Requests for the architecture documents must be accompanied by a check made payable to the FHWA in the amount of $225.00 as reimbursement for reproduction and shipping. There is no fee for the Phase I Summary Report. Please note that individual documents or subsets of this package of documents (other than the Phase I Summary Report) are not available through this announcement. Submit written, signed comments on the documents and Summary Report to the FHWA Docket No. 94&hyph;26, Room 4232, HCC&hyph;10, Office of Chief Counsel, Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. All comments received will be available for examination at the above address from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. Those desiring notification of receipt of comments must include a self-addressed, stamped postcard. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. George Beronio, Office of Traffic Management and Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems Applications, phone (202) 366&hyph;6111, fax (202) 366&hyph;8712, Federal Highway Administration, HTV&hyph;10, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The goal of the National IVHS Architecture Development Program is to document, by the summer of 1996, a nationwide framework for implementation of IVHS. The architecture will help achieve national compatibility of IVHS technologies and systems while allowing for regional flexibility in building actual systems. This national architecture will also integrate the broad range of services available to users of IVHS to achieve efficiencies in the use of communications and infrastructure resources, while maintaining enough openness in the system to foster a rich market for products and services that allows for innovation, expansion, and modernization over time. Teams headed by Hughes Aircraft Company, Loral Federal Systems Group, Rockwell, and Westinghouse Electric Corporation were selected in September 1993 to independently develop four alternative system concepts, or ``architectures,'' for a nationwide IVHS. The program is proceeding in two phases. Phase I, which will conclude in December 1994, has involved the definition and preliminary analysis of alternative concepts. It is the documentation products of this effort that are being made available through this announcement. The most promising concepts will be continued into an 18-month Phase II, which will focus on detailed analysis of these concepts and resolution of differences such that a single consensus architecture is produced and documented. A complete set of 12 documents from each of the four study teams participating in this first phase of the architecture development will be made publicly available in mid-October 1994. A Phase I Summary Report containing educational background material, overviews of the four architectures, and additional detail on the implications of each approach will also be made available shortly thereafter.
