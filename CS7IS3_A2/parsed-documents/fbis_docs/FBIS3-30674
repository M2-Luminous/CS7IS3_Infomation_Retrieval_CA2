FBIS3-30674 "dreeu026__a94046" FBIS-EEU-94-026-A Document Type:Daily Report 8 February 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Protests Against Nuclear Power Plants Growing AU0702111794 Prague CTK in English 1545 GMT 5 Feb 94 AU0702111794 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, February 5 (CTK) -- Protests by Czech and foreign -- especially Austrian -- environmental movements against the completion of nuclear power stations have been gaining strength since the board of the U.S. Export and Import (EXIM) Bank guaranteed a loan of $317 million for the completion of the Temelin nuclear power station in south Bohemia and the modernization of its security systems. The Czech Government approved the completion of Temelin, one of the two Czech nuclear power stations, in March last year. Two blocks with a total output of 2,000 megawatts are to be added, and the power station is to start operating in 1996 or 1997, in order to obtain permission to operate in accordance with Western European and U.S. norms. Former Czech Premier Petr Pithart wrote to American congressman Barney Frank in January saying that the government had not taken into account the opinions of the inhabitants of the area around Temelin and had not put the question of the completion of Temelin for discussion in parliament. The present government had also ignored the fact that no report had been drawn up looking at the potential influence of Temelin on the environment, Pithart added. The first reactor of the other Czech nuclear power station in Dukovany, whose construction cost 25 billion Czech korunas Kc, started operating in 1985. On the basis of the results of a Czech and international technical audit, the operation of Dukovany will probably be extended from the originally planned 20 years to 35 or 40, the usual period abroad. The Czech Energy Works (CEZ) has a long-term investment programme costing Kc20 billion ($600,000,000) for the modernization of Dukovany and further necessary additions. One of the arguments of environmental initiatives against nuclear power stations is the threat of accidents. Weight is lent to the fears of environmentalists by the fact that there have been three fires at Dukovany between 1991 and 1994. The last of these incidents occurred on Thursday, when trouble in the BT-02 branch transformer in the third block caused a fire in the transformer shortly after seven in the morning. By 9 o' clock [0800 GMT] the fire had been completely put out. About 20 cubic meters of oil escaped from the transformer, but did not manage to get outside the power station. Preliminary estimates put the direct damages at Kc15 million ($500,000). Another problem for nuclear power stations is the storage of nuclear waste. By 1993 there will be 288 tonnes of spent radioactive fuel stored in the Czech Republic, in the reactor rooms of the Dukovany nuclear power station. From when the first block of Dukovany went into operation in 1985 until the end of 1993 369 tonnes of highly radioactive waste were produced. Of this, 141 tonnes are stored at the Jaslovske Bohunice power station in Slovakia, but in 1995 it has to start being brought back to the Czech Republic. The remainder was in the past taken to the former Soviet Union. The capacity of the tanks in Dukovany is 335 tonnes, and at the end of 1995 they will be full. Therefore by the end of the year the construction of intermediate storage facilities has to be finished, to which spent fuel can be transferred from the tanks. Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy says that when deciding on the location of the intermediate storage facilities, it is important to provide both the public and the local authorities with exhaustive information and technical details, which is one way from emotions to an objective solution of this sensitive problem. The inhabitants of villages such as Horni Cerekev near Pelhrimov in south Moravia, which lie in the vicinity of places tipped for the possible construction of intermediate storage facilities have, however, signed a petition expressing their disagreement with the construction. The mayors and local counselors of Pelhrimov, Jihlava, Zdar nad Sazavou, Kostelec u Jihlavy, Kamenice nad Lipou and other communities have also publicly disagreed with the construction.
