How do these two things go together? [Wieczorek-Zeul] First of all: We all think that a political solution must be found for former Yugoslavia. Second, all parties in Germany, including those in government, think that German troops have no business in former Yugoslavia. Third, the SPD government program says: Providing the relevant amendment to the constitution is made, we could participate in UN peacekeeping missions. But we do not want the Bundeswehr to be used as an army for military interventions worldwide. [Preissler] Does this mean that the SPD rejects peacemaking missions? [Wieczorek-Zeul] These are combat missions. Neither the United States, nor the United Nations -- as we learned during Butrus-Ghali's visit this week -- expect Germany to take part in such missions. Anyone in Germany referring to demands "from outside," is using this as a pretext for a complete change in Bundeswehr arms and equipment. This would cost billions that are urgently needed for establishing German unity and supporting East Europe. [Preissler] NATO officials and politicians say that it is unrealistic to draw a line between peacekeeping missions and combat missions. [Wieczorek-Zeul] Somalia has made the United Nations and the U.S. Administration realize once again that unclear mandates are dangerous, because they contain the threat of sliding into a war. As to the Somalia mission, the Federal Government has told the Bundestag and the population a lot of lies. None of the originally envisaged aims and conditions have been met. [Preissler] On Tuesday [19 April], the Federal Constitutional Court will discuss Bundeswehr missions. You do not see any reason to withdraw your complaint? [Wieczorek-Zeul] No. By the way, the Free Democratic Party [FDP] has also filed a complaint in Karlsruhe. But ours is credible. Foreign Minister Kinkel will appear two-faced in Karlsruhe, for, as foreign minister he will present the government's position, and as FDP chairman he will argue against himself. The SPD wants a clarification of whether the interpretation of the constitution by all former federal governments is continued, whereby the Bundeswehr's military constitution only provides for the defense of its own country and the alliance. Any other use would require a constitutional amendment. Regardless of the decision the Karlsruhe court takes, the SPD has made it clear that if it takes over the government, the Bundeswehr will only be used in blue helmet missions. [Preissler] Your chairman has pointed out that there is no doubt that the SPD will remain loyal to the alliance. The Greens want to abolish NATO. Does this mean the death of a red-green coalition? [Wieczorek-Zeul] We are not speculating about possible coalitions before the elections. We want the Social Democrats to win as many votes as possible to enable a change of government. I consider the position of the Greens to be wrong and untrustworthy. They are ignoring the fact that the Central and East European countries are very interested in joining NATO.
