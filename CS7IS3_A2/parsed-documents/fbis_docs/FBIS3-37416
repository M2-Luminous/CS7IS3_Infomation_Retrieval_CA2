So I cannot keep quiet and want to share with readers my view of what has happened. We came to PRAVDA as friends. We came about two years ago when complete closure threatened the newspaper because of financial difficulties. Our company helped the editorial office to settle its debts, and as a result of our cooperation PRAVDA began to be published regularly, five times a week again instead of three. [passage omitted] We have always respect, continue to respect, and will respect PRAVDA's traditions. Therefore we did not interfere before in either the creative process or the political line of the newspaper and we shall not do so in the future. Incidentally, the stories in some publications that someone was dismissed by the joint stock company directors' council for his political convictions is blatant slander. The company does not engage in such matters at all. The terms of our cooperation are enshrined in the contract: democracy and pluralism. We realize that we are dealing with an opposition newspaper but a genuine opposition is always creative because it does not destroy the country but helps the people to resolve their important problems. But when the newspaper's new chief editor was elected in October the atmosphere at the PRAVDA International joint stock company changed drastically. For us it was a complete surprise: V. Linnik had been on the joint stock company directors' council for nearly two years and in contrast to G. Seleznev and A. Ilin he invariably supported any proposal of ours. Having become chief editor he and some of his supporters steered a course toward destroying the joint stock company, ruining the cooperation to which they had previously been loyal, and reneguing on agreements and commitments, including those backed by V. Linnik's signature (and I respect people who do not betray the promise they have made). For that they even agreed to stop PRAVDA's production. A campaign of lies and slander began. Our relations of cooperation with the most esteemed Russian newspaper are now being restored. On 4 February this year a meeting of the editorial collective confirmed that the newspaper will be published within the framework of the PRAVDA International joint stock company. It will be published regularly and reach all subscribers, wherever they may live. It has already been decided to ensure stable and permanent financing for PRAVDA's printing. I hope that in the very near future the newspaper's staffers will have no complaints about their wages either. The statements issued in recent weeks that the Russian PRAVDA International company is bankrupts and has no money are completely untrue. Incidentally, we are now having to pay V. Linnik's debts too. There is a great deal of speculation on the subject of whether PRAVDA has become a Greek newspaper. I have been investing money in it for about two years but never for a single day has it ceased to be a Russian publication concerned for the destiny of its own country?! And the permanent staff of PRAVDA International include about 200 Russian citizens and just one Greek -- the financial director of the joint stock company. It is clear that he cannot deal with the newspaper's creative business. His main concern is normal financing for PRAVDA. I am reproached for refusing any contacts with Russian businessman and not wanting their cooperation in the company which we have created in conjunction with PRAVDA. That is utterly untrue. With the approval of the majority of PRAVDA employees substantial business contracts are now being concluded with major Russian entrepreneurs. Their aim is to elaborate long-term programs of cooperation for the benefit of PRAVDA, PRAVDA employees, and readers. I think they will end successfully. I realize that my PRAVDA friends are working in complex conditions and that it is hard for PRAVDA readers to live. I respect those who make the newspaper and those at whom it is aimed. I want to help our common cause of peace, the friendship of the peoples, and the attainment of people's prosperity.
