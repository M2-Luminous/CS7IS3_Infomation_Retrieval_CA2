The appointments were temporary, he said in a statement. Mr Coetsee announced that the decision to appoint the two men was taken in consultation with the management committee of the Transitional Executive Council. The appointments follow the imposition of a state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal by State President F W de Klerk. At a press briefing in Pretoria on Thursday, Mr de Klerk said large numbers of SADF [South African Defense Force] troops would be sent into the province to stabilise the region. The emergency measures would not affect Mr Mangosuthu Buthelezi's position as chief minister of kwaZulu or his administration. Similarly, dignified and full recognition should be given to the position of the Zulu monarch King Goodwill Zwelithini. Mr de Klerk said emergency regulations would provide for the detention of people, a form of prohibition on the carrying of weapons and stricter controls on public events.
