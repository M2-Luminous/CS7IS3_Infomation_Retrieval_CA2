A Grant Bagratyan news conference was scheduled to coincide with this minor anniversary. [Video shows Grant Bagratyan at news conference] The head of the cabinet took almost an hour and a half to report on work of the cabinet, during which it became clear that in spite of the difficult situation in 1993, the harsh blockade by both Azerbaijan and Georgia, and the energy crisis, the parameters of national income from industry and agriculture -- even when taking into consideration the decline from the previous year -- can be considered an accomplishment. Evidently, the fact that prices increased 110-fold while salaries increased by a factor of 3.5 times can also be considered an accomplishment. Living standards decreased by 55 percent. However, this situation undoubtedly has objective reasons: a general crisis in all spheres, military spending, and conversion to a national currency. Inflation was somewhat slowed and [word indistinct] was somewhat stabilized at the juncture of 1993 and 1994. In a word, we are much better off than we could have been. By the way, Bagratyan held his news conference after his meeting with the Russian prime minister. [Video shows interview with Grant Bagratyan] [Begin recording] [Bagratyan] The worsening of the situation in Armenia causes a worsening in Russia also, even if on a smaller scale. Each country is dealing with its own problem, but at the same time they are already trying to take notice of each other. This situation will continue for a year or a year and a half. After that, the recreation of the ruble zone will be the task which would, I would say, allow for larger integration. The question facing us now is not integration, but prevention of disintegration.
