FBIS4-64918 "drweu090_j_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-090 Daily Report 7 May 1994 ITALY & VATICAN CITY Berlusconi's Government Program Detailed Berlusconi's Government Program Detailed BR0905143994 Rome LA REPUBBLICA in Italian 7 May 94 p 4 BR0905143994 Rome LA REPUBBLICA Italian BFN [Report by Maurizio Ricci: "Prime Minister Berlusconi's `Reserve Plan'"] [Excerpts] Rome -- A ceiling on taxation, equality between public and private education, revisions of the law on police informers, negative VAT [value-added tax] for people who create employment, and tax incentives for housing elderly relatives. On the European level, the federalist ideal of previous governments is disappearing and a more nationalist, "English" vision of the future of the European Union [EU] is emerging, to the extent of demanding a revision of the European Monetary System [EMS] and a common currency circulating in parallel with the national currency -- the "hard ECU" that John Major was proposing before Maastricht. These are just a few of the points in the government program that [Prime Minister-Designate] Silvio Berlusconi has illustrated over the last few days in the long process of consultations with allies, opponents, and social partners. The draft program is careful not to talk of outright first-past-the-post voting for electoral reform, and there is no indication of a separation of posts in the magistracy. It does, however, insist on tax relief and the rigid containment of the public debt with respect to national wealth. This is, therefore, one of the three basic conditions for government action in addition to the respect of the rights acquired in the social security reform and the protection of social solidarity, starting with the family. [passage omitted] Institutions It will be up to parliament, and possibly the electorate (through referendums) to enact constitutional reform. The government will, on the other hand, be able to propose specific outlines for constitutional laws, without ruling out the formation of a new, specific bicameral committee. Electoral reform will ultimately involve the replacement of the proportional system with a majority voting system, plus the abolition of the vestiges of the proportional system. At the same time, the rules governing both houses will be revised. Employment "Full support" will be given, especially through interest rates, to small companies and the self-employed. In the first 100 days, a series of concrete measures will be implemented: tax breaks for people creating new jobs, incentives for part-time workers (especially for women), the liberalization of the procedures for employment (even if outgoing Minister Giugni claims that such procedures for selection and direct employment by small companies are already practiced), the unblocking of public works contracts, and tax breaks for reinvested profit. Public Finances There will be no property tax and no consolidation of debt. There will be a ceiling on withholding tax with exemptions for incomes of up to 10 million lire, a "drastic reduction" in personal income tax rates, and only two VAT rates. Where fiscal federalism is concerned, at the local level, taxes which finance services will be distributed locally, while at the national level will be those taxes which finance the basic tasks of the state. Health The principle here is "the right to benefits" for the individual, and a "minimum level of coverage" for the less well-off. There will be room for private insurance and hospitals will be transformed into competing businesses. Pensions There will be increased tax relief to lighten the pension fund (the "hole" for the Treasury will be covered by the income generated by investments in these same funds). Compulsory contributions to the public system will remain. This will finance the safeguarding of acquired benefits for the weakest. There will be a link with wages for the lowest 20 percent of pensions. Education There will be freedom of choice between public and private education. This means that there will be rules "which allow access to private education under the same conditions as access to public education." College students will be able to apply for loans which they will have to pay back when they have found employment. Justice "The laws on informants which have made it possible to identify major crimes will not be touched." There will be "just a few minor changes," partly on the basis of [outgoing Prime Minister] Ciampi's proposals, "to combine efficiency of suppression with the guarantee of a fair trial." For the CSM [Higher Council of the Magistracy], there is talk of a reorganization which "should enhance its efficiency and make it more independent of any possible type of pressure." Family The tax system must be based on a family income tax, with new tax deductions. There will be tax breaks for those who assist their parents. Immigration Migratory flows will be stabilized, but there will also be guarantees on housing, education, and equal access to work. Public Administration The Cassese reform will continue, strengthening the distinction or separation between politics and civil service and eliminating automatic career advancement. Environment There will be a tax on polluters and incentives for ecological investment. Foreign Policy The watchword here is "continuity." However, there will be a "decisive containment of the EC Commission's interventionist tendencies," as well as a rethink of the EMS, "which has failed in objective terms in its Maastricht version. Anyone who believes in European integration will have to work hard to have an alternative strategy adopted, such as the strategy of a common currency."
