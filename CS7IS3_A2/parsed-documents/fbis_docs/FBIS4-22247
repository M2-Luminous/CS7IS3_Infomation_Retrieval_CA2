The aim of the negotiations is the return of Chechnya to the bosom of the Federation. The Ministry of the Russian Federation on Nationality Affairs, headed by Sergey Shakhray and joined by the leadership of the Federation Council (first fiddle in this group is played by Deputy Speaker Ramazan Abdulatipov, first deputy in the recent past and a person who is generally close to Shakhray), is building bridges with the Chechen irreconcilable opposition, which promises Moscow numerous concessions but which cannot make them at present, because it does not now have the power. At the same time, the administration of the president of Russia, headed by Sergey Filatov, is trying to fix relations with Dzhokhar Dudayev, the head of the Chechen Republic, who in words does not intend to give up sovereignty, but who is really prepared to accept certain sacrifices. The "dual diplomacy" in the relationship with the prodigal component of the Federation is explained, evidently, by the fact that Moscow does not understand very well "who is who" in Groznyy. Filatov and his subordinates emphasize that their partners can only be representatives of the official authorities of Chechnya, and they transparently hint at an alleged planned meeting of the two presidents (a success about which Dudayev can only dream at present). Shakhray, in turn, is cautiously insisting that it is impossible to come to an agreement with Dudayev, and that it is necessary to rely on "other sociopolitical forces in the republic," which, incidentally, are thinking of and preparing for a violent overthrow of the Chechen president. In addition, third persons are also wedging their way into the negotiating process. Thus, Viktor Chernomyrdin recently, without consulting anyone and without going into an analysis of the Russian-Chechen mess, received the Deputy Prime Minister Mugodayev of the Dudayev government (with whom our prime minister, according to information of the Chechen opposition, was personally acquainted when Mugodayev was chief of Groztrubprovodstroy) and settled certain problems of the Groznyy oil refinery plant and of a number of other local enterprises. It is possible that the fate of budgetary money earmarked at one time for Chechnya was decided in the course of this rendezvous. As was disclosed by an OBSHCHAYA GAZETA columnist from reliable sources in the government, a year ago Shakhray, being the deputy prime minister at that time, did everything so that this money did not fall into Dudayev's hands. Today, Sergey Mikhaylovich, reduced to the rank of minister, cannot control budgetary expenditures. A competent source expressed the supposition that Mugodayev, with the blessing of Chernomyrdin, took at least a part of the billions held up in Moscow with him to Groznyy. In the meantime, the Chechen oppositionists, who have penetrated the Russian corridors of power, were also counting on this sum. An OBSHCHAYA GAZETA columnist found out about this directly from the leaders of the Provisional Soviet opposed to Dudayev. (Officials in the White House refuse to give any kind of specific information about the negotiations with Chechnya.) Leaders of the opposition arrived in the Russian capital with a draft agreement with the Government of the Russian Federation. They are asking to be helped materially (for which a "Chechen" line in the budget could be suitable) and to recognize them as the legal authority in Chechnya. On their part, they pledge themselves to overthrow the present regime, to organize parliamentary elections, and to transform the republic into a valuable component of the Federation. According to the words of the Groznyy insurgents, Shakhray and Abdulatipov "met their proposals with understanding." Chairman of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko, responding to a question of an OBSHCHAYA GAZETA columnist, declared that "it is necessary to wait and see who is more ready for negotiations--Dudayev or the Provisional Soviet." But in seeking the laurels of peaceful victors in rebellious Chechnya, the Shakhray-Abdulatipov group is being hindered by the "competing firm" of Filatov. As has been reported, at the beginning of March, Filatov, while in Nalchik, met with a representative of the Chechen authorities. This was an official from the department of Dudayev's state secretary, Aslanbek Akbulatov, whose name the Kremlin sources did not want to mention, and the Chechen oppositionists could not recall, but it is clear that the rank of this "emissary" did not in any way equate to the level of his interlocutor. However, Dudayev is prepared in the future to detail Akbulatov himself--formally the third person in the republic, and not too influential in internal affairs--to the negotiations with a Russian emissary. The concepts of the sides on the subject of future dialogues still differ significantly. The Kremlin intends to sign a treaty with Groznyy on the division of powers and subjects of jurisdiction similar to the Russian-Tatar treaty. Dudayev issued instructions to conduct negotiations only "about improving relations with Russia." However, informed persons in Groznyy think that the general is ready for concessions on the condition of keeping his post and the share of profits that the export of petroleum products will bring to the republic. These profits, in the words of those same informants, constitute the basis of the prosperity of the Groznyy establishment, and it is precisely about the size of the export quotas that Mugodayev was haggling with Chernomyrdin. Considering that Dudayev has lost control over a significant part of the territory, and that the opposition is arming itself intensely, the Groznyy leader really can become a very tractable partner. Of course, in this case, he certainly will run into the accusation of betraying the cause of national independence, but here it is already necessary to make a choice: either power or reputation. On the whole, the Chechen situation is reminiscent of the finale of the "Gamsakhurdia epoch" in Georgia. Of course, the local opposition lacks its own Shevardnadze. Doku Zavgayev, the former first secretary of the oblast party committee and chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Checheno-Ingushetia, has retired and does not wish to involve himself in anything. Ruslan Khasbulatov, who was released from prison under the amnesty, could satisfy the insurgents as a person who enjoys popularity in the republic, but the former speaker categorically is not suitable for negotiations not only with Yeltsin, but also Chernomyrdin, and even with Shakhray. The head of the so-called alternative "government of national trust," billionaire Yaragi Mamodayev, who did not share last year's income from exports with Dudayev and who emigrated to Moscow, does not have authority among the opposition, and his whole government consists of himself alone. Salambek Khadzhiyev, the former minister of the USSR oil industry, is more fit than others for the role of future national leader, but he also is not in a hurry to join in the implementation of the "revolutionary" plans of his countrymen, and he is taking a wait-and-see position. Moscow could more successfully play on the confrontation of Dudayev and the opposition, pushing the leader to concessions and simultaneously encouraging the activeness of his opponents. But this is being hindered by the misalignment in the actions of Russian authorities and the rivalry between the high-ranking "negotiators" who do not trust one another. Such a situation pleases Dudayev most of all: He keeps political and economic power in his hands, he feeds Filatov and his team indefinite promises of some kind of a future treaty with Moscow, but at the same time he haggles with the Government of the Russian Federation about the distribution of profits from trade in "sovereign" Chechen oil products.
