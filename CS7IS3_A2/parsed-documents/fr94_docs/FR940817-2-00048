Take notice that on August 5, 1994, City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri (CU) filed with the Commission a complaint against Williams Natural Gas Company (WNG) and motion for expedited relief pursuant to Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) 1 and Rules 206 and 212 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. 2 1 15 U.S.C. ยง717d. 2 18 CFR 385.206 and .212. CU, an LDC customer of WNG, asks that the Commission investigate and either summarily rule on or, alternatively, set for hearing WNG's application of the right of first refusal provision in its tariff. CU seeks an order from the Commission finding that: (1) bids made by Tartan Energy Company (Tartan) for CU capacity on WNG were not bona fide bids; (2) WNG erred in requiring CU to match the Tartan bids; and (3) WNG wrongly awarded Tartan the right to acquire 69,460 Dth of CU's 79,460 Dth of firm transportation capacity. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said complaint should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 214 and 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure 18 CFR 385.214, 385.211. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before September 12, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Answers to this complaint shall be due on or before September 12, 1994. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20102 Filed 8&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
