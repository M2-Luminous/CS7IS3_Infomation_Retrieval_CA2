The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicants' Representations 1. Bando and the SBIC Subsidiary, Wisconsin corporations, are registered closed-end investment companies. In 1992 and 1993, the SEC issued orders to permit Bando and the SBIC Subsidiary to create a holding company structure with the SBIC Subsidiary being a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bando, and to permit Bando to issue a class of senior security (the ``Prior Order''). 1 Bando was licensed to operate as a small business investment company under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. On March 26, 1993, Bando transferred substantially all of its assets and its small business investment company license to the SBIC Subsidiary. Presently, the SBIC Subsidiary provides secured loans to small businesses. 1 Investment Company Act Release Nos. 19030 (Oct. 15, 1992) (notice), 19092 (Nov. 10, 1992) (order) (initial order permitting Bando to establish and operate the SBIC Subsidiary as a wholly-owned subsidiary), 19584 (July 21, 1993) (notice), and 19636 (Aug. 17, 1993) (order) (order amending initial order to permit Bando to issue one class of senior security which is a stock). 2. Bando proposes to form two additional subsidiary corporations. One of these will be a small business lender (``the SBL Subsidiary'') participating in a government guaranteed loan program and the other will be the ``Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary.'' The SBL and Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiaries will be registered closed-end investment companies under the Act. 3. Subject to the approval of the Small Business Administration (``SBA''), the SBL Subsidiary will operate as a qualified lender licensed under the government guaranteed loan program authorized by section 7(a) of the Small Business Act (the ``7(a) Program''). The 7(a) Program's objective is to provide funds to small business concerns, which otherwise may have limited access to credit. The SBA guarantees up to 70 to 85% of the principal amount of loans made by lenders under the 7(a) Program. The SBA has notified Bando that Bando's participation in the 7(a) Program must be effected in a corporation separate from the Bando and the SBIC Subsidiary.
