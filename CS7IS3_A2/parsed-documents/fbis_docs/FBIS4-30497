Like it or not, the Government has made up its mind, perhaps a long time ago, to invite Burma's State Law and Order Restoration Council representatives to next month's ASEAN Summit in Bangkok. The invitation stands. The Government says it can't imagine what the fuss is about -- Thailand's human rights groups and the international community in general voicing their opposition to the presence of an illegitimate government, notorious for its blatant human rights abuses, at the prestigious annual regional gathering. After all, says an Interior Ministry official: "Slorc's participation (at the ASEAN meeting) is only ceremonial." But not everyone agrees. A panellist at a recent discussion held by a group of human rights activists at Chulalongkon University said: "The policy (constructive engagement) of neighbouring countries, particularly Thailand, has partly enabled the continuity of human rights abuses in Burma. " Another said: "Human rights violations are a serious crime since all mankind is created equally. We respect the rights of Thai people, and we must respect those of Burmese." They know what they are talking about. The latest rumblings heard among Burmese expatriates in Bangkok is that their embassy on Pan Road has recently been told (faxed) by Rangoon to persuade Thai authorities to stop issuing work permits to its nationals applying for jobs in Bangkok. The gist of the seminar on "Human Rights Violation in Burma" was that the Government ought to review its invitation to Burma, and the subject of human rights in that country should be raised for discussion at the ASEAN meeting. And if Slorc is to attend the Bangkok session, then Burmese democratic representatives should be extended the same privilege. We believe the Government should give these suggestions some serious thought. Unlike our unfortunate eastern neighbours, in an open society like ours where we have a democratically elected government and the freedom to express our opinions, it is only fair we listen to both sides of the story. Take up the challenge and invite the Burmese opposition as well. If this country is to play host to a government not recognised by its people, then it should also be willing to deal with members of the National League for Democracy which were elected by the Burmese people but ignored by a handful of generals whose main concern is self-preservation. This Government can no longer go on claiming -- nor can its ASEAN partners, for that matter -- that it does not believe in interfering in the "internal affairs" of a country. We are involved. We became entangled with Burma's affairs the day the "constructive engagement" policy was adopted. Unlike most western and democratic governments which advocate isolation and sanctions to force the Burmese military regime to honour the results of the 1990 elections in Burma, we instead opted for the "gentle persuasion" approach to coax Slorc into returning what they have stolen from the Burmese people. It has been four years since Gen Saw Maung promised to honour Burma's call for a democratic government. If ASEAN is serious in wanting to see a democratic government in Burma, then it should seize the opportunity at next month's meeting and invite the Burmese government-in-exile and members of the Democratic Alliance of Burma to sit down together with Slorc representatives to thrash out their differences. Should Slorc agree to this meeting, we would know they are sincere about ending the civil war in Burma which has gone on for more than four decades. Striking ceasefire deals with the ethnic minorities alone is not enough. Slorc must also learn to come to terms with a government elected by the people. Making meat of one and poison of another will not work. As for protests from Burmese students and dissidents in Thailand who oppose the ASEAN invitation, we don't think the Government need worry about disruptions at the meeting. The students have learned to live with whatever decisions the host country has made. They know they are vulnerable to harassment and arrest by the authorities if they step out of line. These new generations of Burmese have learned to be patient and bide their time if they are to win freedom for their country. As a recent All Burma Students' Democratic Front statement on ASEAN's invitation to Slorc said: "The ABSDF respects the sovereignty of all the ASEAN countries and does not want to tarnish their image; and hereby declares that it will not commit any violent act on the soil of any ASEAN country." These children of the 1988 uprising have matured politically.
