The people must know the truth about the August 1991 events," General of the Army Valentin Varennikov, former commander-in-chief of the land forces of the USSR, told a RIA correspondent. He is the only member of the SCSE to have rejected the amnesty announced by the State Duma. He demanded that the trial of his case should be continued, and its examination is to be resumed on June 21. Varennikov thinks he is perfectly guiltless. "I shall be able to do my duty in court, to defend my honour and to give the names of those who are actually guilty of disintegrating the Soviet Union, an epochal event in the eyes of world history," the former commander of the land forces pointed out. He said that the court will have to summon as witnesses Mikhail Gorbachev, Dmitriy Yazov, Oleg Shenin and a number of other persons. "In my turn, I intend to invite to the court some politicians involved in the August events, particularly the president of Russia, and to testify as witnesses," Varennikov added. The general also said that lawyer Dmitriy Shteinberg will be his defence attorney, as before.
