Zhejiang party committee Secretary Li Zemin and Governor Wan Xueyuan spoke on some main issues on Zhejiang's family planning work in 1994. Xu Aiguang, provincial family planning commission chairman, reported on Zhejiang's administration of population and family planning targets in 1993. Liu Xirong, Zhejiang party committee standing committee member and vice governor, chaired the meeting. Xu Xingguan and other leaders were present. Wan Xueyuan, director of the provincial task force in charge of population and family planning and governor, affirmed Zhejiang's achievements in family planning work. He said: In 1993, party committees and governments at various levels have continually strengthened leadership over family planning work, have strictly enforced the target management responsibility system, have persistently provided respective guidance in accordance with separate categories, and have resolutely handled major issues and arduous problems. Consequently, family planning work has been progressing favorably and Zhejiang has fulfilled its scheduled population growth plan. However, we cannot be optimistic over Zhejiang's population growth and family planning. Zhejiang will be under high-birth periods in 1994 and 1995. High-birth periods for some cities and counties in south Zhejiang will continue up to the early 21st century. Zhejiang's family planning work has been progressing unevenly. While carrying out family planning work under new circumstances, Zhejiang has encountered some new conditions and problems. He pointed out: Population issues are social and economic issues. The faster the market economy develops, the more we should strengthen family planning work. We should firmly establish an overall view of population: We should integrate population issues as well as population and family planning work in the overall economic and social development, and should strive to coordinate population growth with economic, social, resources, and environmental development. At present, population problems are still an important constraint restricting Zhejiang's economic progress. In the course of establishing the market economy, we will still be facing population problems, which are major problems to be studied and resolved. Party committees and governments at various levels, particularly key leaders, should guide all the leading bodies to pay close attention to population issues; should coordinate, on their own initiative, with relevant departments so as to share the tasks according to their different functions in an effort to implement state policies on population; should ensure that various policies and measures are conducive to family planning work; and should comprehensively rectify population problems. Zhejiang's specific targets in 1994 are: By the end of 1994, Zhejiang's total population should be under 43.8 million; its population growth rate should be under 1.492 percent; and its population's natural growth rate should be under 0.839 percent. According to the requirements for improving counties with high birthrates, about six out of Zhejiang's 20 counties with high birthrates should get rid of the "high birthrates" term. According to the requirements on contraceptive management, about a quarter of Zhejiang's counties should implement contraceptive management in an all-around manner. According to the requirements on qualified villages, 60 percent of Zhejiang's administrative villages should be able to fulfill the family planning requirements. Consequently, the overall standards of Zhejiang's family planning work can be raised. Li Zemin stressed at the meeting: We should establish an overall view that economic and social development should be coordinated with population growth. To attain a comfortably well-off living standard by the end of this century, Zhejiang should, first, sustain coordinated progresses in its economy, and, second, control its population growth. Zhejiang will still fail to attain a comfortably well-off living standard if it messes up family planning work leading to an uncontrolled population growth even though its economic indicators and figures have been raised. When handling related work, we should beware of future hardship, per capita share, individual responsibility, and the overall situation. He urged: Various localities should continually implement the system whereby party and government leaders personally handle the tasks and are held responsible eventually with each subordinate party committee and government held responsible to those at the next superior level. Party committees at various levels should annually hold two meetings to study family planning work. They should incorporate family planning work in the general programs for local economic and social development; should make annual arrangements to study problematic areas; and should strictly enforce relevant discipline and laws governing family planning work. We should regard the performance of family planning work as a criterion for evaluating cadres' work performance: Promotion will be denied to cadres who have not earnestly or effectively handled family planning tasks. Party and government leaders should study population theory. When handling related work, party committees and governments should stress problematic and key issues and basic tasks. At the meeting, Governor Wen Xueyuan signed target management responsibility contracts on population and family planning with responsible officials of various city (prefectural) governments (administrative offices). Attending the meeting were members of the provincial task force in charge of population and family planning and principal leaders of cities and prefectures.
