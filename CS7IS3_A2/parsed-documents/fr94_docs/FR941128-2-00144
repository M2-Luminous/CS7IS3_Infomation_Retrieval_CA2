Because the fair market value of the Property Interest is less than the Prior Plan Accounts' aggregate costs of acquiring and holding the Property Interest, the Property Interest will be sold by the Trust to Otter for the aggregate costs of acquiring and holding the Property which totaled $61,406. The rental income received by the Prior Plan Accounts covered any interest which might have reasonably accrued on the holding costs as well as any interest which was due but not received under the second deed of trust loan. However, the rental income is insufficient to fully cover the actual holding costs. 6 Because the Prior Plan Accounts have received a complete return of capital with regard to their investment in the Limited Partnerships, the Trust will sell the Limited Partnership Interests to Otter at their combined fair market values of $400,508. Accordingly, the Trust will sell the Interests for an aggregate sales price of $461,914. 6 The rental income minus the Prior Plan Accounts' pro rata share of the interest which was due but never received under the second deed of trust loan minus the interest which reasonably would have accrued on the holding costs equals $8,689 ($36,349 ^$23,554 ^$4,106). Because the holding costs amount to $11,406, the remaining rental income of $8,689 is insufficient to cover these costs. See Representation # 5 for an explanation of the rental income received by the Prior Plan Accounts. See Footnotes # 4 and # 5 for an explanation as to how the applicants calculated the interest attributable to the second deed of trust loan and the holding costs, respectively. 7. In summary, it is represented that the transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) All terms and conditions of the Sale will be at least as favorable to the Prior Plan Accounts as those obtainable in an arm's length transaction; (b) the Sale will be a one-time cash transaction; (c) the Prior Plan Accounts will not be required to pay any commissions, costs or other expenses in connection with the Sale; (d) the Prior Plan Accounts will receive a sales price equal to the greater of the: (1) the fair market values of the Interests as determined by qualified, independent appraisers; or (2) the Prior Plan Accounts' aggregate costs of acquiring and holding the Interests; (e) the trustee of the Plan will determine that the Sale is appropriate for the Prior Plan Accounts and is in the best interests of the Prior Plan Accounts and their participants and beneficiaries; (f) the Prior Plan Accounts, prior to the Sale, will obtain the written consent of the general partner of each of the limited partnerships involved; and (g) the other partners of such limited partnerships, as per the limited partnership agreements, will be given the right of first refusal with respect to the Limited Partnership Interests.
