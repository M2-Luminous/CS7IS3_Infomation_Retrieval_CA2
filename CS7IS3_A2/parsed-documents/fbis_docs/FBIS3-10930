The article notes that a high-level delegation from LA REPUBLICA Publishing House Inc. visited Trujillo to oversee the progress of a project to create regional satellite editions of the newspapers LA REPUBLICA and EL POPULAR, scheduled to go into circulation within 60 days. Vecco reports that this project, which carries a cost of $250,000, envisages the establishment of LA REPUBLICA regional branches in Trujillo, Chiclayo, and Piura which, while having "total technological and news support from Lima," will hire local manpower and cover local news to cater to an increasing readership. The newspapers will be printed in Chiclayo, but there will be editorial offices in each city.
