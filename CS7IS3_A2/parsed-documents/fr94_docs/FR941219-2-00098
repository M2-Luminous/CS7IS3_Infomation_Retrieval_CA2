FR941219-2-00098 FR941219-2-00061 National Park Service Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Program AGENCY: National Park Service, U.S. Dept. of the Interior. ACTION: Notice of FY&hyph;1995 Grant Round_UPARR Rehabilitation and Innovation Grants. SUMMARY: This notice announces the availability of grant funds under the Rehabilitation and Innovation phases of the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery (UPARR) Program and provides information on the application process including eligible recipients and deadlines for submission of proposals. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: ``UPARR,'' Recreation Grants Division, National Park Service, Department of the Interior, P.O. Box 37127, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;7127; (202) 343&hyph;3700. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: For Fiscal Year 1995, $7,486,000 is available for the funding of Rehabilitation and Innovation projects under the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95&hyph;625). NPS will consider proposals for funding projects with a dollar limit of $200,000 (Federal share of total project cost) under the Rehabilitation phase of the program and projects with a dollar limit of $50,000 (Federal share) under the Innovation phase. No more than ten percent ($748,600) of the total amount appropriated will go toward the funding of Innovation proposals. Preapplications must be received by the appropriate NPS Regional Office by no later than April 17, 1995. Rehabilitation grants will be targeted to rehabilitate existing neighborhood recreation areas and facilities which have deteriorated to the point where health and safety are endangered or the community's range of quality recreation service is impaired. Proposals must be designed to provide recreation services for residents within a specified area identified by the applicant. Proposals may identify improvements at multiple sites or facilities, each of which must be individually addressed. Grants may be used to remodel, rebuild, expand, or develop existing outdoor or indoor recreation areas and facilities. Innovation grants may generally cover the costs of personnel, training, facilities, recreation equipment, supplies or services associated with the development of cost-effective ideas, concepts, and approaches towards improving facility design, operations, or programming for the delivery of recreation services. Innovation projects should contribute to a systems approach to recreation by linking recreation services with other critical community programs such as housing, transportation, health and public safety, water quality, energy conservation, crime prevention, etc. The project should demonstrate a concept that is untried, unique, and/or advances the state of the art for recreation at the national, regional or local level. Interested jurisdictions are directed to 36 CFR 72.45 for more detailed discussion of fundable elements under the Innovation phase of the UPARR program. In response to widespread interest in programs that help prevent urban crime, 1995 grant awards will focus on, but not be limited to, youth-at-risk approaches_for example, innovation programs that combine recreation with education, counselling or mentoring activities aimed at teens and/or rehabilitation proposals that target facilities that will supply key recreation opportunities for the target youth populations. Program participants may be aware that a new category of UPARR grants, called ``At-Risk-Youth'' grants, was established as part of the 1994 Omnibus Crime Bill. However, funding is not authorized for such grants before 1996. Consequently, the 1995 grant round will highlight crime prevention in recreation programs, without being limited exclusively to such grants. Preparations are now underway for administration of the new UPARR grants authorized in the Crime Bill should funding for these become available in 1996 or subsequent years. Eligible Jurisdictions: Urban jurisdictions as listed in 36 CFR part 72 appendix B will be eligible. Additional jurisdictions meeting the criteria for eligibility described in 36 CFR part 72 appendix A, and having been approved as discretionary applicants by NPS, may also compete. All applicants must have a Recovery Action Program (RAP) which has been approved by NPS within the past five years, and all projects must be in accord with the priorities outlined in the approved RAPs. Grant Implementation and Timing: Grantees must comply with all applicable Federal laws and regulations for the UPARR program, which include completion of a final grant agreement within 120 days of a grant offer (based on NPS evaluation of preapplications submitted for consideration). Preapplication Requirements: Local chief elected officials (mayors, etc.) applying for UPARR grants will be required to certify, in the preapplication, that the grantee will comply with all requirements of the UPARR program. Applicants must also identify the type of control they have over properties to be assisted. Additional requirements are outlined in the UPARR PREAPPLICATION HANDBOOK (updated for 1995) available from the Regional Offices of NPS. Matching Requirements: UPARR Rehabilitation and Innovation grants are awarded on a 70/30 (Federal/local) matching basis. As an incentive for state involvement in the program, the Federal Government will match, dollar for dollar, state contributions to the local share of the total project cost, up to 15 percent of the approved grant. The Federal share is limited to no more than 85 percent of the approved grant cost and the overall dollar limitations established above for Rehabilitation and Innovation grants, respectively. Pass-Through Funding: At the discretion of the applicant jurisdiction, grants may be transferred, in whole or in part, to independent general or special purpose local governments, private nonprofit agencies or community groups, and county or regional park authorities that provide recreation opportunities to the general population within the jurisdictional boundaries of the applicant jurisdiction. In such situations, the applicant jurisdiction will bear full legal responsibility and liability for passed-through funds. Post-Completion Requirements: In accordance with Section 1010 of the UPARR Act of 1978, assisted properties may not be converted to other than public recreation use without the prior approval of NPS and the replacement of the converted site or facility with one of reasonably equivalent usefulness and location. This provision may not be applicable to funded Innovation projects depending upon the nature of the assistance provided.
