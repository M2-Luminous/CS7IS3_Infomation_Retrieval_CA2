The revised draft law places more emphasis on workers' interests than did the first version. It is to be further deliberated at the current session of the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, which opened here today. The revised draft suggests that when an enterprise has to lay people off in face of difficulties in production or on the brink of bankruptcy, the management should inform the trade union or all of its employees 30 days in advance and seek their consensus. The dismissed workers should be given first priority when the enterprise wants to recruit any staff within six months after the lay-off. The draft law puts a 44 hours per month ceiling on extended working hours, compared with the 48-hour ceiling in the first draft. Workers who work overtime, work on days off or during their holidays should be paid at time-and-a-half, double-time or treble-time rates, the draft says. The revised draft has explicit stipulations on labor disputes. For example, a dispute could be patched up by the enterprise's mediation committee. But a worker is entitled to ask for arbitration from the relevant authorities. He or she could bring the case to court when disagreeing with the arbitration. The labor dispute mediation committee should be jointly formed by representatives of employees, enterprise management and trade union. The chairman of the committee, however, should come from the trade union, the draft says. The first version of the draft law demanded that a labor contract system should be adopted in all state enterprise. But the revised draft describes the contract system as the right direction and the final goal, which may need to be reached step by step in some provinces and cities where the social welfare network has yet to be built up and improved. China now has 35 million workers on contracts, about a third of the workforce in state enterprises. To ensure workers on a contract have a relatively secure job, especially when they are past their prime, the draft says that when the employer and employee agree to extend the contract, the worker has the right to stipulate the length of the extension. But to have this right, the worker will need to have worked in the enterprise for at least ten years without a gap.
