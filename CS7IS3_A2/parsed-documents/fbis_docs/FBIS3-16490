[cubic meters] of natural gas to Ukraine between 1 and 10 March 1994, which was even more than the planned amount (by 128.1 million cu. m.) Obviously, Gazprom's statement about its alleged intention to drastically curtail Russian natural gas supplies to Ukraine, which was widely circulated by the media, cried wolf. In the meantime, on 10 March Moscow was the venue of negotiations between Russia's Gazprom and a Ukrainian government delegation led by vice-premier Valentin Landik on the sensitive issue of Russian gas supplies to Ukraine. The crucial negotiations resulted in an articulated agreement on Russian gas supply resumption in full. The Russian side went even further to state its intention to supply about 80 per cent of natural gas, which Ukraine used to receive from Turkmenistan or would have received from there has it not been for the Central Asian nation's decision to discontinue its natural gas supplies to Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian vice-premier, a protocol was signed in Moscow, under which the two parties pledged to arrange their account settling within a month. Ukraine's gas indebtedness for the 1994, first quarter's supplies will be repaid via monetary means. 1993's indebtedness (which, as Gazprom's spokepersons maintain, exceeds 1.5 trillion rubles) is to be repaid, in 50 per cent parts, in hard currency and Russian rubles, and via equipment and material supplies to Russian natural gas extractors. Russia's statements, blaming Ukraine for allegedly curtailed natural gas supplies to Russia's West European customers in late January and early February, perhaps, should also be taken with a grain of salt. In real fact, precisely at that time, Russia's Gazprom attempted to make its West European clients, primarily Germany, pay higher prices for its gas through curtailed gas exports on its own. According to Ukrgazprom, the Russian exporter curtailed gas supplies in a most drastic manner to Germany, Bulgaria, Turkey and Hungary. Russian natural gas transit across Ukraine's territory in January and February, 1994 could be characterized by the following data: January February Factual In excess of Factual In excess of Supplies plants (+) Supplies plants (+) undersupplied undersupplied amount (-) amounts (-) (million cu. m.) (million cu. m.) Czechia, 7,030.5 +13.5 5,670.7 -237.3 Slovakia, Germany Yugoslavia, 228.0 -123.0 222.0 -46.8 (France, Austria), Poland Romania 464.5 +67.5 372.7 +14.3 Bulgaria, 947.0 -161.0 851.2 -254.8 Turkey Hungary 498.9 -188.0 451.3 -187.1 Though none of Ukrgazprom officials chose to assume responsibility of making a statement to refute accusations against Ukraine of allegedly using Russian gas intended for exports to West Europe, which were circulated by Russia's and Hungary's media, such accusations provided grounds to Russia to lay the blame for natural gas undersupplies to West Europe at Ukraine's door. Nonetheless, during a meeting on 11 March with Hungarian President A. Genz Ukraine's Ambassador to Hungary D. Tkach assured him, on behalf of the Ukrainian State Committee for oil and gas, to which Ukrgazprom is immediately reportable, that Ukraine would unswervingly comply with its natural gas transit commitments. As it also became known, the Ukrainian side agreed to consider the issue of allowing Russia to jointly own some of Ukraine's major pipe-lines and underground gas storages, which will be negotiated at a bilateral Russo-Ukrainian meeting on 10 April. In view of the upcoming process of transforming state-owned enterprises within Ukraine's petroleum-gas complex into joint-stock societies (which is expected to start, when President Kravchuk signs the draft decree "On procedures for preparing for selling stocks of open-type joint-stock societies established through corporatization") the Russian side's demand may be met quite legitimately through acquisition by Russian enterprises of Ukrgazprom's stocks. However, Russia's joint ownership of Ukraine's pipe-line network and underground reservoirs will require a decision by the government, since, according to the endorsed documents for Ukrgazprom's corporatization, both the gas transport network and underground storages should remain the state's property. Russia's access to Ukraine's gas pipe-line system as the latter's co-owner, personified by Gazprom, is supposed to guarantee security of Russian natural gas supplies to West Europe, since Ukraine will not be in a position to unilaterally pump out the exported raw material for its own needs, should supplies to Ukraine be curtailed. More likely than not, in case the scheme materializes, Russia will be able to quite legally shift a part of responsibility for any undersupplies likely to happen to Ukraine. Presently, the declared by Russia curtailment of natural gas supplies to Ukraine is technically very hard to verify. Moreover, the Ukrainian party will become legally liable before Russian natural gas buyers and very unlikely to dictate its charges for transit services. No reliable and exact data are currently available about what facilities may be turned over to Russia. Yet, back in September 1993, when Ukraine's fuel indebtedness to Russia reached the ball park of 750 billion rubles, Gazprom ventilated long-term lease of certain facilities in Ukraine as a minimal and partial redemption of the debt. These reportedly included gas supply depots in Kiev, Uzhgorod, Nikolaev, underground gas storages in Ukraine's border regions, as well as port facilities in Odessa and Ilyichevsk. Russia's Gazprom is also known to have vigorously opposed a plan, which provided for repayment of a part of Ukraine's fuel debt to Russia by means of nuclear weapons, dismantled in Ukraine and transferred to Russia. However, on 17 January 1994, when an agreement was reached on gas supplies to Ukraine, Gazprom pledged to keep to this schedule of supplies: 10.3 b. cu. m. in the 1st quarter, 15.6 b. cu. m. in the 2nd quarter, 18.2 b. cu. m. in the 3d quarter, and 7.8 b. cu. m. in the last quarter of 1994. As Ukrainian gas officials maintain, the schedule is not very convenient for Ukraine, in technological terms. Proceeding from data, regularly published by UBN [UKRINFORM Business News], the latest agreements on the parties' obligations Gazprom appears intent on shrinking to the agreed supply schedule. Reductions in total gas import amounts due to supply discontinuance by Turkmenistan were not so critical as to make the situation a crisis one, Taras Freyuk, Ukrgaz deputy chief asserts. Moreover, a spell of warm weather, which has recently set in, allows to radically reduce natural gas consumption by housing and public utilities, which normally account for about a third of the nation's total natural gas consumption. As statistical data suggest, a one-degree drop in temperature entails extraconsumption of 4.5 million cu. m. of gas Ukraine-wide. According to T. Freyuk, daily gas consumption by the above sector dropped by 100 million cu. m. All-in-all, during the 1-10 March period Ukraine's gas consumption amounted to 2,983.6 million cu. m., according to Ukrgazprom sources, which was by 520.4 million cu. m. less than expected. Only debtor enterprises among Ukraine's over 80,000 enterprises were hit by curtailed gas supplies. Many of enterprises shifted to alternative fuels, such as oil fuel, if their technological processes allowed to do so. However, as T. Freyuk maintains, Ukraine's domestic payment crisis remains a major challenge. The gas supply problem would be automatically resolved, were it not for the consumer-enterprises' untimely payments for fuels supplied to them. According to both Ukrgazprom and Ukrgaz spokespersons, many debtor enterprises start repaying their debts only after gas supplies to them are curtailed and they are notified about imminent supply suspension. State-budgeted enterprises, including those of the housing and public amenities sector, are entitled to continuous gas supplies, though. So far, Turkmen natural gas supplies have not resumed after they were discontinued on 22 February 1994 by the Turkmen government's decision in view of Ukraine's indebtedness. According to formation, which was disclosed by Ukrgazprom's operational and dispatching service sources; not a single cu. m. of Turkmen natural gas has reached Ukraine since then. The issue of Turkmen gas supply resumption remains thus suspended. Ukrgazprom's spokespersons refused to confirm information about Turkmenistan's official statement to the effect of its intention to sell its gas to Russia, should Ukraine fail to comply with Turkmenistan's terms, and Russia likely to resell it then to Ukraine, at a much higher price. Turkmen natural gas was priced at 50 US dollars per 1,000 cu. m. Nonetheless, such a decision by Turkmenistan appears to be a likely one, considering Russia's agreement to supply 80 per cent of the amount, which Turkmenistan earlier undertook to supply to Ukraine. The price and duration issue with regard to these supplies has not been settled yet. As Andrew Marshall, a participant in the current session of the European Parliament, tends to believe, Russia played a trump card with Turkmenistan both to bring pressure to bear on Ukraine's and demonstrate its prestige and significance in the East-European region. Pedalling Ukraine's gas supply challenge has also spurred the USA to increase its aid to Ukraine and prompted Britain to offers its go-between services in a bid to muster support from international financial institutions and elicit credits to Ukraine to repay its fuel debt to Russia. So, it is Russia, who appears primarily to benefit from this problem's shift from the field of economics to the domain of politics, and very likely to have gains in both.
