Three groups have been set up under the committee, of which one is headed by the Secretary, Chemicals and Petrochemicals. The Convention is to come into force in the beginning of 1995 with the international secretariat being established in the Hague while each signatory nation is to set up a national authority. A strong technical support structure required for this in the shape of trained manpower and laboratory back up is also being planned. This was disclosed here today by the Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilizers, Mr Eduardo Faleiro, while addressing the Parliamentary Consultative Committee attached to his Ministry. Mr. Faleiro told members that the National Authority will collect, transmit and obtain data relating to chemicals identified in the Convention. It will also oversee the need to ensure that Indian production facilities do not get over-exposed to international inspections of such facilities. He felt this was most important since technology needed to be guarded and inspection should not become a means for obtaining information which could allow for duplication of such technology in other parts of the world. Mr. Faleiro noted that the Convention is non-discriminatory and non-confrontationist in its approach and seeks to eliminate all chemical weapons within a fixed time frame. Chemicals which come under schedule III, however, have a dual purpose as many of them can be used for weapons but also have important benign uses in production of pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Signatory nations will not have any unfair intrusions into the way they utilise these chemicals, apart from keeping a centrally established nodal international secretariat informed about production, storage and trade in such weapons. The Government will work closely with the chemical industry to finalise measures to implement the provisions of the Convention. Interaction with industry has already begun as several meetings have taken place between industry representatives and the Department of Chemicals during which implications of the Convention have been conveyed to them. The Minister stressed that it was essential for the Government and industry to work together to ensure that the international secretariat is not able to build a case against any production unit in the country. This was all the more important since it is well established that we have no chemicals weapons activity in the country. He said the implications of the Chemical Weapons Convention on the industry mainly relate to becoming more transparent in its functioning and in reporting details of production and sale.
