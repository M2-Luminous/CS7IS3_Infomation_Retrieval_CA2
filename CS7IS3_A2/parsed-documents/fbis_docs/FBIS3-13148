Pakistan has also been included in the framework of regional cooperation and to that extent it appears that closer ties with India are not being sought at the expense of its close ties with this country. However, there are clear indications that the regional scenario is changing, Iran, for instance, has signed a number of agreements of considerable economic significance with India. Given the primacy of economic interest and Iran's relative isolation in the international community, such ties are likely to supersede most other considerations. It is significant also that on the eve of the vote in the Human Rights Commission on the issue of human rights violations in Kashmir the Iranian foreign minister seems to have endorsed the Indian position favoring a resolution through bilateral negotiations between India and Pakistan. The new alignments taking shape in the region would suggest that the potential of Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO), now emerging as a major regional economic arrangement, has been reduced. As for our close ties with China, again it would be useful to keep in mind the recent thaw in Sino-Indian relations whereby the two countries have agreed to reduce tensions with regard to their border dispute. In the aftermath of the break-up of the Soviet Union, India's ally and China's adversary, India and China clearly appear to be moving towards a relationship very different from the one they have had for approximately three decades. Apart from the economic ties that are developing between the three states, a common concern is that of resisting pressure from the United States which Iran, China and India, have felt in unsettling, albeit different, ways. This has been translated into a call for minimising external interference in the region and the internal affairs of states. Pakistan itself subject to a US aid cut-off as a result of differences on the nuclear issue may well appreciate the sentiment but will have to be guided also by the prevailing situation on the ground especially vis-a-vis India. In any case Pakistan should be realistic and take due cognizance of changes taking place in the region. It has to accept that sovereign states are free to choose their allies or friends in accordance with their perceived and changing interests. Undue sentimentality in this context has caught us unawares in the past and adversely affected our ability to adjust in time to changed circumstances. If the new regional order entails closer ties between China and Iran on the one hand and our major adversary India on the other, then so be it. We may still be in a position to use our relationship with the former to influence the latter in some ways with regard to working towards an acceptable resolution of key outstanding issues such as Kashmir and nuclear non-proliferation in the region. In any case, while not compromising on our basic national interests and keeping these in view maintaining friendly relations with different countries, it is important to ensure that the on-going developments do not eventually lead to a distancing from longstanding friends in the region.
