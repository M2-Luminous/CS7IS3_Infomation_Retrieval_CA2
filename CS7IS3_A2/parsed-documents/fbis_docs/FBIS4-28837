He also urged North Korea to implement all nuclear safeguards measures, though belatedly. You will listen to it directly from him. [Begin Yi Hong-ku recording] I cannot but clearly point out that North Korea's withdrawing from the mechanism of all safeguards measures for ensuring the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would decisively run counter to a peaceful solution to the nuclear problem [pihaekhwarul pojanghanun modun anjonjochiui tureso pukhani ital handanun kosun haengmunjeui pyongjok haegyore kyolchongjoguro yokhaeng handanun kosul myongbaekhui chijokhaji anulsu opsumnida].
