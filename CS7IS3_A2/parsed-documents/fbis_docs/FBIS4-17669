In an interview with Interfax-Ukraine Monday, he said "in this case it would be necessary to relocate about 4,000 families of officers and midshipmen of the Ukrainian Navy." "Under the current economic situation in Ukraine, this is practically impossible," Bezkorovainyy said. A top-ranking Ukrainian Navy officer told INTERFAX-Ukraine that stationing the Ukrainian navy in Balaklava was impossible. The officer added that "in the bay of Balaklava there were only 17 moorages, 15 of which were already occupied by border guards' boats." Prior to this, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said the Ukrainian navy could be stationed in Balaklava. The same source was quoted as saying that "vessels with a displacement of more than 1,000 tons presently built for Ukraine's fleet -- patrol boats and small anti-submarine vessels -- cannot enter the bay." To ensure the fleet's normal functioning, it also needs to use the Streletskaya and Karantinnaya bays situated within Sevastopol's city line, a source in the Ukrainian navy headquarters said. The same source supposed that the Ukrainian navy could jointly use 17 infrastructural installations of the Black Sea Fleet located in Sevastopol. "Only in this case the Ukrainian navy will be able to develop normally," the officer added.
