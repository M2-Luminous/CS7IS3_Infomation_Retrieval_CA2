At a meeting of young people from France and Germany in Heidelberg, both statesmen emphasized that Europe's unification ensures peace and freedom for future generations. Addressing about 6,000 young people, Mitterrand stressed that numerous rivalries and passions separated the Germans and the French in the past. The things that divide them must be overcome with an "invincible will." Franco-German reconciliation after World War II has paved the way for Europe. The European Union was founded by 12 states in Maastricht. Soon it will include 16 countries. "In the 21st century, we must think of the whole of Europe," the president stressed. Mitterrand pointed out that every country should "maintain its identity and be proud of its history," and "we must now develop a common history." Kohl called on the young people to support the vision of united Europe with all their strength. Without the Franco-German partnership after World War II, the work of European unification would not have been initiated. The chancellor assessed the fact that so many young people participated in the meeting, which took place under the slogan "Shaping Europe," as proof that the two peoples have become friends. Kohl called on the young people to prevent a return of the evil specters of nationalism of the past. Every generation is facing this challenge anew. Young people from German and French sports and other clubs, school and town partnerships, participants in exchange programs, and soldiers from the Franco-German brigade are participating in the meeting, which was also attended by the foreign ministers of both countries, Klaus Kinkel and Alain Juppe, and French Minister for Youth and Sports Michele Alliot-Marie and her German counterpart Angela Merkel. In the evening, Mitterrand and Kohl discussed ideas about a future Europe with 200 young people at the youth festival which was accompanied by musical and artistic events.
