No consensus has been reached yet concerning issues pertaining to the future national police force. Lusaka today should see the mediators hold separate meetings with the negotiating teams. Pedro Manuel, our correspondent in the Zambian capital, reports: [Begin Manuel recording] Good morning, dear listeners. Yet another day opens without consensus on the future national police issue, all because there continue to be differences in the positions adopted by the two negotiating teams. Today, the mediators and observers are expected to continue holding separate meetings with the negotiating teams. Since 13 January, the negotiators have been seeking an understanding that will allow discussions to begin on specific principles and modalities governing the future national police force. At their separate meetings, the negotiating teams have been delivering to the observers their written views on what they believe the aforesaid specific principles should be. However, no gap has been bridged yet, so UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye and the peace process observers have decided to continue holding separate meetings. [end recording]
