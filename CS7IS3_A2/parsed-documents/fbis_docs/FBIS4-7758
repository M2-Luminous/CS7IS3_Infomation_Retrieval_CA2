In its proposal, the Ministry of Defense will determine which long-term orders directly affect the country's ability to defend itself. The state will then focus mainly on this area, and the arms-industry's chances of obtaining such orders will look more promising, Vaclav Klaus declared. The second group of arms-industry items will be defined less precisely, and the state's long-term approach to it will be much looser. The state will not organize the export of arms production, the prime minister declared further. It will only carefully monitor the fairness of economic competition and compliance with legislative regulations concerning production and exports. Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said that, once the program for the Czech Army's reequipment has been drawn up, talks will be initiated with Czech firms that will be able to participate in the Army's reequipment. The process of reequipment will last up to 10 years, according to Baudys. The Army's reequipment would bring long-term state orders for a number of companies. As early as the late 1980's, for example, the Ceska Zbrojovka [Czech Arms Factory] company in Uhersky Brod started to develop a set of new-generation small arms called Lada. The technical development and testing of the weapon have been wound up, and the company is waiting only for a state order. As representatives of Ceska Zbrojovka told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, after the acquisition of the order, the technical preparation for the production of the Lada set will require three more years and investments of approximately 500 million korunas [Kc]. A state order would be worthwhile for the Uhersky Brod arms factory and would also expand its export potential. The company does not need it in order to survive, however. It exports about 66 percent of its present production to 46 states all over the world. The biggest importers of its products are customers in Austria, the FRG, and the United States. The aggregate revenues of Ceska Zbrojovka Uhersky Brod a.s. reached Kc516 million last year. This year it expects to take in Kc900 million; the projected profit for this year is Kc105 million.
