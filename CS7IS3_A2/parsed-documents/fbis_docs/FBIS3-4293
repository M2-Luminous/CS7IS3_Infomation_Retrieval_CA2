At a late evening press briefing on Monday [28 March] that followed his meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Han said he was leaving later Tuesday for the United States to discuss Beijing's proposal with Washington. "We (South Korea) have not yet chosen between a (binding) resolution and a (non-binding) statement," Han said. "We have to weigh the pros and cons of China's proposal (for a statement) and for this purpose, I am going to Washington, taking with me China's position and explanation," Han said. "The pros of a statement of the Security Council is that it would be feasible on a consensus base and would leave a greater possibility of a negotiated solution," Han said. "China says that it will have more to do (in international efforts to resolve the nuclear standoff) when there remains some possibility of dialogue," he said. In the United Nations Monday Security Council president, Jean-Bernard Merimee, said differences between China, a traditional ally of North Korea, and other permanent council members, had bogged down UN action on the nuclear inspections row. "Certain delegations still hope for a resolution," Merimee said, instead of a non-binding statement issued by the council president, which China has said it would consider if the wording were objective and mild. Merimee also said he would meet with Han during his visit to New York Tuesday, before Han heads to Washington. South Korea has called on China to take a more active role in persuading North Korea to accept nuclear inspections. Han indicated he was in favor of a statement as a first step in order to ensure support from Beijing. Last week, the United States pushed for a draft resolution that would have pressed Pyongyang to give International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts unimpeded access to all its nuclear facilities. The U.S. move followed an IAEA report last Monday that it had been unable to inspect a radiochemical laboratory at the Yongbyon nuclear facility outside the North Korean capital Pyongyang. The U.S. draft text also called for IAEA Director General Hans Blix to report on the situation again in a month. China, however, refused to accept a resolution to pressure North Korea, leading the United States and the other permanent council members France, Russia and Britain, to consider a weaker presidential statement in order to keep China on board, rather than seeing it abstain on or veto a resolution. In Washington, however, the United States sounded set to drop its call for a resolution in favor of a statement, if the phrasing were right. Han arrived here Monday for a stop off visit, before flying to the United States for talks at the United Nations and in Washington then heading to Japan to discuss the Chinese proposal and coordinate international efforts to resolve the nuclear issue. Answering a question about the results of President Kim Yong-sam's meeting with Chinese leader Jiang Zemin here on Monday, Han said the meeting had seen "the most direct and straightforward" exchange of views he had ever seen. But he denied that Bejing had suggested that Seoul was reponsible for aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula with a decision to deploy defensive Patriot missiles or to resume joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises in response to the North's rejection of nuclear inspections. Kim said he would decide on when to start the exercises, named Team Spirit, after he returned home Wednesday from China. Jiang on Monday demanded that Kim to stop Team Spirit and the planned deployment of Patriots in order to seek a negotiated solution to the crisis.
