FR940222-0-00019 FR940222-0-00006 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;149&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8829; AD 94&hyph;04&hyph;09] Airworthiness Directives; de Havilland, Inc., Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and DHC&hyph;8&hyph;300 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and DHC&hyph;8&hyph;300 series airplanes, that requires inspections to detect breakage in the engine rear mount strut assemblies, and replacement of broken struts. This amendment also requires eventual replacement of all currently installed struts with new and/or reworked struts, as terminating action for the inspections. This amendment is prompted by several reports of failure of the engine rear mount struts, due to fracture at one of the rosette welds on the shank of the strut where full weld depth was not achieved during manufacture. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent fracture of the engine rear mount struts, which could reduce the structural integrity of the nacelle and engine support structure. DATES: Effective March 24, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of March 24, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from de Havilland, Inc., Garratt Boulevard, Downsview, Ontario M3K 1Y5, Canada. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, New York Aircraft Certification Office, 181 South Franklin Avenue, room 202, Valley Stream, New York; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jon Hjelm, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ANE&hyph;172, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, New York Aircraft Certification Office, 181 South Franklin Avenue, room 202, Valley Stream, New York 11581; telephone (516) 791&hyph;6220; fax (516) 791&hyph;9024. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and DHC&hyph;8&hyph;300 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 55031). That action proposed to require repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect breakage in the engine strut assemblies, and replacement of broken struts with new and/or reworked struts. That action also proposed to require eventual replacement of the currently installed struts with new and/or reworked struts; when accomplished, this replacement would terminate the need for the repetitive inspections. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the single comment received. The commenter supports the proposed rule. After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. The FAA estimates that 125 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 16 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $110,000, or $880 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.
