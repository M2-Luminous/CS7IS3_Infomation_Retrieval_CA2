Entrusted by the State Council, Song Jian, state councillor and minister of the State Scientific and Technological Commission, discussed the "government work report" together with Hebei deputies and listened to their opinions. Deputy Liu Zongyao said: "As indicated by Premier Li Peng in his government work report, we should closely combine scientific and technological progress with the economy and should translate scientific and technological achievements into practical productive forces. These remarks have inspired us greatly." Liu Zongyao said: At present, the construction of synthetic materials is developing very quickly in the world. To facilitate exchange and cooperation between China and the world, we are required to establish a nationwide association with regard to this discipline as quickly as possible. However, this is a cross-professional discipline, and thus its establishment has not yet been decided. After hearing this, Song Jian said: "Give me one copy of the data, and I will help you in this work." Deputy Liu Zongyao revealed that at present a product must undergo too many reckless technological appraisals, and that quality control is not strict. On hearing this, Deputy Ye Liansong said: "The more the market economy develops, the more quality control should be strengthened. We should rapidly develop some authoritative intermediate organizations to strictly conduct appraisals in order to prevent fake and inferior products from passing the inspections." Deputy Zhou Deman revealed that some large and medium-sized enterprises are overloaded with burdens and thus are having difficulties in operation. Deputies Cheng Weigao and Ye Liansong said: We should invigorate large and medium-sized enterprises. If we refuse to increase investment in science and technology and refuse to develop readily marketable products through technological progress, invigoration will be an empty talk. Enterprises should not depend on the state to increase the investment in science and technology, but should be willing to release a portion of their funds for research and development of new products. All products have an infancy period, growth period, mature period, and old period. We should produce a generation of products, research a generation of products, and store a generation of products from a long-term point of view. By saying that some enterprises bear heavy burdens, it means, in the final analysis, that they lag behind in products and efficiency. Refusing to exert great efforts in technological progress, an enterprise will witness a down cycle and its situation will become difficult increasingly. In her speech, Deputy Chen Bingzhen expressed with deep feeling: Several years ago, some hot issues concerning education began to cool down. Conducting a series of major reform measures among institutions of higher learning for this, the state has provided a two-way choice for distribution of college graduates and encouraged college graduates to study abroad and return freely. The state has also popularized the credit system. These measures have encouraged students to make positive progress and has stabilized campuses. She added: Reform has forced the research achievements of colleges to go beyond the laboratory. [passage omitted] Song Jian said: Both the promotion of technological progress of enterprises and the operation of education, science, and technology requires funds and requires economic strength as their backing. This year, the state has again increased the input in science, technology, and education, thus manifesting its high attention to them. He said: For a long time in the past, we were accustomed to conservative, backward, and narrow traditional concepts and to outmoded production forms so our productive forces were very low. With the start of reform and opening up, however, we have effected great change and enhancement. We should further seize the opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening up, maintain stability, and enhance labor productivity on a large scale. Song Jian said: Achieving success in reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, we should fully depend on and exploit the creativity of the people and pay attention to the pioneering spirit of the people. We should dare to make innovations, try everything, and conduct reform. So long as we unite as one under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we will be able to overcome difficulties and press forward reform, opening up, and modernization.
