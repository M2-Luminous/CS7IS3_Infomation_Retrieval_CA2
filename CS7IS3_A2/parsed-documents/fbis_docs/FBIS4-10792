Portal gave a detailed explanation of the causes that have brought the power system to the brink of collapse, and he said that with the measures now being implemented, Cuba might reach 60 percent of its generation capacity by December. During the most critical days, capacity fell to 36 percent, which resulted in relentless power outages, and today, according to the minister, capacity is at about 50 percent. He said one of the most important steps taken was to improve the working conditions of laborers in this sector, mainly in terms of provisions and incentives. This, along with the startup of two new power plants, the purchase of $10 million in spare parts, and strict control over public and private energy consumption over the next few months, should alleviate the situation by the end of the year. "There are solutions, but we cannot accomplish miracles," Portal remarked, after pointing out the current crisis has been caused by breakdowns and poor maintenance of the nation's thermoelectric plants, the majority of which are Soviet and Czech built; the country's difficult financial situation; and the use of local crude, whose high sulfur content damages the generators. According to the minister, the supply of spare parts was interrupted in 1990, and since then the thermoelectric plants have been repaired or maintained with the reserve stock of spare parts. Also, according to the minister, consumption of electricity in homes increased 14 percent over the previous year during the first quarter of 1994, mainly because of the use of electric stoves, which are often homemade, because of a lack of cooking gas, which is very scarce. "It is not possible for every home to cook with electricity, because the nation's power system could never assimilate the demand," insisted Marcos Portal, after promising that, little by little, the distribution of liquified gas would resume. He also said "there are no privileges" in terms of power interruptions. He added that the incidents which occurred over the past few days in some Havana neighborhoods were provoked "by malicious people." Last week, the power outages lasted up to 20 hours in different areas of the capital, which sparked angry protests of residents and incidents in neighborhoods such as Alamar and downtown Havana.
