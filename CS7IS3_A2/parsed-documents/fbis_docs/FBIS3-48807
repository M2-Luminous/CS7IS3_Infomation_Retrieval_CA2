Takeshita said: "The agency in charge of the construction has not been informed of any change." He also denied the report, saying his inquiry with the Maritime Staff Office has confirmed "such is not the case." Meanwhile, it is also true that the DFAA has not much time left to execute the budget for the construction of the P3C communications facility. Furthermore, since the government formulation of the fiscal 1994 budget has been delayed this year, and the work on formulating the portion of the budget concerning the P3C project will begin in about a month, no doubt the DFAA faces a major problem in regards to the construction project which is making no headway.
