As a sign of protest against detention of pay. "This is not a strike," stated trade union leader Sofya Sirotina in clarifying the position of the miners. "It is an act of protest. We want to work, but not for free. They have not paid us since December." Contrary to directives, but in accordance with her trade union duties, Sofya Vasilyevna descended to the mine drift with the workers and sat five days underground while the management tried to find money. "If today they find the money for Beltsevskaya," stated Leonid Zavodchikov, general director of the Tulaugol association, in predicting the possible development of events, "tomorrow the entire basin will 'stand down.' The budget owes us 38 billion, but the government is not even thinking about settling with us." Leonid Vasilyevich's prediction partially came true. When the December-January pay made its way from the bank to Beltsevskaya, the Zapadnaya mine went on strike. Mostovskaya and Progress joined in the next day. Responding to the question of what demands were being made by the miners, V. Terekhov, chairman of the trade union of Zapadnaya mine, stated that the demands were not yet formulated and a strike committee had not even been organized. The strike took place spontaneously. The main demand was wages. But rejoinders are already resounding on early presidential elections and resignation of the government. Existence Determines Consciousness In the opinion of L. Popov, chairman of the territorial committee of the trade union of Tulaugol association coal miners, the degree of readiness for a strike is determined by many factors, and the issue of wages does not always play the decisive role among them. Vorkuta mine workers can obtain food products only from the store. But in the Moscow area, the miners have garden plots, and so obtain potatoes, vegetables, often pork. This substantially alters views on conducting strikes. "Some are prepared to strike today," L. Popov states. "About 30 percent are in this category. Others promise: 'We will support you.' Then there are those who say: 'We have not yet determined our position.' And still others see no sense in any of this. At least now there is something to demand. But when we just strike the time away, there is nothing to get out of it. The Lipkovskaya mine, for example, has consistently avoided strikes all these years." Even within the framework of one collective there is divergence of opinion. One example from the plans division of the Zapadnaya mine: Underground equipment operator D. Shreyder writes up a petition every time--"I request that the administration guarantee me work, since I do not wish to strike." It turns out that one of Shreyder's division coworkers sympathizes with him. Another, on the contrary, supports the strikers, believing that necessity has pushed them to this point. A Tool for Burying Money L. Zavodchikov attests that there are mines in the Tulaugol combine that are subsidized to the extent of 98-100 percent by the state, i.e., they operate for themselves alone. Hundreds of people go underground, hack their way through the seam, ingest the dust, and move coal to the surface which then undergoes combustion to heat up their own mine shafts. An ideal tool for burying the taxpayer's money. Nor are the ordinary mines, those that are "average" according to indices, enriching the country. At Zapadnaya, for example, 1,246 people are supposed to extract (according to the plan) 786 tonnes per day, but they actually extract 270 tonnes. In this regard, the production cost of a tonne of coal is around 40,000 rubles [R], while the selling price is R9,000. For the combine in general, over 80 percent of the coal production is subsidized by the state. "In fact, we are budget workers," L. Zavodchikov admits. In other words, the coal sector is the operator's locomotive, which collides by inertia with the financial stability of the state. In this manner, assertions that mine workers "make their living at the expense of the old people" are doubly justified. And this is where one sees dramatic theater in the coal industry. It is just that in one instance the old people are real, and in another--abstract. Paradoxical as it may seem, today strikes conducted by the miners are advantageous to the government. The less the miners work, the less is the detriment to the budget. And judging from all appearances, the government is aware of this. There Will Be No Easy Decisions The ineffectiveness of strikes will hardly force miners to abandon fighting for their rights. "The mood is very bad," asserts V. Terekhov, chairman of the trade union of Zapadnaya mine workers. "People are prepared to resort to the most extreme forms of opposition." And so, the respite the government has received will hardly be long. And its choices are not great. The best alternative would be to part from the miners in civilized fashion, i.e., close down mines that are especially unprofitable, pay compensation, retrain the people, and create new job positions. It is this path that is envisaged by the state program for readjustment of the coal industry developed by the government. This path has only one shortcoming--it is too expensive. According to Popov's assessments, shutting down even a small mine would require R36 billion. And when you take into account the fact that this applies to over half the mines in the Tulaugol combine, it then becomes "more advantageous for the state not to shut them down, but just let them quietly keep operating." Unfortunately, this "inexpensive alternative" also has its defects. First of all, it does not solve the problem--it postpones resolution. Secondly, it is not really that inexpensive. For normal operation of the sector, L. Popov believes, you need R11.6 trillion. But the new budget has put up R5.6 trillion. The difference between these figures constitutes the main topic of dispute today between government leaders, on the one hand, and the sector lobbies and trade unions, on the other. In the event the sector lobby is victorious, the black hole in the economy into which trillions are being poured will be preserved. But if the budget prevails, mines will start being shut down. With all the consequences this entails. There is no painless resolution here, but there is a choice between reassuring and hopeless prospects.
