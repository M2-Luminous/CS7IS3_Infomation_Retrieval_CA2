Joe Clark, UN secretary general's special envoy in Cyprus, met with President Rauf Denktas at noon today. In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that a document was submitted including certain changes within the framework of the views and concerns expressed by the Turkish Cypriot side. Pointing out that he cannot comment on the document before studying it, Denktas noted: We will see if the changes effected are satisfactory after evaluating the document. Asked if any progress was achieved, Denktas responded that the talks are continuing and it is not right to comment before reaching a conclusion. In reply to a question, the president remarked that the Greek Cypriot Administration accepted the proposal to have two gates at Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport, adding: The customs procedures at the Turkish Cypriot gate will be undertaken by us. Nothing will be signed unless this is accepted. Noting that he did not receive an invitation to go to New York, Denktas said that every day and every week is important with regard to negotiations, but one can say that this is a very important week. Answering a question on how the negotiations will be affected if there is change in government in Turkey in the wake of local elections, Denktas explained that the talks are conducted within the framework of Turkish policy and they cannot be interrupted because of a change in government. In his statement after the meeting, Clark reported that he submitted to Denktas a written document relating to observations and concerns raised during the last two weeks of the proximity talks. Pointing out that this document will be discussed during tomorrow's meeting, Clark responded to a question by saying that Denktas and Greek Cypriot leader Kliridhis have not been invited to New York. Clark added that he cannot make any predictions concerning the leaders' meeting in New York. If the New York meeting is to be constructive, Clark declared, progress must be achieved in the proximity talks in Lefkosa. Asked if Denktas displayed a positive attitude during today's meeting, Clark said yes. After the talks, the Turkish Cypriot delegation led by Denktas held a meeting to assess the document submitted by the United Nations. The proximity talks will continue tomorrow as well. Denktas will hold a meeting with Clark at 1100 tomorrow. Clark met with Kliridhis over luncheon today.
