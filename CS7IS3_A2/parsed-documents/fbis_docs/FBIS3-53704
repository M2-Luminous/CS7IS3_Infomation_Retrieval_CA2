He said that the 12th round [of Arab-Israeli talks] will be a final test of Israel's commitment to peace and of the United States' ability to carry out its responsibilities and commitments. This, he added, is directly linked not only to security and stability in the Middle East but to the United States' future relations with the countries in the region. In statements made today on the outcome of the al-Asad-Clinton summit, he said that Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad was able to rearrange the Arab-Israeli conflict and link all the tracks in an attempt to achieve a comprehensive solution, which U.S. President Clinton affirmed at the end of the summit. Peace, as viewed by the Syrian president, involves not only the Syrian track but the Lebanese and Jordanian tracks and the legitimate Palestinian rights. Thus, we can say that the issue has regained its balance and comprehensiveness.
