FBIS4-38624 "drsov105_a_94025" FBIS-SOV-94-105 Daily Report 31 May 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Delivery Dates Not Set Delivery Dates Not Set LD3105121694 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian 0650 GMT 31 May 94 LD3105121694 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service Russian BFN [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Kuznetsov] [Text] Delhi, 31 May -- Russia will soon be delivering the first batch of MiG-29M fighter-bombers to the Indian Air Force, under a contract providing for the sale to India of 30 of these aircraft, in addition to six MiG-29ChB combat training aircraft worth a total of 25 billion rupees (about $780,000,000). Informed high-ranking Indian sources announced this today, saying that the MiGs would start arriving this summer and would substantially enhance the combat capability of the Indian Air Force, because "they can effectively intercept and inflict strikes on ground targets deep within enemy territory." Sergey Anishchenko, Delhi representative of the Russian Arms State Company [Rosvooruzheniye], confirmed to the ITAR-TASS correspondent that Russia has indeed sent an offer to the Indian side on supplying the MiGs, 10 of them for state credit and 20 for commercial credit. Moscow has had no official response yet, however, and Sergey Anishchenko therefore described the delivery dates as "too optimistic." Sergey Anishchenko nonetheless voiced the hope that there might be some reaction in the next few days, given Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's official visit to Russia scheduled for the end of June. Russo-Indian military cooperation has clearly been moving into higher gear over recent months, after several years of decline. In mid-May the Indian Defense Ministry announced that in fierce competition with British, French, and Israeli companies the Mikoyan MiG aviation research and production complex had won a tender to reequip more than 100 MiG-21 BIS aircraft which make up the backbone of the Indian air force. Viktor Samoylov, general director of Rosvooruzheniye, recently signed a series of agreements here relating to building missile patrol boats and frigates at the Goa and Bombay shipyards.
