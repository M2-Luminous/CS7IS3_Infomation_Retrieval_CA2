These movements, being conducted in the direction of producing value-added products based on scientific agriculture, are here and there showing instances of success, injecting new hope into the depressed farm economy. Started out of an understanding that only competitive products can survive, these new agricultural methods are characterized by aspects that are completely different from the past, for example, the adoption of advanced technology such as computers. They are drawing agriculture to a higher level by increasing productivity and competitiveness, and are aiming for high technology and high added value in agricultural products, just as is done with industrial products. Recently, in particular, this is not stopping at domestic markets, but instances are increasing of products making inroads into Japan and other foreign markets. This shows that these methods are readily capable of developing the present crisis into an opportunity for making great strides. The agricultural sector being dealt the greatest blow following the conclusion of the UR talks is the rice market. With 4 percent of domestic consumption supposed to be brought in from foreign countries by 2004, it is predicted that the price competitiveness of domestically produced rice will fall dramatically, dealing a serious blow to farmers dependent on rice cultivation. It is predicted that when the rice market opens in earnest, the price of domestic rice will fall, followed by reduced production, self-sufficiency, and farm-household income. The side effects will not be slight. To stop the disintegration of the rice-farming household, high-quality rice must be produced at a low cost and brought to market. Considerable advances are being made in the first stage of this process, such as in species improvement for producing high-quality rice, and this brings hope. The Rural Development Administration, the delivery room of our nation's agriculture, boasts that at present, in the quantity and quality of its rice, Korea is ahead of its competitors, Japan and the United States. Developed in 1991, Grade-I Rice, in particular, is assessed to be vastly superior to Japan's "Koshirikari" and America's "Calrose," which have been known to be of good quality, with a good taste as well as clear, clean grains. The Rural Development Administration was also successful in developing other new kinds of rice, such as "Suwon--No. 387," "Suwon--No. 393," and "Miryang--No. 115." Presently going by their test names, it appears that these types of rice, if supplied to normal farming households, will further heighten competitiveness, at least as far as quality goes. In charge of rice-quality development is the research team of the Rural Development Administration's Crop Testing Center. With a total of 31 members devoting themselves to research, this team has for the last ten years applied genetic engineering, and so on, toward developing two to five new species every year. Of these, "Grade-I Rice," "Changan Rice," "Odae Rice," "Tongjin Rice," and "Mangum Rice," supplied since 1990, are strategic species capable of dealing with the opening of markets to imports. The research team will soon come out with "Hyangmi," whose grains give off a pleasant smell; "Taerimmi," whose grains are more than twice as large as normal rice; and "Yusaengmi," whose grains contain various colors. "We are developing various new species based on the over 21,500 species of rice now stored at the seed bank," says Mun Hon-pal, director of the Crop Testing Center's Lowland Rice Breeding Division. Expressing confidence, he said, "I believe that in quality, Korean rice is already securing international competitiveness." Besides this, concerning the 13 items to be opened for import, such as cereals, miscellaneous grains, and flowering plants, the Crop Testing Center seed bank has secured over 11,000 kinds of seed and is increasing efforts to develop high-quality species. Competitiveness in the rice market is not obtained with quality alone, however. The most important task faced at present is lowering the price of rice, some three times higher than American rice, to a competitive level. For this, it must be backed by agricultural technology and government policy targeting low production costs and high production power. There will be considerable difficulty in accomplishing this, say Rural Development Administration officials. "More than anything else, an expansion of agricultural land is needed to make possible large-scale mechanized agricultural," says researcher Yun Yong-tae, stressing, "The backing of government policy is urgently needed for the reclamation of farm land, which requires the investment of massive project costs." Efforts to find a way of escape, and swimming out of the rough seas of the UR are particularly lively at the private level. Instances are appearing a few at a time of the development of new products mobilizing all kinds of ideas, of facilities conceived and operated to reduce production expenses, and even of products making inroads into foreign markets. [passage omitted] More than anything else, the government and the public need to have a new understanding of agriculture, and farmers too must cultivate a self-renewing capability by developing agricultural methods in keeping with the times. In connection with this, Ho Sin-haeng, former agriculture, forestry, and fisheries minister, says, "First of all, the administration must present a mid- and long-term blueprint with a good understanding of farming and farming communities." He stresses, "Containing the administration's strong will to carry out its policies, it must be capable of inculcating in farmers a motivation to produce." "There must be reform in agricultural education and other areas for raising a specialized workforce. Market reform for price stability must be realized along with it," he says, adding, "Farmers too should conduct one-village-one-product campaigns, campaigns to create local specialty production complexes, and so on, enabling themselves to be independent in the long run."
