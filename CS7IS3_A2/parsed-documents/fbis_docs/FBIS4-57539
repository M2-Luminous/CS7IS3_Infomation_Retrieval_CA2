"That is what we are currently discussing in the economic team," Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero admitted. He added that he has yet not made a decision on how to back the new currency, but he said he is "open" to this possibility. "It already has been decided that the reserves will be an essential part to back the new currency, or perhaps they will be the only backing, but we are studying several ideas," he added. Some economic team members already have adopted a favorable position regarding the inclusion of the public companies' shares. "I will listen to them because they have been at this longer than I have and I have no opinion yet" on the subject, he said. Ricupero denied that the economic stabilization program being implemented by the government entails the dollarization of the Brazilian economy, as Workers Party presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva has said. "That term would be more appropriate for the Cavallo Plan in Argentina," Ricupero said. The reserves, he added, are not made up only of dollars, but also Japanese yen and German, Swiss, and French marks, among other currencies. "The real backing of the new currency will be a healthy Brazilian economy," Ricupero said, meaning the capability of Brazilian companies to compete in the international market and export, thus obtaining a trade surplus. Ricupero nonetheless said that he is willing to study the ideas suggested by the presidential candidates. [passage omitted]
