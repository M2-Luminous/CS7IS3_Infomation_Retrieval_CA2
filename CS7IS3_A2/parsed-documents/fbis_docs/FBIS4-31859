Engineer J. Sidor, press secretary of the Slovak Energy Enterprise (SEP), has told us that the enterprise has concluded a contract in this connection with the German Siemens company. In it, it respects the conclusions reached by the recent International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission and also the decision made by the Slovak Republic Nuclear Inspection Office on the criteria for increasing nuclear safety for these blocks. An undertaking by the supplier to ensure that the costs of the reconstruction do not exceed 5 billion korunas forms part of the contract. The completion deadline is 1997. The reconstruction will take place in tandem with the block's operation. The SEP official added that, despite the fact that the V-1 should cease operating in the year 2000 (under the condition that the first and second blocks of the Mochovce nuclear power plant are operating reliably), it is worth investing in the reconstruction.
