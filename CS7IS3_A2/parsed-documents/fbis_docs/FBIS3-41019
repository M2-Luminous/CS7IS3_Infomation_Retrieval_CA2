Valentin Sergeyev, head of the Russian Government's press service, said this in an exclusive interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent. V. Sergeyev said that "the Russian premier expresses his doubts that the statement made by the Kazakhstan ambassador to Iran reflects the official position of Almaty. All the more so since Kazakhstan has not informed the Russian Government about such a change in its position. Viktor Chernomyrdin will have the opportunity to meet Nursultan Nazarbayev at the World Economic Forum in Davos, to which they have both been invited. Anyway, such issues should be resolved through talks with all the interested parties participating, including Russia, and not in a unilateral manner."
