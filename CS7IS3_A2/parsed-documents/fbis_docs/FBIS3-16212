He said the opposition is not interested in a continuation of the civil war and does not want Tajikistan to become another Afghanistan. Latifi noted that currently preparations for the talks are going on. The talks will be held in Moscow, however the exact date is yet unknown. Asked by Interfax's correspondent what demands the opposition put forward before the Dushanbe authorities, Latifi noted that the Council of National Accord, consisting of people who have not been involved in the civil war, should come to power temporarily. In Latifi's opinion, this government should conduct preparations for elections of a new parliament and do everything possible for the return of a million and a half refugees to their homeland. Latifi pointed out that only after that it would be possible to hold elections and adopt a new constitution.
