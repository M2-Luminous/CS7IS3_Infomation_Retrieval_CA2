In a statement published in Magdeburg on 20 May, he says that it would be a wrong signal to vote for a conservative like Roman Herzog, the candidate of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union. Kunert does not assume that his own party's candidate, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher, will get a majority of the Federal Convention. He argues that, unlike Herzog, Rau has the capability of integrating people and building bridges beyond ideological differences. Kunert says that the social democrat could be the federal president of all Germans, beyond party borders.
