In a statement, the RPF has denied that massacres took place as a result of the withdrawal of French troops last November. The RPF points out that there were a number of reports of massacres of civilians at a time when and in regions where French soldiers were present. The rebel movement also questioned how France could explain that it had evacuated only members of the former ruling party and refused to protect the family of the prime minister designated by the Arusha peace accords -- end of quotation.
