Antipina; place and date not given; under the rubric "Express-Interview": "Creeping `Intervention?'"] [Text] There have been reports in the mass media that foreign insurance companies are quietly penetrating the Russian market, which causes concern among domestic insurers. Are these reports true, and what does this sort of "intervention" hold for Russia? I brought these questions to Aleksandr Ivanovich Malkov, director of the Sibrokko insurance company. [Malkov] I have personally talked to representatives of foreign insurance companies which came to Novosibirsk to conduct a seminar. In particular, with representatives of the Austrian company Grave. Under the guise of seminars they look for clients who may easily fall for dollar-wrapped promises. Having purchased an insurance policy in a foreign company, the client acquires the right to distribute the insurance policy, bringing in new clients... Foreign companies, working illegally in our market, are counting on the president signing a decree permitting them to do this. [Antipina] What consequences may the penetration of insurance market by foreign companies have for Russia? [Malkov] You see, in the West, out of 100 large enterprises, the controlling share of 25-27 is owned by insurance companies, because insurance capital is measured by an annual inflow of money of approximately $1.1 trillion. This capital must be put to work, of course. So it works, including as enterprise stock. And, as is known, he who pays the orders... what this enterprise is to produce. In our country the dollar is worth more than 1,500 rubles [R]. An insurance company may sell $1,000 in Novosibirsk, for instance, and immediately have more than R1.5 million, which it can then use to purchase a controlling share, for instance, in one of the major banks. Who will manage this bank? This is penetration of the national financial economy. The same may be said about penetration of the industrial economy, because enterprises are now being privatized... [Antipina] Can this process be blocked somehow? [Malkov] We have to watch it; make public every fact of foreign companies' foray into the Russian insurance market; send information on it to the insurance oversight agency of the country where this company came from. [Antipina] What about our Russian Federal Service for Oversight of Insurance Activities? [Malkov] Unfortunately, right now it is legally impotent. Despite the fact that way back in 1786 the tsarist government issued an edict forbidding other states from operating unceremoniously in our own fatherland. [Antipina] While we are at it, tell us what is special about your company. [Malkov] We work exclusively with legal entities. With large risk factors. We have this ability because our specialists are highly trained professionally--they have been trained in Italian insurance companies and also by the Russian Federal Service for Oversight of Insurance Activities. We are engaged in a line of work nobody else in Novosibirsk has touched so far. We are so-called average commissioners. We sort out situations that occur, for instance, in cargo transportation: emergencies, theft, robbery... For this work we have specialists who utilize the full range of Western insurance companies' techniques.
