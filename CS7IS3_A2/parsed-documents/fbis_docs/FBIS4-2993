Chen and Sofia Wu] [Text] London, April 13 (CNA) -- A group of influential British parliamentarians Wednesday [13 April] called for world support of Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Speaking at a news conference after they unveiled a report on Britain-Mainland China relations, the lawmakers also suggested that the world find a way to give Taiwan a voice in the United Nations. The report, prepared by the House of Commons' Foreign Affairs Committee, also reviews Taiwan's role in political and economic development in the Asia-Pacific. Noting that Taiwan is seeking increased presence on the world stage, the report says other countries can effectively help Taiwan gain a say in world affairs by supporting Taiwan's GATT bid. As one of the world's major trading powers, the report says, Taiwan should be admitted to the Geneva-based world trade forum as soon as possible, regardless of the result of Beijing's GATT membership application. The report notes that Taiwan has applied to join GATT as a separate customs territory, not a country. "This probably can be used as a model for Taiwan to join other international organizations," the report says. It adds that Taiwan should be allowed a voice in the United Nations. Taiwan has been kept out of the world body since Beijing assumed the UN China seat in 1971. The report continues that the world is obligated to persuade Communist China to continue its gradually expanding exchanges with Taiwan. It further advises the world, particularly Communist China, to take into account Taiwan's desire for a formal place in the international community. The report urges the British Government to further improve relations with Taiwan and better its treatment of Taiwan representatives in London. The 110-page report is the result of a year-long study by the 11-member Foreign Affairs Committee. The committee held a series of public hearings on prospects for London-Beijing ties and its members also visited Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mainland China to collect information about developments in the three Chinese societies. The report is expected to become an important reference for the British Government to formulate its future policy toward Beijing and Taipei. The committee's chairman, David Howell, said he was impressed by Taiwan's democratic reforms during his trip to Taipei last September. Howell pointed out that improvements in Taipei-London relations are not related to conflicts between Britain and Mainland China over Hong Kong, which reverts to communist rule July 1, 1997. "Britain should attach greater importance to its ties with Taiwan since Taiwan has a dynamic booming economy and a gradually maturing democratic system," Howell added.
