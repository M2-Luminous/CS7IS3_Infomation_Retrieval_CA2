Kliridhis made the above statement during a news conference with 13 Turkish Cypriot journalists at the presidential palace. The president expressed the view that the UN secretary general does not intend to submit a second package of confidence-building measures. He also said that he expects that in his letter to the two sides the secretary general will say that immediately following the confidence-building measures there must be talks on the substance of the Cyprus issue. Replying to a question on whether there will be a new package of confidence-building measures for Morphou following the implementation of the proposed measures, President Kliridhis said that after the agreement on the measures, there will be a discussion on the substance of the Cyprus issue. President Kliridhis said that, according to the Butrus-Ghali map, Morphou must be on the Greek side. He added that this is an issue that must be discussed in the substance of the Cyprus issue because the territorial aspect will not be solved through the confidence-building measures. Replying to a Turkish Cypriot correspondent's question, President Kliridhis rejected the claim of AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] General Secretary Dhimitrios Khristofias that he is bluffing on the confidence-building measures. Kliridhis said that the policy of bluffing does not lead anywhere. Asked whether he believes that the Cyprus problem can be resolved during his term in office, President Kliridhis said that if Ankara and [Turkish Cypriot Leader] Rauf Denktas have decided that it is the time for a solution to the Cyprus issue, they have the right man to negotiate with. Kliridhis said that he does not meet officially with Denktas, as the Turkish Cypriot leader insists continuously, because the UN secretary general has not proposed such a meeting. In order to have a meeting with Denktas, he said, certain topics on the confidence-building measures must be arranged first. He added that he does not refuse to have social meetings with the Turkish Cypriot leader. Following their meeting with President Kliridhis, the Turkish Cypriot journalists visited the Um Haram mosque in Larnaca. Earlier they visited Omeriye mosque, which is in the old part of Nicosia.
