In an interview with AL-AHRAM today, Monday, he noted that Egypt's stand on the settlement policy is clear and known and that it considers the settlements illegal and that they should all be removed. He remarked that there is agreement to discuss the matter in the final stages of the solution. He expressed his belief that the Israeli-Palestinian talks will not be resumed officially until the Security Council passes a resolution denouncing the Hebron operation and providing protection for the Palestinians. The ambassador denounced Israeli and Western media exaggerations and one-upmanship in handling the manifestations of violence and terrorism in Egypt and these media's attempts to damage Egypt's image abroad.
