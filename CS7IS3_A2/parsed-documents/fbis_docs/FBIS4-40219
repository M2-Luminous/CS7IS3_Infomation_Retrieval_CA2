According to the declaration, "the policy pursued in the spiritual sphere has become aggressive; a total reversal of what was achieved during 1992 and 1993 is taking place here." The massive firing of democratic journalists, the monopolization of television and radio, and the regulation of the official press proves that the media financed by the entire population is becoming a slave to the interests of a single party, states the declaration. The PDMM says that "the extension of the results of parliamentary elections over local administration bodies is a grave transgression of the Constitution. Through presidential decrees of Mircea Snegur, the results of the 1990 elections for local administrative bodies are practically annulled. The dismissal of some mayors and chairmen of district executive committees is an abuse of the authorities and a serious violation of the millions of voters' interests expressed in the elections that no one annulled." The PDMM considers that the results of the presidential elections of 1991 are put in question as the sole candidate, Mircea Snegur, did not represent any party. "The PDMM informs the CSCE representatives, the Council of Europe, foreign embassies, and all political movements in this country and abroad about the dangerous trends in the conduct of the current Moldovan leadership." The declaration also states that the party will "use in the future all legal means to prevent the real threat of restored totalitarianism and obscurantism in our country," concludes the declaration.
