This is according to an English-language morning newspaper. The paper quotes him as saying he will deny that he is Q, and that he will also deny all allegations against him. However, police sources maintain that it is Captain Klopper who provided the information. Captain Klopper says it is irresponsible of these sources to make him the scapegoat, and of newspapers to publish his name.
