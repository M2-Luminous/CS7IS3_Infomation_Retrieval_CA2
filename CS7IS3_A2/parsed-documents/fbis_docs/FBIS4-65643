Amoros; place and date not given] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Amoros] What is the current state of the conflict between Greece and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]? [Papandreou] Right now there are talks under way with UN representative Cyrus Vance to try to break the deadlock in the negotiations and seek a solution to the problem still existing between our countries. For the present, we have proposed a package of measures to promote mutual trust, in which we reexamine the name issue. [Amoros] Of what do those measures consist? [Papandreou] On the one hand, Skopje should offer guarantees about the borders, as well as not using Greek symbols and eliminating any allusion to expansionist matters. It would also have to reinterpret some articles in its Constitution which refer to changing the borders. For our part, we would immediately lift the measures that we have adopted. We would also urge that negotiations be held on Skopje's possible entry into the European Union [EU], assist in the implementation of joint programs with Europe and the EU, and normalize our relations. [Amoros] Is Greece afraid of some action by Skopje? [Papandreou] No, really no. We are not afraid that there could be a military confrontation. Indeed, there is no desire for that. What we wish to say is that any border dispute, any questioning of the borders by any of the sides, could create a widespread conflict involving many powers. [Amoros] What were the reasons for imposing the Thessaloniki embargo? [Papandreou] After two years of negotiations, we were hoping for some sign of goodwill on Skopje's part, but we found that Skopje was seeking the institutionalization of a de facto situation, and its stances were increasingly firm and inflexible. We therefore decided that there must be an immediate reaction, and that is why the embargo on using the port of Thessaloniki was decreed. [Amoros] And what has been the effect of these sanctions? [Papandreou] I am not very sure what the effect of these sanctions has been, but we can see that there is again some movement concerning the negotiations, and we hope that this will lead to progress in resolving the matter. [Amoros] How does Athens assess the EU's harsh reaction to these sanctions? [Papandreou] The Balkans is an area of Europe in which Greece believes that stability is essential, and so it must be ensured that all countries understand this. Greece wishes to convey the message that stability in the Balkans is essential for the stability of the whole of Europe, and that is something that not all countries have been able to grasp. [Amoros] And if the sanctions fail? [Papandreou] Well, for the present we are optimistic because the negotiations are beginning to move again. We hope for new results from Cyrus Vance's mediation, and believe that this time there will be a satisfactory final solution.
