"We have told them they cannot practice voodoo while they are in Panama; otherwise, I will be forced to revoke their visas and deport them," Dominguez said. Voodoo is an ancient practice, a combination of religion and magic which African slaves had brought to Haiti and which is a type of witchcraft that stirs apprehension in certain parts of the world. Dominguez said this group includes Haitians who arrived in Panama from January to the present. Some of them have been granted an extension while others have opted to hide. According to Dominguez, these 150 Haitians are ineligible for political asylum; as a result, the National Organization for Attention to Refugees cannot give them economic assistance, nor can the Immigration Department. Panama suspended commercial flights to Haiti last week, in keeping with UN sanctions against the de facto regime, which has ruled Haiti for three years. The Central American governments, including Panama's, has rejected a recent U.S. request to admit Haitian nationals into their countries.
