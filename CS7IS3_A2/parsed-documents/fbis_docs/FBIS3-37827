This was announced today at a news conference by Baiba Petersone, deputy chairman of the LNNK board. The Union of National Forces calls on the Latvian government delegation, the Saeima, and the state president not to accept a treaty with Russia if it even partly legitimizes Russia's military presence in Latvia. Otherwise, the statement says, the Union of National Forces envisages using the forms of direct democracy and the experience of non-violent resistance until the full withdrawal of a foreign country's troops.
