The most promising, and at the same time most complicated of them has now been singled out: conversion of foreign currency credits into domestic ruble credits. The difference between the interest rates on world markets (from 3.5 to 17 percent) and in Russia (the Central Bank discount rate, let us remember, is 210 percent), given the slow rise in the dollar exchange rate, is fully capable of compensating for even the high risk of investments in Russia. The financial sphere is very conservative. In order to take low-interest credits on Western markets, one must have great prestige and reliable guarantees. The instability in Russia makes it so difficult to obtain them that today it makes the mechanism described inaccessible even for the most serious structures. The most widespread method of surmounting the difficulties involves using Russian capital located overseas. For example, the capital legally circulating there can be used as a guarantee of the redeemability of Western currency credits, subsequently being converted to ruble credits in Russia. A promising route is to sell sizable blocks of shares of major Russian structures, allowing potential creditors or guarantors to control them, in order to win the necessary confidence. The largest Russian banks today are studying mechanisms to provide other Western guarantees and to draw in low-interest currency credits. At the same time, one should emphasize the exceptional profitability, and this means also the exceptional scale, of the forthcoming operations, which does not simply lead to enriching individual commercial structures, but has a major influence on the entire development of Russian society. The spare capital of the world economy many times exceeds the entire monetary mass circulating on the territory of our country. As a result of the strong conservatism of the financial market, this change in investment volumes will be quite smooth, and society will most likely succeed in adapting to its individual manifestations. The scale and depth of the influence to which Russia is to be subjected in the next few years, however, makes it necessary to foresee at least its basic consequences, which should not take us unawares -- as, for example, when the catastrophic exacerbation of the deficit (depressed inflation), connected with the mass pumping of non-cash monies into the wage fund, took us unawares in 1988 and 1990. The influx of currency funds is capable of replacing the administrative mechanism of the infusion of centralized funds with the market mechanism and therefore, with the much more effective mechanism of an infusion of commercial credit. Under these conditions, the variant, approved in world practice, of a unified emission mechanism, in which the increase in the national monetary mass would be limited by the influx of foreign currency, would be fully applicable. It is this mechanism which improved the war-destroyed financial systems of Europe and Argentina (the latter was poised on the brink of hyper-inflation, periodically breaking down into it, over a period of six decades). In this way, we would by-pass major acceleration of a rise in prices. The possible surpluses of the monetary mass would be small and would be compensated for with the aid of the "fine tuning" of the Central Bank (an efficient change of the discount rate and norms for reserves, differentiation of the latter by types of assets) and with the aid of the natural expansion of the markets (through the share market and the real estate market). The effect of the "currency vacuum cleaners" may become the most important instrument for surmounting the economic crisis and the main path to regenerating Russia as a supreme power. They should therefore be supported to the utmost by the state, right up to creating the corresponding insurance funds for the capital coming into Russia.
