FR940712-0-00019 FR940712-0-00007 Comments NMFS received four sets of comments on the proposed harvest estimates and the proposed rule. Comment: One commenter opposed the proposed amendment to the existing fur seal regulations. The commenter stated that NMFS continues to allow the wasteful taking of fur seals on the Pribilof Islands, and that the proposed rule change would place NMFS in the position of endorsing and authorizing wasteful take for an extended period. The commenter asserted that rather than addressing the wasteful seal killing that has persisted on those islands for years, NMFS, to the contrary, now proposes to institutionalize this improper conduct for 3 years without further question. Another commenter voiced support for the regulatory amendment. The commenter reasoned that the take has been relatively stable and the upper and lower limits of the estimate range were wide enough to allow change, and, therefore, as the populations of animals and people vary, so can the target goals for future harvests. Response: Regulations on subsistence taking of northern fur seals have been devised to limit take to a level providing for legitimate subsistence needs of the Pribilof Natives while minimizing negative effects on the seal population. These regulations are intended, thus, as preventative measures against wasteful taking and improper conduct within each harvest season. (Wasteful taking is discussed in greater detail at 58 FR 42027, August 6, 1993.) The rationale behind the 3 year estimate of subsistence need versus an annual estimate was explained in the proposed estimates of subsistence need (59 FR 25024, May 13, 1994). NMFS has recognized the need to reevaluate the regulatory issues regarding subsistence (57 FR 34081, August 3, 1992). As a first step towards addressing this need, NMFS proposed that ยง215.32(b) of the fur seal regulations be applicable for a 3-year period, beginning in 1994. The regulatory amendment is based on the fact that the actual number of fur seals harvested each year since 1989 has been relatively consistent, and the fur seal take has never exceeded the upper limit of the estimated range for subsistence need within any year of the harvest. NMFS anticipates that the subsistence needs of the Pribilof Island residents may increase during the next 3 years. However, based on historical evidence to date, the year-to-year subsistence needs are not expected to increase to levels exceeding the range established in this final estimate. Comment: One commenter supported the implementation of a cooperative management plan as a means of protecting the fur seal. The cooperative plan would expand governmental conservation efforts, and involve local people on the islands to a larger extent in fur seal management issues. The commenter requested that particular effort be made to establish a structure that will enable the residents of the Pribilof Islands to more actively participate in the monitoring and regulating of the harvest. Response: NMFS agrees with the commenter's suggestions. Section 119 of the recently reauthorized MMPA allows for NMFS to enter into cooperative agreements with Alaska Native organizations to conserve marine mammals and to provide for a co-management of subsistence use by Alaska Natives. NMFS intends to pursue the development of such a program that would further the goal of cooperative management and monitoring with the Alaskan native organizations. Comment: One commenter stated that the 1994 subsistence estimates are too high because they are based on historically wasteful seal killing practices carried over from the period of commercial harvest when only the choicest cuts of meat were taken for human consumption. The commenter continued by stating that through the adoption of these estimates, NMFS further institutionalizes waste and sanctions a level of seal killing known to reflect wasteful practices. Response: This comment is similar to the one presented and discussed in the final subsistence estimates for 1993 (58 FR 42027, August 6, 1993). In that final notice, a commenter maintained that the present harvest level did not reflect the true subsistence need on the Pribilof Islands. However, available information indicates that the present number of fur seals taken for subsistence on the Pribilof Islands is not higher than necessary to provide for subsistence needs. During one of the last periods when fur seals were taken solely for subsistence purposes on St. Paul Island, 1912&hyph;16, the number of fur seals taken each year (range 1,764&hyph;3,483) was significantly higher than it is at present, even though the human population on St. Paul Island at that time was less than one-half of the present population. Therefore, the commenter has inaccurately assumed that practices carried over from the commercial harvest have resulted in a level of subsistence use greater than that used historically on the Pribilof Islands. Comment: A commenter stated that there is no basis for setting the lower end of the estimated subsistence range based on the greatest number of seals killed during any year over the past 6 years. Response: NMFS believes that the present range of fur seal subsistence estimates used on St. Paul and St. George Islands are justified. During the past 3 years the number of seals taken in the subsistence harvest has stabilized, ranging from 1,482 to 1,645 takes each year on St. Paul Island and from 194 to 319 each year on St. George Island. Generally, the lower limits of the estimate ranges for the islands have been approached during each of the past 3 years, but a difference of 1 or 2 actual days of harvest between years can result in the difference observed between the estimated number and actual number of seals taken within any one season. The apparent trend toward stability in the harvest totals on St. Paul and St. George Islands indicates to NMFS that the proposed estimates of annual need accurately reflect the actual subsistence requirements on the islands.
