Are you encouraged by this development? Do you believe Hamas will join the peace process? [Peres] There is a lot of pretense in these matters and in the relationship among the Arabs, quite a lot of embellishment and not enough substance. All I can say is that if Hamas emulates the PLO by abandoning terror and sanctioning peace, it will be the surprise of the century. I doubt that. [Dan] Can their coexistence be negative from our point of view? [Peres] If the coexistence is negative, there will be no agreement. We must not forget that peace is not an agreement on reciprocal favors. Peace serves each side, first and foremost. [Friedman] Mr. Peres, this week we read reports emanating from the top echelons of your ministry to the effect that the outlines of the arrangement with Syria are absolutely clear to you: In return for full peace, there will be full Israeli withdrawal on the Golan Heights, which will not happen gradually over 20 years, but rather within a much shorter period. Is that the master plan of peace with Syria? [Peres] No, I do not think so. You can put anything on paper, and there can be as many position papers as you like. No such stand has been embraced by the Israeli Government, and hence, not by the Foreign Ministry either. The Foreign Ministry is an integral part of the government. I think what the paper intended was mainly to emphasize the positive aspect -- the need for a comprehensive agreement with all the Arab countries on all the disputed issues. They may have meant to indicate the price exacted by al-Asad. In any event, it is not a binding paper, and there are lots of papers and lots of archives in the State of Israel. [Dan] The truth, Mr. Peres, is that unless you tell us that there is truth in the reports about secret agreements with Syria, we have been hearing more reports about increased Syrian military buildup than of peace negotiations. [Peres] There is nothing secret with the Syrians. It is true, the Syrian Army is making buildup attempts, which is certainly a problem we cannot discount. In the fundamental, profoundly historic sense, however, Syria has no option other than peace. Even if it purchases weapons from Russia....[pauses] Russia as it was known exists no longer, not even in terms of weapon production and terms of supply. [Friedman] When you say there is nothing secret with Syria, are you saying it with regret, because in view of the stalemate, it would have been better.... [Peres, interrupting] I was definitely speaking regretfully, because I think the negotiations should be more open on the one hand and more clandestine on the other. They should be more open in order to show each nation that the other side desires peace explicitly and unwaveringly. [Friedman] Then what holds the Syrians back from promoting the peace process with us? [Peres] Old habits, including a regime which is not open, a regime which does not openly face its public, a very uncommunicative regime in a universe in which television and other electronic media, newspapers, and radio networks all participate in the negotiations. It should be clear that negotiations cannot be conducted by officials or ministers alone, they have to be conducted by nations. They should be negotiations that look and sound good, and they should be plausible. The details can be negotiated at a site not lit up by the sun. [Dan] Have we made attempts to hold contacts away from the sun, and were these attempts snubbed by the Syrians? Is that the reason....? [Peres, interrupting] No. I mean, attempts were made, we did suggest that as in any other negotiations, one segment should be more exposed, more public, and the other more technical and more confidential to enable us to conduct negotiations without encountering daily criticism over some leaked details. [Dan] Mr. Peres, when do you anticipate peace with Syria? [Peres] It is very difficult to tell, because the Syrians are very obstinate, and their march forward is very sluggish. They are extremely slow. I hope it will happen this year, but I can make no guarantees. [passage omitted]
