He described a DPA report, according to which the strength of the Bundeswehr "will probably be reduced to 300,000 men" as "completely unfounded." However, the news agency confirmed today that it received the information from reliable sources. DPA reported that, because of the bad financial situation, it will not be possible to keep a strength of 370,000, as agreed between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Former Soviet State President Mikhail Gorbachev in the Caucasus.
