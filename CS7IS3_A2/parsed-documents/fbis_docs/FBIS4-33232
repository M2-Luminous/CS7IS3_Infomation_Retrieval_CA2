Workers will immediately be fired upon proof of drug consumption, and professionals will lose their practicing licenses. Likewise, yesterday, the government yesterday minors and pregnant and nursing women from consuming and possessing drugs. It also forbad the use of psychotropic substances at elementary and high schools, malls, restaurants, bars, night clubs, taverns, recreation centers, and all public places in general. All education centers nationwide were granted a 30-day period to adopt the necessary measures to curb drug consumption in any of its forms as part of their internal statutes. The government also banned drug consumption in all sports activities in the country. The same measure applies to prisons, businesses, and other workplaces. According to the decree, those who violate restrictions on drug consumption could be admonished, fined, and even expelled from where they are, whether a school or a public place. In addition, the government decided those who are caught driving a vehicle while under the influence of drugs could be detained by authorities for a period of up to 24 hours and sentenced to pay a minimum of up to 20 salaries. In addition, their driver licenses could even be suspended. Last night, Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez said: "Drug consumption is not a basic right, but we are warning the objective of the decree is merely to establish certain restrictions to the CC ruling rather than challenging it." Those laws that penalize drug sales, trafficking, production, and distribution within the country are in effect, and the government will not hesitate to enforce them against those who violate them. Meanwhile, Drug Director Gabriel de Vega Pinzon has said strategies of integral production against drug addiction will be reinforced to protect the people's basic rights, which could be affected by drug problems. He added that within the framework of antidrug strategies, we are progressing in tangible prevention and rehabilitation programs in Medellin, Atlantico, Caldas, Cali, Huila, and Santander. Restrictions The decree prohibits drug possession, trafficking, and consumption in the country's public and private schools. School officials will be in charge of reporting cases of drug possession and consumption. In case minors are caught with drugs, school officials will notify their parents. Student penalties could range from admonition to expulsion, including suspension. Moreover, all schools will include drug prevention subjects in their curriculum. Governors and mayors, with the coordination of the Education Ministry, will verify the development of prevention programs at schools and impose pertinent disciplinary measures.
