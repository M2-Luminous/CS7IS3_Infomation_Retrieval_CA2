FR940302-0-00033 FR940302-0-00015 The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered plants. All trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export any endangered plant, transport it in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial activity, sell or offer it for sale in interstate or foreign commerce, or remove it from areas under Federal jurisdiction and reduce it to possession. In addition, for endangered plants, the 1988 amendments (Pub. L. 100&hyph;478) to the Act prohibit the malicious damage or destruction on Federal lands and the removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying of endangered plants in knowing violation of any Commonwealth law or regulation, including Commonwealth criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions can apply to agents of the Service and Commonwealth conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered species under certain circumstances. It is anticipated that few trade permits for Auerodendron pauciflorum will ever be sought or issued, since the species is not known to be in cultivation and is uncommon in the wild. Requests for copies of the regulations on listed plants and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits should be addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, room 420C, Arlington, Virginia 22203 (703/358&hyph;2104). National Environmental Policy Act The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). References Cited Liogier, A. 1982.
