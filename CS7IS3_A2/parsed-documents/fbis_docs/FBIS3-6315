But Permanent Secretary for Transport and Communications Mahidon Chantharangkun confirmed, "We'd better talk to them." A Thai delegation headed by Mahidon will go to Washington April 5-6 following a US invitation. The United States wants Thailand to adopt its "Open Skies" policy allowing for unrestricted cargo and passenger capacity on a mutual basis. Mahidon said the Thai delegation is unlikely to go along with the US Open Skies idea but stand firm in defending this country's interests first. The industry source said Thailand is now in an advantageous position vis-a-vis the United States since there is now no permanent agreement obliging this country to make any concessions. The latter has tried to help its airlines gain more access to the growing Asian markets. Thailand would be at a disadvantage in an openly competitive competitive [as published] situation. Thai Airways International is the only large international carrier based here and it does not have the capability to fight with the four strong US airlines flying here, including United, Delta, Northwest and Federal Express. The United States successfully concluded open-skies agreements with the Netherlands for an unlimited time frame and with Germany for a four-year term. Negotiations with the United Kingdom are now under way. He emphasized however that it is time for the two countries to resume talks, four years having passed since the cancellation of the last aviation pact. "How could people be angry for four years? We should have a little bit of talking. If the negotiations show no sign of accomplishment, we will just quit," Mahidon said. The United States on March 11 informed Thailand that it wants to see three main topics discussed, including Thai restrictions on seat sales by Delta and United Airlines, possible capacity limitations by Thai and US carriers and more flexibility for cargo carriers. Asked if the US might impose sanctions under the US 301-trade law on Thailand for not consenting to its demands, Mahidon said that he believes the US would not, without however giving a reason. "It depends on who is leading the negotiations," he added. A source in the Aviation Department pointed out that the US has already softened its stance on Thai Airways International's operation in the US market in the hopes of Thailand easing its resistance. Another temporary agreement between the two countries, valid from Mar 7 to Sept 1 was just completed.
