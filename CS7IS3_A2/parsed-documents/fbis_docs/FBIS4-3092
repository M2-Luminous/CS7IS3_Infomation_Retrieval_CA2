The country, which has suffered shortages of electricity for two decades, expects at least $25 billion to be invested in the sector in the next seven years. Delegations will be sent to Western nations this year with proposals for co-operation, said an official with the Ministry of Power Industry. Power production has become a key attraction for foreign investors over the past two years and several overseas-financed power plants have been announced. "Big breakthroughs in foreign investment are expected," the official, who declined to be identified, said in an interview with Business Weekly last week. China can produce up to 181 million kilowatts. Experts estimate that 25 percent more capacity is needed to satisfy the booming demand. Power Industry Minister Shi Dazhen last week began a 17-day trip to France, Spain and Israel to bring in investment. China expects 9 per cent economic growth for the next seven years. To achieve that goal, additional generating capacity of at least 120 million kilowatts must be installed by the year 2000. That means an average 17 million kilowatts of generators should be installed each year. The government plans 12 million kilowatts for this year, but financing has not been fully-arranged. Some 10 billion yuan ($1.15 billion) of the 66 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) needed is not available. Ministry officials said the capital shortage will probably be eased later this year as the central government gives the sector top priority and the new State Development Bank begins supporting construction of infrastructure. But they pointed out that bigger problems lie ahead. Fewer projects were kicked off last year than were expected and no projects have been approved so far this year. Big power plants that are planned may not be completed, they said. This scaled-down construction, they caution, would jeopardize long-term economic growth. The government does not want to let big capital construction projects drive up inflation, which in the first two months of the year stood at 20 percent. Building a large power plant requires billions of yuan. Plants with total capacity of 53 million kilowatts are under construction, but that is at least 7 million kilowatts less than expected. At the same time last year, 54 million kilowatts were under construction. Officials warn that if enough investment is not found, construction would further shrink. In France, Shi is expected to sign an agreement with the French power sector to extend a 10-year power co-operation treaty that expires this year. The minister, leading five key officials from the ministry, is to explain China's energy policies to the French Government and business community, discuss possibilities for further co-operation, and learn about French corporate management. Coming on the heels of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's visit to China, the mission is expected to be fruitful, trade analysts said. Balladur's visit was described as a turning point, following about four years of relatively cool relations between the two countries. Shi's visits to Spain and Israel are also considered important. A Western European power union is based in Spain, and Israel has ties with financial organizations worldwide. China is also to rely on foreign power groups for know-how to improve its efficiency. The Ministry of Power Industry said late last year that China would need $25 billion in foreign investment by the year 2000 to generate enough electricity to support its economy.
