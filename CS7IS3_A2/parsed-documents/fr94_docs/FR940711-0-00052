ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: This document corrects a final rule published on June 10, 1994, which inadvertently listed incorrect coordinates in the airspace description for Glacier Park International Airport, Kalispell, Montana. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, August 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James E.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 10, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule that amended the Kalispell, Montana, Class E airspace area to accommodate arrival/departure aircraft transitioning between the en route and terminal areas in western Montana.
