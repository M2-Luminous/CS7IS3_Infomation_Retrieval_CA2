There is evidence that the Kurdish businessmen--including the singer Ibrahim Tatlises, Idris Ozbir, Halis Toprak, and Necdet Ulucan--have been targeted because they allegedly have been providing enormous financial assistance to the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. An official at the Istanbul Security Directorate said Behcet Canturk was killed two weeks ago in order to cut off the PKK's financial resources. This same official said Inci Baba was killed for the same reason. He said: "Inci Baba, who was known to be close to the DYP [True Path Party], was killed because, despite warnings from the Security Directorate, he continued to harbor `radical views' on the Kurdish problem and to provide financial assistance to the Kurdish movement." A source close to the National Security Council [NSC] said a policy has been adopted to pressure and even to kill "those persons who fetter the state in its policy on the Kurdish problem." Such people will be cowed by linking them to the ASALA [Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia], PKK, and mafia. Recently, the Kurdish businessmen have been placed under constant surveillance and their books have been scrutinized by the tax inspectors. Tatlises Also Targeted The famous singer Ibrahim Tatlises is on the top of the list of names targeted by the counterguerrillas. The latter are planning to kill Tatlises as part of the operation that started with the murder of Canturk. A source told AYDINLIK: "They [the Turkish officials] are very determined. They will either intimidate or eliminate those who even give a single coin to the PKK. They see as their target all those individuals and organizations that provide, or are suspected of providing, financial assistance to the PKK." This source added: "Ibrahim Tatlises is attracting too much attention. He is on the top of the list that has already been drawn up. They might give it the appearance of an accident. The only thing preventing them from carrying out this act is Tatlises' popularity." When informed by AYDINLIK that he is one of the targets, Tatlises said: "Why should they target me? What is my crime? I have committed no crime. It is not a good thing to die for nothing." Asked to comment on Canturk's assassination, Tatlises said he does not even know Canturk's profession, adding: "I do not know what his profession was and why he was killed. You should ask his family. They must know their friends and foes." Tatlises then added: "I would be happy if am going to be the second man to be killed after Behcet. But, there is no reason to warrant my killing."
