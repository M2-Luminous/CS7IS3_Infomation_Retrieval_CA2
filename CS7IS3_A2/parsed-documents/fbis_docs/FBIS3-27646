Lin Chien-hsiung, director of the Department of National Treasury, made the announcement on the opening day of US-Taiwan tariff reduction negotiations. US negotiators had earlier requested Taiwan revoke its monopoly alcohol and tobacco tax in accord with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) regulations. Taiwan currently imposes monopoly taxes on the imported products averaging NT$16.6 (US$0.61) per pack of cigarettes and NT$660 (us$24.4) per liter of alcohol. After the monopoly tax is lifted, imported alcohol and tobacco will be subject to normal taxes, Lin said.
