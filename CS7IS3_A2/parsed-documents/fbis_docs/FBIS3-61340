From this standpoint, our readers would be interested to know how our relations with these countries are organized and developing, first and foremost with Russia, since we have to acknowledge that any event in Russia in one way or the other reverberates in the Republic of Armenia, especially affecting its internal and foreign state of affairs. [Kirakosyan] That is, of course, a very broadly defined question. Nevertheless, I will try to provide an exhaustive answer and, naturally, I will start with the Russian Federation. Today, when international relations are in a period of transition and a trend is in the making toward the creation and development of more new unions, including a broad process of cooperation on a mutually beneficial basis, Armenia assigns a priority to Russia in its foreign policy. In its relations with the countries in the region, the Russian leadership is unquestionable. Now the period of defining the positions of the two states with respect to each other seems to be behind us, and we finally have come to a mutual understanding. I especially want to draw your attention to the fact that we have to approach the process of bilateral relations between Armenia and Russia seriously. In the current situation, it is important to coordinate foreign, economic, social, military, and domestic policy in the direction of leading the republic out of the economic and energy crisis, which will ensure external and internal political equilibrium and a successful course of economic transformations. In our relations with the Russian Federation, we base our actions first and foremost on the national and state interests of Armenia, which are aimed at economic development on a mutually beneficial basis. Diplomatic relations between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Armenia were established in April 1992. President of the Russian Federation B. Yeltsin on 26 May 1992 appointed V. Stupishin as ambassador plenipotentiary and extraordinary in Armenia. Before that, on 29 December 1991, an agreement between Armenia and Russia, "On Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Security," was signed in Moscow. The Republic of Armenia has trade and economic agreements with the Russian Federation for 1992-1993. In addition, we have signed more than 30 other agreements with the Russian Federation, and a number of projects are in the development stage. All of this overall must help to create favorable conditions for market relations between Armenia and Russia, with the aim of preserving and developing existing economic ties, drawing on already signed agreements on coordinating the actions in the development of the fuels and power generation sector, industry, transportation, communications, and so on. Thus, we can say with certainty that the Republic of Armenia does not have as intensive and comprehensive ties with any foreign country as it has with the Russian Federation. It is quite obvious that in the Republic of Armenia's foreign policy, Russia occupies an important place. And this is logical, since it reflects the trends and traditions that exist between our countries and peoples. Now let us look at the factors that stand in the way of developing Armenian-Russian relations. For a variety of reasons, economic ties between the Republic of Armenia and the Russian Federation are currently noticeably disrupted; nevertheless, fluctuations in the political and economic life of Russia echo in our republic. The latest confirmation of this is freeing prices for bread and fuel, an unexpected exchange of the USSR State Bank and the Central Bank of the Russian Federation banknotes of 1961-1992 issue, and so forth. One should assume that the existing close economic ties between the two states are a long-term factor, which is to a considerable degree necessitated by the absence of appropriate alternative infrastructures, and this circumstance must be taken into account in developing the foreign policy course of the Republic of Armenia. Alas, we have not yet made the effective steps that need to be made in the sphere of developing relations with the Russian Federation. A Republic of Armenia Embassy still has not been opened in Moscow, which, naturally, would be appropriate for the current stage of development of bilateral relations. The current form of Armenian representation in Russia corresponds only to a small extent to international norms and logic-dictated relations existing between independent states. Its functional disparity currently does not afford us the ability fully to conduct relations with embassies of other countries in the world, the number of which in Moscow equals the number of these countries' representations in the United Nations. Such things as monitoring the implementation of previously signed agreements and treaties, as well as the analysis of promising projects aimed at further deepening and expansion of Armenian-Russian relations, not to mention the enormous opportunities to stimulate the republic's economy, remain outside the activities of the permanent representation. Creation of consular representations of the Republic of Armenia in important key points of the Russian Federation also is progressing slowly. Moreover, a wrong trend is developing in the matter of forming representations: we base our decisions on the assumption that representations are needed first and foremost in places where the greatest number of Armenians live, so that we can resolve their problems in Russia. This undoubtedly is an important task. We should not forget, however, that the main task of representations is not in working with the [Armenian] community--it is in facilitating the development of relations between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Armenia, in particular, in those areas where the community has a certain economic, political, and social potential. Speaking of the need for the fastest possible creation of legal and treaty foundations for multilateral cooperation, which could have a decisive influence in leading us out of the economic and energy crisis, we should pay attention to the actual ratification by our Supreme Council of a number of bilateral agreements and treaties. Among them is a fundamental document--the agreement between the Republic of Armenia and the Russian Federation "On Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Security." In our opinion, the next factor is the influence of the Russian Federation, which, both within the framework of undertakings of the UN and CSCE and by its direct participation, could play a perceptibly positive role in the resolution of the Karabakh crisis. The deepening and development of comprehensive relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Russian Federation may help to establish good-neighbor relations between Armenia and the countries with which it shares borders. As to the CIS' inter-state structure, almost all its members, including the Russian Federation and the Republic of Armenia, want a qualitatively new level for the CIS, a single economic and cultural space. In this context, development of relations with all CIS countries is as important as of those with Russia. This should include both restoration of economic, social, and cultural ties and development of relations with the Baltic countries. [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] How are our relations developing with the countries of the East-European part of the Commonwealth--Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova? [Kirakosyan] The absence of active relations with these states also is the result of our rather inflexible approach. However, lately the state of affairs has improved markedly in this respect, too. For instance, in February of this year we opened a diplomatic representation of the Republic of Armenia in Kiev; we are preparing a visit of the Armenian president to Ukraine, where a large package of important documents will be signed. Finally, diplomatic relations have been established with the Republic of Belarus. We will soon set up a diplomatic representation in Minsk; an interim charge d'affairs of the Republic of Armenia has been appointed to the Republic of Belarus. We are working on mutually beneficial treaties and agreements. "Armenia-Ukraine" and "Armenia-Belarus" societies have been established in Yerevan; they are engaged in strengthening friendly ties between our peoples. We still have a long way to go with respect to Moldova. We have established close trade and economic relations with it. However, for a variety of reasons, we cannot yet speak of comprehensive relations. [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] Mr. Kirakosyan, in your opinion, does not the new Economic Union hamper the independent development of CIS countries? [Kirakosyan] Meetings among the prime ministers of three Slavic republics--the Russian Federation, the Republic of Belarus, and Ukraine--have taken place lately; these meetings were marked by active discussions. As a result of negotiations, a joint statement has been signed on urgent measures with respect to acceleration of economic integration. In connection with this agreement, opinions have been voiced that the CIS has not lived up to expectations, and that by taking this step, the stronger Slavic states are trying to shed the less developed members. Commenting on the results of this meeting, I can say that this is a logical step which does not contradict the idea of the CIS. Moreover, this step was taken further to its logical conclusion by the three Slavic states in Moscow, at the conference of heads of CIS states (which took place in the end of September of this year), where an agreement was signed to create the Economic Union, whose purpose is to serve only one practical goal--creating a single market. Such a union has become a necessity, since the former USSR republics can sell most of their output only to one another, and in many instances can produce the final product only with the help of one another. The creation of such a union is logical; it is happening in other regions of the world as well and does not in any way hamper the independent development of CIS countries or keep them from establishing and strengthening independent economic relations with some or other country. This union in the future envisages a great volume of work both inside the CIS and in bilateral relations. In particular, the parties to the agreement must ensure the compatibility of taxation systems, establish visa-free travel, and so on. Accepting the necessity of unified guiding principles of economic relations, they expressed a willingness to bring national legal codes into conformity with the criteria of the aforementioned agreement and international law. It is also envisaged to create joint bodies of administration, while decisions affecting the Economic Union will be adopted only on the basis of consensus. [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] What is your appraisal of our relations with Transcaucasus states? [Kirakosyan] The Transcaucasus region is in the center of special attention. It is no secret that the security and well-being of Armenia and the Armenian people depend to a large extent on the situation that exists in this region, on the correlation of different forces and interests, relations with Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Iran. Bilateral relations with neighboring countries are important. In this respect, it is hard to overestimate the place and role of Georgia. We need today to rethink Armenian-Georgian relations from the standpoint of national and state interests. First of all, we should not forget about the more than half-million-strong Armenian diaspora in Georgia, whose fate concerns us today. We hope that the current authorities in Georgia will conduct a farsighted policy of goodwill with respect to their citizens of Armenian descent. Much has been said about vitally important communications that go through the territory of Georgia. I only want to add that all transit shipping, including petroleum products and gas, is being done on a mutually profitable basis. Unfortunately, it is for this reason that the explanation for the frequent robberies on transportation and the explosions on the gas pipeline most likely lies in the instability and crime-engendering situation inside Georgia than in its "ill intents." When the region becomes relatively stable, an equal level of our countries' economic development will finally allow us in the future to cooperate in the sphere of joint production and distribution of products and may in the future lead to the desired economic integration. In particular, a serious legal basis has been established for us to develop our relations along civilized lines. As is known, during the meetings of heads of our states and governments (in May and June of this year), about 30 treaties and agreements were signed, including a Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Security; an Inter-State Declaration of Economic Cooperation; agreements on transit freight shipping, as well as on cultural, scientific, and humanitarian cooperation; and other documents. Each party set up government commissions to coordinate their implementation. The continuing political instability; the deepening of Abkhazian-Georgian confrontation; and a certain polarity of opinions regarding the ways to settle it--this is how, unfortunately, we have to characterize the existing situation in Georgia. In these extreme conditions, several months ago an Armenian Embassy was opened in Georgia, whose task is to serve the cause of further development of Armenian-Georgian relations. There are four diplomats working there, headed by an interim charge d'affairs. A number of organizational issues with respect to ensuring normal work of the diplomatic representation have been resolved. The embassy was able to launch active work on resolving the tasks set for it; close relations have been established with the bodies of authority in the republic, as well as with diplomatic representations accredited in Georgia. They inform the Republic of Armenia's Ministry of Foreign Relations in a timely manner on the events in the neighboring republic, present their forecasts, and submit proposals aimed at resolving emerging problems and developing relations between our countries. Many people are currently worried about the prospects for future relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan, especially considering that the latter now has become a CIS member. I want to say right away that our republic had no objections to Azerbaijan's joining the CIS, and expressed hope that this circumstance will become a stimulus for a peaceful resolution of the Karabakh issue, the problem that represents the only obstacle on the road of normal neighborly relations between sovereign independent states. However, the latest events show that the shortsighted, obstructionist actions of Azerbaijan's current authorities do not leave any hope for achieving peace in the near future. Numerous official statements by Yerevan and Stepanakert and their foreign policy agencies, their acceptance of a new cease-fire schedule, are proof of the desire on the part of Karabakh to cease military actions. We support the peacekeeping efforts of the UN and the CSCE, as well as government, state, and public figures of a number of states, who have taken upon themselves an important mission--the fair resolution of the problem and establishing peace in our region. [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] How are our relations with Central Asian states developing? [Kirakosyan] After the collapse of the Soviet empire, Central Asia began to attract major powers of the world like a magnet. The United States, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, and Great Britain, as well as Korea, India and Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, and a number of other states, began to fish for their "miracle fish" in Central Asian soil, which holds fabulous wealth. Armenia also has its own direct interests in this region. As is known, we still get our gas from Turkmenistan. We are, of course, interested in the oil and grain, metals, cotton, and relatively cheap food that the Central Asian states have in abundance. Of course, had the roads been open, the situation would have been different, since these states also are interested in a number of goods produced in Armenia--electric bulbs, electric motors, cable, chemicals, cognac and wine, various technologies, electronic equipment, and so on. Through the territory of Armenia, Central Asian states have a gateway to Turkey (and from there on to Europe), as well as to Black Sea ports. Armenia, in turn, through the Central Asian states would have a gateway to the countries of Southeast Asia and the Far East. As you can see, our relations with the Central Asian republics are no less important. These relations are not always smooth: old traditions are still strong in these states, and they exert a strong influence in the sphere of state and economic management. Over the past year, we have established diplomatic relations with Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. The aforementioned and a number of other reasons still keep Uzbekistan from establishing diplomatic relations in accordance with international norms not only with Armenia, but also with other CIS states. Uzbekistan is the only state of the former USSR with which Armenia still has not established diplomatic relations (actually, with exception of Azerbaijan). With Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan, we have signed protocols on cooperation between ministries of foreign affairs. Finally, we signed long-term inter-state agreements with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan (with the latter during the recent visit of President L. Ter-Petrosyan). Dozens of economic agreements and treaties have been signed and are operating at different levels. The Embassy of the Republic of Armenia has already been functioning in the capital of Kazakhstan, Almaty, for several months. The interim charge d'affairs of the Republic of Armenia at the same time represents our state's interests in Bishkek. The embassy at this point has a minimal staff, but it already is working actively. We plan to open an embassy in Ashgabat before the end of the year. In short, we have a lot of things to do in the future, and I can say that the Central Asian region will always remain at the center of our attention.
