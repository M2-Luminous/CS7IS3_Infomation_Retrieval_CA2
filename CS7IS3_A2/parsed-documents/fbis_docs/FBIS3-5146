When I was entering the Chongwadae presidential office I felt spring had arrived. I understand you do jogging every morning. What do you at dawn? [Kim Yong-sam] It is still chilly at dawn. It is March, so I can feel spring is coming. [passage omitted on jogging habits] [Yi] Mr. President, thank you very much for your response to our request for this interview despite your busy schedule. The date 25 February marked one year since you took office. You are now entering the second year. Most of the people know the method, content, and style of your management of state affairs through the mass media. The purpose of my visit here today is to hear more of them directly from Mr. President; for instance, the background in making policy decisions, managing state affairs, and so forth. Mr. President, what were your plans and objectives in managing state affairs during the past year? [Kim] We cannot say the previous governments were strong governments because they failed to enjoy the people's support and because they were not the governments that were entrusted by the people. On the other hand, however, the present civilian-led government is a government entrusted by the people and a government chosen by the people. Therefore, the present civilian-led government can dignifiedly carry out politics for the interest of the country and the people as stipulated in the Constitution. In other words, the present government is a legitimate government, so it can dignifiedly ask the people to do what they should do. It accepts our people's demands, if they are considered to be reasonable. To make a clean and honest government is a very important task. I think only such a government can become a strong government and enjoy the people's support and love. [Yi] Inspection activities continued last year in order to eliminate all sorts of old social and political corruption and irregularities. These activities enjoyed praise from people at home and abroad. However, there were also voices of resistance and complaints from some former privileged people. How do you assess the past year? [Kim] I have said that the past year felt like 10 years or so. I think that during the past year I have done a lot of work in eliminating all sorts of past corruption and irregularities. One of the most important tasks the previous governments failed to implement, which our civilian-led government has accomplished, is the adoption of the real-name financial transaction system. With the adoption of this system, the people can receive due compensations for what they have done -- shedding sweat. Another important task that our government has accomplished was the adoption of the system of revealing the private property of public servants, including myself. With the adoption of the system, those who have accumulated property through illegal means had to leave their posts. This system will be enforced in the future, too, on a continuous basis. This kind of reform is unprecedented in our history, and, therefore, is a revolutionary event. I stress here that my plan for reform and change will continue. It is very difficult to complete the work of reform and change in one year. However, the effectiveness of our work for reform and change is presently being witnessed in our society. In other words, our society is now in the process of reform and change. Many changes have been implemented among both upper and lower grade public servants. I think we should concentrate more efforts on carrying out reform and change among lower grade servants. [Yi] What difficulties have you had in carrying out your work for reform and change during the past year? [Kim] I was well aware of the president's duties and responsibilities because I had a long career in politics. After I took office, however, I came to realize that my prior understanding of the president's duties and responsibilities was limited. I know some people hold that I am enforcing one-man politics or a one-man dictatorship under the civilian-led government. This is indeed a wrong assertion. Under the presidential government system, the president should assume responsibility for all things. So, it is wrong to say that I am enforcing dictatorship under the civilian-led government. I am just performing responsibilities assigned by the people. When I make serious decisions I am often engulfed in agony and feel lonely because I have to make a final decision alone without consulting with other people. [Yi] These reforms and changes are efflorescing in our society. Yet, there is still a field where the work of reform and change has not been smoothly carried out. It is precisely our political field. What do you say about the reform movement in the political field? [Kim] Changes in the political field are very important. Politics should change. Our politics have never changed, still the same as the politics of 20 years ago, 30 years, and 10 years ago. Whenever an opportunity presented itself, I stressed the need for reform and changes in the political field. To achieve reform and changes in the political field, elections should be clean. So, the bills which have been submitted to the National Assembly this time for deliberation are in fact revolutionary bills. I mean the bills on elections. If these bills are passed at the National Assembly the politics of our country will become advanced ones. As long as political corruption and corrupt elections exist, our country cannot become an advanced country. I know a country where political corruption and illicit elections have been perpetrated. Of course, I would not identify the name of the country here. Anyway, political corruption and illicit elections are indeed a misfortunate phenomenon. That country is undergoing difficulties these days. This is because of the lack of clean politics and clean elections. Only when clean politics and clean elections are conducted can people's awareness of genuine politics be changed. Illicit elections are to drive people into depravity and ruin. [Yi] Last January you met the three former presidents. Afterward, many Sixth Republic figures were released from prison. Witnessing this, many people have raised the voices of worry that your will for reform is being enfeebled. What do you think of this? [Kim] It is entirely different from facts. Of course, the assessment of the three former presidents may be various. Among them are the presidents who were not directly elected by the people. However, meeting the former presidents as the president of the civilian-led government is also meaningful. The release of Sixth Republic figures is a matter on the rights of the Judical Branch. So, we cannot argue on this matter. We should not link the meeting of the three former presidents to the release of the abovementioned figures. [passage omitted] [Yi] Last year, many foreign heads of state visited our country. You met many heads of state at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] meeting. Also, you had summit talks with U.S. President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa. While traveling overseas what image did you witness foreign countries had toward the ROK? [Kim] The establishment of the civilian-led government has completely changed the image of the ROK. In a nutshell, I think that democracy is the supreme value. Under the previous regimes our diplomacy was not properly and smoothly carried out. The strongest power in diplomacy is precisely democracy itself. At the meeting of heads of the ROK missions in the Asia, Pacific, and American regions held in Seoul I told them that they should become salesmen. I urged them to make their best to increase our international competitive power. The United Nations publishes a report on human rights once a year. The ROK has been a target country of this report. However, since the civilian-led government was established, our country has become a human rights screening member country in the United Nations. The position of our country has changed completely. [Yi] I understand you are scheduled to visit Japan and China this year for summit diplomacy. What are your expectations? [Kim] The importance of these two countries is very great in today's pan-Pacific era. In terms of our security, the two countries are also important. Japan and China are among our three major trade partner countries. So, my visit to these two countries will be closely related to our future economic development. Deep and detailed discussions will be held for bilateral economic cooperation. I think that my visit to the two countries will become a great turning point in respective bilateral relations. The two countries participated in the APEC meeting. This fact also gives more significance to my planned visit. Of course, Russia, which is one of our neighboring countries, is very important to us. We cannot disregard the importance of Russia. I cannot make a visit to this country at this time. Anyway, if economic cooperative relations are smoothly achieved, our country's future will be very bright. [passage omitted] [Yi] The greatest pending foreign policy issue is the inspection of the North Korean nuclear facilities. The North Korean nuclear issue is a problem which we are directly concerned with, and it is a difficult problem to solve for the world as a whole. Fortunately, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team has entered Pyongyang to conduct official inspections. In Panmunjom, a working contact is being held for the exchange of special envoys. How do you think this problem will be solved? If it is not solved, what measure do you think will be necessary? [Kim] The North Korean nuclear program should be stopped by all means. This is necessary not only for the survival of the 70 million fellow countrymen but for peace in Northeast Asia and the world. This is a problem directly connected with our survival and for peace on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, I think we should mobilize all means possible to solve this problem. Fortunately, the IAEA inspection has started. The working contact for the exchange of special envoys is being held. We cannot be too optimistic at this stage, for we have undergone numerous critical stages in our relations with North Korea. We cannot expect that everything will be settled smoothly. We will have to overcome some more critical points. However, now that North Korea is permitting the nuclear inspection, the so-called nuclear card has left the North Korean hand. I think the inter-Korean dialogue, therefore, has to make considerable progress. The United States has promised us that it will not hold the third round of high-level talks with North Korea unless there is significant progress in the exchange of special envoys. North Korea has also officially announced it will do so. What is most important at the present stage is that we are handling every matter in close cooperation with the United States. The United States has always consulted us on their contacts with North Korea. At times, the United States even halted the talks with North Korea to have time to discuss matters with us. I think what is most important to the ROK is maintaining such a close cooperative system with the United States. If the exchange of special envoys and inter-Korean dialogues proceed as we intend and North Korea's nuclear development program is hindered, we could promote relations with North Korea in various areas, including the economic sector. I think North Korea should acknowledge the fact that the ROK is in a position to actively help it improve relations with the United States. It would be foolish of North Korea to think that it can discuss this issue without the ROK. [Yi] In a recent news conference, you said that the precondition for the exchange of special envoys is holding a summit. You even said that you would meet with the North Korean president when you believed it conducive to keeping North Korea from developing nuclear weapons. When do you think it will take place? [Kim] It is hard to predict now. I will have to judge the timing by watching the development for the exchange of special envoys. [passage omitted]
