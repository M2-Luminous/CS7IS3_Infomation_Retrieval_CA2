According to the report, from January to October in 1993, although the disease incidence and death toll dropped 11.14 percent and 43.48 percent respectively from the same period of 1992, disease incidence in some local areas in Anhui, Sichuan, and Shandong Provinces rose rapidly and even caused some deaths since October of 1993. Reports submitted by 40 EHF monitoring stations across the country also affirmed the rapid increase of EHF disease incidence since last October. Wild rats are believed to be the major vectors of disease transmission, because the density of wild rats in some rural areas is as high as 30-40 percent, and 15 percent in residential areas. Apodemus agrarius, which accounts for 80-90 percent of wild rat population, is the major intermediate host. In 1993, higher virus-carrying rate and infection index of Apodemus agrarius have also been reported.
