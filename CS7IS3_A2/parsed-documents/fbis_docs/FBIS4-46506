The program is 12 minutes long. Interviewed at the beginning of the feature, Major-General N.F. Tkachev, commander of the Russian peacekeeping motor rifle division, comments on the status of his command: "We are an ordinary Land Forces unit, a motor rifle division, which is charged with carrying out the duties of a peacekeeping unit, an essential function that arose when conflicts in our former republics on the borders of Russia began. We are guided by our training program for peacekeeping forces subunits, which was developed by the Land Forces General Staff. Unfortunately, it has to be said that we still have no legal documentation to establish the status of our duties. There is an order by the defense minister which determined additional privileges on the basis of Russian legislation for those soldiers who carry out their duties in conflict areas. So far there is no other document." On the proportion of soldiers serving by contract in conflict areas, Tkachev says: "We have conscripts and we have contract servicemen. In the battalion that is in Tskhinvali at the moment there are about 70 contract servicemen. Officers and warrant officers are practically all on contracts. Other ranks, conscripts, naturally carry out the same duties as they do. Today we only send volunteers, be they on contracts or conscripted, and only after careful training. That is, all those who are now being sent to the conflict zones have served a minimum of six months." A major, identified by caption as "AP Prilepin, regimental psychologist," explains in an interview that volunteers for service in conflict areas are carefully screened and selected for given specialities in particular units, with unsuitable candidates being rejected. His duties also include psychological support for soldiers, he says: "The peace-keeping duties that face us are of a kind that demand the development and provision of a whole complex of measures, including essential psychological rehabilitation during and after service there." Vox pops with individual soldiers on their fears at being sent to a conflict area then follow. The soldiers emphasize that they are volunteers and satisfied at having received additional training to fulfill their new role, but said they have little idea of what awaited them in their new posting. Captain K.P. Samosyuk, company commander, agreed that training could be improved to take account of local conditions. "Additions to the training program for peacekeeping forces are essential. More specialized training should be introduced, and physical training. Because the soldiers serving here are mostly conscripted from Leningrad, Arkhangelsk, Vologda Oblast, and so on, while the peacekeeping mission has to be carried out--our division is in the Caucasus, in Moldavia [Moldova], mountainous places. And 18 months ago one battalion was sent to Tajikistan, another region a long way from our forested boggy part of the world." Video throughout shows interviewees, training facilities, and large numbers of marching troops.
