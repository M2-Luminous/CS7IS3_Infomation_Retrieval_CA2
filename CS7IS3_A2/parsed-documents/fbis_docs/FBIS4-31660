Feher argued that, after the incorporation of proposals for changes, the government bill was undemocratic. Do you agree with him? Does it mean that the other Coexistence deputies, Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] deputies, and deputies of the government coalition parties voted for an undemocratic law? [Duray] Unfortunately, Deputy Feher is right in that, had this draft been adopted, the law would have been discriminatory and restrictive. I can only express pleasure at the fact that it was not adopted. I agree with Interior Minister Pittner in that this problem must be addressed also in order to demonstrate to the European public that this petty issue will not be the stumbling block of democracy in Slovakia. [Pankovcinova] All of the MKDH deputies voted for this law. The MKDH is your coalition partner, and, in the coalition agreement, you had agreed to vote unanimously in the National Council of the Slovak Republic on issues pertaining to minorities. In the case of the signpost law, this did not happen. Will this disrupt coalition relations between your two parties? [Duray] We are going to hold consultations on this issue, and there could be a sharp exchange of opinions. However, this does not affect the substance of our cooperation. [Pankovcinova] Why have you not yet signed a preelection coalition treaty with the MKDH, the signing of which you had heralded to reporters two weeks ago? [Duray] The treaty is 90-percent ready. Only the final provisions remain to be drafted, the wording of which depends on whether there will be an agreement on a three-member coalition comprising also the Hungarian Civic Party [MOS]. Once we agree that a tight three-member coalition (which means conditions such as a joint club of deputies, joint course of action in communal elections, and joint representation of our voters' interests abroad) is acceptable to the MKDH, the treaty can be signed in a short time. [Pankovcinova] According to the MKDH chairman, however, this is not acceptable. Will you sign a treaty on a two-member coalition, then? [Duray] The treaty is ready, except for the final provisions. [Pankovcinova] What is the Coexistence Movement's attitude toward the government coalition? Will you support the government until the last day of the last meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic in this electoral term? [Duray] We would be glad if we could. [Pankovcinova] Under which conditions will you support it? [Duray] At today's meeting of the Coalition Council, we will have talks not only on how to resolve the issue of the signpost law but also on the restructuring of the Ministry of Education. If we come to an agreement, we will support the government. [Pankovcinova] And what if you do not come to an agreement on the signpost law and a possible deputies' draft of this law does not pass in the National Council of the Slovak Republic? [Duray] We had agreed with the government even before it was formed under which conditions we would support it. I hope we will not have a reason not to support it. [Pankovcinova] Let us assume that, at today's meeting of the Coalition Council, you will agree that the deputies' draft of the signpost law will be submitted in the form in which it was approved on 3 June, but without Deputy Kaliska's amendments [under which communities named after important figures of Slovak history should be exempted from the bilingual regime]. Will your deputies vote for such a law? [Duray] We will propose that the version that was submitted to the National Council of the Slovak Republic by the government be used as the point of departure. Proposals for changes that expand the application of the signpost law are acceptable to us. We will support the proposal, under which it should be possible to designate Ukrainian and Ruthenian communities in these languages on a greater scale as well as the proposal that an exemption [from the provision, under which a minority must constitute at least 20 percent of the population for bilingual signposts to be installed in a community] be granted to communities inhabited by citizens of German nationality. We will support the signpost law in that form.
