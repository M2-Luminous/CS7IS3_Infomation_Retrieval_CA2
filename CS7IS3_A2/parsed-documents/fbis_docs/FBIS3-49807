The order, issued ahead of the new round of Geneva negotiations on former Bosnia-Herzegovina, is one more measure of precaution in order to reduce to the minimum possible manipulations, imputations, and accusations at the expense of the republic of Srpska army, that it allegedly imperils members of the international organizations in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, sources close to the republic of Srpska leadership believe. The Serbian side has so far been exceptionally cooperative with international organizations, but it has often been accused of putting humanitarian missions in jeopardy, despite the fact that it has never engaged in military actions against members of the international organizations, the sources say. [passage omitted] With a view to preventing any undesirable incidents with international organizations, Karadzic issued a strict ban on all military activities in the direction of Sarajevo airport directed against any aircraft landing at the airport, any points of deployment and convoys belonging to UNPROFOR, the UNHCR, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other humanitarian organizations. President Karadzic ordered that all UNPROFOR convoys, military observers, and convoys belonging to international humanitarian organizations, that have obtained valid permission to move around in the territory of the republic of Srpska, be provided with full protection and unhindered movement, with planned and necessary inspection, and that "a completely fair and professional attitude" be taken toward representatives of all these organizations. He also ordered that all controversial issues arising with UNPROFOR representatives and military observers be dealt with exclusively through corps commands and the main headquarters of the republic of Srpska army, while disputes with international humanitarian organizations are to be dealt with through the government's coordinating body, a statement dispatched from the office of republic of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic says.
