The conference convened in Pyongyang in April 1948 discussed measures to frustrate the moves of the U.S. imperialists and the traitors for a permanent split of the nation and establish a unified democratic government with concerted efforts of the patriotic forces in North and South Korea. In his historic report "The Political Situation in North Korea" at the conference, President Kim Il-song laid bare the sinister intention and true color of the U.S. imperialists and the traitors in South Korea seeking the division of Korea and indicated epoch- making nation-saving measures for all patriotic forces in North and South Korea to unite and fight a nationwide struggle with a common fighting goal to oppose the separate "elections" in South Korea and establish a unified democratic government. Yu Ho-chun, director of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, in his report at the meeting said the joint conference was a brilliant example of a political consultative conference in which representatives of political parties, groupings and strata in the North and South with different ideologies and political views sat together and discussed measures of a joint struggle. "The conference convinced people that when the patriotic forces in the North and South united and waged a joint struggle, they could frustrate the nation-splitting moves of the U.S. imperialists and traitors and reunify the country," the reporter said. He described "10-point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country" put forward by the respected leader President Kim Il-song last year as a banner of national unity calling for the great unity of the whole nation based on patriotism and the spirit of national independence and as a brilliant embodiment of the great all-embracing policy of the Workers' Party of Korea on magnanimously embracing even those who once committed crimes against the nation and achieving broad unity. He said, "The South Korean rulers have ignored our sincere efforts for he great unity of the whole nation, turned North-South relations into hostile relations of confrontation, totally blocked North-South dialogues and staged hysteric war exercises against the North, follwing outside forces." "If the entire nation is to unite into one," he continued, "The principle of national independence must be observed. The Koreans at home and abroad must reject the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's policy of depending on outside forces and vigorously fight to get the U.S. troops and nuclear weapons withdrawn from South Korea and turn the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free, peace zone." The reporter said the South Korean authorities, though belatedly, must discard the foolish dream of realising their sinister intention in reliance on outside forces, join hands with fellow countrymen from the position of national independence, accept the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and respond to the historic proposal for a national conference.
