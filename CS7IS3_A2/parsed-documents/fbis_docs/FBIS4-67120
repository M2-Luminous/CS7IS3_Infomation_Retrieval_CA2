The police have so far seized a little over 500 grams of heroin. The National Criminal Police got on the trail of the gang upon being contacted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Customs. Nigerian heroin has been smuggled via Finland to at least the United States and Germany, but additional Central European countries were also mentioned in the preliminary hearing. The activity has probably been continuing for at least a full year. According to Criminal Commissioner Jaakko Sonck, it appears that the heroin has not been sold in Finland. Police have seized very pure white and brown heroin. Heroin of this quality can still be cut before being sold to abusers. In Finland the price for heroin on the street is from 2,000 to 5,000 markkas per gram. Seven Nigerians residing in Finland have been arrested, and four of these have been charged on suspicion of aggravated narcotics violations.
