The FPOe will, however, not give a recommendation to voters for the EU referendum to take place in June. After week-long discussions, the FPOe has finally taken a position on Austrian EU membership: On Friday evening [8 April] at the special party congress in Villach, 85.5 percent of the 463 delegates supported FPOe Chairman Haider's proposal. This proposal recommends that the FPOe parliamentary group oppose both the EU membership agreement and the amendments to the constitution that will be necessary for EU membership. The second central point of the vote at the party congress: The FPOe will not give voters any recommendation for the EU referendum in June. A total of 390 FPOe delegates (85.5 percent) voted in favor of this position, 66 were against it, and seven cast invalid votes. Haider had determined this course in his speech immediately before the vote. The FPOe chairman called the results achieved by the government in EU membership negotiations "poor, modest, and to be rejected." [passage omitted]
