Does the introduction of so many reform measures have necessary conditions? Will it give rise to social instability and dissatisfaction on the part of the masses? [SCRE] The year 1994 is a year of crucial importance for economic structural reform in China. A number of reform measures, including those of taxes, banking, foreign exchange, planning, investments, and enterprise system will be introduced and put into effect, and the difficulty and strength of reform will be quite great. Of course, there are also certain risks. We should point out that in working out reform plans, the parties concerned have already considered the possible impacts these reform measures may produce, and have planned measures to cope with the situation. Separate taxation system structural reform is undoubtedly of important significance to rationalizing the distribution relations between the central authorities and localities, mobilizing the two initiatives, promoting the rational growth of state revenue, appropriately strengthening the financial resources of the central authorities, and enhancing the macroeconomic regulation and control ability of the central government. However, such reform has also taken into account the interests of localities and enterprises, and has adopted some transitional measures so as to gradually achieve the goal of reform. As to the return amount of local taxation, the central financial authorities are taking 1993 as the return base year. Subsidies provided by the central authorities, local profits turned over to the higher authorities, and related matters of settling accounts which were in effect under the original system will remain temporarily unchanged after the separate taxation system is carried out, they will be gradually standardized after a period of transition, and be supplemented by other complementary reform measures so as to ensure the successful progress of the new system. Carrying out the tax system reform of a unified 33 percent income tax rate for home-investment enterprises will inevitably produce a major impact on fair tax burdens, on providing enterprises with the opportunity of equal competition, and on orderly competition and the stable growth of China's economy, and should be carried forward rapidly. However, taking into consideration the actual situation of the low profits of some enterprises, China has taken some transitional measures, such as making allowances for the tax rate. In short, after more than ten years of economic structural reform, the economic and psychological bearing capacity of the Chinese people has been greatly strengthened, the material benefits of reform make people feel confident of government reform measures and their results, the new system has relative superiority and a scientific basis, and the considerations given by reform measures to the vested interests and corresponding arrangements made in transitional rules and regulations have all provided ample conditions for carrying out the new system. However, we will not lower our guard against problems that may crop up and will take necessary measures at any time to overcome them to help bring about smooth reform. [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] As far as I know, the GDP for 1993 broke through three trillion yuan, with a growth of 13.4 percent, and the retail price index was 13 percent. What are the trends of economic development and commodity prices this year? [SCRE] Economic development this year will remain high, and the trend is "medium growth and medium inflation." Calculated by the current growth capacity of China's economy, the economic growth rate for 1994 is potentially about nine percent. If we lay down hard and fast rules to expand demand, and the growth rate increases too rapidly, inflation will be aggravated. To make a big step forward this year, we are objectively required to have a rather loose economic environment. Therefore, it is not suitable for the economic growth rate for 1994 to exceed 10 percent. Judged from the angle of demand, planned fixed asset investment for the whole year is 1.3 trillion yuan, social commodity retail sales will be 1.6 trillion yuan, price reform will make quite a big step forward, and including the time-lag of basic money input from the previous year, it is estimated that China will strive to keep the inflation rate under 10 percent. Last year the central authorities mainly relied on economic means, and not on administrative means, to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, and did not take measures to control prices by laying down any hard and fast rules. Due to the control of total demand, the present price rise has slowed down. The introduction of banking, fiscal charges, and other reform measures in 1994 will not lead to price increases. The introduction of price reform measures will only affect pricing structure changes. The central authorities attach great importance to inflation. When prices of grain and edible oil went up recently, the central authorities immediately took a number of measures to ensure market stability. Now some prices have gone down to a certain extent. The purpose of strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control is to achieve a basic balance between general supply and general demand, avoid a tight macroeconomic environment, and reduce the inflation rate. The state will flexibly wield the tool of currency policy, control money supply with satisfaction, and make its growth rate stay at 20 to 25 percent. It is estimated that price increases this year will be under 10 percent. In making plans this year, the state has taken full consideration of the pressure of high-speed economic growth on inflation. In making arrangements for the scale of fixed asset investments and the extent of total social commodity retail sales, it has also allowed for unforeseen circumstances. The growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) has also been readjusted from 13 percent for 1993 to 9 percent. [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] The Chinese mainland recently took measures to curb price increases of grain, but there was little essential growth of peasants' income in recent years. How should this contradiction be handled? [SCRE] There were increases in the peasants' income in recent years, but after deducting the factor of price increases, they were very small. For instance, the per capita net income of peasants in 1993 was 880 yuan, an increase of 90 yuan over that of the previous year, but after deducting the factor of price increases, actual growth was only about 2 percent. Do increases in the peasants' income rely mainly on rises in the price of grain and other agricultural products? Of course, and necessary price rises are necessary, which are also an aspect of raising the peasants' incomes. This year, due to the impact of the release of raw coal and crude oil prices, it is necessary to further raise the purchasing prices of grain and cotton. But the price level is affected by supply and demand relations, and it is impossible for it to stay at a high level for a long period of time. In fact, the prices of grain and other agricultural products in China are already close or equal to international market prices. It seems that, from an agricultural point of view, to increase the income of the peasants it is necessary to take the road of high yield, best quality, and high efficiency. Apart from developing high-yield, best-quality, and highly efficient agricultural products that suit market needs and reduce the peasants' burdens, to develop nonagricultural industries is the key and breach for increasing the peasants' income. At present, there are over 100 million surplus laborers in China's rural areas, and there will be a new increase of over ten million laborers each year in the future. How we tackle the problem of employment for these laborers is a matter of major importance for raising peasants' income. The solution to the problem is to make great efforts to develop primary, secondary, and tertiary industries, of which the stress should be on developing township and town enterprises. Why are the peasants of economically developed areas in China rich? It is mainly because they get a large amount of income from township and town enterprises. At present, the income peasants derive from nonagricultural industries already accounts for 37 percent of their total income, and the great majority of the income of peasants in economically developed areas come from nonagricultural industries. Therefore, the key to major development of the rural economy and to increasing the peasants' income is to fully employ peasants and to develop township and town enterprises. [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] What reform and policy measures will the state take in 1994 to reduce the burdens of state-owned enterprises? [SCRE] An outstanding problem that currently constrains state- owned enterprises to transform mechanisms and move toward the market is that they carry heavy burdens. In light of this problem, in 1994 the state intends to adopt, while actively blazing new trails in the enterprise system and building up a modern enterprise system that meets the requirements of market system, corresponding policy measures and complementary reform measures, reduce enterprise burdens in real earnest, and concentrate its efforts on creating conditions for state-owned enterprises to participate equally in market competition. The state intends to: 1. Adopt a unified tax rate, fair tax burdens, and strengthen the loan repayment capacity and funds capacity of state-owned enterprises. From 1 January 1994, a 33 percent income tax rate has been in effect for home-investment enterprises. The collection of budget regulatory taxes, energy and communication construction funds, and budget regulatory funds from large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises is abolished. According to industrial policy, after-tax profits of old state-owned enterprises of sole proprietorship that need support can be retained by enterprises for their own use. Businesses should conscientiously implement the "General Rules for Enterprise Financial Affairs" and "Norms for Enterprise Business Accounting," and standardize enterprise cost accounting. Loan interest should be charged to cost, and those enterprises with proper conditions can increase depreciation. The loan repayment capacity of enterprises is enhanced by the above measures. 2. Rationally solve the debt burden problem of state-owned enterprises. Enterprises that find it difficult to repay outstanding loans on fixed assets can postpone repayment after being examined and verified as having bad debts and overdue accounts, a part of which can be handled by a bad-debt reserve fund by banks according to relevant regulations. 3. Gradually separate the nonproductive undertakings of enterprises and solve the problem of enterprises "running society." Schools for children of workers and staff run by enterprises and other service undertakings and social functions undertaken by enterprises should be separated from enterprise production and operations as soon as possible. Some should be carried on by the government, and others by social self-government organizations. 4. Pay close attention to solving the redundancy problem of ailing enterprises. According to a sample survey, there are about 20 million redundant members at their posts in ailing state-owned enterprises. These redundant members can be digested and dispersed by vigorously initiating tertiary industry and setting up servicing economic entities. Moreover, pay close attention to working out certain policy measures, and encourage a number of staff and workers to go to work in township and town enterprises, "foreign-funded" enterprises, and private enterprises, or look for jobs by themselves. 5. Enterprises that carry heavy burdens, and that lose money for a long time and without hope of eliminating deficits, should be transformed through bankruptcy, annexation, reorganization, and joint ventures, thus fundamentally solving the problem of enterprise burdens. [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] What is the situation of experiments with the shareholding system in China, and what are the plans for 1994 ? [SCRE] Under the guidance and encouragement of Comrade Xiaoping's talk during his inspection tour to southern China, the experimental work of China's shareholding system has entered a new stage of development. As an important form of equity system reform of state-owned enterprises and the transformation of enterprise operations, the shareholding system has won people's attention. The experimental work of the shareholding system started in 1984, and up till now it has been carried on for ten years. Although the time for experiments is not long, and the number of enterprises under experimentation is small, the shareholding system has shown powerful vitality in the market economy, injected new vigor into the equity system reform of state-owned enterprises, and promoted the setting up of a modern enterprise system. According to incomplete statistics, there are 3,800 enterprises experimenting with the shareholding system. Through their method of buying shares, these enterprises can be roughly divided into three categories: First, shareholding enterprises that include shares held by their own staff and workers, which account for about 47 percent. By this form of shareholding system, a number of share ownership certificates are issued to enterprises' staff and workers, from whom 23.5 billion yuan have been raised. Second, shareholding enterprises whose shares are purely held by legal persons, which occupy about 46 percent. They are mainly joint stock companies whose shares are held by specific legal persons, and companies with limited liability, invested in and organized by legal persons. Third, shareholding enterprises whose stocks are issued to the public, which accounts for about 7 percent. These joint stock companies are divided into three types depending on how their stocks are issued and listed. The first type is: A shares, which are issued only inside China, mainly purchased by the public of China. The second type is: While A shares are issued, B shares are also issued, which legal persons and natural persons outside China are allowed to purchase, and the costs of which are calculated in renminbi. Transactions of B shares can only be made in the securities markets inside China. The third type is: While A shares are issued, H shares are also issued to buyers outside China, which are listed in Hong Kong. At present, there are six joint stock limited companies listed in the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, which includes Tsingtao Brewery, Shanghai Petrochemical, Guangdong Shipyard, Beiren Printing, Maanshan Iron, and Kunming Machine, and HK$8.4 billion have been raised. By the end of 1993, 196 companies were listed for transaction in the securities exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, of which 33 listed companies issued B shares, and the market price of listed shares amounted to 300 billion yuan. There were 25 kinds of directional fund-raising corporate shares listed in the jointly run STAQ [preceding acronym published in English; expansion unknown] Market and China Securities Exchange NET [preceding acronym published in English; expansion unknown] System, of which 23 kinds were listed for transactions. These listed companies were distributed over 19 provinces, municipalities, and cities whose plans were separately listed. Listed companies expanded in scale from small and medium-sized enterprises to large and especially large enterprises, extending to industry, commerce, urban construction, energy, communications, telecommunications, and other trades. To standardize the shareholding enterprises under experimentation before the end of 1990, the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy approved and acknowledged 119 fundraising companies to continue making standardization experiments. The next step, whether enterprises carrying out shareholding system reorganization or issue stocks and list for transactions, is still making experiments, and not spreading out over large areas. The principles of experimental work are: Active experiments, strict standardization, steady progress, and healthy development. The requirements for experimental work are: Making experiments resolutely, not trying to make too many experiments, but be sure they are good, and not running into disorder. We must still exercise margin control over enterprises that are going to issue and list their shares this year, and whether their shares are issued inside or outside China, preferential measures should be taken toward large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in energy, communications, telecommunications, raw and processed materials, and other trades. We should continue restricting monetary enterprises and real estate development enterprises from issuing shares, nor do we advocate large numbers of commercial enterprises issuing shares. This year we will continue recommending a larger number of enterprises than that of last year to issue and list their shares in Hong Kong and the United States. [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] Please say a few words about the current situation of the futures market in China, the present policy of developing the futures market, and issues related to it. [SCRE] Since leading comrades of the State Council gave us instructions in 1988 to study futures, the development of China's futures market -- from research, planning, to making experiments -- has been healthy. Up till now, a number of broker companies and exchanges for futures transactions have been set up, and the business volume of some exchanges has reached a considerable scale. However, there have been some problems in the course of development of the futures market, some of which are quite serious. For example: Recently, some localities and departments competed with each other to set up futures exchanges or retail markets with the goal of developing a futures business, and blindly set up futures broker companies. Some law enforcement departments also participated in futures brokering activities. Some futures broker companies of foreign investments, Chinese and foreign joint investments, or joint investments in disguised form deliberately deceived their clients, and some illegal elements inside and outside China colluded with each other in futures swindling activities. Some organizations and individuals lacked a basic understanding of the futures market, blindly took part in futures business inside and outside China, and were taken in and deceived, resulting in losses. Therefore, we must strictly standardize and control the futures market, and everything must go through experiments. China's present policy of developing the futures market is: 1. In the present experimental work of the futures market, we must uphold the principle of "starting by standardization, stepping up legislation, everything goes through experiments, and strict control," strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, and carry out unified guidance and supervision and management. The State Council has decided that the State Council Securities Committee shall be responsible for the guidance, planning, and coordination of the experimental work of the futures market, and that specific jobs shall be done by China Securities Supervisory and Management Committee. 2. Examination and approval and registration of new futures business and broker organizations will be temporarily suspended without exception. Existing futures business organizations and broker companies are required to complete formalities again for examination and approval, and those that are not approved shall suspend making futures transactions and futures broker business without exception. 3. Ban illegal futures broker activities. 4. Strict control should be exercised over state-owned enterprises and public undertakings taking part in futures business. Law enforcement departments and their affiliated organizations must not take part in futures broker activities. It is strictly prohibited to use bank loans for futures business. China's attitude toward foreign capitals entering China's futures market and China's enterprises, public undertakings, and individuals engaged in futures business outside China is: China's futures market is still in its experimental stage and has just started, and the building of laws and regulations is unsound. Therefore, there is no corresponding legal guarantee at present for foreign capital to enter China's futures market. It is not suitable, nor is it safe, for them to enter. When China's futures market becomes somewhat mature, and when laws and regulations become amplified, we welcome foreign capital in China's futures market. Regarding China's state-owned enterprises, public undertakings, and individuals engaged in futures business activities outside China, our attitude is: 1) State-owned enterprises and public undertakings taking part in futures transactions should be kept under strict control. Generally, they are allowed to carry out transactions in appropriate commodity futures and index-linked foreign exchange futures, while making spot transactions on import and export trade. 2) Non-state-owned enterprises and individuals that have the capital may engage in futures speculation outside China, and all risks are borne by themselves. [ZHONGGUO GAIGE] What are the plans for China's import structure reform? What are your views on last year's import and export trade deficit? [SCRE] The Chinese Government encourages exports and imports that are beneficial to China's economic development. Last year, there was a deficit (7.8 billion dollars from January to November) in China's foreign trade, for which there were many reasons. It was a problem accompanied by last years' high-speed economic growth. But, from a structural point of view, it also explained that the Chinese Government had greatly reduced administrative control over imports, and indicated China's action of further connecting tracks with international practice in its import structure. China reduced its import duty rates twice in one year (from 43 percent to about 36 percent, which can be regarded as average), and will in the days to come further reduce its import duty rate. Beginning last year, China carried out plans of reducing in five years about two-thirds of its commodities controlled by import quotas and permits, and commodities controlled by import examination and approval, and the import of machinery and electronic products was changed from the system of examination and approval to primarily the system of registration. In the future, China will further reform its import control system, further reduce administrative intervention, strengthen economic means, and maintain a basic balance in imports and exports.
