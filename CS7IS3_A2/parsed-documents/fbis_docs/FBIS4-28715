I also think it will be an important historic event." Hata's remarks came in reply to a question posed by Toranosuke Katayama of the Liberal Democratic Party, who asked, "Is it correct to say that you are making a public commitment to formulating the legislation by the end of June and having the Diet pass it by the end of the year?" Asked about the political responsibility he might assume in case of failing to achieve the reform, however, Hata only said, "I want to tackle the issue seriously."
