Petushkov, Central Aerological Observatory; UDC 551.510.534(215-17)] [Abstract] The reasons for the appearance of ozone miniholes over the northern hemisphere in January 1986 and 1987 are discussed. This phenomenon is usually observed in the period October-March, its appearance has an irregular character and may vary from year to year. These miniholes occur in the northern hemisphere middle and high latitudes when there is no global ozone hole in the Arctic. An attempt is made to establish correlations between changes in wave activity in the lower stratosphere and ozone distribution anomalies in the northern hemisphere high latitudes. The many processes involved in the development of these miniholes are analyzed. A comparison of the computed three-dimensional Eliassen-Palma flows and variations in the total ozone content indicated that the appearance and evolution of ozone miniholes over the North Atlantic, Europe and Siberia are related to changes in wave activity and the direction of vortical transport of ozone by planetary waves. Weakening of wave activity and anomalous transport from the low latitudes may be reasons for the appearance of ozone miniholes. The filling of ozone miniholes is associated with an increase in wave activity. The analysis of these ozone anomalies in the northern hemisphere middle and high latitudes indicates that natural, not anthropogenic factors are responsible for the formation and evolution of ozone miniholes.
