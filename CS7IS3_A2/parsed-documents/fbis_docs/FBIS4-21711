Khachatphai: [passage omitted] I wish to give the assurance that the country enjoys complete security. All the officials concerned have worked together closely to find the culprits and gather information to prevent the future occurrence of these problems. Security at various installations has been strengthened to prevent acts of terrorism. [passage omitted] Correspondent: Does this mean that the performance of the officials concerned has not been effective? Khachatphai: One must realize that there are people who look for opportunities to create trouble. They will carry out their work whenever an opportunity arises. Therefore, it is difficult to absolutely prevent every problem. Intelligence operations and security vigilance have been responsible for preventing many incidents. These types of operations, however, cannot be publicized. So, people do not know about the performance of such operations. Therefore, it is unfair to say that officials have been ineffective. Correspondent: What are the causes of the bombings perpetrated by local or foreign elements? Khachatphai: There are many causes for the bomb attacks carried out by Thais. Among them are personal conflicts and deliberate attempts to create a situation. [passage omitted] Correspondent: Do international terrorist groups pick Thailand for their operations because they find it easy? Khachatphai: Thai society, like in other liberal countries, is open. Tourists can travel where they please. Several million foreign tourists visit every year, in addition to more than 100,000 illegal arrivals. This is a weak point, but it does not mean that international terrorists pick Thailand because it is so easy to stage an incident. Correspondent: Compared with Singapore and Malaysia whose societies are also open, why do terrorists pick on Thailand to carry out their sabotage activities? Khachatphai: There are several factors international terrorists consider in choosing a country for their sabotage. One factor is their intended target. It is probably not true that security in those two countries is so good that it is impossible to carry out terrorist activities. The elaborate counterterrorist measures in the United States and the UK have not been able to completely prevent terrorist activities there. Correspondent: In addition to foreign terrorist groups, are there local groups which complicate the sabotage picture? Khachatphai: Possibly both. That is, there could be foreign terrorist groups which have targets in Thailand. Meanwhile, there are some local groups which aim to create public disorder. So, incidents affecting national peace and order could be created by any of these elements. Therefore, officials concerned must not relax and must be ready to prevent an incident and timely solve it if it happens. Correspondent: What about groups which seek to topple the current government? Khachatphai: The results of initial investigations have not linked groups seeking a political change to the disturbances. Normal incidents of disturbance are probably linked to personal disputes or to intimidation with some purpose in mind. Officials concerned are trying to verifying the causes. [passage omitted]
