Dr. al-'Anani was reacting to a statement in Cairo by the prime minister of South Yemen's secessionist government, Haydar Abu- Bakr al-'Attas, accusing Jordan and Iraq of providing the north with military spare parts. The information minister said Jordan views the current fighting in Yemen as an internal affair and that the accusations were baseless. [Begin recording] [Al-'Anani] Well, first of all, as far as Iraq is concerned, Iraq is being closely monitored especially in the field of arms. So, as far as that score is concerned, I think it's not correct, and I am sure it's not correct. As far as Jordan is concerned, the only transportation we had to Yemen was when the internal war took place. Jordan was among the very few countries, and eventually the only country, which dared send planes, first of all civilian planes, to rescue people from the war zone and bring them back -- Jordanian families and children, and then Arab nationals, and then even peoples from third countries. We did that on our own risk. The planes which went there were civilian planes. We had to pay at a certain time an insurance policy, noncommercial insurance policy, amounting to half a million dollars per trip, which is an exorbitant amount to pay. Then we replaced that by empty planes that brought people back, military planes that brought, which came back full of people and luggage. And those were witnessed by many people, they were under cameras and monitored and so on. I really don't see where such a claim came. Maybe, it could be as a result of Jordan's position as far as believing that legitimacy and legality should prevail in Yemen because Yemen right now is a sovereign country that has developed its own institutions through a constitutional process, elections, and so on and so forth. It is true that the institutional structure was not yet completed, but we had a state that was acknowledged by the international community. Therefore, I don't think that we should mix positions of Jordan, which stem from its strong adherence to international law and to internal integrity of each sovereign state in the world, with the fact that Jordan, which was invited by both warring factions in Yemen to reconciliate between them. [sentence as heard] They came to Jordan, they asked Jordan for that role, which we did with the help of other Arab countries, now to be accused that it is really fuelling the war that is going on when we abhor bloodshed, and we don't like it. [Correspondent Murid Hammad] Some say that this is the price that Jordan will again have to pay for standing up in favor of Arab unity and national reconciliation. Do you agree with that? [Al-'Anani] I agree that Jordan has paid a heavy price for such positions and maybe Yemen will prove to be another example. [end recording]
