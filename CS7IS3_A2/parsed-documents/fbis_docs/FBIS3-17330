The document in the form of yet another petition is expected to reach Viktor Chernomyrdin's desk soon. Should the Russian premier add his signature to it, the regions would finally secure a clear delimitation of powers of the Federation components and the Federal government in the budget, taxation, and foreign policy spheres. The conference participants announced that the agreement would replace the separate treaties each Federation component has with the center. Sergey Shakhray, who attended the conference and who is regarded, according to some information, as the mastermind of the agreement, stated that the ideal option would be for the oblast and local budgets to absorb up to 75 percent of the public revenues. A draft agreement lobby was created in the form of a coordination council which will "have its representatives in the central organs of power and directly transfer to the regions the powers they are going to procure." It is known from recent history, however, that it is not going to be easy for the regions to get the powers -- even despite the fact that Sergey Shakhray is prepared to sacrifice for the agreement the government careers of four ministers, members of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord.
