It is planned to have one efficient military base installed in two localities on the Republic's territory. The main installation is to be in the Gyumri locality, where a Russian motorized infantry division is currently quartered, while part of the base's subunits will be stationed in Yerevan, where a Russian motorized infantry regiment is based at present. This opinion was shared by the members of the Russian military delegation at the summing-up conference held today by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. He noted that Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan was sympathetic toward the proposed Russian military base. According to Grachev, the bases in Armenia should be set up by 1 August 1994. The minister noted that it will be quite a powerful body of troops and that there are plans to include antiaircraft and air force -- with the exception of long-distance aircraft -- elements alongside ground troops. "It will be a powerful air mobile force," Pavel Grachev said, "which can be deployed in any danger area at short notice should the need arise." Apart from this, the question of creating a joint Russian-Armenian antiaircraft defense system within the framework of the collective security treaty was also discussed. The extent of the Russian and Armenian contributions in terms of materiel and personnel was established. In particular, Russia plans to station additional air defense subunits in Armenia to cover certain sections and control the Armenian airspace. These will be missile complexes and a squadron of interceptor planes. The final decision on the whole complex of questions concerning the Russian military base in Armenia will be made at the presidential level. As one of the participants in the talks said to an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Russia intends to take legal posession of its military base for the period of 25 years. At the same time the Russian side hopes that "conditions do not mean that the base is being rented." Besides, the Russian side proposed that Moscow exercise direct control over the base. According to Pavel Grachev, the Armenian side promised to assist in funding and provision for the Russian military base.
