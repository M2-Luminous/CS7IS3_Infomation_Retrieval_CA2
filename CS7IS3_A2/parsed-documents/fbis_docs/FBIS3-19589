Great Britain might be willing to give in concerning the contentious issue of the blocking minority for European Union [EU] decisions. So far, the final conclusion of the membership negotiations has failed because of disagreement on this issue. The issue of European integration was also the focal issue at a meeting of the Federal Executive Committee of the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] in Salzburg on Saturday [19 March]. The marathon debate took more than six hours. In the course of this discussion the FPOe made a clear change in its EU policy. Until then rejection of EU membership had dominated. Now the FPOe has become more positive toward the EU. A precondition for a recommendation to vote yes [in the referendum on EU membership] is the conclusion of a European treaty between the government and the opposition, FPOe Chairman Joerg Haider stressed. "In view of the existing results of the negotiations, which are known only very rudimentarily, it is all the more necessary to critically ask whether the necessary homework has been done." Over the past few days, EU advocates in the FPOe have spoken up more loudly. In the diet elections [in Salzburg, Tirol, and Carinthia on 13 March], polls showed that half of FPOe voters are positively inclined toward the EU. The European treaty is to set down the fulfillment of several demands within a precise timeframe. Among other things, Haider is demanding a constitutional safeguarding of direct payments to farmers and tax reform to protect small and medium-sized enterprises. The invitation to Foreign Minister Alois Mock (Austrian People's Party) and State Secretary Brigitte Ederer (Social Democratic Party of Austria) to brief the FPOe about the results of the EU negotiations is still open.
