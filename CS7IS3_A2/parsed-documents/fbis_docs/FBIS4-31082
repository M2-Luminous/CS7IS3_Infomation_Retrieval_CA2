They have chosen this name because they are obliged to do so according to electoral law. Speaking about the policies of the new party at a news conference in the federal assembly today, Slobodan Rakitic, stated that they are a democratic party whose program is based on Christian civilization. Stressing that the opposition has up to now been mainly saying what it does not want, rather than what it does, Rakitic said that the party supports everything that is good for the Serbian people. [Begin Rakitic recording] Morality, traditional values, understanding, and tolerance that the Serbian people possess in their collective being should be the main program tenets of the reformed Depos. [end recording] Presidency member Strahinja Kastratovic said that the time of boisterous parties, yelling, and outbursts of hatred is over, and that the new Depos favors a peaceful approach and cooperation with all political parties. Kastratovic stressed in particular that one should do everything possible to help the stabilization program and that the party supports Avramovic's program. The survival of the program is the precondition for the stability of the parliament. According to Kastratovic, this means that one should not insist on new elections but support the efforts of the federal and republican governments. Regarding Depos' stand on peace in Bosnia, Kastratovic said that the interests of the Serbian people must be protected, as must international relations, taking into account the interests of the republic of Srpska and the republic of Serbian Krajina while not endangering the interests of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
