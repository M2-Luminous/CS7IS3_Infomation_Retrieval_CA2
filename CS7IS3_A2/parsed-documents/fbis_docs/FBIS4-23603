Answering questions after his opening address to the two-day World Economic Forum [WEF] conference in Cape Town, he said a clause of the African National Congress' Freedom Charter of 1955 had called for the nationalisation of a "limited sector" of the economy -- the mines, banks and monopolies. That had been the correct strategy because history had shown countries had not been able to escape nationalisation after a trauma such as war. However, he and the ANC had been "so hammered" on the nationalisation issue at the 1992 WEF conference in Davos, Switzerland, that it "became clear that although we were correct in this strategy, we had to do something if we wanted investment in the country", Mr Mandela said -- to applause and laughter from the international and local delegates. The ANC had, therefore, shifted its stance and its position today was exactly the same as that of Germany, where the constitution provided for nationalisation but where it had not been implemented for decades. "Now our position is a pragmatic one," President Mandela added.
