FR941021-1-00045 FR941021-1-00009 In determining eligibility for medical certification under the special issuance provisions of the FAR, the Federal Air Surgeon considers the natural history and severity of the problem, the period of satisfactory recovery since manifestation of the problem, and any treatment, as well as any continuing requirements for treatment, and the nature of treatment. For diabetics whose disease is controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents, additional factors that may be considered include: the age of onset of diabetes; the documented degree and means of past and present diabetes control; the presence or absence of adverse effects, including hypoglycemic episodes; the presence or absence of other known risk factors; and the individual's willingness and ability to maintain strict control of his or her condition and treatment and to cooperate with any monitoring plan required by the FAA. Four physicians who served on the AMA Report's Endocrinology Committee subsequently submitted a letter stating that they reconsidered their Committee's recommendation on diabetes. The recommendation of the Endocrine Committee was to continue to disqualify diabetics who use insulin to control their disease. In their letter, the four physicians stated that persons on insulin therapy should be allowed consideration for special issuance certification. Several other physicians who commented on the AMA Report also supported certification of persons on insulin therapy. The issues raised by these commenters pertain to current FAA policy of not permitting special issuance consideration for persons on insulin therapy. As recommended by the full AMA Committee, the FAA proposes to retain this policy but remains open to a change in its policy should there be any new medical developments. The issue was thoroughly covered by the full AMA Committee and its recommendation was made after deliberation and thorough discussion. The contra recommendation of the four physicians who submitted a letter to the FAA was not subjected to the same process, nor did their recommendation contain any acceptable procedure for identifying persons on insulin therapy who could be safely, reliably, and practically certified through the special issuance process. In a related matter, a summary of an American Diabetes Association (ADA) petition for rulemaking to review FAA rules and policies regarding individuals with diabetes was recently published in the Federal Register (56 FR 10383, March 12, 1991). Specifically, the ADA petitioned the FAA to amend FAR §§67.13, 67.15, 67.17, and 67.19 to allow individuals with insulin-treated diabetes mellitus to be issued medical certificates on a case-by-case basis. The ADA further requested the creation of an FAA-appointed medical task force to develop a medical protocol capable of permitting meaningful case-by-case review. Docket No. 26493 was established to receive comments on the ADA petition. Since the comment period on the ADA petition has closed but the subject of that petition is directly related to the part 67 review, additional comments on the diabetes-related issues raised in the ADA petition may be submitted to the docket of this rulemaking. The FAA may dispose of the issues raised in the ADA petition through this action at the final rule stage, or through the issuance of a separate disposition of the ADA petition.
