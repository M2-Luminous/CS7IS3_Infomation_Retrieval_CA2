They explained this move by saying that they did not consult with the prime minister on their decision because he left for Germany before they had a chance to talk with him. Do you feel cheated? [Krzaklewski] The prime minister has made it clear to the whole of society, and not just us, that his declarations cannot be treated seriously. I do not know whether this scenario was actually preplanned--that is, whether the prime minister intended to announce the withdrawal of his support for the popiwek act in public one day, and to have his deputies submit a government bill for a new popiwek act the next, but, whether or not it was, this sort of strategy is dishonest and it compromises the government. It could also suggest that the prime minister has lost control of his own party and, by the same token, has lost his credibility with us. In any case, the point is not only that the National Commission was cheated, inasmuch as its members had left Gdansk with very little hope that a dialogue with the government was still possible. The National Commission regarded the prime minister's declaration with much reserve anyway, and it decided not to suspend the protest action while awaiting the implementation of the said declaration. Moreover, we never received a positive reply to any of our remaining stipulations. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Which ones? [Krzaklewski] The ones concerning energy prices, taxation, citizens' enfranchisement, and a 40-hour workweek. In other words, stipulations mainly concerned with ensuring an increase in families' real incomes. It is inconceivable that we should have a situation in which the 1994 gross national product is on the increase, but the working people's family incomes keep falling. The government rejected our recommendations that energy price increases be reduced to the level of inflation. In a clever move, it spread the increases over three successive stages, which is why people have not felt their full effects yet, but, because of that operation, the increases will be higher than originally announced. Similarly, families have not yet felt the impact of the changed taxation bands. For example, people who earn a comparatively large amount will soon enter the second taxation band. If, as a result of the "married couple" assessment of tax liability, which includes their spouses, it turns out that their income tax does not exceed the 33-percent threshold, they will still not get back the advance payment--reduced by the inflation rate--until the second quarter of the following year. Because of this kind of regulation, we demand the chance to assess family incomes on a current basis, determining from such assessment which families should be automatically receiving family income supplement. Social unrest is increasing, and, if it does not explode today, it is bound to in August or September, with greatly magnified force. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] But is your stipulation to enfranchise society not belated and unrealistic, in any case? After all, workforces of enterprises under privatization receive their allocated shares according to the terms and provisions of the "Enterprises Pact." As a result of this form of privatization, many employees become millionaires, not to say billionaires. [Krzaklewski] Like the night guard at Bank Slaski. The enfranchisement demand is not belated and is still perfectly relevant today. People feel the injustice of the uneven opportunities more and more acutely. Those citizens who have the luck to be working in enterprises that are being privatized--even if the privatization is of a pathological nature--have a chance of becoming richer than they were before. Others, who have been contributing to the creation of the state's assets, have no such chance at all. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Those who have received their shares will not give them back now. [Krzaklewski] Their shares should be treated as prepayment on account of the universal privatization scheme. If they exceed a certain set limit, they will get no more shares in the future. We want to see 50 percent of the inventoried State Treasury assets distributed among all citizens in the form of privatization bonds. After two or three years, the owners will be able to exchange the bonds for shares in banks and companies or, for example, use them to purchase homes within company housing schemes. Certain preferential terms should be reserved for employees of the privatized enterprises because they had taken an active part in the creation of their assets. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] But such decisions require fundamental changes in the entire system. [Krzaklewski] Indeed, the system does need to be changed. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] If Solidarity-based governments failed to introduce significant changes in the system, how do you expect the present postcommunist parties to do it? [Krzaklewski] I most emphatically deny that they were truly Solidarity-based governments. They were governments composed of people who had once belonged as members to the Solidarity trade union, were experts attached to it, or were otherwise associated with it on political grounds. These people created their own political parties, with specific programs and ideologies. But they should not be associated with a trade union. None of these parties has ever realized the Solidarity program. It is high time to put an end to the formulation "Solidarity governments." Let me remind you that, if you do not count the resolution in support of the president in the election, Solidarity has never officially resolved to promote or sponsor the authorities in power after 1989. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] What about the "protective umbrella" extended over the first Solidarity-based government? [Krzaklewski] That was an umbrella over the whole of Poland. After all, as early as 1990, there were several dozen strike actions, and, in the following year, their number grew to several hundred. Through the end of 1993, we had more than 1,000 strike actions. Would you still maintain that we were extending a protective umbrella over the government? Remember that we started coming out in protest much earlier than the postcommunist trade unions. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Rumors circulating among certain Solidarity activists have it that the latest demonstration and the wave of recent strikes were inspired by President Lech Walesa. [Krzaklewski] This is arrant nonsense! The last time I had any direct contact with the president was before the Zielona Gora congress. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] But, during the Warsaw demonstration, the Solidarity leadership did its best to ensure that the marchers did not go to the Belweder. [Krzaklewski] We did not want to dilute our action by introducing a whole variety of issues and slogans. We wanted to show that our goal was to secure increases in families' incomes. In the past few days, the president interpreted our protest correctly. His veto of the popiwek act was not exclusively a gesture in the direction of private companies. It came as a result of pressure exerted by our union, and that is why we expressed our thanks to the president. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Meanwhile, the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR], which is the president's organization, has been boasting that it was the first to support your strike actions. [Krzaklewski] The first organization that offered us its support was the center-right parties' secretariat. However, we would like to be effectively supported by politically strong parties--and these are lacking at the political center and on the right. Consequently, we are waiting for a strong party, whose program and ideology will not be at odds with Solidarity. I am afraid that we might have a long wait ahead of us. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] It so happened that Professor Zbigniew Religa, BBWR chief, offered to represent you politically before your meeting with the president. What are you going to answer if, say, the president promises to supports your demands but, in return, stipulates that you support him in the presidential election? [Krzaklewski] We cannot even consider such an eventuality, and we will not enter into any political compacts with anyone--not even the president--because we are not a political party. All we can do is negotiate a certain contract on the basis of which the president would support our demands. On the other hand, making promises of support for the president on behalf of all of our members would be dishonest of us. People will support him but only when he has fulfilled their expectations. We would be very glad to see the president achieve successes because people would then live a better life. Recently, we learned that, apart from the right to veto parliamentary bills, the president has a rather limited range of powers because a peculiar hegemony of two parties has arisen in parliament, and this enables them to approve virtually any bills they want. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] It was members of the public who chose them. [Krzaklewski] But the same number of people voted for the parties and political groups that are outside parliament now. Does Mr. Kowalski, who voted for the groups that did not pass the parliamentary threshold, have different constitutional rights from Mr. Nowak, who voted for the parties that passed the 5-percent threshold? [Madajczyk-Krasowska] In that case, why did the leaders of the former groups, including also Solidarity, not give Kowalski a chance by creating a joint coalition? After all, the National Trade Union Accord [OPZZ] did enter a coalition with the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. [Krzaklewski] Before the election, we campaigned for creating a block of combined votes in favor of the Solidarity electoral list, but each of the possible parties was convinced that it would obtain the required 5 percent of votes on its own. It is also worth remembering that some parties were hostile to us. To tell the truth, the only offer of support came from the president. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] But you rejected it. [Krzaklewski] That was in order to demonstrate that Solidarity as a union will not enter into any political compacts with any party or parties. If we did, it would be a decision of grave consequences for a union as pluralistic as ours. On the other hand, the BBWR electorate is in the main associated with the liberal and neoliberal orientations as regards the economy. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] What political and economic system do you want? [Krzaklewski] We want a system that will combine market economy with cooperation and that will constitutionally guarantee a dialogue between social partners, a dialogue conducted according to the rules of social solidarity. You could provisionally call it a market-and-social-solidarity system. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Is that not a utopian vision? After all, this world is marked by conflict between groups of opposing interests. [Krzaklewski] They come into conflict and thus drag the world into a crisis. Nowadays everybody is asking what kind of system we should have. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] People have always asked this question. We know that only a democratic system based on political parties can withstand major crises. [Krzaklewski] Are we in Poland supposed to copy the mistakes made by those who refuse to put their efforts into creating a more stable political system, in which the principle of social solidarity would be the rule? [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Do you suggest a third way? [Krzaklewski] Yes. World confederations of trade unions are of a similar opinion, too. Such a program was presented by Solidarity at the latest World Labor Organization congress. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Who is supposed to realize it? [Krzaklewski] It must be written into the constitution of the Third Republic. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Do you sometimes dream of a return of Solidarity as it was in 1980? [Krzaklewski] There will never be another Solidarity like that because the situation is very different now. At that time, we were fighting to regain our national independence and to return to fundamental moral values. We were involved in the creation of a democratic system that would not be dominated solely by the free market and monetarism but would include ethical values. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Do you know even one country where moral values are placed at the top of the agenda? [Krzaklewski] In other words, you mean paradise. Even if we cannot build such a paradisiacal country in this world, that is no reason to give up our hopes and ambitions. We must strive to improve the system, and we must protect people from being marginalized because otherwise they will cease believing in just and fair political and economic action and become irresponsible. After all, neofascist groups are already beginning to gain momentum in both the West and the East. Poland and other postcommunist countries are now facing the risk of building a capitalist system on the basis of dishonestly accumulated capital. A significant proportion of present businessmen are people who amassed their wealth only because they were, for example, communist functionaries or financial criminals who escaped being caught and brought to justice after 1989. If such negative tendencies prevail in the future, we will move in the direction of the system of capital oligarchy--that is, the stage South American countries had attained in the 1950's and 1960's. Seventy percent of national assets will be in the hands of 10,000 or so citizens. We are at this moment at the crossroads of a struggle for our system. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] How do you propose to introduce a better system? With the help of strikes, demonstrations, or perhaps a revolution? [Krzaklewski] We want to change the law and make a clean break with the legislative system obtaining in the Polish People's Republic [PPR] as well as the consequences of that system; we also want to enfranchise all citizens. We believe that there is a need for a decisive break with the previous system by means of such moves as, among other things, the introduction of a vetting law and a decommunization law, which would condemn past structures instead of people. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] You blame all mistakes on Solidarity-derived parties, but, at the same time, you form very extensive coalitions with them for the purpose of local self-government elections. Is your anticommunist crusade supposed to justify even those coalitions you form with the parties that previously tried to restrict your rights? [Krzaklewski] We do not form coalitions but, at the most, enter into contracts in support of individual candidates. On the whole, Solidarity Trade Union does not take part in its own right in local self-government elections. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] When are you going to meet with the president? [Krzaklewski] The date of our meeting depends on the president's choice. We regret that the president signed the Budget Act before meeting with us; many of our stipulations could be realized through complementary budget-related parliamentary acts and regulations. We wanted to explain to the president that it is not at all necessary to introduce fundamental changes in the budget in order to meet our demands. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Do you have an alliance with the president? [Krzaklewski] We do not. We have formal relations with him. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Will you allow yourselves to be exploited by the president? [Krzaklewski] You cannot view our meeting with the president in terms of one side losing and one side gaining in the exchange. It is the country that is supposed to gain. That was what we were talking about during our meetings with the president last year. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] What if the president were to dissolve parliament in fulfillment of his threats? Would you support him then? [Krzaklewski] The president cannot dissolve parliament just like that, on his whim. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] What if he were to resort to the use of power? [Krzaklewski] That would be tantamount to fascism! We will not lend support to such moves even in relation to a parliament led by communists. The democratic system must be respected even if it has given birth to an "ugly duckling." After all, we have fought for that system--and we are still fighting for it.
