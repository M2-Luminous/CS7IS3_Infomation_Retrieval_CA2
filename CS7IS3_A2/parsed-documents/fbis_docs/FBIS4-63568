Kovalev has signed the decree "On Payment in Kind of Enterprises' Financial Obligations." Henceforth and until times improve, enterprises, by agreement with the administration, will pay their taxes in the form of their own output. The local authorities intend to use barter to acquire the goods which the oblast needs. Enterprises' debts to the budget will be considered cleared only after deals have been completed by an administrative intermediary.
