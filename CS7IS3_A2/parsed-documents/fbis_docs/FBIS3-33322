They have resulted in an abundance of reflections, suggestions, and very interesting critical assessments, all of which have been aired in a climate of free participation by the workers. Since the beginning of the year, the Cuban labor union movement began consulting with its rank-and-file on how the nation can increase work efficiency and resolve its internal finances. It is estimated that by the end of the process -- early March -- a total of 3 million workers will have contributed their points of view. One of the most prominent matters, and one that has been reiterated in thousands of parliaments in the workplace held up until now, is related to the harmful impact of excessive personnel in factories, workshops, and service centers. Excessive personnel works against efforts to reduce costs and to increase profitability. True, there is concern about the ultimate fate of workers who are declared redundant, because these workers may have become so involved with their jobs and with their coworkers that they may not want to change jobs. Nevertheless, beyond this understandable situation, the truth is that no Cuban fears being fired as a result of measures aimed at rationalizing the work force. The nation's authorities and the labor unions agree on the need to find alternative formulas to avoid the abandonment of one single Cuban. Along these lines, ideas have been discussed on organizing courses to retrain workers, as well as on assigning excessive personnel to farming or housing construction duties. Maybe, because they feel secure in terms of their future, the participants in the parliaments in the workplace have so far agreed that the country cannot continue having exaggerated personnel rosters in the majority of its centers of production. The attendees, amid heated labor union discussions, have suggested solutions, some of which could possibly be applied by company administrators. Meanwhile, the nation's authorities are not sitting back, and certain practices are being tested, as with the publishing house in the eastern municipality of Palma Soriana. After the production of books was halted because of a lack of paper, the publishing house assumed alternate tasks and retained its work force. Now it is making a profit. As long as there are resources available, the Cuban Government will encourage such emergency formulas in order that the unavoidable process of personnel rationing does not turn into unfavorable remedies for the workers.
