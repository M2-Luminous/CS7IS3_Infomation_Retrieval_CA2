Hetzel & Co Elektronik-Recycling GmbH and the equipment technology division of Siemens AG presented two pilot plants in Nuernberg which dismantle both black-and-white and color picture tubes into completely sorted glass. According to Hetzel CEO Juergen Wolf, ten million picture tubes per year are being discarded in Germany. According to the company the program-controlled facility uses a thermal process to separate the lead-containing conical glass and the strontium-containing front glass. Test agreements exist already with the glass industry to reuse the recycled products for picture tube molding. Black-and-white tubes which consist of uniform glass are cut open with diamond saws in the pilot facility which makes it easier to remove the luminescent coating in a washing installation. According to the company, there are also plans for recycling the washed out rare earth elements which currently still go to a waste dump. At present, the two mobile facilities recycle 240 color tubes and 150 black-and-white tubes per day . According to Wolf, this throughput can be increased quite easily. The unit price for recycling a tube is currently DM8, for a complete computer monitor it is DM35 to DM45.
