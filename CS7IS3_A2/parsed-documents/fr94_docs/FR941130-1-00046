FR941130-1-00046 FR941130-1-00011 As previously indicated, MSHA approval documentation would show that the product had fulfilled the requirements of the foreign target market area and those of MSHA. In the first instance, the product marketed in the United States would embody a higher level of safety, while in the second instance it would embody equivalent safety. In no case would the product be less safe than mandated by MSHA approval requirements. The following example illustrates how this concept would work. In testing and evaluating electrical circuits for intrinsic safety under 30 CFR 18.68, MSHA uses spark test apparatus meeting the requirements of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), IEC 79&hyph;3 (1990). With this apparatus, each rotation of a four-wire electrode holder produces at least six make-break sparks on a slotted cadmium disk in the presence of the explosive test gas mixture. The MSHA procedure requires that the test duration be 1000 rotations of the four-wire electrode holder and that the polarity of the test circuit be reversed after 500 rotations. This same apparatus is used to test intrinsically safe circuits in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the IEC test, IEC 79&hyph;11 (1991), for intrinsic safety. However, the IEC procedure specifies a test duration of 400 rotations of the four-wire electrode holder for DC circuits and 1000 rotations for AC circuits. With all other factors equal, MSHA could consider the spark test specified by IEC 79&hyph;11 (1991) to be equivalent to the spark-test procedure followed by MSHA in fulfillment of 30 CFR 18.68, by increasing the number of rotations of the four-wire electrode holder used in the IEC DC circuit test by 100 rotations and adding 500 rotations with reversed circuit polarity. For AC circuits, in addition to the 1000 rotations of the four-wire electrode holder required by IEC, 500 rotations with reversed polarity tests would be required to meet the MSHA requirements. The resulting test would exceed some aspects of both the MSHA and IEC procedures and would fulfill the requirements of both. In this manner a single test could verify conformity to the test requirements of both parties with no reduction of safety in either case. In like fashion, other MSHA and IEC requirements for the approval of intrinsically safe electrical circuits could be reconciled to obtain equivalency without adverse impact on safety. MSHA anticipates that savings from use of this option would reduce the manufacturer's unit cost by permitting more standardized construction and, thus, improve the manufacturer's competitive position. This, together with the need to provide products meeting the highest level of safety demanded by the market areas of interest, would encourage a more rapid introduction of mining products embodying new technology with enhanced safety features. Because of the potential for a more global market area, MSHA also expects an improved availability of specialized mining equipment adapted to more safely address unique mining conditions for which equipment could not be developed without significant market demand. In general, this proposal should provide increased opportunity for direct competition leading to improved safety and performance quality in mining products. As is the case with existing MSHA approval regulations, this proposed rule would be nondiscriminatory as between U.S. and foreign manufacturers. Any manufacturer, either domestic or foreign, wishing to acquire an MSHA product approval would be able to take advantage of this ``equivalency'' program. Further, the proposal would be consistent with the North American Free Trade Agreement and the newly negotiated Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) which will become effective when the Uruguay Round Agreements enter into force for the United States. Proposed ยง6.20(c) would require that, after a determination of ``equivalency'' is made, the industry be notified of the determination through publication of a notice in the Federal Register . The notice would clearly identify the alternative requirements evaluated and either indicate that they are ``equivalent'' or specify how they would need to be enhanced to provide equivalency to the corresponding MSHA product approval requirements. Following publication in the Federal Register of the alternative requirements determined by MSHA to be equivalent, MSHA, as well as NRTLs recognized by OSHA to perform the equivalent testing and evaluation requirements, would be able to conduct the equivalent testing and evaluation when so requested by an applicant seeking product approval. The MSHA Federal Register notice of equivalent requirements also would specify whether an NRTL recognized by OSHA to perform testing and evaluation to the original MSHA approval requirements would have to obtain an expansion of its OSHA recognition to perform testing and evaluation to the ``equivalent'' alternative requirements.
