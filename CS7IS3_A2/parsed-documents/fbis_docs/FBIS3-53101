[Al-Bishari] Some fraternal countries, like Egypt and Tunisia, are engaged in persistent efforts in this regard. We are pinning great hopes on the constant and important efforts being made by President Mubarak to address this issue. We hope that these efforts will bear fruit. Hence, our contacts with the United States have not been interrupted, thwarted, or suspended. All that there is to it is that the issue has become complicated after the tightening of the sanctions against us. The issue has become part of efforts by big powers to finalize some arrangements in the region, given the interests they have in it. This has been manifested in what is taking place in Palestine, the calls made for the launching of a Middle East market, as well as the situation in Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Gulf, and Iraq. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Now that the key witness in the Lockerbie affair has retracted his testimony, what is your position on this issue? How can you take advantage of this new development? [Al-Bishari] We are trying to make international and regional organizations informed about this new development as quickly as possible. We will benefit from this development. Likewise, we will keep the permanent members of the UN Security Council, particularly the PRC, informed of this new development, given its weight at the UN General Assembly, as well as its convictions regarding Libya's innocence. This new development may also influence public opinion, as well as the policies of nonpermanent members of the UN Security Council, which were pressured to vote against us. [Reporter] Why did Libya receive the Serbian foreign minister at a time when barbaric massacres against the Bosnian people are being escalated? Doesn't this undermine your credibility with the Muslim world? [Al-Bishari] Libya is making honest efforts to end the calamity of the Bosnian people. We believe that it is necessary to hold direct talks with the major party to the crisis, namely the Serbs, if we are to influence them and induce them to end the massacres against Muslims. This is a serious effort on our part. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Libya was reported to have had a hand in the disappearance of onetime Libyan Foreign Minister Mansur al-Kikhya, and that the Libyan Government had a vested interest in his disappearance. Does what happened prejudice your relations with the Egyptians? [Al-Bishari] We are as surprised as the next man by his disappearance. We do not regard him as an enemy. If anything, there has not been any break in his relations with Libyan Government officials. We have been and still are bound together by an open and friendly relationship. Our lines of communications were open. His family remains in Libya and is being treated with all respect and appreciation. The man posed no threat whatsoever in order for us to move against him and thus jeopardize our Egyptian relations and interests in Egypt. Al-Kikhya is a man of stature. He once served as minister in view of the revolution's confidence in him. He left office having reached the age of retirement. I recall one day the brother colonel [al-Qadhdhafi] asked that we contact him in Paris and ask him to go to Algeria as a member of a Libyan delegation when Ahmed Ben-Bella returned to his country. [passage omitted] [Reporter] How do you react to reports that Libyan-Egyptian relations are strained and that Dr. Usamah al-Baz's mission in Libya last month was a failure? [Al-Bishari] There's no truth in these reports. Nor will we allow such a thing to happen. Ours is a strategic relationship that we will not allow anyone to sabotage. In none of the assignments entrusted to Dr. al-Baz by President Mubarak to seek a way out of the Lockerbie affair has he failed. Besides, as far as al-Kikhya's disappearance is concerned, Libya is not in the dock for al-Baz to go to Tripoli to talk about the affair. Again, the man is not an enemy of ours. We wish him a safe and speedy return to his children and wife. We hope the mystery of his disappearance will be solved. We -- Egyptians and Libyans alike -- are distressed by his disappearance.
