The boss of labor circles, Rengo Chairman Akira Yamagishi, finally voiced his real motive. What he is aiming at is the straight line of a new liberal party. Its leaders will be Hosokawa, Takemura, Eda, and Yokomichi. What about Ozawa and Ichikawa? [SANDE MAINICHI] What will become of the political reform bills? [Yamagishi] I think they will be passed in the upper house. But I think it will be a slim margin of about 10 votes. [SANDE MAINICHI] Do you mean that the rebel group in the SDPJ will not oppose it that much? [Yamagishi] Rengo, too, is making independent approaches, as a support group, to see that they are approved. Even so, I suspect that some crimes of conscience will appear. Persuasion will have no effect whatsoever on people who withdraw this time. In other words, it is a case of it being an ill bird that fouls its own nest. We cannot have this,but I think it can be kept to about five people. [SANDE MAINICHI] Is there no chance of the bills not passing, the Diet being dissolved, and a general election being held? [Yamagishi] No, that won't happen. Politics is a living entity, so one cannot tell until the very end, but the mission of a support group is to persuade people. [SANDE MAINICHI] What was your impression when you saw the SDPJ conference on the 11th and 12th? [Yamagishi] As might be expected, I had a gut feeling that the split between the faction which supports the coalition government and the independence faction is quite wide. As a guest, I said a few words, but there was a great deal of heckling and outcries. The heckling from those on the left was so outrageous that in the middle of my address I shouted back "shut up and listen!" It was my first experience with this kind of thing. I was gripped by a hallucination that I had mistakenly blundered into a conference of the Communist Party. What made me mad was the heckling by Diet members. What is going on when local executives of the largest party that props up a government are heckling at the top of their lungs? One cannot keep the public trust by this kind of behavior. This is a manifestation of the split between the two factions. [SANDE MAINICHI] The two factions can no longer endure working together. [Yamagishi] That is right, both of them say that, having come this far, they have to split up. They have already reached their limit. But if the SDPJ splits now, the coalition government will collapse, and the political reform bills will also be rejected. That is the weak point. I suppose that is why the group supporting the coalition government is having the most difficult time. [SANDE MAINICHI] If the political reform bills pass, next will be the issue of a source of revenue for compiling a budget. When that comes, the consumption-tax issue will become the occasion for a split. [Yamagishi] That will not happen. The broad tax reduction of over 5 trillion yen should be financed by two or three years of short-term deficit-covering bonds. Both the right and left factions of the SDPJ agree on this. If they announced increasing the consumption tax as a package deal with reducing taxes, the Hosokawa cabinet would collapse. Hosokawa ought to understand that better than anyone else. [SANDE MAINICHI] In that case, when do you think there will be a second realignment of the political landscape which includes the breakup of the SDPJ? [Yamagishi] For that we probably have to consider the next general election. I think that, if the reform bills pass, the next general election will probably be after the autumn of next year. It will take six months to draw up the bill for dividing the districts. That bill will also be very difficult because of party interests, so I suppose a special session of the Diet will be called at the very end of the year. Moreover, as is common knowledge, the period is three months. In addition to which, April 1995 are the local elections, right? June is the upper house election. Therefore, the general election will be after autumn. There is enough time before a second realignment of the political landscape. [SANDE MAINICHI] You are advocating the concept of a "new liberal party," what would it be in concrete terms? [Yamagishi] After this, the political landscape will converge into a system of two large political parties. But even in such a case, we should not adopt the thesis of two conservative parties. I think it should be a system of two large parties, conservative versus nonconservative. But the process of going there must pass along a tripolar path. The three poles will be conservative A, conservative B, and nonconservative. I think that conservative A will be Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] type conservatives, conservative B will be a group which aims at a non-LDP, new conservatism, and that the nonconservative will be a body in which social democratic, moderate, and liberal groups join forces. Therefore, I think that such as SDPJ, Japan Democratic Socialist Party, United Social Democratic Party, Sakigake [Harbinger]. The Japan New Party, the reform faction of the LDP, and the political forces located on their borders should join together in a nonconservative, liberal new party. The SDPJ must discover a path to survival in the midst of that and settle itself in a manner which leads to expansion. That is true for all of them, including the Japan New Party and Sakigake. It Would Be Rude To Place Ozawa in a Different Dimension [SANDE MAINICHI] Are you saying that you would draw a clear distinction between it and the Shinseito-Komeito bloc? [Yamagishi] That part has been greatly misunderstood. What kind of people do you imagine in the group of leaders of the nonconservative, liberal forces? I was asked this by Soichiro Tawara on television and said people like Yokomichi (governor of Hokkaido), Hosokawa, Takemura, Eda, and Hiramatsu (governor of Oita). He asked me if it did not include Ozawa and Ichikawa, so I replied, no; I think they belong to the B conservatives, so they "are not included." That statement appears to have been taken as if I had said it excludes Ozawa and Ichikawa. The nonconservative, liberal group has no room for cooperation with conservative A. But it should conclude an agreement on policy with conservative B and fight at their side. In fact, that is the framework of the current coalition government. The starting point of my idea is to maintain this framework in the future as well. [SANDE MAINICHI] In that case, do you mean to say that your posture has not changed since around the time of the general election last summer? [Yamagishi] That is correct, I have not changed my posture. I said that (joining hands with Ozawa and Ichikawa) was collaboration between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. At one time the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Nationalist Party joined hands and rose in a war against Japan in order to oppose military aggression by the Japanese military. I took that historical fact as a model. In addition, I said that I did not have Ozawa in mind as a leader of the new liberal party because Ozawa said that he is a new conservative. It would be rude to put him in the midst of people such as social democrats and liberals who live in a world of a totally different dimension. I certainly have no antipathy or hostility toward Ozawa. [SANDE MAINICHI] I understand that you met Yokomichi at the end of last year; is he going to return to the central political scene? [Yamagishi] I do not think he will serve a fourth term as governor. He is not inclined to run. In the history of Hokkaido, there is no governor who has served for four terms. Therefore, I think that Yokomichi understands the situation clearly. Surely he is not at an age to retire either, so naturally he is thinking of returning to the central political scene. We exchanged views, and I took him to be very enthusiastic about it. But it is a matter of the timing of his return. Yokomichi wants to serve out his third term as governor and then return to the central political scene. The situation is developing in that way, so there will probably be no contradictionbecause his term will end in April 1995 and the general election will be the autumn 1995 at the earliest. [SANDE MAINICHI] Are you saying that Yokomichi has no desire to return to the SDPJ in its current state? [Yamagishi] Yes. Therefore, it is what I call the new liberal party concept. He says clearly that he can no longer operate within the framework of the SDPJ. Yokomichi will fulfill the role of creating one pole of the tripolar structure. The SDPJ will sublimate within that. [SANDE MAINICHI] What will become of the so-called protect-the-constitution group? [Yamagishi] How would I know something like that? I suppose it will cause a chemical reaction and break up. [SANDE MAINICHI] If the party breaks up, what will become of the party headquarters building? [Yamagata] The reform group of the SDPJ will not make a fuss about the Miyakezaka Headquarters. The land belongs to the country. They will take care of such things by a fund-raising campaign. [SANDE MAINICHI] Will you not also be forced to reconsider Rengo's endorsements when the election system changes? [Yamagishi] The small election districts will have a single seat, so the LDP will narrow down to a single person. The coalition government side will also have to adjust to a single candidate. If it fails in this, it will lose miserably to the LDP. Deciding to back a conservative B in this district and a liberal in that district, Rengo will support them in order for them to be elected. It will only benefit the LDP if we say things like they were formerly in the SDPJ, so we do not back them, or they were in the Shinseito, so we will not work hard to support them.
