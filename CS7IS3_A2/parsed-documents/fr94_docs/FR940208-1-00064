(a) The provisions of this subpart apply to each bulk gasoline terminal, except those facilities: (1) For which the result, E T , of the following equation is less than 1: E T =0.63(T F )+0.19(T E )+0.092(T ES )+0.03(T I )+0.0012(V)+0.024(P)+KQ where: E T =major source applicability factor for bulk gasoline terminals, E T "1 means bulk gasoline terminal is a major source, T F =total number of fixed-roof gasoline storage tanks, T E =total number of external floating roof gasoline storage tanks with only primary seals, T ES =total number of external floating roof storage tanks with primary and secondary seals, T I =total number of fixed-roof gasoline storage tanks with an internal floating roof, V=number of valves in gasoline service, P=number of pumps in gasoline service, Q=gasoline throughput rate (liters/day), K=3.18x10 ^6 for bulk gasoline terminals with uncontrolled loading racks (no vapor collection and processing systems), OR K=(4.5 x 10 ^9 ) (EF+70) for bulk gasoline terminals with controlled loading racks (loading racks that have vapor collection and processing systems installed on the emission stream), and EF=the federally enforceable emission standard for the vapor processor (mg of total organic compounds per liter of gasoline loaded). or (2) For which the owner or operator has documented to the Administrator's satisfaction that the facility is not a major source as defined in section 112(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act. (b) The provisions of this subpart apply to each pipeline breakout station, except those facilities: (1) For which the result, E P , of the following equation is less than 1: E P =2.4(T F )+0.09(T E )+0.043(T ES )+0.027(T I )+0.0009(V)+0.009(P) where: E P =major source applicability factor for pipeline breakout stations, E P "1 means pipeline breakout station is a major source, and the definitions for T F , T E , T ES , T I , V, and P are the same as provided in paragraph (a) of this section; or (2) For which the owner or operator has documented to the Administrator's satisfaction that the facility is not a major source as defined in section 112(a)(1) of the Act. (c) The provisions of paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (b)(1), and (b)(2) of this section, do not apply to bulk gasoline terminals or pipeline breakout stations located within a contiguous area and under common control of a petroleum refinery if the petroleum refinery is a major source under section 112(a)(1) of the Act.
