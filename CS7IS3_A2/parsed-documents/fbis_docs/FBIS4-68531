FBIS4-68531 "jpusr050___94007" FBIS-USR-94-050 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 19 April 1994 RUSSIA POLITICAL AFFAIRS Deputy on Kuzbass, Miners Deputy on Kuzbass, Miners 944F0624C Moscow SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA in Russian 19 Apr 94 pp 1,2 944F0624C Moscow SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA Russian CSO [Interview with Aman Tuleyev, Federation Council deputy, conducted by correspondent Nadezhda Garifullina: "At the Limit of Patience"] [Text] The deputies of the Federal Assembly supreme chamber greeted the appearance of their colleague, Aman Tuleyev, in the Federation Council meeting hall with a bouquet of flowers, a hearty welcome by the speaker, and enthusiastic applause. And there was good reason for congratulations: At the elections to the local organ of power in the Kuzbass, Tuleyev's block had won a "crushing victory" over the candidates of pro-presidential "democratic" orientation. Out of 30 elected deputies, 23 are in Tuleyev's command. During the break, I sought out Aman Gumirovich and relayed to him the congratulations of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA readers and journalists, and asked: [Correspondent] What did the voters talk about at the meetings? What does the oblast population expect from the Legislative Assembly? [Tuleyev] The meetings were very difficult. People have been driven to the brink of desperation. It is that way everywhere, and I met with all strata of the population, including the miners, of course. I will never forget the discussion which lasted for many hours at the "Fizkulturnik" mine, where the representative of the miners' trade union was also present. The attitude in the collective is already on the brink of breakdown. And what can it be like if the miners are demanding that what they earned in November be paid out to them at least in March or April?! I remember, some speakers said openly: "If they do not meet our demands, we will take our pick axes and begin breaking down the shop stalls, the commercial buildings, the mayoralities." I say: God forbid, of course, that this "merciless riot" should occur. Its echo would carry disaster throughout all of Great Russia, and then it would be the end of all. Can it be that they do not understand this here, in Moscow? I visited the "Yuzhnaya" mine. My heart bled. The miners had begun to pass out from hunger. They are going to the coal mines hungry!... When has such a thing ever happened? Even during the war they cared for the people and found ways to support and help them. But here they are demanding their lifeblood, what they have earned! Cases of passing out from hunger have been recorded also in the city of Berezovskiy. The "Pervomayskaya" mine has been on strike in this city for a month now. Because the miners, and all the population in general, find themselves in most difficult, inhuman conditions. [Correspondent] The fact that the Tuleyev block won the majority of the mandates in the local organ of self-government, it seems to me, is a rather indicative fact. As it turns out, most of the voters of the mining kray have gone over to the opposition against the ruling regime, and an active process of rejecting the policy of anti-popular reforms has begun? [Tuleyev] Yes, the miners themselves are posing the question of trust in the president. And at the meetings they have often announced: "We have trust in no one!" Recently, at the request of the Association of Enterprises and Organizations of the city of Kemerovo and, naturally, the voters, I sent a deputy's request to the president, the chairman of the government, and the speakers of both chambers of the Federal Assembly. This, if you will, was the soulful cry of thousands and thousands of people. We studied the systematic reporting on the economy and the social sphere. We analyzed the meetings with labor collectives, with the people at their place of residence, and with managers of all forms of ownership which were held in the course of the pre-electoral campaign to the Legislative Assembly. And we came to the irrefutable conclusion: Processes of disintegration of industry, agriculture, construction and the social sphere are being consistently implemented in the Kuzbass. [Correspondent] The conclusion is a difficult and bitter one, but are you not exaggerating a bit? [Tuleyev] Judge by the figures: The decline in volumes of industrial production in the last three years has comprised over 40 percent, and in construction--around 60 percent. The base coal industry of the Kuzbass has fallen to the level of the 50's, the chemical industry--of the 60's, and the light and food industry--to the level of the 70's, to the times when these sectors were just emerging in our oblast. Hidden unemployment is reaching 40 percent, while at some enterprises up to half of the workers have been laid off. Highly skilled workers are becoming "shuttle runners," "stall-keepers" and second-hand dealers, as a result of which the threat of stoppage of complex types of production has arisen due to a shortage of workers. Labor productivity has fallen to one-third of what it used to be in industry, and on the whole the economy of the Kuzbass has been thrown back to the level of the 60's. And this is in peacetime, half a century after the most destructive war in history... This has led to ruin, desperation and hopelessness... Mutual nonpayments have taken on the form of a mass epidemic disaster. I will say without exaggeration that they have cast the economy and the social sphere of the Kuzbass into a state of collapse. The total amount of mutual nonpayments between enterprises and organizations in Kemerovo Oblast--taking into consideration the enterprises of other regions and the CIS republics--reached over a trillion rubles by the end of March. [Correspondent] But they say that supposedly all these nonpayments are almost provocation on the part of the "red directors?" [Tuleyev] Rubbish! Everything has been destroyed--the country, the communist party, the soviets which supposedly hindered the implementation of "democratic transformations." Now a new image of the enemy is needed. And so they found one: The "red directors." In fact, however, the mass nonpayments are caused by the actions of the government, which has refused to finance, partially or fully, the enterprises of the TEK [not further expanded] and the budget organizations, and to pay for the agricultural production which has been taken from the peasantry. Why, this is a modern form of corvee [feudalism]! The nonpayments lead to a string of most acute conflicts in the economy and in the oblast. In general, if we speak with complete frankness, we must say that the Yeltsin-Gaydar reforms have set us back not by 20-30 years, but to the epoch of the feudal natural economy. From commodity-monetary relations, the economy of the Kuzbass has begun to change over to exchange in kind. Barter is flourishing. Wages here are paid in whatever you like--from irons, shoes, fabrics and tobacco goods and even meat to medical preparations and spare parts for automobiles. I could go on forever citing examples of the destructive processes, examples which confirm that the course being implemented by the "reformers" is unpromising. I will say only that the government of Russia and the local authorities are ever more acting in the role of firemen; and in recent months they are not even able to handle this role, as confirmed by the results of the first quarter. A sad record has been set for rate of decline in production--25 percent! Well, it seems that now we should sound the alarm and urgently alter the course which is ruinous to Russia. Nothing of the sort! The government of Russia is not even thinking of correcting it. On the contrary, with maniacal consistency it rejects any management and regulation of the economic and social processes. [Correspondent] Yes, it is certainly not in the best of situations that the Legislative Assembly of the Kuzbass is making its debut. Nevertheless, how did you begin? [Tuleyev] At the first organizational meeting immediately after the elections, we elected a chairman first of all. I will not hide the fact that I am beholden to the deputies for their trust. They voted unanimously for my candidacy, and by secret ballot. Then we adopted the first document--the statement of the Legislative Assembly, in which we announced ourselves as the legal successors of the oblast Soviet of People's Deputies and thanked our predecessors for their honest fulfillment of their deputy obligations. We will have to act under difficult conditions. We have a great responsibility to the people, while our rights under the constitution are laughable. Nevertheless, we must do everything possible for the people, even under these circumstances and with a poverty budget. I told the deputies: If we do not do anything specifically in this most difficult situation, these will be the last elections in the Kuzbass. The people will not go to vote any more. Therefore, the deputy corps bears a huge responsibility. Currently, we are preparing our first resolutions. What have they done here? The departments have staged competitions--who will raise prices the most. Communications suppliers are raising the telephone rates, municipal managers are hiking up the rent. I might add that those who live in the center for some reason pay less than those who live on the outskirts. Moreover, expenditures for transport have risen sharply. Also, payment for land takes up the lion's share of the family budget: 15,000 for one sotok! Who can afford to plant a garden? Potatoes will be like gold. And so it turns out that in every family, 70-80 percent of the income goes just for food. Of course, such a policy lays the groundwork for social upheaval. Therefore, we will solve these problems in first priority, and will think about how to protect the population. The tragedy of the Kuzbass lies in the fact that it has been plied to death with drink. Last year, 1,9000 people were poisoned by vodka which had been brought in. Is the domestic variety not enough? They are even bringing it in from across the border. 1,900 families have been left without breadwinners for this reason alone. And the first request which I made to the procurator general: We must bring to responsibility those who are getting the people drunk. As it is, the Kuzbass is dying off. The mortality rate exceeds the birth rate by 20,000 people! You know, during my life I have passed through all imaginable and unimaginable choices, but the last ones were the most difficult: The people have already been beaten to the end. They no longer believe anything or anyone. I wrote about all this in that letter which I mentioned at the beginning, the letter to the president, the prime minister and the leaders of the Federal Assembly chambers. At the end I added a note: I am sending this in order to clear my conscience. The people have asked, and I have fulfilled their request, although I know that these appeals will do no good. Therefore, I asked: Give the rights to the regions, do not hang on to power. As it is, you are doing nothing yourselves and not allowing us to do anything. [Correspondent] This time at the meetings of the Federation Council you spoke twice on a most acute problem: The crime rate, corruption, the mafia, the role of the procurator's office, and the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. As I recall, you even said, addressing the deputies: "We all engage in self-deception and lead a double game." These are harsh evaluations. What is it that disturbs you in particular, if we speak of crime? [Tuleyev] We are holding parliamentary hearings. Well, we will speak, we will listen, we will shout a bit, we will adopt laws. But what will change from all this? I have often appealed to the minister of internal affairs and the procurator general, citing blatant cases of corruption in the oblast. It is like talking to thin air. The air did not even move! Any head of administration knows that in every oblast they are aware of all the corrupt dealers, swindlers and bandits. They could take them all in one night, and the next day there would be order in Russia. Yet those who are supposed to do this--do nothing. And so we lie and lie, lie and lie. Why is the struggle not being waged? Why, because the roots of corruption have penetrated into the government itself, into the highest echelons. There has been a very strong merging together of the state apparatus, the administrations of all levels, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the KGB [secret police] or the MB [Ministry of Security], the procurator's office, and so forth. And so we, the deputies, are sounding the alarm: There is corruption and bribery, there are mafioso clans in Russia! Yet the president believes otherwise: Everything is normal in the country, we are waging a struggle against corruption, and he awards Russia's highest honor to the minister of internal affairs. Well, where is this done? I would understand if Yerin had become a Hero of Russia for a heroic struggle against the mafia. But he distinguished himself by shooting defenseless people in the House of Soviets! Yeltsin, Shumeyko and Gaydar say that now we are creating a class of property owners in Russia. We are creating it. Moreover, by high-speed methods and on a criminal basis. I stated openly at the Federation Council: Yerin is forced to keep quiet, because if he springs up, he will be removed. We are men of law, but our laws do not work, our edicts do not work. If a person wants to act in accordance with the law, he is killed. I will not recall the renowned Moscow terrorist actions of recent days, but all this is "flourishing" also in the provinces. Murder for hire is becoming the norm of our abnormal existence. The commercial director of the Kuznetsk Metallurgical Combine, carrying out the will of the government, shipped orders where they were supposed to be shipped--to the government. Well, and what happened? They shot him along with his wife, riddled him with bullet holes like a dog. The laws are not being carried out. Everything is dictated by the mafia. If you do not fulfill the order of the mafia, that is the end of you. And every manager, every head of administration, lives in fear. For me this is a most basic question: The entire tragedy lies in the fact that the laws do not work, and the first violator is the President of Russia himself. If only he were to set the example of a respectful attitude toward the law and the constitution by saying: "Here is the law. It may not be perfect, but it must be fulfilled!" After all, why do you think I spoke out in support of Kazannik? To speak honestly, I must say that my attitude toward him has always been negative, but in the amnesty situation Kazannik acted courageously. He was the first person to stand up in defense of the law. The first person who said a firm "no" to telephone law. Enough of violating the law! That is why I supported him. And to the acting procurator general, Aleksey Nikolayevich Ilyushenko, I said directly: You should not try to become procurator general. The people will not believe you anyway. Moreover, we must remove Minister Yerin for the lawlessness in the country, and announce early presidential elections. If we do not do this, nothing will change. We can adopt a hundred wonderful laws, but the first ones to violate them will be the president, the MVD, the procurator, and so forth... As long as these people are in power, we, unfortunately, will not be able to accomplish anything. I am glad that all the deputies in our oblast Legislative Assembly are professionally trained people, some of whom are former chairmen of soviets, and that all have a fervent desire to work. Now we will begin to strike at corruption. We have made a number of inquiries, and based on the results we will publish a list of corrupt bureaucrats and will demand their resignation, especially in the upper echelons of Russian power. As for Moscow, I would like to emphasize once again: One way or the other, early presidential elections cannot be avoided. The sooner we re-elect the president and the government, the better it will be both for them, and for Russia, and for the cause. [Correspondent] You said that the Kuzbass has reached its final limits. But do you realize what has to be done in order to stop the slippage into the abyss? [Tuleyev] I would propose a minimum program of urgent measures in the economy and in the social sphere: To begin the management of the economy by methods which have been tested in world practice and in our country in past decades; to use indicative economic planning (instead of the directive form used in Soviet times), which is widely used in many countries of the world and in major corporations; to return validity to various forms of the state order, with precise adherence to responsibilities on the part of the state; to return to the compilation of national economic balances and economic balances by regions, with the application of market levers of their realization; to change over to the regulation of prices and incomes, and to immediately review the tax benefits granted to producers of goods and services... These are but a few points. Altogether there are 14 of them, first priority and immediate tasks. I will not list all of them. I have insisted and will continue to insist on the immediate indexation of wages, pensions, stipends and subsidies, based on the rates of inflation. We must stop the continued impoverishment of the population. Having toured the entire oblast in recent weeks, I was simply appalled by the crying poverty of the people. In the Kuzbass today, one-third of the population is poverty-stricken. One in every four families either never sees meat, or can afford it only once a month. And all this is on the background of the furious rates of accumulation of wealth by 5-7 percent of the population of Kemerovo Oblast. I will never reconcile myself to this. At every meeting with the voters--in the mining and other collectives--I spoke about my social program, and everywhere they understood and supported me. This is dear to me. It is my faith in the people and their support that gives me the strength to live and to fight.
