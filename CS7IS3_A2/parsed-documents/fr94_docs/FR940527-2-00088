(Telephone numbers, other than ``800'' TDD numbers, are not toll-free.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Purpose and Substantive Description The HOPE 1 program is authorized by title III of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437aaa), which was added by section 411 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, approved November 28, 1990) (NAHA). The law was subsequently amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (1992 Act). On August 2, 1993 (58 FR 41126), the Department published a NOFA announcing the availability of $182,047,160 in funding for implementation grants for the HOPE for Public and Indian Housing Homeownership Program (HOPE 1). On September 1, 1993 (58 FR 46209), the Department published an amendment to the NOFA increasing the funding being made available by $24,000,000 from $182,047,160 to $206,047,160 due to the conclusion of the processing of a reprogramming request. The funds were appropriated by the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriation Acts for fiscal year 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;139, approved October 28, 1991) and fiscal year 1993 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;389, approved October 6, 1992). In its Fiscal Year 1994 appropriations bill for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Congress rescinded $45,000,000 from the amounts remaining available for the HOPE 1 program under the Department's fiscal year 1992 appropriation (Pub. L. 102&hyph;139) and $130,000,000 from the amounts remaining available under the Department's fiscal year 1993 appropriation (Pub. L. 102&hyph;389) for a total rescission of $175,000,000 in the amount of funds made available under the previously published NOFA and amendment. After the rescission, $31,047,160 remained to fund applications pursuant to the NOFA. On April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17560), the Department published a Notice of award based on procedural error announcing the award of $24,882,854 to the New Community Corporation in Newark, New Jersey based on a procedural error. The Department allocated $9,692,854 of the $31,047,160 available under the NOFA to partially fund the New Community Corporation application. The remainder of the New Community Corporation application was funded using amounts appropriated in 1994. After the award announcement, $21,354,306 remained available to fund applications pursuant to the NOFA. This Notice announces that the amount of funds remaining available for implementation grants for the HOPE 1 under the NOFA was increased from $21,354,306 by $1,087,628 using HOPE 1 funds previously awarded for planning and implementation grants in FY 1992 that either were not obligated or were deobligated. After taking all of the adjustments into account, the total amount available for funding the grants announced by this Notice was $22,441,934. This Notice also announces that HUD extended the deadline for submission of responses to deficiency letters in the HOPE 1 program for those applicants located within the jurisdiction of HUD's former Region Three (since renamed the Mid-Atlantic Region) who were adversely affected in their preparation of responses to deficiency letters as a result of the extraordinarily severe winter weather and consequent office closings during the period January 14&hyph;28, 1994. For qualified applicants, the deadline for submitting responses to deficiency letters was extended from January 28 to February 4, 1994. In order to qualify for an extension of the deadline for submitting a response to a deficiency letter for Implementation Grants under the HOPE 1 program, the following requirements had to have been met: (A) The applicant must have submitted a certification with its response to its deficiency letter describing the reasons which justify a delayed submission pursuant to this Notice; and (B) HUD must have determined that the certification adequately demonstrated that the applicant's ability to prepare or submit the required response to a deficiency letter was substantially impaired as a result of the extraordinarily severe winter weather and consequent office closings during the period January 14&hyph;28, 1994. Once HUD approved the certification, the application would be accepted for review. Only one applicant requested an extension of the deadline for responding to deficiency letters and complied with the requirements: The Housing Authority of the County of Chester in Pennsylvania. HUD accepted the Housing Authority of the County of Chester's deficiency response and continued to process its application in accordance with the established procedures for the HOPE 1 program. In accordance with section 102(a)(4)(C) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989, this announcement also notifies the public of funding award decisions made by the Department for the HOPE 1 program. The announcement contains the names and addresses of the award winners and the amount of the awards. This information is provided in appendix A to this document. Dated: May 20, 1994. Joseph Shuldiner, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.
