The attack by Prof. David Pearce, proposer of the Government's ``green'' taxes on fuel, will cause embarrassment on the eve of the Prime Minister's launch tomorrow of environmental strategy for the next 20 years. Prof. Pearce will publish research this week showing that the £15 billion raised from road taxes each year is dwarfed by £25 billion in ``social costs'' of road use -- noise, pollution, wear and tear on roads, congestion and accidents to pedestrians. If the motorist was to pay the real cost of using a car, he said, road taxes would need to be nearly £10 billion more, nearly double what they are now. Prof. Pearce, adviser to former Environment Secretaries Patten and Heseltine, says his research demolishes the argument of lobby groups such as the AA and RAC that motorists get ``a rough deal'' because he pays £15 billion a year in tax and only £6 billion is spent on road building. ``We have done something that the Department of Transport should have done. If they did their sums properly we wouldn't have such a rosy picture of the benefits we get from the roads programme,'' said Prof. Pearce, head of environmental economics at University College London. ``If you were to start to charge for using the road, you would need to charge the motorist for the pedestrians killed each year and the fact that he causes congestion to someone else.'' ``Similarly, no one currently charges the motorist for the social cost of the nitrogen oxides and the carbon dioxide that his car emits.'' Prof. Pearce, who sits on two Government advisory committees, says the Government's proposals for motorway charging, aimed at raising money to spend on roads, do not go far enough to stop escalating traffic growth. He said: ``I'm highly sensitive to the argument that giving a higher priority to protecting the environment would cost industry money. But the Government has done no work on how much it would cost, or how it could be paid. It has simply dropped the idea.'' ``I believe that this change can be engineered to be good for the individual, good for the country, good for economic growth and good for the environment.'' He said his attack on Government policies arose from ``sheer frustration.'' He had ``finally run out of patience'' after five year of working with Government. ``We've all been extremely fair to them, addressing our criticisms internally. I remember saying when I got a copy of that White Paper, `Is this it?' It was all the repackaging of old policies.'' ``There was nothing new and no imagination. I expect the Sustainable Development Strategy, which Mr. Major publishes this week, will be exactly the same thing.'' Prof. Pearce reflects the frustration of a mounting number of the Government's closest advisers who feel that Mr. Major's Government has promised to use market incentives instead of regulation to address environmental problems, but has held back from introducing measures such as motorway charges and landfill taxes to back its convictions. He is critical of leading civil servants, whom he accuses of having ``a vested interest in not upsetting the applecart.'' ``Somewhere along the line we've run out of imagination. And nothing has been helped by Downing Street,'' he added, in a veiled reference to Mr. Major. Prof. Pearce's new book Blueprint 3: Measuring Sustainable Development -- a follow up to Blueprint for a Green Economy commissioned by the Department of the Environment -- contains the first account of how in the 1980s Britain was living on capital rather than new income. He looked at the five percent savings made nationally in the 1980s and subtracted the depreciation of assets such as North Sea oil and gas reserves, the increase in pollution and the loss of recreational opportunities through new development. He found Britain was using up capital faster than it was generating income from economic growth. ``What tips us into the red is the failure to take account of the environment,'' he said.
