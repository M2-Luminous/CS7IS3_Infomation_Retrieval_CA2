Sweden should also be ready to allow its defense forces to serve the EU's common foreign and security policy." So said French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure, who visits Sweden on Friday [11 February] for talks with the Swedish Government. DAGENS NYHETER met him in Brussels during a break in the meeting of EU foreign ministers. In the interview Alain Lamassoure returned time and time again with an almost religious passion to the EU's need for a common foreign and security policy. But he also left the door ajar on the possibility of special regional support for northern Sweden, spoke about the problems the fall in the value of the krona has caused French industry, and denied that France is the villain of the membership negotiations and a constant opponent of Sweden. Anyone who has followed the negotiations might otherwise have easily formed the impression that France is the country which is at the head of the resistance to Sweden's negotiating demands. It was France which long blocked the question of snuff; France took a tough line against Sweden's demands relating to car exhaust emissions; France is doubtful especially about agricultural support for farmers in northern Sweden. But Alain Lamassoure gave assurances that France "is happy" about Sweden's membership application and is adopting "a well-disposed attitude" to Swedish demands. However, in the past France did have its fears about Sweden as an EU member, he said: "From the beginning we had major worries about the EU's common foreign and security policy." However, France's concern that neutral Sweden would slow down the EU's march toward the common foreign and security policy which France considers to be extraordinarily important has been allayed. Alain Lamassoure said: "Yes, after we listened to the Swedish leaders, especially your prime minister who visited Paris a few months ago, and after Sweden adopted the declaration in which all the applicant nations commit themselves to adjusting their legislation so that it falls in line with the needs of the common foreign and security policy." When Sweden's membership negotiations started, European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel stressed in his speech that the Riksdag has stated that Sweden's military nonalignment continues to exist. Alain Lamassoure did not give a direct answer when asked whether nonalignment is possible for Sweden as an EU member: "Neutrality and nonalignment no longer have any meaning. The world is no longer divided into two blocs," he said. "Today all EU member nations must be involved in shaping a common foreign and security policy and should be ready to put their military capacity at the service of this policy." [Hedstrom] Must Sweden join the WEU? "Yes, in the longer term," Alain Lamassoure replied. "At present it is not compulsory. According to the Maastricht Treaty, member nations can either be members of the WEU or observers. Observer status can be permitted, but it is only provisional. We hope that Sweden can become a full member of the WEU, which is in a way the European Union's military defense arm." The meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels is negotiating regional policy with Sweden for the first time. The EU foreign minister has given the thumbs-down to so-called Objective 1 support -- the EU's special support for poor regions -- to Norrbotten while Sweden is standing firm on its demand for special regional support for Norrland. "We consider that Sweden has a geographical handicap because of the latitudes in which the country lies. Sweden has a right to have a regional policy which compensates for this handicap. What has not been resolved is how this is to be combined with the EU's regional policy," Lamassoure said. "Our approach is that we want to find a solution which corresponds to Sweden's needs without again opening up the discussion within the EU. We have devoted months to discussing which regions would receive Objective 1 support. If we let Norrbotten receive Objective 1 support there would be a great risk that we would receive new demands from regions within the EU. "If it is possible to find a different solution, we would prefer that. But I am not worried, because I consider that when it comes to these problems it ought to be possible to find a solution." [Hedstrom] Is a special solution, which does not directly correspond to the EU's current rules -- an "Arctic" fund, for example -- possible? "We are in the process of looking at this together," Alain Lamassoure replied. When the Volvo-Renault deal collapsed, the French president hinted that this could have an effect on the EU negotiations with Sweden. But Lamassoure denied that the breakdown of the marriage between the two car companies had caused bad blood. Something that has bothered France more is the increase in French imports of Swedish wood and paper products since the collapse of the Swedish krona made it possible to reduce prices. But unlike the Finnish authorities, the Swedish authorities have been "cooperative" on this question and agreed to a mechanism for checking on developments, and for this reason there is no risk that the negotiations will be affected.
