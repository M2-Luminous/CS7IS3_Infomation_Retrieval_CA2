Their talks lasted about one hour, and they are due to resume tomorrow. For now, no agreement has been reached, no cease-fire signed. On the ground, things seem to be calming down, as Colonel Luc Marchal, commander of the Belgian UN peacekeeping forces, explained to Thierry Perret: [Begin recording] [Marchal] We have seen a certain stabilization, which means that the fighting has died down somewhat, one could say that it has all but stopped, though there have been a few flare-ups. A series of political negotiations are going on, which should allow them to clarify their positions. It is clear that with what has happened in the last 10 days, I do not know, we cannot expect things to stabilize overnight, but, well, I am quite skeptical at the moment as to the chances of a solution or a definitive status quo [sentence as heard]. [Perret] Do you have the feeling in Kigali today that the RPF can take the town? [Marchal] The RPF has massed to the north of the town. It has brought in regular units which progressed quite normally. I think that it had hoped that these battalions could infiltrate and win a victory from within, but it seems that these units that have been infiltrated have got as far as they are likely to get, and that in order to take the city, the RPF will now have to use all its available means.
