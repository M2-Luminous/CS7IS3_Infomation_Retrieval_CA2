On the other hand, the visit serves to signal to the voter at home that the candidate can move on an international level: In the realm of symbolic politics, the handshake with the respective master in the White House corresponds to knighting in the Department for Foreign Countries [as published]. Since Tuesday [12 April], the new warrior has been Knight Rudolf of Palatinate. He was "noticed" with more than the usual interest in Washington; it is also known there that Scharping has a realistic chance of replacing Kohl. Altogether, Scharping made a good showing. His reserve, his self-confidence, and his occasionally demure friendliness left the image of a serious, responsible politician. Although the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] chairman did not tire of stressing the basic continuity of German foreign policy in the event of his assumption of power, differences appeared when one had a closer look. This was most clearly shown in the debate on the form and extent of Germany's possible participation in UN military actions. Scharping -- he said this repeatedly -- left Washington with the conviction that in the White House and on Capitol Hill this question is regarded as far less urgent than it is presented in the government coalition and the media in Germany. He does not believe that Washington wants to or will exercise political pressure on the Germans in this respect. From the point of view of the campaigner, this argumentation is understandable. The SPD is attacked by the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] because of its alleged attitude of refusal. Moreover, parts of the party are still feuding with Scharping because they do not want to put up with his blue-helmet line. Therefore, it is in Scharping's interest to invalidate at least the accusation that the United States is putting pressure on the Germans. All that reminds one a little bit of the fact that nobody discusses the fire brigade as long as there is no fire. At present, there is no immediate occasion for the Americans to accuse the Germans of dodging. However, neither Bonn's checkbook diplomacy during the Gulf war nor beating about the bush over the AWACS mission in the Balkans or the public relations action in Beledwynne have been forgotten. Even though nobody told it to Scharping in this form, German fears of an increased UN commitment are like a shadow on the lung that provides the transatlantic relations with breath. Not in vain did the Senate adopt two resolutions that say explicitly that Germany should create the political and constitutional prerequisites for "full" participation in UN military actions. The pressure that Scharping did not (yet) feel this week is developing there, for example.
