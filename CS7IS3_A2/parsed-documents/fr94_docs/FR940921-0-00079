(a)(1) Exhaust emissions from new 1994 and later model year diesel heavy-duty engines shall not exceed the following (optional for 1994 through 1996 model year new natural gas- and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled heavy-duty engines): (i)(A) Hydrocarbons (for diesel engines fueled with either petroleum-fuel or liquefied petroleum gas). 1.3 grams per brake horsepower-hour (0.48 gram per megajoule), as measured under transient operating conditions. * * * * * (C) Nonmethane hydrocarbons (for natural gas-fueled diesel engines). 1.2 grams per brake horsepower-hour (0.45 gram per megajoule), as measured under transient operating conditions. (ii) *␣*␣* (B) 0.50 percent of exhaust gas flow at curb idle (methanol-, natural gas- and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel only). * * * * * (c) No crankcase emissions shall be discharged into the ambient atmosphere from any new 1994 or later model year methanol-fueled diesel, or any naturally-aspirated diesel heavy-duty engine (optional for 1994 through 1996 model year natural gas- and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled engines). For petroleum-, natural gas- and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled engines only; this provision does not apply to engines using turbochargers, pumps, blowers, or superchargers for air induction. * * * * * 23. Section 86.094&hyph;17 of subpart A is amended by revising paragraph (a) introductory text to read as follows: §86.094&hyph;17 Emission control diagnostic system for 1994 and later light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. (a) All light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks shall be equipped with an emission control diagnostic system capable of identifying, for each vehicle's useful life, the following types of deterioration or malfunction which could cause emission increases greater than or exceeding the following threshold levels as measured and calculated in accordance with test procedures set forth in subpart B of this part. Paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section do not apply to diesel cycle light-duty vehicles or light-duty trucks. Paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section do not apply to natural gas-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks until the 1998 model year. * * * * *
