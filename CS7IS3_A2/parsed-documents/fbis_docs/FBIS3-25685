Following this exceptional meeting, the Gabonese Confederation of Free Trade Unions [CGSL] has decided to suspend its general strike. CGSL Secretary General Francis Mayombo talks to Jean de Dieu Odong Ovono. [Begin Mayombo recording] After the explanations given by various parties, the head of state ordered negotiations to commence swiftly. Thus negotiations will begin this afternoon at the Ministry of Planning with a view to reviewing prices. Next week, precisely on 1 March, we shall examine, together with the same committee, the parity of wage increases. We are, therefore, suspending our strike in order to negotiate with the government and to analyze the eventual increases whose percentages we do not know yet. We shall first have to negotiate with the government and show evidence of skyrocketing prices. This will enable us to trigger off a system of negotiations on the basis of the loss of purchasing power and the housewife's expenditure. It is only then -- at the 1 March meeting -- that we shall be clear about the parity of the increases that will be made. [end recording]
