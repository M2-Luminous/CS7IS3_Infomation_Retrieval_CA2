The Chinese Government launched the project in 1989 in 17 provinces or autonomous regions, including Sichuan, Shanxi, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Hebei, Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou and Yunnan. It is designed to help poor mountainous counties to apply a new farming technique: Growing hybrid maize with heat-retaining plastic sheets covering the ground. The new farming technique was introduced from Japan in 1978 by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture. It helps to increase the temperature of the earth, keeps fertilizer in place and prevents soil erosion and water losses. The system has been dubbed "the white revolution" or "silver revolution," and it is highly suitable for cold mountain zones. It has now been applied to more than 3.79 million hectares in 483 counties, benefiting 33 million farmer households with a total of 135 million people. The technique has raised the per hectare output of corn by 2,511 kilograms, which represents a 56.4 kg increase in per capita grain output in the project areas. "This white revolution has brought about a profound change in the cultivation mode in the mountain areas," an official of the Chinese Agriculture Ministry said. In the past, only maize was grown in the fields, and now vegetables and wheat flourish there too. The "food-and-clothing " project has not only helped villagers to solve their food problem, but also assisted them in learning and using advanced agricultural techniques, he said. To help the project along, the Chinese Government sends agricultural scientists and technicians to the project areas to work with the local farmers. The necessary materials and equipments are also supplied. By the end of last year, the project areas had also developed 333,333 hectares of farmland for other cash crops, such as tea, fruit trees and walnut trees, and vegetable-growing. The per capita annual income in the areas has reached 498 yuan, 120 yuan more than in 1988. People living below the poverty line in those areas have been cut to three million, from the previous seven million. In the five years, more than 288,000 technical training courses have been held in the project areas. Some 36.01 million people have attended the courses. The project has cost some 1.1 billion yuan (about 130 million U.S. dollars).
