Paek Hak-yon, permanent vice-chairman of the Pyongyang Municipal People's Committee, and other speakers branded the planned deployment of Patriot missiles as a blatant challenge to the nation's desire for peace and denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and an unpardonable act to exterminate the nation through a nuclear war by deliberately increasing the tension. They declared they would not pardon the brigands who reversed the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and steps of simultaneous action agreed upon at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York and are threatening the DPRK with "sanctions." The Korean people are not frightened by any missile and the Team Spirit nuclear war game, they said, warning that the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique must refrain from reckless war moves and other rash acts. The speakers declared that the Korean people and the People's Army closely united around General Kim Chong-il, their supreme commander, will smash the aggressors at one blow if they dare provoke socialist Korea.
