The arrival of peacekeeping forces in west Georgian rayons was shown on television yesterday. Be that as it may, Zhirinovskiy has appeared in Abkhazia. [sentence as heard] Gudauta is visited frequently by the military and diplomats, who can rarely be seen in Tbilisi. Does it all mean that the settlement of the Abkhaz problem is a result of relations between Russian and Abkhaz leaders? Has the Georgian leadership found itself left out? [Shevardnadze] Thank you and good morning. The peace process in Abkhazia has started, as planned, with a preparatory stage, the clearing of mines, concentration of peacekeeping forces, the setting up of checkpoints, road repairs, and so on. It can be said that the start has been normal so far. The population of Samegrelo and Zugdidi, as well as the people who remained in Gali, have welcomed the peacekeeping forces. However, it must be said that the main difficulties will start when large numbers of refugees enter Abkhazia, which is the task for the next few days. In this connection, good organization is necessary on this Georgian side of the Inguri river. What I mean is that groups of refugees should be formed and the schedule for their return to Abkhazia be determined. There is a lot of organizational work to be done. A permanent government commission, information center, construction and repair authorities will operate in Zugdidi. Many of them are already there. The prime minister, defense minister, their deputies, and almost all of the Council of Ministers of Abkhazia will work there. Mr. Jaba Ioseliani [chief Georgian negotiator with Abkhazia] is planning to go there tomorrow or on Wednesday. He has contacts with the military, which is very important. In a word, things are moving forward. As regards the arrival of various political leaders, this is less worrying. [Oniani, interrupting] For example, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Georgiy Kondratyev's visit cannot be less worrying, can it? [Shevardnadze] Do you mean General Kondratyev? [Oniani] Yes. [Shevardnadze] Let us first speak about political leaders. This is less worrying. It is probably inevitable that leaders holding various ranks and views will arrive there. However, friends of both ours and the Abkhaz will come as well, which is more important. Their active involvement and assistance, including Russian parliament deputies' involvement and assistance, should certainly be taken positively. As Vladimir Shumeyko [chairman of the Federation Council] and others have told me, there are such plans. As for Gen. Kondratyev, I must say that we are having businesslike contacts with him. Ioseliani and Sandro Kavsadze [Georgian negotiator with Abkhazia] have met him more than once. There is no need for him to visit Tbilisi now. If it becomes necessary, such a visit will be possible. Talking about visits, I would like to recall the visit to Tbilisi earlier this month by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and a series of extremely productive talks that were held. As far as this and other issues are concerned, I think that we will soon witness an increase in Russian diplomatic activity. In general, it must be said that both Russia and Georgia have without any doubt assumed historic responsibility. We should hope, we should be certain that all sides will rise to the occasion, to this historic occasion and honor their responsibility, not only to our peoples but also to the world. As regards Tskhinvali, as you know, the Tskhinvali process began in Dagomys and has produced some positive results. Now it is time to get actively involved in the settlement of this conflict. The experience of Abkhazia and that of other peace processes will naturally be taken into consideration. I believe that the settlement of the Georgian-Ossetian conflict is not a matter to be solved in the remote future but is something to be dealt with soon. The start has not been bad. It has shown that both the Georgians and Ossetians are thirsty for peace. We are moving in this direction, and we are moving with resolve. [Oniani] A section of the parliamentary opposition has become, so to say, especially active recently and is getting anxious over the issues of authority. Why do you think a parliamentary crisis has exacerbated at this stage? Why has it speeded up so intensely at this stage? [Shevardnadze] The stepping up of activities by any opposition can be explained if viewed against the background of various trends. As for the aggression by a part of the opposition, which is not a considerable part of the opposition anyway -- I can explain it by the fact that tendencies for stability in the country have been established and they [the opposition] are worried about it. [Oniani] Batono [polite form of address in Georgian] Eduard, a meeting of foreign ministers of the member states of the Economic Cooperation of the Black Sea Basin Countries will start in Tbilisi in a few days. A year or two ago we could not have imagined holding an international meeting in Tbilisi. The reason why I am saying this is that there are signs that the criminal situation in the country is being stabilized. Last week, the Interior Ministry, together with the town's police department, carried out an operation -- this time in Tbilisi -- and the activity of the Interior Ministry is noticeable against the background of inactivity and endless promises by some establishments. [Shevardnadze] The meeting of foreign ministers of the Black Sea Countries' Alliance -- this is what I call it, is undoubtedly of paramount importance. I think that the activities [of the Black Sea basin countries] all the way through from the last meeting in Istanbul to Tbilisi will be summed up. Time has been long enough. There is a lot to be discussed and all the more to be done. I am sure that representatives of key member-states will arrive and work actively at the conference and participate in partnership. In itself, holding such a conference in Tbilisi can be possible only under the circumstances of stability, a certain stability. The fact that we are holding this conference will speed up the reinforcement of order and will step up the fight against reinforcing order. In this connection, words of gratitude must be spoken for the police, of course, in connection with the operation that has recently been carried out in Tbilisi. As we have touched upon the issue of the police, we are going to discuss this issue on 8 July when we will sum up the work done for the last six months and we will discuss all structures. Interesting suggestions will probably be voiced to the effect of reinforcing these good tendencies and setting new goals; but large-scale operations must be carried out in rayons, towns, and residential districts so that every family feels secure and safe and feels that they are protected by the state. I think that we are gradually getting there. [Oniani] Because of the current economic crisis in Georgia, our population looks with hope at every visit abroad and at every meeting with representatives of financial circles. After your visit to the United States, no one was surprised by the recent visit to the United States by National Bank President Nodar Javakhishvili and Deputy Prime Minister Teimuraz Basilia. You had a meeting with them yesterday. Is there anything in prospect that will alleviate our population's difficult conditions? [Shevardnadze] Our cooperation with the World Bank and the IMF entered an active phase during my visit to Washington. There had been visits and meetings before but they had mainly been concerned with formalizing our membership of these organizations. We had productive talks with leaders of these two extremely important international economic and financial organizations. Both the World Bank and the IMF were represented at the talks by all their leaders. As a result of these talks, several delegations have visited Georgia and prepared recommendations for further progress in our relations and for arriving at specific decisions [as heard]. In my opinion, the recent visit by Basilia and Javakhishvili was undoubtedly productive. They are unanimous in Washington in stressing the importance of a stable political and criminal situation, which has recently taken shape in Georgia. If we continue our efforts to ensure stability, then we can hope to receive significant assistance roughly in the fall, or a little earlier. This assistance will serve as a certain factor and guarantee for financial stability in the country. [Oniani] An important event happened last week. Russia joined the Partnership for Peace initiative. Fortunately, no one is surprised today by the fact that the country that constituted the core of the Warsaw Pact and was an irreconcilable ideological enemy of the United States, the entire capitalist world, and especially NATO, has joined this initiative. After events of recent years this no longer seems absurd. What is your assessment of this decision by Russia, especially taking into account the preparatory period that preceded this decision. [Shevardnadze] I had an opportunity during our previous interviews to welcome statements in this regard by the Russian President Mr. Yeltsin and Defense Minister Grachev's assessment of his visit to Brussels. Now something that was meant to happen has happened, and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has signed a document making Russia part of this initiative. I again welcome Russia's joining this initiative. I believe that it was another step toward a new life and order in the post-communist world. [Oniani] Thank you very much. You have been listening to Eduard Shevardnadze, the chairman of the Georgian Parliament and head of state.
