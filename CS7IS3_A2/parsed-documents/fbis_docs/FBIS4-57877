He said the state currently does not have a plethora of resources as it did in the past when resources were squandered and used to encourage physical and moral corruption. He said: "We do not have a great deal of money in our budget; instead, we have found a tremendous deficit that is getting worse for a thousand reasons." Speaking at the Saturday inauguration of a newly built section of the Trapichito neighborhood in Valencia, President Caldera noted that although resources are scarce, there still exists a great deal of hope, desire, and a strong work ethic in the nation. He added that, through the joint efforts of various state offices that deal with public housing and slums, the nation will face these social problems, which it still considers a priority. "I feel a special calling to resolve the housing and slum problems, and the government I head is committed to this and intends to struggle and open the way to clean up slums throughout the country and boost housing at every level in accordance with the economic needs of the dwellers," Caldera concluded.
