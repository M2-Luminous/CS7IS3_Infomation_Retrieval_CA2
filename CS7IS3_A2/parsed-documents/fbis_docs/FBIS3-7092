The 1993/94 budget indicated a huge deficit of 1.8 trillion rupiah. The huge budget deficit will raise questions from numerous sectors, such as, will such a deficit reoccur during the 1994/95 fiscal year? In a statement during a plenary session of the House of Representatives (DPR) on Monday, 7 March, Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad stated that more funds will be allocated and changes will be made to the 1993/94 budget to keep to a balanced budget of 62.65 trillion rupiah. It is clear that such changes are needed so income estimates will be at 62.65 trillion rupiah while estimates for expenditures will stand at 64.64 trillion rupiah. According to the finance minister, the government will utilize a balance of payments and proposed reserves for development totalling to 1.8 trillion rupiah from previous fiscal years in the effort to realize several development programs during the 1993/94 fiscal year and as a measure to cover the deficit. Our economic planners need to be more watchful if we take into account the amount derived from 1993/94 domestic income, which stands at only 52.279 trillion rupiah or 0.9 percent lower than estimated. This indicates that lower income derived from the petroleum sector has not been balanced yet by increased nongas exports. Income from the petroleum sector was expected to bring in only about 12.507 trillion rupiah or a decline of 17.3 percent from the estimated target. The average price of Indonesian oil will only stand at U.S.$16.50 per barrel or U.S.$1.50 per barrel lower than the projected U.S.$18 per barrel for the 1994/95 fiscal budget. Therefore, the major cause for the 1993/94 fiscal year deficit is due to the lower income derived from the petroleum sector. Unquestionably, the lower income derived from the petroleum sector was solely due to declining oil prices in the international market. Global oil prices continue to slide since last year and in February 1994, the price of oil remained static at U.S.$14 per barrel. This worrisome condition of our national income from the petroleum sector should be expeditiously anticipated. Lately, the price of petroleum in the international market further intensifies our concern because current oil prices have descended to slightly more than U.S.$13 per barrel. The price of Brent Blend [preceding term in English] -- a global demand -- stood merely at U.S.$13.05 per barrel on Monday, 7 March. The perpetual decline in oil prices will certainly influence our national income for the 1994/95 fiscal year because we projected oil prices to stand at U.S.$16 per barrel. National income will be lowered by a net 600 billion rupiah if the price of oil were to decline by a mere U.S. dollar per barrel. In the effort to avoid another budget deficit as a result of the perpetual decline in oil prices, the government has made a provision of 3.5 trillion rupiah to be taken out from the proposed development reserves. Several sectors will surely ask if it was indisputable that another budget deficit can be avoided through the utilization of proposed deveopment reserves. The country's economic planners have frequently stated that the proposed reserves for development will not be used as long as it can be avoided. This means that the proposed reserves for development can only be used when there is a problem with national income, which in turn, causes a national economic crisis. The utilization of proposed development reserves indicates an "instability' in the national economic situation. As such, an alternative source has to be found. Several other alternatives exist and the one with the most potential is to effortlessly intensify nongas export activities. As a result of the increasing stiff and endless competition to gain access to the international market, we must first totally eliminate all high-cost economic activities in the country in our effort further increase and intensify our nongas exports. Indonesian products will never be competitive if such a measure is not taken.
