The press center describes as not in accord with reality the report that representatives of the Russian Government had visited Odessa. In connection with this, the press center of the Russian Navy states authoritatively that the Russian delegation received a refusal from all levels of the Foreign Ministry and the Defence Ministry of Ukraine. Meanwhile, an extraordinary meeting of the CIS defense ministers has taken place in Moscow. Taking part were the military ministers of the states which signed the treaty on collective security. Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy was present as an observer. Quite naturally, journalists asked Radetskyy about the rumors that an act of force is being prepared against the brigade of Russian river vessels stationed in Izmail. Here is what he replied: [Radetskyy] "No such action is being prepared. This report is not objective. An end should be put to all of this. We are only giving grounds for the extremists and nationalists to enflame these passions and this does nothing to improve mutual relations between the two neighbors." The Ukrainian defense minister also commented on his own decree on the resubordination of Division 318. [Radetskyy] "No such division should exist on the territory of Ukraine, particularly in Odessa, if the leaders of this division give the command to use weapons without warning." After this extraordinary meeting an unofficial meeting took place between Vitaliy Radetskyy and Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev which, alas, did not produce any particular results. Here is what Pavel Grachev said: [Grachev] "It was precisely the Ukrainian authorities which provoked this action. Its opinion is rather different. It says in its defense that the decision was made to use weapons. But no one used any. Therefore, of course, we did not reach mutual agreement. I pointed out to them that their action was unilateral and was thus outside the framework of the Yalta Agreement."
