The organization had launched a goal to establish a global satellite-based cellular telephone service project called "INMARSAT P" by the year 2000 and had been conducting a review as to whether it should handle the project as a parent-company function or under the control of a subsidiary. Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD) which is Japan's only member of the organization intends to invest in the new company. The decision to establish the new company was made at INMARSAT's recent board meeting held in London. Further, an informal decision has been made to operate the satellite at a "medium orbit" of 13,155 kilometers altitude. The new company will first be established with capital completely paid for by businesses that are currently members and investors in INMARSAT, and its monopolistic characteristic will be lessened by subsequent capital contributions of 30 percent by businesses that are not members of INMARSAT. INMARSAT P will provide telephone, facsimile, and data communications services using palm-sized cellular instruments. Its goal is to begin services in 1999 or 2000 after an investment of about $2.4 billion. Several private-sector projects such as Motorola's "Iridium Project" are under way to provide global cellular communication services. It appears that INMARSAT decided to establish a separate company for fear that operation of the proposed system by INMARSAT itself might lead to criticism of "unfair competition."
