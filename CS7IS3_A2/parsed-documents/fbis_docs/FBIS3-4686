European nations, which have supported Japan's position of rejecting the U.S. demand of introducing objective criteria at the Japan-U.S. framework talks, did not conceal their irritation at Japan's unshrinking current account surplus at the meeting. Japan has to speedily work out a specific program to reform its economic structure to avoid being isolated by the rest of the G-7 industrialized nations and stand in step with the policy coordination of the G-7 industrialized nations. A Finance Ministry official lamented at the meeting room, "We have come here with a package of stimulus measures totalling more than 15 trillion yen, but ...." He said tax cuts amounting to more than one percent of the gross national product, though they will last for only one year, can be expected to stimulate the Japanese economy. But requests from the rest of the G-7 industrialized nations to Japan were difficult to address. European nations have highly praised Japan for checking the United States from moving toward protectionism by rejecting the U.S. demand for introducing internationally criticized objective criteria at the Japan-U.S. framework talks. Their praise has led Japan to hope that it would be able to win support from European nations at the meeting, but Japan's hopes were found to be overly optimistic. In a bid to reduce Japan's current account surplus, the United States has so far attempted to strengthen the yen against the dollar, but its efforts have left an impression of Japanese strength. The United States is about to take a new approach: that the Japanese market is different from those of the rest of the G-7 industrialized nations because Japan has not increased imports. The Japanese Government plans to map out a package of measures during March to open the Japanese market. The package can be considered the first step in a specific program to reform Japan's economic structure. Japan will be asked to make efforts not only to open its market, but to revamp the conventional bureaucrat-led system of policy formulation. At the latest Japan-U.S. framework talks, the United States expressed strong apprehension about the Finance Ministry's plan to cut income taxes for only one year. Prime Minister Hosokawa is said not to have mentioned a plan to cut taxes for many years at the latest Japan-U.S. summit talks. At the G-7 meeting, Finance Minister Fujii said that "Japan would continue to cut taxes in the future." Taking into account the contradictions in Japan's responses, other nations appear to have felt a sense of incongruity regarding Prime Minister Hosokawa's leadership. The meeting of G-7 finance ministers and central bankers failed to reach a clear agreement on exchange rate stability in the face of opposition from the United States. The U.S. Government had no choice but to oppose such an agreement, for which Japan has hoped to placate hard-line members of Congress who do not want the U.S. Government to make any concessions for Japan. Following the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework talks, the present situation in the United States is such that it is difficult for the U.S. Government to take any measures considered by Americans to be soft on Japan. The U.S. Government is neither giving up on exchange rate stability nor trying to seek a strong yen. A steep rise in the value of the yen and a correspondingly sharp fall in the value of the U.S. dollar may lead to even higher interest rates on long-term loans. High interest rates on long-term loans are keeping stock prices low in the United States. Any fluctuation in the currency exchange rate may shake financial markets, and this would be a undesirable situation for the U.S. Government. European nations, which have had bitter experiences regarding a currency crisis, have no reason not to hope for the stability of the exchange rate. The G-7 finance ministers and central bankers appear to have decided not to discuss the exchange rate issue at their meeting out of consideration for the U.S. domestic situation.
