[Chavez Mena] We propose establishing conditions for creating an integrated economy with strong sustained growth, through a model of social market economy, characterized by combining three areas: free initiative or free competition, social development, and citizen participation. We want to create a social market economy that combines these three factors. Three areas are important to us. We include investing in the people in the first area. We propose four priority programs in this area: education, health, potable water, and the ecology. The second area attempts to broaden the business base. It strengthens current entrepreneurs and encourages new ones so as to broaden the base. To this end, there are four priority sector policies. First, encourage cattle raising and agricultural production levels; second, medium-, small-, and mini-sized entrepreneurs should be supported with fair policies; third, there would be a policy for professionals; fourth, the state should encourage better academic preparation through the supervision of university training. The third idea is to incorporate women into the production sector. There is a special emphasis on low-income women and peasant women. Women are the head of the household in 63 percent of Salvadoran homes, only 33 percent of homes are maintained by a couple, and 1 percent are homes where just the man works. Our policy is to incorporate women into production activities, creating entrepreneurial agents and even banks for women. This strengthens the small and the medium-size entrepreneur and creates women agents. [Reporter] The government says it has a social market economy. What is the actual difference from your social market economy? What measures would the PDC implement? [Chavez Mena] To our way of thinking, the difference is that the government has seemingly encouraged a structural adjustment program to reach greater economic stability levels, which was important and has yielded good macroeconomic results. I do not question the macroeconomic figures. The structurural adjustment program was applied to resolve a problem at the time; however, it is not true that the government set down the bases for a social market economy model, it was more like an adjustment program that may or may not be done within a social market economy program. [Reporter] What is the problem then? [Chavez Mena] Rather than a production economy, a more speculative and financial economy was encouraged. To our way of thinking, we should maintain all macroeconomic policies that have created certain levels of economic stability. It is not a question of destroying what works. What is needed is to implement extensive sector policies. Exporters of agricultural and other products have complained of an absence of sector policies; there really were no policies intended to encourage agricultural and cattle raising sector activities. The topic of updating industries, which we feel is part of the Central American integration, was not included either. The presidents made a lot of headway in political accords and have laid down important principles for the integration process, but this should be coordinated with macroeconomic policies. For example, basic grains: There cannot be complete freedom of trade between Central American countries if all macroeconomic politics are not coordinated. The EEC's toughest problem was to solve the agricultural sectors' problems. It is true the government achieved certain levels of stabilization; what we need today is to encourage the country's production. We propose creating new entrepreneurs through credits with FIGAPE [expansion unknown] or Fedecredito [expansion unknown]. We plan on opening new banks and allowing these facilities to compete. It is important to allow foreign banks to open but within a regulated framework. If we are going to open trade, we need a very aggressive policy so our industrialists can begin to improve. Another difference is the need to increase remittances [remesas]. Here we have an extraodinary amount that covers the $1.4 billion trade deficit. These remittances must be used appropriately. How? By offering homes, for example. Production activities must be encouraged, which for one reason or another this administration did not do. [Reporter] Where will the funds come from? [Chavez Mena] To implement this program we have drafted a budget to cover 1994-99. To this avail we have taken into account several resources. First of all, we have taken into account fiscal income, which does not require additional taxes. I believe that a lot of headway has been made because the tax system has been streamlined. Secondly, we have taken into account family remittances over the next five years. A third source of revenue is international cooperation. The country is going to need loans, donations, and honestly speaking hefty international cooperation. [Reporter] Taking into account the delays in project approvals, especially at the ECC and international organization level, are there projects that have already been approved? [Chavez Mena] There are some. From the [Jose Napoleon] Duarte administration there were between $1.2 to 1.3 billion left in projects, such as overpasses, repairs to the North Junction Road, and the continuation of the road toward eastern El Salvador. The projects will take approximately 20 months from the time the requests are presented and the contracts are signed to when the plans are drafted and construction is undertaken. We are taking this into account plus the existing volume. Thus, a very aggressive foreign policy is needed to gain access to the difference in funds required. [Reporter] As part of this aggressive foreign policy, do you have at this moment any general idea, for example, on reducing the number of embassies and consulates, or obtaining the necessary funds to send more qualified personnel abroad? Has anyone thought of sending businessmen or economists to get more aid? [Chavez Mena] Foreign policy must have a strong economic content. During the years I was foreign minister, there was greater emphasis on the political side as opposed to the economic side. This was due to the war situation. We intend to take advantage of all our consular and embassy infrastructure to promote our exports and to use that infrastructure more as a commercial agent for exporters. [Reporter] If you have an economic plan based on a market economy already designed to be put into effect in case you are elected, what was last week's "emergency" [emergente] proposal? [Chavez Mena] We consider that there are several problems that are urgent, which demand extraordinary measures. We believe a plan to control crime is needed. With such a high level of insecurity, the problem of encouraging economic activity and investment, especially foreign investment, becomes even greater. Likewise, we need to freeze basic food basket prices. Supply is too low and the market is distorted. When the imbalance is so great the idea is to halt somewhat the demand during six months to stimulate all participants in the production chain, especially in the cattle raising and agriculture sector and in the small and medium sized businesses. What we propose, immediately after we take office, is to call on producers and union leaders to establish a social pact, much like in Mexico, which also worked in Bolivia, and not freeze basic food basket prices by decree.
