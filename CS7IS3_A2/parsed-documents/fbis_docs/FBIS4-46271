He noted that investigations have provided definite proof that the lawyer was involved in conveying instructions, receiving funds, and distributing them to the rest of the group members. Al-Alfi, who was speaking to members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Cairo today, said that Madani had been implicated in several previous cases and committed an act of terrorism in 1991. He noted that many documents and papers were seized with him and that he was detained after obtaining a permit from the Public Prosecution Office. Al-Alfi said that all the procedures used regarding lawyer Madani were legal and that not even the emergency law was used against him or against any other. He said: We were concerned to detain this man and to keep him alive but his health condition led to his death and thus we lost much information that we were supposed to obtain from him.
