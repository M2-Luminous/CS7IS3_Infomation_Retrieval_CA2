FBIS4-27776 "dreas108__a94007" FBIS-EAS-94-108-A Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan `Source': Tokyo To Offer Economic Aid to DPRK `Source': Tokyo To Offer Economic Aid to DPRK OW0406104094 Tokyo TOKYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 2 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0406104094 Tokyo TOKYO SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] On 1 June, the government conveyed its intention to the DPRK that Japan is ready to give economic aid to it through international organizations even before normalizing its diplomatic ties with the DPRK should the DPRK diplomatically settle the nuclear issue by returning to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and accepting the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) nuclear inspections. This has been disclosed by a government source. After explaining its intention to the United States, the Japanese Government informed the DPRK of the plan through the U.S.-DPRK working-level meeting. Japan explained only its fundamental policy and did not touch on details of the economic aid. However, it is assumed that Japan can provide support in such areas as development of light-water reactors, development of the Tumen River, and increasing urgently needed food production. Moreover, the government named the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the IAEA, and other organizations as possible agencies through which the economic aid will be given. However, the government is also taking into consideration the possibility of having relevant nations and organizations, including the United States, the ROK, and the World Bank, form support groups. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said that "North Korea is a country which went through unbearable sufferings and griefs during Japan's colonization." From this viewpoint, the government, in an effort to normalize its diplomatic ties with the DPRK, plans to give full- scale economic aid to it, in the same way as Japan did to the ROK when both countries normalized their diplomatic ties, by signing an accord on the right of claim [seikyuken] and economic cooperation. It seems that the government, by implementing aforesaid government policy at an early date, firmed up a plan to partially provide economic aid to the DPRK prior to normalizing diplomatic ties because of its intention to urge, by using the economic aid as a pump-priming measure, the DPRK to settle the nuclear issue through diplomatic channels and to open up its doors to other countries. However, it is "difficult to give bilateral support" to North Korea before normalizing ties with the DPRK, according to a government source. Therefore, the government came up with the concept of providing aid by having international organizations and relevant countries and agencies form support groups. Moreover, regarding normalization of diplomatic ties between Japan and the DPRK, the government is also studying the possibility of establishing diplomatic ties after recognizing the DPRK as a nation and reaching an agreement to hold negotiations to normalize relations.
