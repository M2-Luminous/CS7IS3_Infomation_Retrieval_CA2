Deputy Savin (as he was known in lay life) was always polite and courteous, voted but, it seems, never once gave a speech. His calling allowed him to talk only from the pulpit, but everybody was aware that the church had a presence in the parliament. There are no clergymen among the deputies now. But the church was much more active in the March elections than four years ago. And if there are no vestments in the new parliament it does not mean that the devotees of the cult--so to say--have given up politics and limited themselves solely to communicating with God. On the contrary, the social profile of the church activists is on the increase. One does not have to go far to see the vehemence with which the Catholic Church is attempting to `theocratize' Poland. We see the confluence of church and state in Ukraine and attempts at indirect influence. Having recovered from repressive state control, Church activists quickly captured the trust of a people devastated by atheism. The confusion of the post-perestroika years has been replaced by awareness of their political interests and might, and the utility of front men. Article 5 of the Public Laws of Ukraine on "Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organizations" states quite clearly that churches cannot "advance candidates for elections to governing bodies, nor promote or finance election campaigns." But such paper barriers obviously are not enough to control the ambitions and interests of church leaders vis-a-vis lay matters. As Post-Postup predicted a last spring, all Ukrainian churches were active in the elections. Since more elections are scheduled this year, we can prophesize that this activity was just the beginning. The Ukrainian Autocephalic Orthodox Church (UAOC) publicized its elections credo in spring of 1993. The UAOC called its adherents to vote for believing christians to repel atheists who lack "any moral credentials." But the heavens seemed to favor the latter in elections. Father Chudinov, who stood for elections in the Snihuriv Electoral District in Mykolayiv Oblast, had his church set on fire by some goons, while the chancellor of the UAOC, Fr. Yuriy Boyko, survived the firs bout of elections in Shpolyanshchyna area (Cherkasy Oblast), but then lost big to Oleksander Tkachenko, a former minister of agriculture and a leader of the socialist movement. Nor did Vitaliy Zhuravskyy win; he heads the Christian Democratic Party (CDP) which is simpatico with the UAOC. He may have counted on some other support since he ran in the Marynskyy district in Zhytomyr Oblast where UAOC is weak. Still, the UAOC can count on two deputies from the CDP and Serhiy Holovatyy. Holovatyy is one of the leading proponents of a reviews of the legality of the Common Orthodox Sobor, held in June 1992, that deprived UAOC of its official status. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church--Kiev Patriarchate (UOC-KP), a more clever competitor of the UAOC, issued a sharp appeal to the faithful before the elections. They hit hard at the fifth columnists, betrayers of the Black Sea fleet, and external enemies. In two words, the essence of the appeal was to vote for "true patriots." This patriotism has several interesting features, including the recent elevation of Metropolitan Volodymyr (Romanyuk)--a former religious dissident--to a patriarch. Then there are the close ties between the UOC-KP and the government as well as with personages connected with the former Congress of National Democratic Forces. In short, the clergy seem to be more catholic than the pope--after all, before and during the first few months of Ukrainian independence many of the highest UOC-KP hierarchs were on the other side of the barricades. If one is to believe the Moscow news agency IMA-Press, sixty percent of the candidates running for parliament in Kiev declared their devotion to Patriarch Volodymyr before March 27. My observations showed a steady stream of politicians to the hierarchy's reception rooms during spring, as well as to other ecclesiastical luminaries in their districts. This was, however, a two-way street. In Ukraine the mountain and Mohammed take turns visiting each other. The leaders of UOC-KP visited the Rivne region where two powerful figures in Ukrainian Orthodoxy, Vasyl Chervoniy and Mykola Porovskyy, both members of the Supreme Church Council, were successful candidates. But a third lay member of the council, Oles Shevchenko, was less successful despite a patriarchal visit and Oleksander Moroz, leader of the Ukrainian Socialist Party, emerged victorious. Nor did patriarchal efforts help Svitlana Li in the Kharkiv District in Kiev. Still, having Porovskyy and Chervoniy in parliament assures the UOC-KP that its interests will be protected. The Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church (UGCC) is also taken care of in the parliament. In Galicia, especially in the rural districts, a word from their priests made a decisive difference in an election. The only question was the delicate manner in which the hint was given to avoid breaking the law. But the names that were mentioned with sympathy in the rectories of Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil wound up as deputies--Volodymyr Pylypchuk, Vyacheslav Chornovil, Yevhen Pronyuk and others. The UGCC hierarchy strongly favored the rightists and rightist centrists. But they also favored liberals--although seeing in them a threat to their puritanical philosophy--and extreme radicals. At St. George's Hill they noted that nazism-fascism is no better than communism and both should be kept from emerging. In fact, the legendary Metropolitan Sheptytskyy had already expressed those sentiments in 1942. The UGCC had outlined its views in a pre-election message: "Epistle of the UGCC Hierarchy on the Occasion of the March 27, 1994 Parliamentary Elections." The bishops advised saying `No' to the political system of the past and irrational centralization, and `Yes' to Ukrainian independence and democracy, private property and the new constitution. The future deputies were reminded of Christ's maxim: you were elected to serve and even give your life for others, not to be served. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church--Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP) was most consistent in not popularizing its political tastes, perhaps because the candidates themselves avoided affiliation with a collaborationist church. Perhaps it was due dissent within the church. Still, adherents of the UOC-MP count in the thousands and thousands and their parishes dominate in 22 Ukrainian oblasts (except for the three Galician oblasts.) My view is that Metropolitan Volodymyr (Sabodan) is not indifferent to the outcome of the elections. Nevertheless, the confessional synod of the UOC-MP allowed two of its hierarchs to run (unsuccessfully) in the elections--Avhustyn (Markovych), Bishop of Lviv and Drohobych, and Sofroniy (Dmytruk), Bishop of Cherkasy and Kiev. Interestingly, the MP had forbidden its bishops and other clergymen from running for the Russian Duma since such duties would interfere with the divine duties of pastoral care. Father Hlib Yakunin ran for the Duma and was defrocked. Even as a dissident in Brezhnev's time he was treated more gently and simply forbidden to hold services. What are we to make of this? Either there is a conflict between Kiev and Moscow or Patriarch Alexei's court feels that two disparate approaches to politics are called for in Ukraine and Russia. Avhustyn and Sofroniy, as well as father Anatoliy Kyrychenko, who ran in Fastivka, Kiev region, should have been aware of their noncompliance with apostolic decrees. But willful noncompliance was and is a church tradition and the position of the UOC-MP is quite uncomfortable at the present time, particularly since their colleagues in the other Ukrainian churches did not shy away from politics. Through it all the protestants remained remarkably calm and quiet. Nowhere in Ukraine do they form a compact electorate-- except Hungarian reformists in Transcarpathia, but that is a nationality issue--and the candidates ignored them. However, had elections been held on a proportional basis, the 300,000 disciplined protestants could have been heard from. These ruminations exclude Jehovah's Witnesses who during Soviet times avoided having anything to do with temporal affairs and refused to vote. On the other hand Baptists, Pentecostal Christians, and Seventh Day Adventists--who account for most Ukrainian protestants--did their civic duty. On March 20 the Baptists even proclaimed a day of fasting and special prayers for the elections. Leaders of the protestant communities supported centrist candidates who would not drag the country back to socialism or promote dubious innovations. Since the traditional churches are not very welcoming to these believers, in the future only those candidates who advocate freedom of religion and legal equality of all churches will be able to count on their support. In Conclusion, it appears that keeping churches out of politics is as unattainable as the Ten Commandments. Churches are, after all, social institutions with tens of millions of members. The effectiveness of their pastoral care depends on worldly realities. Some commentators have even attribute the fall of communism to the Vatican, while others feel it was due to a desire to replace a foreign ideology by our own. There are principal differences between churches with finely honed political aims and those that seek to protect the weak from the "powerful of this world." There are the stirring examples of Bishop Midszenty who opposed the pro-Moscow and pro-Stalinist regime in Budapest, Father Tekesz who helped bring down Ceausescu, and our own martyr, Metropolitan Yosyp Slipyy. But then there are also contrary examples. President Leonid Kravchuk noted with some trepidation on the eve of the elections that "...recently various political forces have attempted to subvert the authority of the Church to their ends in the upcoming parliamentary elections." He took the appropriate steps to control such machinations...but the skeptics pointed out that the Presidential Press Service made similar announcements a year ago on May 26. Nobody, of course, paid any attention to this and elections have become a tradition in Ukraine. Just a glance on the goings-on makes it easy to tell which local or presidential candidates have been blessed by an ecclesiastical hand and which have not.
