By the end of this year, bad credits will constitute about 23 percent of the entire credit portfolio of commercial banks. In 1996, the number of bad credits should go down to 7-8 percent, which corresponds with norms usually adopted by banks in highly developed countries. Bad credits began to be a problem after 1989; that is when economic conditions changed. Many enterprises could not repay credits they had borrowed earlier because they had problems in selling their products. But until they have repaid old credits, they could not have borrowed new ones (which they needed to modernize the production process.) Bad credits began to also haunt the banks themselves. Even though interest rates were rising on paper, bankers were perfectly aware that once a debtor goes bankrupt, the chances to recover the money will be very slim indeed. The only solution was to write off part of the old debts for those enterprises that have good future prospects. In March 1993, a law on restructuring banks and enterprises became effective. The banks researched by the institute were provided special bonds, in return for which they had to restructure their credit portfolios within a year. The Institute of Market Economy Research examined the credit situation at seven banks separated out of the National Bank of Poland: Bank Gdanski, Bank Zachodni, Powszechny Bank Kredytowy, Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy, Pomorski Bank Kredytowy, Bank Depozytowo-Kredytowy, and Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy. The conclusion is that banking reconciliation proceedings [postepowanie ugodowe] was the most frequently applied method of restructuring debts--it was applied in four-fifths of the cases. The banks tried to recover about 15 percent of the debts by using judicial conciliation proceedings, while, in the remaining cases, Civil Code agreements were used. Conciliation Most Frequent According to Finance Ministry data, enterprises had initiated over 190 banking conciliation proceedings by 31 March, out of which 120 were completed. As much as 60 percent of the proceedings were entered into by the banks researched by the institute. The value of these conciliation agreements is estimated at about 8 trillion zlotys [Z]. Banking conciliation proceedings covered primarily large enterprises that employed on average over 1,300 employees. The majority of the enterprises (72 percent) are state-owned or Treasury-owned joint-stock companies. The largest number of conciliation proceedings were initiated in the light and the electromachine industries, primarily in the Jelenia Gora, Opole, Lodz, Wroclaw, and Walbrzych Voivodships. As one can see, a majority of these voivodships are regions facing the danger of structural unemployment in which the industry's situation is very difficult. In 30 percent of the banking conciliation agreements, the principle of substituting financial claims with shares in the enterprises was applied. This means that banks will have a better way of controlling the remedying process [proces naprawczy]. Bankruptcy or Sale In the case of 162 enterprises that have incurred debts with the banks researched by the institute, courts declared bankruptcies of the enterprises on motions by the banks. This is the way the banks dealt with debtors who were without prospects for repaying the loans. In most cases, these were state-owned enterprises of the light or electromachine industries. No bankruptcy was declared with regard to enterprises of the fuel/energy or metallurgic industries. Selling the financial claims [wierzytelnosci] of banks was another method of getting rid of the claims by the banks. The banks decided to put financial claims of 378 economic units up for sale; the total of the debts of these units amounted to about Z2.4 trillion. The prices ranged from 8 to 50 percent of the total value of a financial claim. Claims with regard to enterprises of the electromachine industry were the easiest to sell.
