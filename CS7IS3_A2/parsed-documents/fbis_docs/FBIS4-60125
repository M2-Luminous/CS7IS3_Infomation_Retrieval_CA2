FBIS4-60125 "drnes099dd_94019" FBIS-NES-94-099 Daily Report 21 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Islamic Jihad, Hamas Assail Self-Rule Authority Islamic Jihad, Hamas Assail Self-Rule Authority JN2105210594 (Clandestine) Al-Quds Palestinian Arab Radio in Arabic 1630 GMT 21 May 94 JN2105210594 (Clandestine) Al-Quds Palestinian Arab Radio Arabic BFN [Text] The Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine has criticized the statement released by the 'Arafat leadership in reaction to the heroic commando attack at the Erez checkpoint in the northern Gaza Strip. The Islamic Jihad Movement's statement called 'Arafat's reaction another example of capitulation to the Zionist will and dictates. The statement regretted that the new authority should have reacted the way it did against an operation carried out by the Jihad Movement, when it cannot bar armed settlers from the self-rule areas. We reject this skewed logic, as do our people, who yesterday were jubilant over the heroic operation. Our jihad will continue and we will keep our weapons as long as the occupation remains, the Jihad Movement's statement emphasized. Meanwhile, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has issued a statement to mark the advent of the blessed 'Id al-Adha. As we celebrate the 'Id, advocates of negotiation and lovers of normalization with the Zionist entity try to convince us that the 27,000 sq. km that is Palestine has now shrunk to 400 sq. km, where they plan to set up an authority to provide for the security of the Zionist settlers and guard the interests of the shabby leadership. The Hamas statement called for remembering the martyrs, detainees, and wounded, who put their lives on the line for the sake of the homeland. The statement also appealed for help to be extended to the poor among our people, whose ranks have been swollen by the Zionist closure of the occupied territories.
