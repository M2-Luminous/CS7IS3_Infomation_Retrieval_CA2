FBIS4-56397 "drlat086__a94006" FBIS-LAT-94-086-A Daily Report 2 May 1994 ANNEX Brazil `Most Controversial Issues' in PT Platform Viewed `Most Controversial Issues' in PT Platform Viewed PY0305172194 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 2 May 94 p 3 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY0305172194 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Portuguese BFN [Unattributed report: "The Most Controversial Issues"; approved during a PT party convention on 1 May] [Text] Land Reform -- This is a priority for Lula. It will be immediately implemented after his inauguration, if he wins. The PT plans to immediately resolve the problem of rural workers camping along highways. Some 19,000 families live under such conditions. A definitive land reform will be implemented over a 15-year period. The program provides for the distribution of land and an agricultural policy to assist 3 million landless families. The state will provide technical assistance and invest in techniques for using the soil. Minimum Salary -- Lula has promised to raise the minimum salary to $300 toward the end of his mandate. The proposal was made by the PT Struggle faction, but was not backed even by CUT [Sole Workers Center] President Jair Meneguelli, who abstained from referring to the issue, or by Rio Grande de Sul Deputy Paulo Paim, who is the former president of the Labor Committee. The PT plenary session preferred to back the original text of the proposed program, which provides for "the gradual, steady increase of the minimum salary. In real terms, it seeks to double its value in the shortest possible time, reaching the level indicated by DIEESE [Interunion Department for Statistics and Socioeconomic Studies] ($350) at a later stage." Sao Paulo Deputy Aluizio Mercadante, the main economist of the PT bloc, justified the decision on the grounds that the program mentions no quantities. He added: "The growth rate of the minimum salary will be established by the process. It cannot be defined in the party's identification badge." The PT believes establishing a value might become a trap and a target for attacks from adversaries. "If the salary reaches $295, they will say the government did not fulfill its promise," Meneguelli noted. "We cannot advocate wishful thinking," Paim said. Abortion -- The PT decided to soften the abortion issue in its program. The text advocating the legalization of abortion was replaced by a general statement that limits itself to advocating the use of the public health network for abortion cases provided for by law (rape and life risk for the mother). Sao Paulo Deputy Jose Genoino justified the change, saying: "The campaign should take into account the balance of power and society's level of understanding and conscience." Homosexuals -- The 9th PT Convention did not debate the proposal on marriage between homosexuals. The basic text of the program was eliminated. The text carries a general statement saying the future government should take the initiative to propose legal measures permitting marriage between homosexuals. The PT withdrew the proposal from the program. Government -- The PT proposes creation of the Ministries of Employment and Social Security to replace the Ministries of Labor, Social Security, and Social Welfare. The Presidency of the Republic will be strengthened with an increased number of secretariats and with a reduction in the number of ministries. Mercadante is the most likely candidate for the Finance Ministry, although economists Paulo Nogueira Batista and Maria de Conceicao Tavares, and PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] Sao Paulo Deputy Jose Serra have also been mentioned. PT economist Paul Singer might be designated to the Planning Ministry. Anti-Imperialism -- The effort to defeat the radicals broke one of the bases of the PT's three-point anti-imperialist program (moratorium, fight against monopolies, fight against latifundia). In its party program, the PT defines itself as a socialist party that favors breaking with the IMF. The program does not mention the "anti-imperialist fight." Marcos Sokol, of the PT Struggle faction said: "This is discouraging for party members. One of our stronger principles has been affected."
