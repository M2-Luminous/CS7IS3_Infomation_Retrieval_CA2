"Negotiations are under way between the two countries," Hong said, "as to the size and time of deployment, decisions will be made after further consultations." "We hope that the deployment (of Patriot missiles) will enhance South Korea-U.S. defense capability," he said. South Korea will not purchase Patriot missiles and the anti- missile defense system will be part of the weaponry deployed by the U.S. forces in Korea at their bases, Hong added. At present, about 36,000 U.S. soldiers are stationed in South Korea.
