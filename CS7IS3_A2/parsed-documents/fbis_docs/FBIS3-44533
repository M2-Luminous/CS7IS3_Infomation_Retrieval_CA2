At a press conference here today organized by the Press and Publication Administration of China, Professor Wang Xuan, director of the Computer Institute of Beijing University, said that all the technology of the new color printing and publishing equipment is stored in a personal computer. "The greatest benefit of the new technology is that Chinese printing houses can now do their color printing without buying and using the expensive imported electronic color analyzers," said Wang, who is also a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. According to Wang, China's printing houses have spent 70 million U.S. dollars importing some 400 color analyzers in recent years. Many of the Chinese publishers have to go to Hong Kong to get their high-quality color books printed. "Our newly-developed technology has some features and functions which traditional electronic color analyzers do not have," Wang noted. "For example, publishers and printers can do all kinds of artistic processing and creative designs through a computer." Due to its small size and low prices, Wang said, most small and medium-sized printing factories can afford to purchase the equipment. According to Wang, the market for color printing equipment in China is worth at least two billion yuan.
