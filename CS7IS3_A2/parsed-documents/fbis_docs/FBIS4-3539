The two leaders agreed that Sino-U.S. relations were very important. The relations concerned more than bilateral ties; they should be looked at in a global context, with the focus on the 21st century. Details of the talks were not revealed, but the choice of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference as the venue for the meeting for the two state leaders after an almost five-year break was itself profoundly significant. Security Considerations Replaced by Economic Factors When China and the United States normalized their relations 22 years ago, leaders of the two countries were looking at the north of Asia. Despite the then ongoing Vietnam war, the two countries, mainly motivated by a desire to ward off the hegemonism of the former Soviet Union, improved their relations. Twenty-two years later, when leaders of the two countries are thinking of and discussing their relations, they are looking at the dynamic region of Southeast Asia (including China). The truth is, the shift of their focus was prompted by the shift of the overlapping interests (mutual or conflicting) between the two countries. The shift was reflected not only in geographical changes, but also in the changed proportions of various key factors in overall Sino-U.S. relations. Twenty-two years ago, security was almost the sole factor in Sino- U.S. relations. Today, the new economic factor is becoming increasingly bigger. The shift toward the south in Sino-U.S. relations has just started, but its impact on bilateral relations, multilateral relations in the Asia-Pacific region, and the future multipolar world cannot be ignored. The Three Causes Behind the Shift Toward the South Why have Sino-U.S. relations shifted toward the south? Stated simply, there are three causes: First, it was a result of recent changes and developments in the global political and economic situation. I do not intend to repeat the arguments as the movement of the post-Cold War global political world toward multipolarity and the lone brilliant performance of the Southeast Asian economy amid the yet-to-recover global economy have been covered by many articles. Second, for four years, China stood up to pressures from the West, increased the pace of reform and opening up, actively developed relations with countries sharing common borders and its Asian neighbors, and scored a series of significant results. As the understanding and trust between China and these countries grew, an "Asian" political and economic cooperation distinguished by political independence, economic interdependence, a fading of ideological differences, mutual tolerance, and an Asian concept of human rights different from the West's is taking shape. The entry of China into the East Asian economy and the considerable growth of its trade ties with Japan, ROK, and ASEAN countries, injecting new vitality into the region, made Western countries look at China with a new eye. Third, the shift toward the south in Sino-U.S relations was also a result of the new approach toward China adopted by Clinton since he came to power. In the last few months, the United States has made relatively important adjustments in its policy toward China, the most important of which was Clinton's realization that the Asia-Pacific is a region with great hopes, a great future and great vitality, one having a vital bearing on U.S. interests. To solve its domestic economic problems, the United States needs to strengthen further its ties with the Asia-Pacific region. To do that, it has to value China's role. In Clinton's own words: "You cannot isolate a country as big and important to the world's future as China." Such a change in U.S. policy should be welcomed. The disintegration of the Soviet Union and the rapid victory in the Gulf War created a feeling of invincibility among some Americans and Westerners and an illusion that with the passing of the Cold War, it was no longer necessary to maintain strategic cooperation with China, which explained why they applied sanctions to China under numerous pretexts. They were imprisoned in their Cold War mentality. However, to their surprise, China remained stable politically and more open economically, and developed just as rapidly. And the problems confronting the world were not as simple as they thought. U.S. foreign policy suffered a series of setbacks on the problems of Russia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, and Haiti, showing that the United States could no longer do what it wanted, and that it needed to cooperate with China and other countries in dealing with various thorny world issues. In particular, when they looked at the southern part of East Asia and found the prosperity there, the United States and other Western countries realized that they could no longer afford to neglect the role of China in the Asia-Pacific region and to pass up the economic opportunities in China. This can be reasonably described as a realistic attitude. The Need To Consider Seriously Two Problems [subhead] Whether or not Sino-U.S. relations will develop smoothly, the shift to the south in the political and economic relations of the two countries may already signify the beginning of a new stage demanding that we scrutinize Sino-U.S. relations with a new eye and perspective. In this new stage, both sides will encounter some old problems; for example, whether or not the United States can abide by the various principles in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques; whether or not their differences on problems of trade, human rights, and arms sales can be properly bridged; whether or not frictions can be kept at a low level so that they will not jeopardize overall bilateral ties; and so on. The general belief is that in the near future, there will be improvement in Sino-U.S. relations, though not at any fast rate; and there may also be some complications. One problem that we should be thinking about, however, is under the new situation, what kind of new elements may emerge from, and what kind of new problems we may have to face in future Sino-U.S. relations. In my view, the following two points are important: First, cooperation between the two countries is absolutely necessary, though competition will run alongside it. In the early days of improvement in Sino-U.S. relations, the security interests were clear, easily seen, and mutual. And given the then limited economic ties, there were no trade frictions. Cooperation then was relatively smooth. But the situation began to change in the early 1980's and looked quite different by the 1990's. When the center of bilateral relations shifted to the southeastern part of Asia, China and the United States still shared a common interest in maintaining the security and stability of the Asia-Pacific region, but on specific issues their interests began to diverge and even clashed. The Western media hype about "threats from China" on the Taiwan issue was a case in point. Another key factor was the increasing proportions of economic and trade and technological considerations in Sino-U.S. relations. In economic relations, what is inevitable is competition. Although China, the United States, Japan, and other Asia-Pacific countries strongly complement each other economically, it is plain to see that in many areas there is competition, and that it is increasingly fierce. Apart from the economic factor, the Clinton administration's adjustment of its Asia policy, and its great concern for it, was also prompted by political considerations. How to face this cooperation-competition situation in future Sino- U.S. relations is an important subject we must think through. Second, multilateral ties between China, the United States, and the Asia-Pacific region mean that there will be more international factors acting as constraints on Sino-U.S. relations. The "macrotriangular relations" between the United States, China, and the Soviet Union in the Cold War era were relatively simple. With the end of the Cold War, the center of Sino-U.S. relations moved south and exercised far greater influence on the stability and development of the entire Asia-Pacific region and made all kinds of relations much more complicated. On the one hand, the ups and downs of Sino-U.S. relations will impact on their respective relations with other Asia-Pacific countries; and on the other hand, developments and changes in any of their respective relations with Asia-Pacific countries will bounce back on Sino-U.S. relations. The prospects for Sino-U.S. relations is a great concern for Asia- Pacific countries. Lee Kuan-yew recently suggested to the United States that it take China as its "strategic partner." A noted Australian personage also criticized the U.S. Government's attempt to impose its own human rights concepts on Asian countries. All these illustrate the problem well. Therefore, how to make use of channels arising from bilateral and multilateral relations to foster positive development in Sino-U.S. relations and multilateral relations with the Asia-Pacific region is another key subject we should think about and pursue in action. Of course, describing the shift of the center of Sino-U.S. relations toward the south does not mean that there are no common concerns and significant common interests for China and the United States in Northeast Asia. It is still true to say that situations in Northeast Asia still stir and sway Sino-U.S. relations. I have not intended to conduct a full review of Sino-U.S. relations in this short article. What I wanted to stress was the ongoing change of a background factor in Sino-U.S. relations. The argument that the center of Sino-U.S. relations has shifted to the south calls for another look. However, I hope that by offering this argument I can provide a new perspective in observing and making forecasts on Sino-U.S. relations.
