This is one of the main branches of the investigation that began after police busted into the fortress home of illegal lottery banker Castor de Andrade last week. Hundreds of names of individuals and organizations financed by the illegal lottery were found thanks to the investigation. Illegal lottery banker Waldermiro Garcia, aka Miro, who is considered the richest of all the numbers lottery bankers, owns a casino in Ciudad del Este (Paraguayan city on the border with Foz de Iguazu). According to Paraguayan builders, nearly a year ago he invested $2 million just to refurbish his casino. According to information obtained by Brazilian police that is in the District Attorney's Office's hands, 60 small, private airplanes fly daily from Paraguay into Brazil bringing drugs from Bolivia and Colombia. Most of the airplanes land in Sao Paulo State, from where the drugs are taken to Rio de Janeiro in small quantities. The Rio de Janeiro district attorney will ask the government to carry out negotiations with the Paraguayan Government to further control the flights of small airplanes leaving for Brazil. The subject is being handled with total discretion because there are suspicions that Paraguayan Government officials may be involved in these operations. The investigations show that besides being used to bring cocaine, the airport [not further specified], which already has been closed once, also is used to receive smuggled weapons. Reactions The day at the Rio de Janeiro District Attorney's Office was marked by reactions against the release of the list of names of people who received money from the illegal lottery scheme. Rio District Attorney Antonio Carlos Biscaia, who today wanted to concentrate on analyzing the thousands of pages from the accounting books where the financial movements of the illegal lottery bankers are registered, was forced to receive politicians and lawyers protesting the manner in which the case was made public. Files After decoding 166 diskettes confiscated from the home of Castor de Andrade, the prosecutors and computer experts investigating the corruption scheme operated in Rio de Janeiro by the illegal lottery on 8 April managed to enter the files of the illegal lottery's top bankers, and they believe they will obtain extraordinary revelations. Nonetheless, they are waiting for authorization from District Attorney Biscaia to reveal their findings. The diskettes found in the safes of Castor de Andrade's fortress home that police busted last week are being studied by experts from the District Attorney's Office and the Rio de Janeiro State Data Processing Center [Centro de Processamento de Dados--Proderj]. The work being carried out at the Military Police Classified Services Office, at the institution's headquarters, were surrounded by mystery on 8 April. According to Classified Services Commander (P2) Colonel Marcos Paz, some of the diskettes' contents already have been printed by the experts. The printed pages were taken to the District Attorney's Office. The experts did not want to give out any information about their work, saying the information on the results is centered at the District Attorney's Office.
