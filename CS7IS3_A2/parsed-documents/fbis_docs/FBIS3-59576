The European microelectronics industry is not getting off its crawling start. While Japanese and Taiwanese manufacturers are further enhancing the top position the Far East holds in memory chips and American electronics giants such as the Intel Corporation are reaping billions in profits with their microprocessors, the barometer readings for this industry on the old continent have again fallen to the the bottom. "Europe has only half-heartedly responded to the drastic reconstruction process taking place in the semiconductor industry worldwide" soberly states Hans Weinerth, former manager of Philips and today chief of Sican GmbH (GmbH = Ltd) in Hannover which produces special custom-made chips. "Whoever wants to catch up here must not nibble at but take a whack at it" believes Jens Uwe Fuhrmann of the German Machine and Plant Construction Society (VDMA). Yet the European chip industry has suffered for years from a frightening lack of motivation. Only Siemens, jointly with the IBM Deutschland GmbH (German IBM Ltd), still bearably holds on to the mass market for memory chips. The twosome recently delivered their first 64 Mbit chips to selected customers. The European Research Initiative JESSI (Joint European Submicron Silicon), although established for the purpose of developing this particular chip as closely as possible alongside the Japanese, has since changed its orientation. "Memory technology was virtually stricken from the European agenda" admits Heinz Hagmeister, just recently appointed JESSI chairman. A general breakdown of the domestic microelectronics industry, however, Hagmeister refuses to concede: "We are still holding some trump cards." It is slowly dawning on the JESSI board members in charge that the billions of research money squandered in laboratories on unmarketable projects actually help countries like Japan, Korea, and the U.S.A. to remain leaders in electronics. The situation is, indeed, becoming more and more critical. The European chip users are becoming more and more dependent on non-European chip producers. "Japan has assumed the leading role all the way from making semiconductor materials through fabrication of chips to manufacture of electronic products" complains Michael Pero, director of Microelectronics in the Technology-Strategy and Innovation Projects (TES) division of the Daimler-Benz AG (AG = Corporation). There is absolutely no shortage of new places where to start. Professional market watchers are raising Europe's expectations in this field by their discovery of a demand for microelectronic components called ASIC's (Amorphous-Silicon Integrated Circuits) designed to meet user's special requirements. These components can be used in washing machines, mobile telephones, machine tools, automobiles, and in practically all electronic circuits, each component as a rule in only a very specific kind of electronic device. They often replace an entire series of mass-produced chips and thus remain each suitable for only a particular device targeted for miniaturization. They furthermore perform their specific task most often faster and more reliably than an electronic circuit built with mass-produced chips. "The success of European products hinges neither on the degree of integration nor on the storage density of chips" acknowledges Max Syrbe, since a few weeks ago president of the Fraunhofer Society. Extremely fine structures striven for in mass-produced chips are not needed in an ASIC. Inasmuch as only the functions needed for performance of its specific task are built into it, an ASIC is by far not as crowded as a 64 Mbit chip. The chances are good that, by pursuing the ASIC line, Europe's semiconductor industry will again catch up with the leading manufactures of semiconductor devices and especially so since the Fraunhofer Institute of Silicon Technology has focused its attention on precisely this particular concept. A comfortable new Institute building is currently being constructed in Itzehoe with Europe's largest contamination-free space for research and development. Two thousand square meters of floor area will be made available to the Institute's researchers and collaborating experts from industry. Relocation from the present site in Berlin is scheduled to take place in the second half of 1995. The Institute will provide the technical prerequisites for a quantum jump in ASIC development. The equipment on hand for this purpose is designed to produce chip structures of sizes smaller than half a micrometer. This will lead to an actual manufacture of ASIC's and thus to further progress in the miniaturization of devices. According to Weinerth, chief of Sican, there are still openings for entry into competition with other semiconductor manufacturers for share of the world market. "Our ambition must not be to gain a few percentage points on the world market with standard products", admonishes the former JESSI man, "but rather to offer specialty products." Despite the favorable position for a good start, marketable products are still scarce. Exceptions include the world's highest-speed silicon chip developed at the Ruhr University in Bochum. The know-how for this device has been acquired by the Daimler-Benz Corporation. Then the Institute of Discrete Mathematics (IDM) at the Bonn University has developed layouts for new chips which the IBM Deutschland (German IBM) GmbH now uses. But on the whole, says IDM chief Bernhard Korte, the European semiconductor industry is fast asleep. The greatest weakness lies in transmitting the know-how from the laboratory to the industry. A man who wants to correct this is Prof. Dieter Seitzer in Nuremberg. His efforts should benefit most of all middle-class consumers. This incumbent Chair of Engineering Electronics professor at the Erlangen-Nuremberg University, who is also director of the Fraunhofer Institute of Integrated Circuits, knows what the trouble is with the group of people he will confront: "Researchers and potential users are still too timid to communicate with one another properly." The agile professor visualizes covering West Europe with a hundred competence centers which will assist every prospective user in the design of ASIC's. The laboratory facilities of the Fraunhofer Institute in Erlangen are today almost ready to handle telephone orders. Meanwhile, however, the JESSI project is still in its infancy. Besides the Erlangen Institute, only the Braunschweig Institute of Applied Microelectronic has a so-called chip shop available for custom design of ASIC's. Seitzer is not the only one promoting such services. The Thuringia Microelectronics Application Center (MAZeT)Ltd, in which the city of Erfurt and also the Weinerth-Sican enterprise and the Jena Optics Ltd participate, offers assistance not only in ASIC development but also in almost all areas of microelectronics. Because of this capability, the Center occupies a unique position in Germany, having competence in advance microelectronics also at its disposal.
