Accordingly, the support level for the 1994 crop of such kind of tobacco will be the 1993 level, adjusted by the difference (plus or minus) between the 1993 ``basic support level'' and the 1994 ``basic support level.'' In addition, section 106(f)(6)(B) of the 1949 Act provides that to the extent requested by the board of directors of an association, through which price support is made available to producers (producer association), the Secretary may reduce the support level determined under section 106(f)(6)(A) of the 1949 Act for the respective kind of tobacco to more accurately reflect the market value and improve the marketability of such tobacco. Accordingly, the price support level for a kind of tobacco set forth in this rule could be reduced if such a request is made. Determinations The following levels of price support for the 1993 crops of various kinds of tobacco were determined in accordance with section 106(f)(6)(A) of the 1949 Act: ␣ 1Kind and type 1Support level (cents per pound) Virginia fire-cured (type 21) 139.5 KY&hyph;TN fire-cured (types 22&hyph;23) 146.4 Dark air-cured (types 35&hyph;36) 125.5 Virginia sun-cured (type 37) 123.3 Cigar-filler and binder (type 42&hyph;44 and 53&hyph;55) 107.4 Cigar-filler (type 46) 83.4 Section 106(b) of the 1949 Act provides that the ``basic support level'' for any year is determined by multiplying the support level for the 1959 crop of such kind of tobacco by the ratio of the average of the index of prices paid by farmers, including wage rates, interest, and taxes (referred to as the ``parity index'') for the three previous calendar years to the average index of such prices paid by farmers, including wage rates, interest, and taxes for the 1959 calendar year. For the 1994 crop year: (1) Average parity indexes for calendar years 1990&hyph;1993 are as follows. ␣ 1Year 1Index 1Year 1Index 1990 1,265 1991 1,285 1991 1,298 1992 1,303 1992 1,298 1993 1,340 Average 1,287 Average 1,309 (2) Average parity index, calendar year 1959=298. (3) 1993 ratio of 1,287 to 298=4.32; 1994 ratio of 1,287 to 298=4.39. (4) Ratios times 1959 support levels and 1994 increase in basic support levels are as follows:
