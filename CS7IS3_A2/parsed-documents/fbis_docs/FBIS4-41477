This follows a cable from Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy Admiral Felix Gromov to BSF Commander Admiral Eduard Baltin. Baltin is asked to let the BSF officers and men know that no statements from some Ukrainian military officials will be able to hinder a solution to the problem in exactly that way. In a speech in Sevastopol on Tuesday, Commander of the Ukrainian Navy Vice Admiral Vladimir Beskorovainy said that Sevastopol was a Ukrainian naval stronghold while the Russian Navy could be deployed there as one of a foreign state under a leasing agreement spread over a period of 15 to 25 years. For its part, the press service of the Russian Navy in a statement on Thursday said that "in the emerging situation, such statements by the chief of the Ukrainian navy department are aimed at unsettling the situation over the BSF". These address those forces in Ukraine which assume extremely nationalist positions in resolving a highly complicated problem in relations between two fraternal Slav nations, says the statement.
