Although Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic and Bosnian Muslim Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said after the talks that differences between the two sides had been narrowed, according to foreign news agencies, they did concede that the two sides were still far from any significant agreement. Granic, who is also deputy Croatian prime minister, said the Muslim side was interested in a confederation with Croatia, but the two sides were still not in agreement about the future form of organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Granic said each member of the planned confederation would be a member of the United Nations. Granic said various ideas about the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina into ethnic republics or cantons and a ceasefire in central Bosnia had been discussed. Granic and Silajdzic said the talks on future Croatian-Muslim relations would be resumed in the Croatian capital of Zagreb next week at the level of experts, after which they said the two of them would most likely meet again. Granic and Silajdzic first separately met with special United States envoy for Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ambassador Charles Redman. Ambassador Redman said he was trying to have the two sides more decisively approach the resolution of issues of their future coexistence.
