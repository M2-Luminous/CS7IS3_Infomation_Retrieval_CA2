According to the Jordan News Agency, PETRA, Transport Minister Adeeb Halasa Friday [28 January] said that at its meting in Baghdad, the company also "reviewed plans for activating operations once the sanctions against Iraq are lifted." The company, jointly owned by the Baghdad and Amman governments, had forcast a $10 million profit for 1993 in a board meeting held last May. There was no official explanation for the reduced profit, reported REUTER. But it was believed to be a result of reduced Iraqi trade through Jordan due to the kingdom's compliance with the sanctions, Iraq's introduction of strict trade and monetary regulations and the thorough inspection of cargo vessels bound for al-'Aqabah. Mr. Halasa's comments were made in Baghdad at the end of a four-day annual board meeting, co-chaired by Mr. Halasa and his Iraqi counterpart Ahmad Mortada. According to Petra the board also decided that plans for 1994 should include the prospect of operating its trucks outside Jordanian and Iraqi territory. The company, which oversees freight between both countries, was established in 1981 with a capital of $50 million. Mr. Halasa, who returned to Amman Friday, said that $8 million has been allocated for the purchase of the new trucks, but he declined to say when the purchase would be made. He said the company discussed plans for operating a weekly flight between Amman and Baghdad to carry ailing Iraqis who cannot afford the 1000-kilometre overland trip between the two countries. [sentence as published] "We discussed all the measures that should be adopted once the United Nations approves Iraq's request for a weekly flight between both countries that was submitted two months ago," Mr. Halasa told PETRA. The agency also quoted an Iraqi official as saying that Iraq will continue to use al-'Aqabah for its imports despite the reopening of Umm Qasr Port in the Gulf in November. Jordan was concerned that Iraqi imports through al-'Aqabah could diminish because of the reopening of Umm Qaser.
