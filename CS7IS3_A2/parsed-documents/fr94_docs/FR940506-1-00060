FR940506-1-00060 FR940506-1-00014 (i) Either the 30th day after receipt by the designated billing office of a proper invoice from the contractor, or the 30th day after Government acceptance of the work or services completed by the contractor, whichever is later. If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the invoice payment due date shall be the 30th day after the date of the contractor's invoice, provided a proper invoice is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with contract requirements. (ii) On a final invoice where the payment amount is subject to contract settlement action ( e.g., release of contractor claims), acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on the effective date of the contract settlement. (4) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the contractor for payments described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, Government acceptance or approval shall be deemed to have occurred constructively on the 7th day after the contractor has completed the work or services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract (see also paragraph (c)(5) of this section). In the event that actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of acceptance. (5) The constructive acceptance and constructive approval requirements described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section are conditioned upon receipt of a proper payment request and no disagreement over quantity, quality, contractor compliance with contract requirements, or the requested amount. These requirements do not compel Government officials to accept work or services, approve contractor estimates, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities. The contracting officer may specify a longer period for constructive acceptance or constructive approval in the solicitation and resulting contract, if required to afford the Government a reasonable opportunity to adequately inspect the work and to determine the adequacy of the contractor's performance under the contract. (6) Construction prime contracts contain special provisions concerning prime contractor payments to subcontractors, along with special prime contractor certification requirements. The Office of Management and Budget has determined that these certifications are not to be construed as final acceptance of the subcontractor's performance. The certification in 52.232&hyph;5(c) implements this determination; however, certificates are still acceptance if the contractor deletes paragraph (c)(4) of 52.232&hyph;5. (d) Due dates for payments of contractor invoices for meat, meat food products, or fish; perishable agricultural commodities; and dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils are as follows: (1) For meat or meat food products, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921 (7 U.S.C. 182(3)), as further defined in Public Law 98&hyph;181, including any edible fresh or frozen poultry meat, any perishable poultry meat food product, fresh eggs, and any perishable egg product, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery. (2) For fresh or frozen fish, as defined in section 204(3) of the Fish and Seafood Promotion Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 4003(3)), will be as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery. (3) For perishable agricultural commodities, as defined in section 1(4) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499a(4)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after product delivery, unless another date is specified in the contract. (4) For dairy products, as defined in section 111(e) of the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4502(e)), edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after the date on which a proper invoice has been received. Liquid milk, cheese, certain processed cheese products, butter, yogurt, ice cream, mayonnaise, salad dressings, and other similar products, fall within this classification. Nothing in the Act limits this classification to refrigerated products. When questions arise about the proper classification of a specific product, prevailing industry practices should be followed in specifying a contract payment due date. The burden of proof that a classification of a specific product is, in fact, prevailing industry practice is upon the bidder making the representation. (e) A proper invoice must include the items listed in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(8) of this section. If the invoice does not comply with these requirements, the contractor must be notified of the defect within 7 days after receipt of the invoice at the designated billing office (3 days on contracts for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days on contracts for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils). The reason that the invoice is not a proper invoice must be specified. If such notice is not timely, then an adjusted due date for the purpose of determining an interest penalty, if any, will be established in accordance with 32.907&hyph;1(b). (1) Name and address of the contractor. (2) Invoice date. (Contractors are encouraged to date invoices as close as possible to the date of mailing or transmission.)
