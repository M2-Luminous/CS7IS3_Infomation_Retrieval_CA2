It is a thin-film battery that was jointly developed by Dr. Noboru Koyama and associates at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. (president: Y. Morishita), and what is interesting about the battery is the fact that the composite electrodes are made with organic sulphur compounds. It is much lighter than conventional batteries, and would last 10 times longer if it were the same weight. When it becomes commercially available, it will help further the use of electric cars in which one of the major stumblingblocks has been how far the car can travel on one recharge. A secondary battery is charged and discharged based on combinations of chemical reactions that take place between the positive and negative electrode. Dr. Koyama and associates resolved the delayed reaction problem that had been plaguing batteries by focusing on an organic compound (dimercapto-thiazole) in which thiols were linked in thiazole chains, and formed a composite material for the electrode by mixing highly superconductive polyaniline with fine carbon particles. He and his associates prototyped a 1-cm thin-film lithium battery that consisted of the composite electrode that they developed, a solid gel electrolyte, and a negative electrode (lithium foil). They then investigated the energy capacity of the battery that tells them how much work the battery can perform per kilogram of mass on one recharge. Results of tests confirmed that the battery had 10 times the energy capacity of commercially available NiCad batteries, and five times the capacity of batteries which use only polyaniline. Moreover, the company found that by adding diethyl carbonate to ethylene carbonate to form the solid electrolyte that they could apply high voltages to the battery for 4.3V recharges, and speed up the time it takes to recharge the battery. Furthermore, the new battery demonstrated the ability to maintain 80 percent capacity after 50 repeat charges/discharges, showing the kind of durability required for use commercially.
