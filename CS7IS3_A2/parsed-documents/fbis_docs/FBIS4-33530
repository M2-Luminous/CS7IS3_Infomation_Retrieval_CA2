[passage omitted] In his speech at the OAS plenary, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim stated that he has observed positive signs of a democratic reform in Cuba, which must be both deepened and encouraged. Amorim, who is a 52-year-old career diplomat, said: "We have expectations for democratic progress in that country, with which Brazil maintains friendly relations and major cultural ties." The head of Brazilian diplomacy added that "we do not view economic and political isolation as the best way to contribute to promoting a transition that is already in the making." On 6 June, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo proposed at the OAS plenary session that the OAS undertake negotiations aimed at promoting democratization with the Havana government and with all other parties concerned.
