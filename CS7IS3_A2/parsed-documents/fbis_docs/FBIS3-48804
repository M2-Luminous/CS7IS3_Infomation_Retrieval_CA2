This survey has been conducted once a year (latter part of June to latter part of July) since 1953, targeted at regular households nationwide with two or more household members (6,000 households, return rate 68.5 percent) in order to grasp the actual state of savings, consumption, and life awareness. Below, we would like you to view the major characteristics of the results of this survey. Average Amount of Savings Held and Composition by Category The average amount of savings per household for households with savings was 13 million yen, the highest in the past, but it was no more than a small increase of 3.3 percent compared to the previous year (12.59 million yen). Moreover, the median amount of savings (the amount of savings of households positioned in the middle when ranking households with savings in order of the amount of savings held) was 7.32 million yen, a slight increase of 1.0 percent compared to the previous year. In the component ratio by category for amount of savings, "deposit savings" was the largest, accounting for 50.2 percent, next in order were "insurance and annuities" (25.3 percent), "negotiable securities" (14.4 percent), and "loans and money trusts" (6.4 percent). Moreover, viewing these by annual income level, a special characteristic was that deposit savings accounted for over half in the low income level, but the percentage of negotiable securities was high and the percentage of deposit savings was low for those with annual income over 7 million yen. Reasons for Increase in Amount of Savings Held Viewing the reasons for the increase in savings (multiple answers), the percentages for "increase in earned income" (43.2 percent) and "higher percentage of savings because of earned income" (34.1 percent) continue to be high, but with the recent economic trends, while the percentage of households indicating "increase in earned income" has continued to decline for three years, households indicating "a higher savings percentage" have greatly increased (27.8 percent previous year to 34.1 percent) and the condition of stressing savings even amidst the leveling off of income stands out in relief. On the other hand, a few households indicated "dividend and interest income" (11.1 percent), "extra income from inheritance, retirement pay, etc." (5.8 percent), and "increase appraised value of stocks" (2.0 percent), etc. Selection Criteria for Savings Categories The percentage was greatest for households indicating "security" (43.5 percent) as the most important criteria in selection of savings category and next in order were "fluidity" (27.1 percent) and "earnings" (25.2 percent). Comparing this with past surveys, up until 1991, the households indicating "security" had dropped back because of the progress of financial deregulation and the surge in interest preference awareness, and household indicating "earnings" had increased; however, since 1992, a complete change has been noted with "security" increasing (most recent bottom 37.0 percent in 1991) and "earnings" declining (most recent peak 29.1 percent in 1991). Savings Objective Regarding savings objective (multiple answers of not more than three items), the households that consider "preparation for illness or disaster" continues to be the greatest with 70.9 percent, followed next by "funds for old age" (50.1 percent), "children's educational expenses" (35.8 percent), "no particular objective, but peace of mind when saving" (23.5 percent), and "home acquisition or enlargement/remodeling funds" (19.1 percent), and this order has not changed since 1987. Viewing this by the age of the head of household, 1) "preparation for illness or disaster" has the greatest weight for all levels, but the trends can be surmised that 2) "children's educational expenses," "home acquisition or enlargement/remodeling funds," "funds to purchase durable consumer goods," and "funds for travel and leisure" have comparatively great weight in young households, and 3) "funds for old age" is high for elderly households. Reasons for Selection of Financial Institution Regarding the reasons for selection of the financial institution (multiple answers of not more than three items), households oriented toward geographic convenience continue to be great with "because there is a branch or ATM in the neighborhood and it is convenient" (73.4 percent) being overwhelmingly the greatest, and in addition, not a few households indicating "because the branch network extends nationwide" (28.5 percent). Amidst this, a special characteristic of this survey is that "because the management is healthy and reliable" at 37.0 percent surpassed the previous year (28.4 percent) by 8.6 percentage points. In addition, "because salesman was enthusiastic and image is good" (11.5 percent) and "because they sell commodities with high earnings" (9.5 percent) follow. Demands for Improvement in Service by Financial Institutions Looking at demands for improved service by financial institutions (multiple answers), demands for expanded business hours are the strongest, with "extension of weekday window closing time" (44.8 percent) and "expansion of ATM functions on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, and extension of operating hours" (42.0 percent), etc. They are followed by "rate service for deposit and loan interest rather than spending on the cost of gifts such as tissue paper" (35.1 percent) and "shorter waiting time at window" (34.6 percent). Recently, there have been quite a few demands seeking a close relationship with financial institutions such as "providing information closely linked to lifestyle" (19.6 percent), "establishing window where you can easily have consultation" (19.2 percent), and "expanding communication with customers, which has been neglected with automation" (15.0 percent). Thoughts About Financial Deregulation Looking at the thinking in regards to financial deregulation (multiple answers of not more than two items), there has been a gradual increase in those who appreciate the merits or significance of deregulation such as "choice of financial assets is broad and advantages are great" (19.0 percent) and "approve since fair markets have been formed" (15.2 percent). Although households complaining of lack of information have decreased compared to last year (52.8 percent) such as "the deregulation process and details on commodities are unclear" (43.9 percent), besides being rather large as before, many indicate "apprehension about the increase in mergers and failures of financial institutions" (24.9 percent) and "risk increases because there are limits to an individual's information-gathering capability and there are no advantages" (24.8 percent). About Consumption Expenditures 1. Consumption Expenditure Trends Viewing the increase or decrease of consumption expenditures for the past one-year period, while the percentage of households that consider that "consumption has increased compared to the previous year" (44.3 percent) has dropped compared to last year (45.9 percent), households that consider that "it has decreased compared to the previous year" (13.4 percent) have increased from last year (10.8 percent), and the attitude toward consumption lately has become cautious. Moreover, regarding the next year, households that will continue a cautious attitude about consumption spending at about the same level as up to now have increased. 2. Consumption Expenditure Decreased Expense Items Looking at the specific expense items where consumption was checked along with the aforementioned changes in consumption trends (multiple answers with no more than three expense items), in the past one-year period, many households decreased spending on items such as clothing (64.5 percent), cultural education and entertainment or social (50.5 percent), durable consumer goods purchases (43.5 percent), or food (36.2 percent). Moreover, in the next year period, they plan to decrease expense items about the same. With regard to clothing expenses, durable consumer goods, and cultural education and entertainment or social expenses among these items, they are already possessed to a certain extent and it is believed that they are being held in check because of their weak essential character, but it is inferred that they are being held in check because they can be held in check. About Life Planning 1. Status of Establishing Life Planning Regarding life planning, 42.7 percent of the households considered that "they are establishing life planning," and, together with households that say that "they will establish life planning in the future" (34.5 percent), they amount to slightly less than 80 percent, and it can be said that the perception of the importance of life planning continues to be strong. Incidentally, on this point, the Central Committee on Savings Public Relations conducts without charge "computerized diagnotic life planning" in order to help people who are trying to establish life planning, and users have reached 8,000 to 9,000 per year, with a trend of further increase. On the other hand, regarding items that households which are establishing life planning considered important when establishing it (multiple answers of no more than two items), the greatest were households which consider "funds for old age" (50.8 percent), followed next by "a life that is distinguished by planning" (31.6 percent), "children's educational funds" (31.2 percent), "home acquisition or enlargement/remodeling funds" (22.8 percent), and "funds for children's marriage" (13.4 percent). 2. Connection Between Life Planning and Household Account Entries Regarding the important household account entries with establishment of life planning as the basis, households which "enter it" (25.8 percent) and households which "sometimes enter it" (19.7 percent) are 45.5 percent if combined, but no great change has been seen in the past few years. However, looking at the connection between household account entries and whether or not there is life planning, households who "are establishing" life planning amount to about 60 percent of the households which "enter it" in household accounts, and it amounts to slightly less than 90 percent if households which "plan to establish one" in the future are included. As opposed to this, households that "are establishing" life planning are no more than about one-third (34.1 percent) of the households which "do not enter it" in household accounts, and it is no more than about 70 percent if households which "plan to establish one" in the future are included. Awareness About Living Standards in Old Age Regarding "preparations for life in old age," in addition to many households indicating it as the most important item for life planning, it also follows "preparation for illness or disaster" as the objective of savings, and it can be said that concern about living standards in old age is very high. Therefore, let's look at the awareness of "living standards in old age" and its background, dividing households where the head of the household is under 60 years of age and households where he is over 60. A. Looking at the awareness of "living standards in old age" in households where the head of the household is under 60, the percentage of households that think that "there is not much concern" is no more than about a third (35.6 percent), and the majority of the households consider it "somewhat of a concern" (62.0 percent). On the other hand, viewing the awareness of "living now" in elderly households with the head of the household over 60, households that consider that "living without much concern" amounted to over 70 percent, and it can be inferred that their awareness contrasts with households where the head of the household is under 60 years old. B. Behind this awareness of living standards in old age, households which considered that it is "because there is an annuity or insurance" (61.6 percent) were the greatest in those that "have no concern" among households with the head of household under 60, followed next by "because there is retirement pay" (33.4 percent), and "because the price of goods has not gone up so much that the prospects for living are difficult to see" (22.2 percent). On the other hand, the percentage of households which consider that it is "because of insufficient savings" (77.9 percent) or "because annuities or insurance is inadequate" (59.5 percent) was quite high in households that "have concern," and indicated next are "because retirement pay is not enough" (35.9 percent) and "because a large increase the price of goods is possible" (25.9 percent). C. Looking at the source of funds necessary for living (multiple answers) in households with the head of the household over 60, households that indicated "public pension" (66.4 percent) and "income from employment" (53.6 percent) respectively accounted for over half. They were followed next by "individual or corporate annuity" (15.3 percent), "taking from savings" (11.1 percent), "real estate income" (10.6 percent), and "interest or dividend income" (10.3 percent). Recently, comparatively few households indicate "support from children" (7.5 percent), and, moreover, as opposed to the percentage gradually declining since 1984 (18.7 percent), households that indicate "income from working" has increased since 1989 (from 37.3 percent at most recent bottom in 1989 to 53.6 percent in 1993), and the independent orientation of elderly households can be inferred.
