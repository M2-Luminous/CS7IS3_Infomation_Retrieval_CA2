They said that the Mexican authorities had treated them badly, had given them drugs, accused them of belonging to the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN), took their money, and held them under arrest for several days. They added that many are under arrest in Villa Hermosa, Tabasco, and Chiapas. Therefore, they call on the corresponding authorities, as well as Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge Mario Garcia Laguardia to conduct investigations into the outrages committed against the illegal aliens in Mexico.
