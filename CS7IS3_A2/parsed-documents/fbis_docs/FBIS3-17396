In addition, according to the head of the presidential administration, recognizing the bilateral accord between the federal authorities and Tatarstan as a general basis was yet another condition for starting talks between Russia and Chechnya. Instead, the Chechen side put forward its own version of the treaty, Filatov stated. At that point the meeting was suspended. The talks can be resumed only if the above conditions are accepted, the head of presidential administration stressed. Also, Filatov noted that the Chechen side had proposed to hold a meeting between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev. The meeting would be premature until fundamental issues are solved, he believes.
