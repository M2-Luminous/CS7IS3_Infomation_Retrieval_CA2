FBIS4-467 "drafr070_c_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-070 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA IFP Central Committee Issues Resolutions IFP Central Committee Issues Resolutions MB1004060594 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1950 GMT 9 Apr 94 MB1004060594 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Statement issued by Office of the Chief Minister of kwaZulu on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 9 April] [Text] Resolution 1 We the members of the Central Committee of the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] re-state our unqualified commitment to seek an all- inclusive solution for the present national crisis. We further 1. Fully support the international mediation effort aimed at resolving outstanding issues so that a solution to the national crisis can be found prior to the holding of any election. 2. Re-state that the purpose of international mediation must be to seek a constitutional settlement on the basis of the outstanding constitutional issues identified in the respective IFP and ANC terms of reference and on the resolution of the issues related to the claims and demands of His Majesty the king of the Zulu nation. 3. Re-state that the above said constitutional compromise must be translated into amendments to the 1993 constitution so that it can form the basis for a broader political settlement and reconciliation to take place before elections. 4. Re-state that the purpose of international mediation and of the constitutional settlement is to enable the Inkatha Freedom Party to rejoin the electoral process on an equal footing with all other political parties. 5. Re-state that the election date of April 27 is to be postponed so as to offer an opportunity for international mediation to bring about the results we all hope for. 6. State the willingness of the IFP to resolve by means of international mediation any outstanding differences between the terms of reference of the IFP and the ANC. 7. Re-state that international mediation is not and shall not become international arbitration and that the role and function of the international mediators is to facilitate the process of negotiations between the IFP and its counterparts with respect to the issues which divide us. 8. Re-state that the purpose of international mediation is not to determine who is right and who is wrong, nor is it to assess the value of the 1993 constitution against any abstract constitutional model. The purpose of mediation is to acknowledge the objective differences between the requirements of the IFP for the establishment of a federal and pluralistic system of government and the provisions of the 1993 constitution, as amended, with a view to seeking a fair and just point of settlement and reconciliation, which the IFP has submitted to be provided by its compromise proposals contained in the December 19, 1993 yellow paper. Resolution 2 The Central Committee of the Inkatha Freedom Party notes with approval that the leadership of the African National Congress has at long last met with His Majesty the king of the Zulu nation. It applauds the statesmanlike manner in which His Majesty set out the question of sovereignty of the Kingdom of kwaZulu. The Central Committee wishes to place on record that it was saddened by the proposals made by the ANC in its so-called "offer" made to His Majesty the king. The document displays a great deal of ignorance and some aspects are even colonial in character. We therefore: 1. Applaud the fact that the leadership of the ANC has at last met with His Majesty the king of the Zulu nation. 2. Formally note that the so-called "offer" to His Majesty the king was clearly drafted by people unfamiliar with African customs and protocol and will thus give offence to the Zulu people. It is wittingly or unwittingly prescriptive in character and typical of centralised thinking. 3. State that any proposals relating to His Majesty the king or to the Kingdom of kwaZulu must be based on an acceptance of the principle of sovereignty and self-determination of the Zulu nation. The proposals of the ANC are in breach of these principles. Resolution 3 The Central Committee of Inkatha Freedom Party has received with satisfaction the report by the President Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the historic summit with his Majesty King Zwelithini Goodwill Ka Bhekuzulu, Dr Nelson Mandela, president of the ANC and State President FW de Klerk, held at Skukuza camp at the Kruger National Park on April 8, 1994. The Central Committee notes that presentations and proposals were made by the various parties. Particular attention needs to be drawn to the concerns expressed by His Majesty the king as well as to the detailed proposals made by the president of the IFP whose aim was to facilitate an all-inclusive political settlement that would enable the IFP to join the electoral process. The Central Committee regrets that the summit was not immediately productive but nevertheless endorses the decision to press ahead by means of a task group charged with producing a package of proposals vis-a-vis His Majesty the king and constitutional issues that have to be placed before the respective leaders of the summit by Thursday 14 April 1994. The Central Committee supports a second summit to be held towards the end of next week to take final decisions. Resolution 4 We the members of the Central Committee of the Inkatha Freedom Party place on record our total opposition to the state of emergency imposed on kwaZulu-Natal to achieve party-political gains for the ANC/SACP [South African Communist Party]/NP [National Party] alliance at the deliberate expense of the kwaZulu government and the people of kwaZulu-Natal. This construct of the ANC/SACP-dominated TEC [Transitional Executive Council] amounts to an invasion of this region and will therefore be resisted by all citizens who will democratically reject this assault on their basic and lawful rights. After the revolutionary coup in Bophuthatswana, the politically motivated imposition of a state of emergency in kwaZulu-Natal is another stage in the breakdown of legality in South Africa to silence any dissent and political opposition to the ANC/SACP strategy to seize power at whatever cost. We call for the immediate lifting of the state of emergency as necessary and essential for the continuation of negotiations seeking a peaceful resolution of the present national crisis and the holding of free and fair elections. We reject the notion of electoral processes and negotiations being conducted in the shadow of armoured vehicles and under the intimidation of armed forces which are no longer required to respect basic human rights. The freedom of the people of kwaZulu-Natal cannot be subjugated with iron fist measures. History will defeat those who engage in totalitarian follies equal to those perpetuated during the darkest years of apartheid. Resolution 5 The Central Committee of the Inkatha Freedom Party notes with dismay the growing partisan character of the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] as reflected in the utterances of its chairman and vice- chairman. The comments of some officials of a statutory body charged with quasi judicial functions have been loud and improper. Both those wishing to participate and those wishing not to participate in the elections are citizens entitled to equal fundamental human rights. It is unedifying for those holding public office to hurl gratuitous insults at citizens of the country. We call upon officials of the I.E.C to act with decorum and to desist from making partisan comments. Resolution 6 We the members of the Central Committee of Inkatha Freedom Party add our voice to the many millions of South Africans who were equally appalled by the cold-blooded slaughter of Zulu citizens peacefully marching in support of their king in Johannesburg. We call for all witnesses to the massacre of these people outside Shell House, in front of the ANC's PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] headquarters and at the Library Gardens to come forward and testify in the best interests of justice and democracy. That there was publicly observed evidence of killer snipers firing from buildings occupied by the ANC and that police investigations in this regard were blatantly and deliberately thwarted is nothing short of a national disgrace. We demand: 1. That the commissioner of police immediately provides the people of South Africa with a precise explanation as to why a proper investigation was not conducted inside both Shell House and the ANC's PWV headquarters as a priority. 2. We demand a report on the current status of the enquiry into the murders. There appears to have been a conspiracy of silence drawn over the public assassination of these men and women and the apparent lack of the ability of the relevant authorities to arrest any perpetrators is an outrage. The Central Committee of the IFP salutes these sons and daughters of kwaZulu, and it grieves for them, their families and their loved ones. We are determined that their deaths will not be allowed to be forgotten and we will annually commemorate the anniversary of their brutal slaying in the Shell House massacre. Resolution 7 We the members of the Central Committee of the Inkatha Freedom Party are alarmed to hear that it is intended to move members of Umkhonto weSizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] operating within the National Peacekeeping Force into the East Rand next week. Members and supporters of the IFP are adamantly opposed to the deployment of this non-inclusive, non-proven and highly controver- sial force into the area. They warn of grave consequences given the already notorious conduct of some of its leaders and ordinary members and fear for their lives. To choose the East Rand for the first placement of this fledgling force, given the long history of death and destruction in the area, is an irresponsible act of extreme provocation. Resolution 8 We the members of the Central Committee of the Inkatha Freedom Party yet again mourn a much loved son of our party, Mr Jeff Sibiya, who was brutally slain yesterday in the East Rand. Mr Sibiya who was a youth leader, publicity spokesperson and peace committee member and monitor was felled by SADF [South African Defense Force] bullets, when according to numerous witnesses, he was attempting to mediate and while wearing his peace monitor jacket and holding a torch. The IFP has already called for an immediate enquiry into his tragic and unnecessary death and he joins many other IFP leaders, who were active in peace committees, who have been killed throughout the country. Our deepest condolences go to his family and to all his many friends and colleagues who will remember Mr Jeff Sibiya's ability to always smile in the face of adversity as he sought peaceful solutions amidst the horrors of living the life of a hostel dweller in the East Rand.
