The spokesman of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] would like to totally reject this vicious propaganda claim by puppet Hun Sen and other leading Vietnamese communist puppets. What is the reason for this fabrication by the Vietnamese communist puppets in Phnom Penh? 1. It is to scare those who do not know the truth, and it is aimed at undermining the king's national reconciliation effort. 2. It is to boost the morale of their soldiers who are badly dispirited, combat weary, and mutinous against their commanders everywhere. 3. It is to deceive others in their show of hollow force against the masses, the students, the teachers, and other residents in Phnom Penh who are revolting against the Vietnamese communist regime and the two-headed, three-eyed administration both in Phnom Penh and the provinces; and so on. As a matter of fact, however, the masses and the people have seen through that lie. One thing that everybody admits as true is that the Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and their alliance have been attacking the people and Democratic Kampuchea. They have been attacking us all the time, both on the battlefield and in their psychological propaganda activities. 1. More than 200,000 Vietnamese communists attacked Democratic Kampuchea and the Cambodian people for 13 years. 2. After the signing of the Paris agreement, the alliance both inside and outside the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia [UNTAC] joined hands with the Vietnamese communists and their puppets in attacking Democratic Kampuchea. 3. Immediately after the formation of the provisional two-headed government in July 1993, the Vietnamese communists, the alliance, and their puppets launched attacks against Democratic Kampuchea and the people, particularly at Phnum Chhat and in Stoung. And after the adoption of the Constitution and formation of the so-called legal two-headed government, they again have begun attacking Democratic Kampuchea and the people. Although the king entreats: Children, you should be reconciled with one another; the people say: Let us be reconciled; and the world community urges: Cambodians, be reconciled; but the Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and their alliance keep shouting: Fight! Fight! Fight! The truth is that hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese communists have been attacking and slaughtering the Cambodian people and Democratic Kampuchea for the past 13, 14, or 15 years; the Vietnamese communist puppets have been serving the Vietnamese communists for the past 13, 14, or 15 years; and UNTAC came in to help them for another 18 months. The Cambodian nation and people, like the world people at large, have seen and heard about the defeats of these warmongers bent against peace and national reconciliation. Most are of the opinion that the more they struggle and writhe, the firmer and tighter they become fastened. The ones who are holding onto the noose around their necks are not Democratioc Kampuchea nor the Khmer Rouge; it is the Cambodian people, the students, the teachers, and the soldiers who are opposed to the aggressor Vietnamese communist regime and are jointly supportive of the king's national reconciliation policy.
