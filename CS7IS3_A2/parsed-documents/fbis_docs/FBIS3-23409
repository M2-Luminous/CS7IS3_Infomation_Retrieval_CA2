This prompted the army command to take basic measures and to deploy units in this party's centers that were used for planning these bombings. Visitors of President Ilyas al-Hirawi, citing him, told our radio that there were four detainees in the bombing of the Sayyidat al- Najat church, and that two others managed to flee to the occupied border strip. THE NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY, quoting concerned parties, said that the results of the investigations into the bombing will be made public next week at a meeting at Justice Minister Bahij Tabbarah's office.
