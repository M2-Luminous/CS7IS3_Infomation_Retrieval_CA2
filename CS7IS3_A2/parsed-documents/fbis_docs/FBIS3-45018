These changes will exert far-reaching influence on future world economic growth. The recovery of the Western economies was still weak this year. After experiencing a "soft recovery" for two and a half years, GDP growth topped 3 percent in the second half of this year and annual growth will be around 2.8 percent. And yet, due to many chronic afflictions, the U.S. economy is still troubled by serious financial and foreign trade deficits. After dropping for three consecutive years, the EC economy is likely to register negative growth of 0.5 percent this year; with the number of unemployed at 18 million, there have been frequent strikes in various countries. The Japanese economy is still in the doldrums and Japan will register its first zero growth since World War II. Some headway has been made in creating private enterprises in the CIS countries, but economic chaos has not been brought under control. Industrial output will drop by 16 percent this year, the inflation rate stands at 2,000 percent, and the people's living standards are continuing to drop. The economic situation in East European countries is different, with Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary scoring some achievements in their change toward a market economy and their industrial production tending to stabilize or pick up. Average economic growth in the developing countries was about 5.6 percent but there were considerable differences among different countries. In Latin America, most countries' economies have improved for three consecutive years, their gross output value has grown by about 3 percent, and they have improved their ability to absorb foreign capital. In Africa, the annual economic growth rate is about 1.6 percent, lagging far behind its 3-percent population growth. The Asian economy is still upbeat, with economic growth standing at about 7 percent. Economic growth in East Asia will reach 8 percent, ranking first in terms of world economic growth for several years running. East Asia is after all regarded as the area with the most dynamic economic growth in the world. The tide of economic reform is sweeping practically all countries and regions in the east, west, north, and south. All countries, developed or developing, are striving for development through change. Soon after taking office, Clinton put forward a whole set of programs for reforming and rejuvenating the American economy. EC countries are focusing on changes in four aspects, i.e. increasing employment, reforming their welfare systems, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, and accelerating the shift from scientific research to production. Japan is focussing on reforming its monetary system, strengthening basic scientific research, and readjusting existing employment and operational mechanisms, as well as expanding internal demand and gradually opening up the domestic market. The CIS and East European countries are expediting the transformation of their economies. A number of new emerging industrialized countries and regions, which are rising suddenly in East Asia, are encouraging large numbers of developing countries to explore modes suited to their economic development. The trends toward regional economic blocs and world economic integration are developing further, with economic competition and mergers going hand in hand. Early this year, a big market of 12 EC countries began to operate. Following the final approval of the Maastricht Treaty after many twists and turns, the construction of a European Alliance has started. The European Economic Area pact will also come into effect in January 1994 and the process of European integration is still developing in accordance with the idea of three "concentric circles." The United States, Canada, and Mexico have approved the North American Free Trade Agreement in Congress. [as published] Some time ago, a Seattle meeting of the leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization, which attracted widespread attention in the international community, put forward the idea of open regional economic and trade cooperation. The sustained, high-speed development and sudden rise of the Asian economy, especially the East Asian economy, has further enhanced the region's economic status. The rate of Asia's economic development this year is about three times that of world economic development. Economic regional alliances, subregional alliances, and other forms of development in the Asian region are emerging one after another. In the face of such a uniquely good economic situation in East Asia, the U.S. Government has openly indicated, "looking forward into the 21st century, no other region is more important to the prosperity and stability of the United States than the Pacific rim region." The world's finances are still weak. It is increasingly difficult for the old world and regional monetary coordination mechanisms to play their roles. The crisis in the European currency system and the great appreciation of the Japanese yen, which have come one after another this year, indicate a drastic increase in the volatility of international finance. To stimulate economic recovery, the United States has reduced its short-term interest rates to a record low. Japan has basically followed the trend in U.S. interest rates. To control inflation and maintain the dominant role of the Deutsch Mark among European currencies, Germany has kept its high interest rates unchanged for a long time. Monetary turmoil has also found expression in violent fluctuations of stock markets. Since the bursting of Japan's "bubble economy," the Nikkei Index has dropped continuously and so have stock markets in Germany and France. [sentence as published] State intervention has increased and economic diplomacy is the order of the day. With the general slump of the Western economy, there is turmoil in society. This has directly affected the position of the ruling parties, leading to changes in some governments. Consequently, developed countries have extensively increased macroeconomic regulation and control and formulated a series of measures and plans to stimulate and develop the economy. They have further enhanced the status of economic security in international relations and tried hard to gain a favorable position in the midst of fierce international competition. State intervention has also involved credits, investment, foreign aid, trade, and even private investment. These countries have kept exchange rates and technological transfers under stricter control. The world economy will still face many difficulties next year but favorable factors will also increase. The overall situation is expected to be better than this year.
