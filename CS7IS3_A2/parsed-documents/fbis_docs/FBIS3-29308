Since the point at issue lies in the controversy over the basic problem on introduction of numerical targets, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] has responded coolly to the breakdown, saying: "It was somehow predictable." MITI intends to deal with U.S. pressure on Japan, which is expected to intensify in the future, by frequently resorting to the method of enlisting cooperation of auto and auto parts makers to increase purchases of U.S.-made products (known as the corporation approach). However, prospects for the framework talks still remain utterly unknown. Even if the talks should be resumed, it would be difficult to find a way out unless our two nations should come to share a common understanding of the objective criteria. Thus, discussions may have to be resumed from the starting point when the decision was made to set up the framework talks last July. In analyzing the talks, a senior MITI official said: "The yen's sharp appreciation is a menace to us but we do not think that the `verbal intervention' will last long. It will also be difficult for the United States to take unilateral sanctions based on laws such as the U.S. Trade Act." His comments indicate that since mutual cooperation in the industrial area has deepened and since sanctions will affect Japan in only a few sectors, such sanctions may not bring about serious damage. If the United States should invoke its Trade Act and take unilateral sanctions, such as raising import tariffs on semiconductors, American users will be forced to use expensive Japanese products because higher costs will result in higher prices. Thus, MITI argues that in the long run, it will be American consumers who will suffer disadvantages. Meanwhile, the two countries had the hardest time at the recent talks on autos and auto parts. And concerning these talks, MITI indicated its confidence, and said: "Cooperation between the private sectors of our two countries will further deepen regardless of the future development in the framework talks." A source at the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association [JAMA] also said: "We will continue to promote bilateral cooperation in the industrial area." In this way, JAMA shows its intention to promote the corporation approach, which MITI advocated at the recent talks, so as to show the United States how effective it is. However, the corporation approach gives no guarantee of an increase in the amount of procurement and it will take a long time to produce any results. In this connection, it is hard to expect that with the approach of the by-election this fall, the Clinton administration will tolerate the trade imbalance in the auto sector, which amounted to as huge as approximately 2.45 trillion yen (in 1993). "Numerical targets will not be accepted because it will lead to managed trade." This is a fair argument for Japan to claim. However, in view of the fact that the trade surplus has remained unreduced, it will be difficult to win U.S. understanding. Since the numerical targets issue has become something like a debate on philosophical problems, rough sailing can be expected at future talks. Therefore, for the time being, the private sector will be asked to try to achieve the "invisible numerical target" by resorting to the corporation approach to steadily increase the purchase of U.S.-made products.
