To make matters worse, North Korean criticisms against South Korean President Kim Yong-sam and Kim's strong reactions against them have collided, resulting in an "emotional" tit-for-tat. "Reneging on its promise not to slander or vilify each other (in the inter-Korean basic agreement), North Korea extended its time for anti-South Korean propaganda to 13 hours from 10 hours a day," Kim was quoted as telling military leaders in a luncheon meeting at Chongwadae [presidential offices] Tuesday. He further criticized the North for remaining the same as it was 50 years ago in failing to keep promises, citing that the North Korean continued its nuclear weapons development program secretly even after it agreed to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. The fresh recrimination between the two Koreas can be seen most clearly at the working-level contact on exchanging envoys at the truce village of Panmunjom March 19. In front of the North Korean delegates at the inter-Korean talks, chief South Korean delegate Song Yong-tae read aloud a "bill of indictment" issued by the North Korean Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, a body in charge of South Korean affairs. In the indictment dated Feb. 25, Pyongyang harshly lashed out at President Kim Yong-sam and called on the South Korean people to wage decisive battles against the government to overthrow it. To the North Korean delegates, all of whom are associated with the committee, Song strongly demanded that the North withdraw the indictment and apologize in order to engage in further dialogue. "If the contents of the indictment were true, wouldn't it be hypocrisy for you to hold a talk with our side here and now?" Song was quoted as saying. Song's vigorous protest was in response to the North's renewed demand of the four preconditions it had set for the envoy exchange. The North had backed down over the preconditions at the sixth contact March 12. Such a turnaround on the part of the South was mainly caused by the North's repeated and escalating criticisms against the Seoul government, especially President Kim Yong-sam, analysts say. With the exception of the first 100 days after Kim took office late February 1993, North Korea has not ceased to slander the South's Chief Executive. Regardless of these vilification, President Kim decided to try to improve inter-Korean relations by proposing a summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Il-song early this year, but met with more high-blown slander, which billed his offer "the whining of a hooligan caught in a trap." The North's continued mudslinging against the South was reported to have something to do with the President's complete about-face on North Korean policy from appeasement to hardline. According to a report compiled by the National Unification Board (NUB), the North's number of slander against the President amounted to 1,000 during the past year. "Recently, it has doubled, to eight to ten times on a daily basis," Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae said. North Korea's verbal attacks against the southern leader are centered upon Kim's personality, his policies and remarks regarding the North. In extreme cases the North called President Kim Yong-sam a "political whore," "civilian fascist wearing business suit," and "first-class poodle of Japan and the United States," to name a few. That is why the South Korean chief delegate demanded that the North immediately stop slandering the President, during the eighth contact at Panmunjom March 19, where the North ruptured the talks by walking out of the meeting. The North's slander against the South Korean President are due to the country's great worry over the Seoul-Washington joint strategy in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue, the NUB report analyzed. The North Korean leadership must have reasoned that the close cooperation between South Korea and the United States would be a great stumbling block to the future negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang in resolving the nuclear issue. Other reasons included the North's bid to maintain anti-South Korean hard-line sentiment among the North Koreans to calm discontent over its economic difficulty, and to weaken the President's popular support and instigate antigovernment struggles in the South, the NUB report analyzed. However, many experts on North Korean affairs advised people not to be bothered with North Korean demagoguery, which stresses rhetoric. The government's North Korean policies should not be adversely affected by it they said. (LMH)
