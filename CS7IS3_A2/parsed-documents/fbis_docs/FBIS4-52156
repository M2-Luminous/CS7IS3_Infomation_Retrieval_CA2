After he replaced Nagano with Hiroshi Nakai of the Democratic Socialist Party, Hata told reporters, "As a matter of fact, I am responsible (for his resignation) as the person who appointed him (as justice minister)." However, he added that he would like to show his responsibility by his own actions and efforts in preventing a war. Opposition parties are reportedly ready to question his responsibility over Nagano's remarks at Diet deliberations which start Monday. Hata said he anticipated such Diet deliberations on his responsibility, but added, "It is not bad to discuss these matters." The premier said it is not fruitless if Diet deliberations will help unify a historic view of the Japanese people. The prime minister also said he expects tough Diet going because his cabinet started as a minority government. He cited an early Diet passage of the government-proposed 1994 draft budget as the government's responsibility in the international community, considering Japan's current status in the world.
