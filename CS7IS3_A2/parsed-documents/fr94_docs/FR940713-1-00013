FR940713-1-00013 FR940713-1-00001 Mechanical process modifications have also been studied. Good effects in reducing bacterial levels on carcasses have been obtained when conventional scald and chilling systems have been replaced with countercurrent scald and chilling systems. In countercurrent systems, carcasses exit from the system where the water is the cleanest. 14 In 1991, the industry conducted a major study that showed that a combination countercurrent scald system, post-scald rinse, and chlorination at several control points on the evisceration line effectively reduced the number of spoilage and pathogenic organisms on carcass surfaces. 15 14 ``Effects of countercurrent scalding and postscald spray on the bacteriologic profile of raw chicken carcasses.'' 1992.

Washing the carcass more often during the slaughter and dressing operation has been shown to reduce the levels of bacteria on carcass surfaces. Researchers theorize that spray washing at critical points during the process creates a water film between the bacteria and the carcass surface which prevents bacteria from attaching to carcass surfaces. Simply washing carcasses with hot water has also been shown to be effective in reducing the levels of bacteria on carcass surfaces. 16 16 ``Salmonella Savvy.'' R. Mulder. 1987. Poultry Processing.

FSIS is studying the use of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) concept in official establishments as an effective means of improving the process and reducing bacterial loads on carcasses. Using HACCP in poultry inspection was proposed by the National Academy of Science in a 1985 study, ``Meat and Poultry Inspection: The Scientific Basis of the Nation's Program.'' 17 The first step in developing an effective HACCP plan is to define the hazards. Microbiological hazards are defined as ``the unacceptable survival by microorganisms of concern to safety or spoilage and/or the unacceptable production or persistence in foods of products of microbial metabolism.'' After hazards are identified, critical control points are established. The critical control point describes the location or points in the process which, if not correctly controlled, could lead to contamination with unacceptable growth. 18 17 This document is available for review at the Hearing Clerk's Office, Washington, DC. 18 ``The Use of HACCP in the Production of Meat and Poultry Products.''

The use of an antimicrobial treatment on raw poultry carcasses would not eliminate the need for continued careful handling of raw poultry products, but would reduce the levels of bacteria that may be present. Establishments have several options to use as effective treatments in reducing bacterial contamination on carcass surfaces. Some treatments will require further development as indicated. Finding practical ways to reduce bacterial contamination on raw poultry products will continue to be a top priority in the agency. Anticipated Improvements Inspectors and veterinarians would be free to concentrate their attention on disease problems, on more intensive inspection of various on-line and off-line plant operations and on microbial controls. The Agency could more effectively utilize its inspection resources to maintain bird-by-bird inspection at this time, particularly for pathology and disease conditions, while enhancing and increasing its use of a comprehensive program of sampling and quality assurance. This proposal would also allow the Agency to begin to lay the groundwork necessary for further training of personnel to perform monitoring and prevention activities needed to implement the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points System in the future. The poultry enhancement initiatives included in this proposal are intended to improve the current inspection system and not be a substitute for inspection. A comparison of the current and proposed systems is summarized in Table 2.
