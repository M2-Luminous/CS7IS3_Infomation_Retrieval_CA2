FR940303-0-00030 FR940303-0-00010 Comments received were very positive. Accordingly, the regulations adopt the provisions of the notice of proposed rulemaking, with only minor changes. In response to a comment, the words ``or training'' are added immediately after the word ``study'' in §1.6851&hyph;2(a)(2)(ii) (A) ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) to clarify that the regulations apply to payments incident to training as well as study. In addition, a commentator suggested that the exemption should apply to amounts, such as travel allowances, that may be received by students or trainees when not physically present in the United States. These regulations clarify that such amounts are covered by the exemption as well, assuming that the other requirements of the regulations have been met. The final regulations also provide that the exemption covers amounts received that are exempt from United States taxation under section 871(i)(2)(A), relating to certain interest on deposits. Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is Thomas L. Ralph of the Office of Associate Chief Counsel (International), within the Office of Chief Counsel, IRS. Other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development. List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 1 Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
