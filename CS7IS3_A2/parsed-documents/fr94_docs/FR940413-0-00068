SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Many institutions of higher education, student financial aid applicants, and recipients have been adversely affected by the earthquake in California. The President signed the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;211) on February 12, 1994. The Act authorizes the Secretary to reallocate any excess funds under the Federal Perkins Loan and the FWS programs from the 1993&hyph;94 award year to assist individuals who suffered financial harm as a result of the California earthquake of January 1994. The Secretary has the authority to reallocate these funds only to institutions for use in the 1994&hyph;95 award year. Institutions will be informed of the application procedures for obtaining reallocated funds to assist California earthquake victims in a letter issued by the Department to financial aid administrators. The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1994, however, does not expressly authorize the reallocation of funds returned under the FSEOG Program. The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), in section 413D permits the Secretary, in accordance with regulations, to reallocate excess FSEOG funds returned by an institution to other institutions. Under current FSEOG regulations (34 CFR 676.4), the Secretary reallocates funds on a pro rata basis, i.e., the amount of an institution's fair-share shortfall as a percentage of the fair-share shortfalls of all participating institutions with an unmet FSEOG request. The Secretary has decided to promulgate standards to allow excess funds under the FSEOG Program from the 1993&hyph;94 award year to be reallocated during the 1994&hyph;95 award year to assist students adversely affected by the California earthquake. The funds will be reallocated to institutions that enroll students adversely affected by the earthquake and submit applications in the format required by the Secretary. If the total funds requested exceed the total funds available, the funds will then be reallocated on a pro rata basis only among these institutions to provide assistance to students whose financial need has increased as a result of the 1994 California earthquake. The Secretary recognizes the severe impact the earthquake has had on institutions and their students located in the designated natural disaster areas. Many institutions and individuals adversely affected by the earthquake are facing immediate problems concerning the disbursement and repayment of student loans.
