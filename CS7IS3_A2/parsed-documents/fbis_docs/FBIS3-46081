On the other hand, we should adopt a rigorous, realistic, and scientific attitude, proceed from reality, and promptly uncover and solve salient problems as we move forward. Attending the commencement ceremonies were 1,964 students from the Central Party School's 21st advanced studies class for cadres at the prefectural and departmental levels, the school's theoretical department, and its branches at the CPC Central Committee's Work Committee for Party Organs, the CPC Central Committee's Work Committee for Government Organs, and military units. After fully affirming the students' academic achievements, Hu Jintao pointed out: The year 1994 is very crucial to our country's future process of reform and development. This year's tasks are heavy and arduous. We must strengthen leadership, consider the overall situation, and mobilize all positive factors to ensure the implementation of various major central policy decisions. He pointed out: A major issue to which the entire party, especially leading cadres at all levels, must attach importance, and which it must endeavor to solve, is how to maintain rapid and good development of the national economy and ensure the smooth implementation of all reform measures while safeguarding political stability. In his speech, Hu Jintao said emphatically: We should strengthen ideological and political work in the course of reform to provide a spiritual driving force and an ideological guarantee of reform, opening up, and the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. He said: Leading cadres at all levels must carry forward the party's fine tradition and work style, go deep among the masses, carry out mass propaganda, and address and solve thorny and intensely discussed problems of common concern to the people. Along with the introduction of major reform measures, we should concentrate on carrying out propaganda and explanatory work and on guiding public opinion in order to dispel people's misgivings, defuse contradictions, and mobilize the broad masses of people to support and participate in reform. We should integrate ideological and political work with the solution of people's practical problems, foster close ties with the masses, listen to their views, understand popular sentiment, show concern for people's sufferings, base our actions on the masses, and strive to tailor our policy decisions and measures to the wishes of the broad masses of the people. Furthermore, we should foster correct ideals, beliefs, and values, and vigorously promote the arduous pioneering spirit of the new period, in all segments of society, especially among the younger generation. Hu Jintao also expressed his views on the questions of thoroughly studying and mastering Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; correctly handling the relationship between reform, development, and stability; and earnestly strengthening and improving party building. In closing, he expressed the hope that the students would take their group studies in the Central Party School as a new starting point from which to improve their on-the-job studies, form the good habit of studying hard and thinking deeply, apply constantly what they have learned to the practice of reform and modernization, conduct investigations and studies, sum up their experiences and improve their work, and enhance their capacity for studying new circumstances and solving new problems. Wang Jialiu, executive vice president of the Central Party School, chaired the commencement ceremonies. Attending the ceremonies were Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and Secretariat, and responsible individuals from relevant departments such as Zhao Zongnai, Liu Yunshan, Zheng Keyang, Chen Fujin, Lu Shiche, Wang Yiping, Su Xing, Xing Bensi, and Liu Shengyu.
