Mr. Adigun, who was speaking in Cotonou, said that the meeting had become imperative in view of the recent devaluation of the CFA franc and other geopolitical changes in the subregion. The Nigerian envoy, who drew an analogy between the EEC and ECOWAS, pointed out that the imminent emergence of majority rule in South Africa, has made the EEC shift its focus toward that country. He also spoke of the need for ECOWAS member countries to highlight the things that were of mutual benefit to them. Meanwhile, the transborder commercial activities between Nigeria and Benin Republic have reduced substantially following the January 12 devaluation of the CFA franc. A survey shows that the usual traffic congestion at the border town of Seme has dropped. The secondhand goods market across the border at Seme has been virtually empty [words indistinct].
