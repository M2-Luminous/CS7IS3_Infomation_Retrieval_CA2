The joint staff is to speed up the solving of the remaining problems in relations between the Moslem and Bosnian Croat armies, he added. The setting up of a joint command is envisaged under the Vienna accords which put the finishing touches to the Washington agreement signed by Bosnia's Moslems and Croats in March under strong U.S. pressure. Two days ago, Bosnian Croat Army representatives turned down an offer of separation along the lines of contact with Moslem formations in the upper flow of the Vrbas in central Bosnia, on the grounds that it was much too early for such a move to be made. The lack of trust between the local commanders is not surprising in view of the fact that the memory is still green of bitter battles fought by the two sides in central Bosnia for a year, until they were curbed by the Washington agreement.
