FR941104-1-00046 FR941104-1-00009 The January 27, 1994, Federal Register notice gave current information about the Atlantic bluefin tuna including management by the International Commission on the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), recent stock assessments for the western and eastern stocks, recent estimates of fishing mortality rates, reductions in harvest quotas recommended at the 1993 Regular Meeting of ICCAT for the years 1994 and 1995, and plans for the implementation of a Bluefin Statistical Document to be required for the import of bluefin tuna by ICCAT countries. The next Regular Meeting of ICCAT will be held in December 1994. It was noted in the FR notice that according to the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics of ICCAT (SCRS) and NMFS scientists there is uncertainty about an appropriate boundary between the western and eastern populations of bluefin tuna. At the request of the Department of Commerce, the National Academy of Sciences has conducted an independent review on the ``Scientific Basis of Management of the Fisheries for Atlantic Bluefin Tuna,'' which evaluated information on stock structure as well as recent population assessments. The report was presented to the Department of Commerce on August 31, 1994. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has named a team of experts to evaluate the findings and make recommendations about policy and management issues. Within the comment period, the Service received a total of 83 comments on the possible CITES listing of this species from the general public, commercial and recreational fishers and fishing organizations, conservation organizations, and foreign governments. Of these, 73 supported a listing of the Atlantic bluefin tuna in Appendix II, 8 opposed any listing under CITES, and 2 did not specifically oppose or support a listing. (Comments from the Russian Government were received after the comment period closed.) The Executive Secretary of ICCAT conveyed the comments of the Chairman of ICCAT. While not commenting on the appropriateness of a CITES listing, the Chairman drew attention to steps that ICCAT had recently taken to improve the conservation of Atlantic bluefin tuna, including: 1. Drastically reducing the allowable catch for western Atlantic bluefin tuna; 2. Introducing an effective measure for monitoring international trade through the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document Program; 3. Undertaking or developing other methods to improve data collection; 4. Encouraging expansion of research and analysis with a goal of having the basis to develop a program at the Commission meeting in 1995 aimed at achieving a 50 percent increase from current levels in the spawning stock biomass of the western stock by the year 2008; and 5. Adopting an amendment to ICCAT that would allow the European Union to be a Contracting Party to ICCAT and hence expand the number of countries adhering to the ICCAT recommendations. Commenters opposed to an Appendix II listing for Atlantic bluefin tuna (including the Global Guardian Trust, the National Fisheries Institute, Inc., and the International Coalition of Fisheries Associations) generally believed that measures recommended by ICCAT are being implemented according to schedule, and that the steps taken by ICCAT represent significant progress in improving reporting requirements and management measures. Therefore, they felt that it is not necessary or appropriate to consider a CITES listing until the effectiveness of these steps can be evaluated. The Japan Fisheries Association contended that international organizations for the management of living resources, such as ICCAT, are designed to conserve and manage resources that are at higher stock levels than are resources that would be listed under CITES, and that species listed under CITES are being protected from possible ``extinction.'' Therefore, they believe that listing species such as the Atlantic bluefin tuna under CITES would require a digression from the objectives of CITES, and would also go against ``the principle of sustainable development.'' The Federation of Japan Tuna Fisheries Cooperative Associations felt that a CITES listing of Atlantic bluefin tuna would not ensure its conservation because CITES does not have authority to limit harvest. They suggested that no conclusions should be drawn concerning the status of the species until a peer review of information about the existence of two stocks of Atlantic bluefin tuna is completed. The Federation also contends that the species is not currently threatened with extinction, nor is it likely to become so, therefore it does not meet criteria for listing under CITES. The East Coast Tuna Association maintained that recent assessments and future projections concerning the western stock of Atlantic bluefin tuna are ``extraordinarily controversial,'' to the extent that the NMFS has requested the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a peer review of data and information supporting these assessments as well as the two-stock hypothesis. They believed that a CITES listing would be redundant and would likely penalize only those fishermen who now participate in the ICCAT program. The FAJ felt that it is essential that any CITES listing be based on scientific evidence that there is a threat of extinction to a species and that trade control is necessary for the protection of the species. They contended that a species should not be listed only for the purpose of collecting trade data, especially if an international organization is already collecting such data. They believed that an Appendix II listing of Atlantic bluefin tuna would impose undue burdens on the enforcement capabilities of many countries. They also state that protection of wildlife cannot be accomplished through regulation of trade alone, but harvesting should be regulated, and that CITES is not capable of harvest regulation. Also, they believed that the interests of range states should be considered based on consultations, and range states have not been contacted. The First Secretary (Fisheries), Embassy of Japan, essentially supported these contentions. As an ICCAT member, the Russian Ministry of Protection of the Environment and Natural Resources felt that ICCAT's regulation of take by annual quota and the Statistical Documentation Program provide strict controls for use of the Atlantic bluefin tuna. They also did not think that the species is threatened with extinction and therefore was not eligible for a CITES listing.
