FR941205-0-00075 FR941205-0-00021 EPA Response: Pursuant to ยง70.4(d)(1), an operating permits program submittal that is not fully approvable must first substantially meet the requirements of part 70 in order to be considered for interim approval. Once a submittal has been deemed to substantially meet the requirements of part 70, the criteria established at ยง70.4(d)(3) are applied as a second test for eligibility for interim approval. On the basis of the five disapproval issues, EPA has determined that Virginia's operating permits program submittal does not substantially meet the requirements of part 70 and, therefore, is not eligible for interim approval. Moreover, the fact that the emergency regulations establishing the permits program have expired sufficiently indicates that the program does not substantially meet the requirements of part 70. Comment: EPA judged the adequacy of the Commonwealth of Virginia's operating permits program prior to official submittal. Specifically, EPA notified the Commonwealth of Virginia that it lacked adequate statutory provisions for standing for judicial review prior to the receipt of its November 12, 1993 program submittal. EPA Response: EPA attempted to alert Virginia to potential impediments to the approval of any operating permits program submitted by the Commonwealth prior to the November 15, 1993 program submittal due date. It was EPA's intention to supply constructive comments to Virginia prior to November 15, 1993 in order to provide the Commonwealth with adequate time to seek any statutory or regulatory revisions as needed. EPA has a well-established policy of providing comments on draft and proposed regulations and programs which will later come before it for formal rulemaking action. Notwithstanding EPA's policy of providing timely comment, the Agency's position on the standing for judicial review issue has been consistent throughout its correspondence with the relevant parties in Virginia and that position has been maintained and reflected in the rulemaking actions undertaken in response to the official submittal of Virginia's operating permits program. Comment: EPA may be applying inconsistent approval standards among the various State and Local jurisdictions seeking approval of operating permits programs to satisfy the requirements of title V of the CAA. The commenter indicated that EPA is not providing a consistent level of review and comment of other States' standing provisions. EPA Response: EPA has applied consistent standards to other states. EPA has not proposed approval for any State operating permits program that does not substantially meet the requirements for standing for judicial review as required by section 502(b)(6) of the Act and 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(x). EPA will evaluate each program separately to determine if it meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 70. Comment: The Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Environmental Quality submitted comments to address the regulatory deficiencies cited in EPA's notice of proposed disapproval and the Technical Support Document accompanying that action. The comments specifically exclude discussion of the standing for judicial review issue. The Department of Environmental Quality details the regulatory modifications it plans to make to the previously adopted regulations for its operating permits program. EPA Response: EPA is encouraged that the Department of Environmental Quality is working to address the regulatory deficiencies of its operating permits program as cited in the proposed disapproval. At such time that EPA receives an official submittal replacing the Commonwealth's November 12, 1993 submittal being considered by this action, the Agency will evaluate the new submittal in an additional rulemaking action. To comment on the adequacy of proposed modifications would not be appropriate in this action. Comment: One commenter provided EPA with letters it had previously submitted to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. The letters discuss the commenter's concerns regarding Virginia's operating permits program. The letters also offer suggested modifications to the program. The commenter suggested that EPA consider these letters when reviewing Virginia's program.
