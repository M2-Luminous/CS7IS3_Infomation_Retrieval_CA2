FR941031-1-00025 FR941031-1-00004 Of the 169 U.S.-registered airplanes affected by the proposed AD, 6 airplanes are owned by the federal government. Of the other 163, one business owns 26 airplanes, two businesses own 9 airplanes each, one business owns 8 airplanes, one business owns 7 airplanes, one business owns 5 airplanes, four businesses own 3 airplanes each, sixteen businesses own 2 airplanes each, and fifty-five businesses own 1 airplane each. Because the FAA has no readily available means of obtaining data on the sizes of these entities, the economic analysis for the proposed AD utilizes the worst case scenario using the lower annualized cost threshold of $4,850 for operators in unscheduled service instead of $69,000 for operators in scheduled service. With this in mind and based on the above ownership distribution, the proposed AD could have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Because of this, the FAA conducted a regulatory flexibility analysis. A copy of this analysis may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and(3) if promulgated, may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The FAA has conducted an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Analysis and has considered alternatives to this proposal that could minimize the impact on small entities. A copy of this analysis may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . After careful consideration, the FAA has determined that the proposed action is the best course to achieve the safety objective of returning the airplane to its original certification level of safety. Alternative actions and views are solicited from interested persons and will be considered by the FAA in the development of the final rule. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing AD 81&hyph;10&hyph;11, Amendment 39&hyph;4112, and adding a new AD to read as follows: De Havilland: Docket No. 91&hyph;CE&hyph;22&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 81&hyph;10&hyph;11, Amendment 39&hyph;4112. Applicability: Models DHC&hyph;6&hyph;1, DHC&hyph;6&hyph;100, DHC&hyph;6&hyph;200, and DHC&hyph;6&hyph;300 airplanes (all serial numbers), certificated in any category, that do not have Modification No. 6/1769 incorporated. Compliance: Required as indicated in the body of the AD, unless already accomplished. To prevent failure of the elevator root rib, which could result in loss of control of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Within the next 50 hours time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this AD, unless already accomplished (compliance with AD 81&hyph;10&hyph;11), inspect the elevator root rib, part number (P/N) C6TE1022, for cracks in accordance with the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS section of de Havilland Service Bulletin (SB) No. 6/399, Revision E, dated May 25, 1984. (1) If any crack is found, prior to further flight, accomplish one of the following: (i) Replace the cracked part with an airworthy part and reinspect thereafter at intervals not to exceed 600 hours TIS until the modification required in paragraph (b) of this AD is incorporated; or (ii) Incorporate Modification 6/1769 in accordance with the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS section of de Havilland SB No. 6/399, Revision E, dated May 25, 1984. Note 1: Modification 6/1769 consists of pulling back the elevator skins, removing the torque tube assembly, replacing the root rib assembly and doubler, replacing the second outboard nose rib, installing a new intercostal, and reinstalling the torque tube assembly and new skin.
