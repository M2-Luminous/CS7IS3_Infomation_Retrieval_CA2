In a pre-departure statement, Sha'th said that he will brief President 'Arafat on the development in the Taba talks between the Palestinians and Israelis. Sha'th added that he will receive from 'Arafat his directives with regard to the coming round of the Palestinian-Israeli talks scheduled to be held on Monday. Speaking about the coming round of talks, Sha'th voiced hope that the Israelis would not pose any obstacles before the negotiations. On the coming summit between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton, slated for tomorrow in Geneva, Dr. Sha'th expressed optimism over such a meeting, adding that it will open the door for Syria's return to the negotiations table. If Israel expressed readiness to fully withdraw from the Golan Heights, this would pave the way for Syria's return to the talks, he said. Sha'th added that there is a Palestinian continuous drive in the peace process pointing out that 'Arafat met yesterday with the ambassadors of the U.S. and Russia in Tunis, the co-sponsors of the Middle East peace march. Sha'th added that he had talks with the Norwegian foreign undersecretary, who stressed his country's support for the Palestinian cause and his readiness to offer any assistance to make the negotiations a success. Sha'th will take part in the meetings of the PLO Executive Committee, due to open in Tunis today.
