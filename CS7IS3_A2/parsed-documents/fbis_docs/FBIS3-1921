The anticorruption campaign must be firmly and more effectively carried out, so as to maintain social stability and guarantee the progress of reforms, opening up and economic growth, said the communique, issued at the end of the six-day session. "The anticorruption drive is long, arduous and urgent and it is necessary to carry out a protracted struggle against corruption and to score successes in different periods," the communique pointed out. While affirming the achievements already made in the anticorruption campaign, the communique noted that negative and corrupt phenomena still persist and in some cases are quite serious. No efforts should be spared in the crackdown on corruption, it urged. The communique said that the decision by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on launching the anticorruption struggle is correct and has guaranteed the smooth progress of the fight against corruption. Marked results have been achieved in the anticorruption campaign since the convening of the second plenary session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) last August, with the dwindling of some corruptive phenomena, the communique said. During the session, 103 members of CCDI carefully studied an important speech made by Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, on renewed efforts against corruption. The speech, which called for the investigation and severe punishment of serious cases, is of great significance in guiding the anticorruption drive in the new situation and is a clear indication of the determination of the CPC to wipe out corruption, the communique said. At the session, which was presided over by CCDI Secretary Wei Jianxing, five new requirements were set for leading officials to maintain clarity and honesty in performing their duties. The communique also called on leading cadres to take a lead in fighting corruption.
