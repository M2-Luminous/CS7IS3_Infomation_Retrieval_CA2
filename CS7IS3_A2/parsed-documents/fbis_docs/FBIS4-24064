The deserted Mulundi village has been transformed into barracks. The adobe houses where the tea plantation workers used to live are now occupied by RPF soldiers, whereas the managers' homes are reserved for the general staff. It is in one of these houses that RPF Chairman Alex Kanyarengwe received us yesterday, just as he learnt about the arrival of the first French troops in Zaire. [Frilet] Do you believe in the sincerity of the French initiative intended to bring humanitarian aid to the civilian victims of the massacres that took place in your country? [Kanyarengwe] France has been present in Rwanda ever since the civil war broke out in October 1990. Right from the first few days, it sent a military contingent to evacuate French nationals from Kigali, saying that it would withdraw its troops as soon as they had carried out their mission. However, it became immediately apparent that Paris did not want the RPF to win. We had to wait for the Americans to intervene -- upholding the implementation of the Arusha peace agreements -- before the French accepted to leave. [Frilet] Some analysts think that France's present initiative is mainly intended to enable it to reestablish itself in a neutral position after its neutrality was called into question because it supported a regime which is responsible for many massacres. [Kanyarengwe] The tragedy we are living through is the result of all of France's dealings and maneuvers aimed at keeping President Habyarimana's ruling party in power. This was a completely dictatorial regime which was repeatedly denounced for having perpetrated massacres and political assassinations. France propped it up by keeping troops and diplomats stationed in the country, as well as by providing considerable funds. It is only natural for France to feel responsible for this tragedy and to try now to prevent the disappearance of the MRND [National Revolutionary Movement for Development] (the former single party), and, above all, prevent international inquiries which might bring to light France's complicity in the actions carried out by those in power. However, these inquiries must be conducted normally and those responsible for the massacres must be brought to trial. Right from the beginning of the reprisals, all the other countries left once they had evacuated their nationals. France stayed on, and it could have appealed to the United Nations not to withdraw the 2,500 Blue Helmets. As an influential member of the Security Council, it could have demanded a stop to the massacres by requesting a strengthening of the UN presence. Furthermore, considering that France continued to maintain military, political, and diplomatic links with the government, it could have asked its "acolytes" to put a stop to the massacres. [Frilet] Therefore, in your view some secret plan lies behind the French humanitarian initiative... [Kanyarengwe] In the French statements, you can always read, behind humanitarian reasons and between the lines, the notion of intervention. President Mitterrand himself suggested as much in his televised statement on the occasion of the closing of the 6 June [D-Day] ceremonies. In this way, they want to link the fighting between the RPF and the government forces to the massacres perpetrated against the civilian population suspected of supporting the RPF. [Frilet] From a military point of view, does a link exist between the imminent vote in the Security Council and the stepping up of your military campaign? [Kanyarengwe] Not in the least. The recent progress made by our troops eastward and southward has nothing to do with this decision. With regard to the battles we are waging for the capital of Kigali, they result from our strategy which is based on conducting an attrition war in the urban centers and a blitzkrieg in the countryside, so as to save as many human lives as possible. [Frilet] If you continue your advance throughout the country's territory, of which you now control two-thirds, would you be prepared to accept the surrender of the government forces? [Kanyarengwe] We would prefer a measure of consensus on their part in order to agree on the means to be used to reconstruct the country. We are prepared to accept the MRND in the spirit of the Arusha peace accords, which constitute a political framework for reconstructing our country, provided that the MRND's members are prepared to be held answerable for their actions. Of course, the MRND's role as defined in the Arusha agreements will have to be reviewed in the light of its responsibility for the tragedy we are living through. This is why we have insisted on an international inquiry being held on the crimes that have been committed. [Frilet] France's former ambassador to Rwanda wishes to come here to present the French initiative. Are you prepared to receive him? [Kanyarengwe] All contacts are interesting. He is scheduled to arrive on Wednesday, and I see no objection to receiving him. [Frilet] What would be the consequences if, as you suggest may happen, France becomes involved in the war in Rwanda? [Kanyarengwe] If France intervenes militarily, the war will change and may become worse. The population, which France says it wants to help, will itself become the victim of this situation. Moreover, the whole region may flare up. Both Zaire and Burundi have the same geographical patterns and the same types of population. The whole region would therefore feel concerned. [Frilet] In Paris, the RPF is considered a Tutsi minority movement, with a 15-percent share of the vote at the most. It is hard to imagine that you will hand over power to the winner in the elections which you are committed to hold once peace has been reestablished. [Kanyarengwe] You Westerners tell us to follow your model of democracy. I thought democracy must be judged from actions and ideas. Democracy is acquired by adhering to a certain type of politics and a social program. We cannot envisage democracy under an ethnic mantle which fosters privileges and exclusion. This, however, was the situation under the government which France supported and is still trying to maintain in power at all costs.
