In accordance with a survey conducted by the Brasilia-based Brazilian Institute of Political Studies (IBEP), 83.2 percent of Brazilian congressmen described as "very important" the role of foreign capital in bringing about the resumption of economic growth. Furthermore, 89.9 percent of deputies support free association between Brazilian and foreign companies, and 92.9 percent of them consider the technology brought in by foreign companies to be good for the country. The IBEP survey polled all 503 deputies and 81 senators. Regarding legal and tax aspects, the survey shows that most congressmen want equal treatment for both national and foreign companies. A total of 49.6 percent of all the congressmen surveyed believe it to be inadvisable to establish a legal discrimination between companies because of the origin of their capital, while 41.6 percent believe such companies should be treated differently. Only 27.2 percent approve of a different tax regime for companies of foreign and Brazilian capital, while 67.2 percent of them disapprove of such discrimination. This trend may be construed as a shift in the average opinion of congressmen. Deputy Augusto Carvalho of the PPS [People's Socialist Party] -- the former Brazilian Communist Party -- in Brasilia is an example of this change. He said: "I changed. The left changed. Congress changed." He added: "We are not against foreign capital, which will create companies and bring technology to the country." In his opinion, Brazilian companies cannot be considered to be sacred. He said: "We are not going to act as protective shields to bad local businessmen in the name of a so-called national industry." The survey also shows that Congress is questioning the monopoly prevailing in the area of telecommunications. To 48 percent of congressmen, the installation of telecommunications infrastructural facilities (telephone lines and exchanges) should be jointly undertaken by the state and by private companies. Only 33.6 percent believe this endeavor should be exclusively entrusted to Brazilian companies.
