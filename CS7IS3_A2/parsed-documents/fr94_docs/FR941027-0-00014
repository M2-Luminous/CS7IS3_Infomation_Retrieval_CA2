FR941027-0-00014 FR941027-0-00006 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION 17 CFR PART 200 [Release No. 34&hyph;34871] Disposition of Business by Seriatim Commission Consideration or by Delegated Authority ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is amending its rules on disposition of Commission business to formalize current practice regarding procedures for seriatim and delegated consideration of business. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: C. Hunter Jones, Office of the General Counsel, (202) 942&hyph;0877, or Anne Sullivan, Office of the General Counsel, (202) 942&hyph;0954. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission is modifying 17 CFR 200.41&hyph;200.42 concerning seriatim consideration of business and actions by individual Commissioners on a delegated basis in order to formalize current practice and clarify that any member of the Commission may schedule a matter for joint deliberation, regardless of the number of Commissioners who have voted to approve it, and that a member of the Commission who is serving as duty officer is authorized to approve a formal order of private investigation. The Commission has determined that these amendments and additions to its procedural rules relate solely to the agency's organization, procedure or practice. Therefore, the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (``APA'') regarding notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunities for public participation, and prior publication 1 are not applicable. Similarly, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 2 which apply only when notice and comment are required by the APA or other laws, are not applicable. 1 5 U.S.C. 553. 2 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. Effects on Competition Section 23(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') 3 requires the Commission, in adopting rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the anti-competitive effects of such rules, if any, and to balance any impact against the regulatory benefits gained in furthering the purposes of the Exchange Act. The Commission has considered the changes adopted in this release in light of the standards cited in section 23(a)(2) and believes that their adoption would not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Exchange Act. 3 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).
