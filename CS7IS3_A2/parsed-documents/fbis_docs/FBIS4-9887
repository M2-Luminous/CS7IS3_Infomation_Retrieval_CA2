Radio Reloj at 1501 GMT on 2 April reports that Jose Luis Arias Munoz, a Spanish communist residing in Switzerland, has made a personal donation of medicines worth $4,000 to the Centro Habana Pediatric and Teaching Hospital.

The general manager of these hotels said that rooms will be enlarged and all bathrooms and furniture replaced or renovated. We have also decided to build a larger kitchen here at the Neptuno to offer full pension service to clients, he said. Together with our Cuban partners, we hope to find, either in Mallorca or in Cuba itself, a discotheque expert because we are interested in establishing a discotheque in the Tripton Hotel.
