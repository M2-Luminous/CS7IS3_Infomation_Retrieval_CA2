Government Lacks Economic Program"] [Text] The 19th session of the Tatarstan Supreme Soviet, which began in Kazan and whose main agenda item is the adoption of the republic's budget for this year, bodes no good for the local government. A crisis of nonpayments, which may be even graver than in other regions, the pressure of the tax burden, and a nearly complete paralysis of oil production -- the main source of budget revenues -- have called into question not only the viability of much-publicized social programs and the possibility of old-style, large-scale assistance to agriculture, but also the prudence of the Tatarstan government's economic policy as a whole. The opposition, including both the nationalists and the federalists, is criticizing the republic's leadership for lacking any reform program whatsoever. Moreover, the highest echelons of the republic's power, which have until recently been considered monolithic, suffered a split the other day. First, the policy pursued by the republic's leaders was challenged by Rafael Khakimov, President Shaymiyev's closest adviser. In an article entitled "A Year of Missed Opportunities" he accused the top authorities of "narcissism," pointing out that "everything is remarkably nice in our young republic. Leaders do not blunder. They sign treaties and agreements that the people fully endorse," whereas in Austria, "Chancellor Franz Vranitzky asked me how far Tatarstan is from Nizhniy Novgorod." In Mr. Khakimov's view, the first reformist steps by the republic's government -- the regulation of prices instead of "shock therapy," thought-out agricultural policy, and social safety nets for specific sectors of the population -- were proclaimed reform proper, which actually marked an end to it. "At the same time," Mr. Khakimov notes, "the Tatarstan government has not explained the essence of the republic's economic development model to the population." What he sees as the main trouble is that "sovereignty has not yet become...a way of life and the government has been hamstrung by `oblast' thinking." Mintimer Shaymiyev was swift to counter the charges, and presently the institution of presidential advisers in Tatarstan has been abolished altogether. The tide of criticism of the republic's economic situation has not subsided, however. Tatarstan Deputy Prime Minister Ravil Muratov said in an interview for INTERFAX: "We are wasting time and missing the chance to complete reform at the minimum costs... We are beginning simply to lag behind certain regions. The government is undertaking costly social programs.. but it does not care very much about finding actual sources of financing them, primarily about the budget. Who will pay taxes? Enterprises indebted to each other, entrepreneurs crushed by a tax burden? Collective and state-owned farms that rely on subsidies, most of them money-losing? We have long watched Russian reform so as to avoid its mistakes. But by doing so we have made those of our own, having failed to work out our concept of economic development..." Those responsible for the "idle time" have not been named yet, but it is clear that the government officials' criticism is directed at Svoboda Square, where the Cabinet of Ministers has its seat, not at the Kazan Kremlin, residence of the Tatarstan president. Given that rumors about Prime Minister Mukhammat Sabirov's resignation have been circulating for a long time now, one may surmise that the question will be discussed at the parliamentary session that began yesterday. So far, questions concerning the treaty and follow-up agreements with the Russian Federation, which were signed in February, and the proposal by Deputy Bayramova, leader of the nationalist "Ittifak" party, on the discussion of human rights violations in the republic, have not been included in the session's agenda. Although there have been no proposals to discuss the government's report on its last year's performance, the deputies will apparently have plenty of opportunities to say aloud everything they think on the subject when discussing the report on the implementation of Tatarstan's 1993 budget. In addition, the session must consider the president's budget message for this year. Under the message, the republic's budget will amount to 9,124,576 million rubles. At the same time it is planned to transfer to the federal budget a total of 847.266 billion.
