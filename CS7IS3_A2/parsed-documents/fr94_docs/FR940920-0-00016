ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is finalizing the approval of a revision to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the Federal Register on January 12, 1994. The revision concerns a rule from the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (SBCAPCD). This approval action will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving this rule is to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The revised rule controls VOC emissions from oil refinery leaks. Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of this revision into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective on October 20, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the rule revision and EPA's evaluation report for the rule are available for public inspection at EPA's Region IX office during normal business hours.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On January 12, 1994 in 59 FR 1698, EPA proposed to approve the following rule into the California SIP: SBCAPCD's Rule 331, Fugitive Emissions Inspection and Maintenance. Rule 331 was adopted by SBCAPCD on December 10, 1991. This rule was submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on June 19, 1992. This rule was submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act. A detailed discussion of the background of the above rule and nonattainment area is provided in the NPRM cited above. EPA has evaluated the above rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA interpretation of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the NPRM cited above. EPA has found that the rule meets the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions and evaluations has been provided in 59 FR 1698 and in the technical support document (TSD) available at EPA's Region IX office (TSD dated June 7, 1993). Response to Public Comments A 30-day public comment period was provided in 59 FR 1698. No formal comments were received. EPA Action EPA is finalizing action to approve the above rule for inclusion into the California SIP. EPA is approving the submittal under section 110(k)(3) as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and part D of the CAA. This approval action will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving this rule is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the CAA. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Regulatory Process This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Under section 307(b) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 21, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review not does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2)).
