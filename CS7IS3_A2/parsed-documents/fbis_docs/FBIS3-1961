According to Huang Ju, mayor of the city, Shanghai plans to export 8.5 billion U.S. dollars-worth of goods this year, an increase of 15.4 percent over last year and exceeding the growth of its gross domestic product. Last year saw the city export 7.34 billion U.S. dollars-worth, keeping the same pace with the expansion of its GDP. "However, Shanghai's leading position in economic development has required it to further develop its foreign trade," the mayor noted. Huang called on foreign trade departments to strive to export at least 8.5 billion U.S. dollars-worth of goods this year and goods valued at 10 billion U.S. dollars next year. To accomplish the objective, the municipal government has decided to adjust its industrial structure and organize enterprise groups while adopting an investment policy to encourage foreign trade departments.
