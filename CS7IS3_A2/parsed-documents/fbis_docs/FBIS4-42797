Recalling that President Rauf Denktas had accepted those agreements reached at the meetings held with UN representatives in Vienna which were within the framework of the confidence-building measures, Ciller continued: The Turkish side agrees to the package but the report creates an obstacle in the way to a just solution to the Cyprus issue. Addressing the True Path Party National Assembly caucus in Ankara, Ciller discussed the Cyprus issue and criticized the UN secretary general's report. Ciller indicated that previous experiences have proved that it is impossible to achieve a solution to the Cyprus issue by coercion and threats. Stating that Turkey supports a just, realistic, and viable Cyprus solution based on the equality of both communities, Ciller stressed that Turkey will continue to support the Turkish Cypriots to the best of its ability.
