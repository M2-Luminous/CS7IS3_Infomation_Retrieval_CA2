It intends to open a plant in the Polish city of Poznan that will turn out an estimated 5,000 cars this year, with a capacity for expansion in the future. Ludvik Kalma, director of the factory in Mlada Boleslav, explained that this is the only way to avoid restrictive tariffs on exporting Czech cars to Poland. Skoda has negotiated unsuccessfully with Polish officials to reduce these duties, which could increase car prices by as much as 41 percent.
