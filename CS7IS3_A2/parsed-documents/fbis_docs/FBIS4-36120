The meeting was attended by members of the political bureaus of the two allied parties; Dr. Ahmad al-Jalabi, chairman of the executive council of the Unified Iraqi National Congress, the INC; and Major General Hasan al-Naqib, member of the INC Presidium Council. During the meeting several important resolutions were issued regarding the withdrawal of the forces of the two parties and the establishment of an operations room in al-Sulaymaniyah including the PUK, KDP, INC, and the Islamic Movement. It is worth noting that this important meeting took place two days after the historic speech delivered by PUK Secretary General Jalal Talabani to establish security and stability in Kurdistan. In this speech, brother Talabani announced an initiative for a unilateral cease-fire and the withdrawal of the PUK forces. At the end of the meeting, Dr. Fu'ad Ma'sum, Sami 'Abd-al-Rahman, and Dr. Ahmad al-Jalabi held a news conference attended by representatives of the media establishments in Kurdistan and foreign correspondents. Answering a question on the position of the Islamic Movement in Kurdistan, Dr. Fu'ad Ma'sum, active member of the PUK Political Bureau, said: It was decided that if the Islamic Movement abides by the cease-fire decision, the two parties will show their readiness to disengage their forces under the supervision of the operations room. If the Islamic Movement persists in its previous positions, it will be held responsible for the events by the two parties--that is, the PUK and KDP. In this case, we in the PUK and the KDP must defend the areas of Kurdistan, and the regional government must also carry out its duty. It should be noted that brother Talabani and Dr. Ahmad al-Jalabi have held a bilateral closed meeting to discuss the situation. Meanwhile, there was wide-scale reaction to brother Talabani's initiative from regional and international circles. [passage omitted]
