In its initial form, CELERG centralized all the conceptional and marketing facilities of the two parent firms. In a recently signed memorandum of understanding, AEROSPATIALE and SNPE have added production and fabrication facilities to their joint venture. These facilities will include the production of propellants and engine integration. They will be located at Saint-Medard-en-Jalles (Gironde) and Angouleme for SNPE and at Bourges for AEROSPATIALE. CELERG is now the leading European manufacturer of power plants for missiles and tactical weapons systems, with a size comparable to that of its major American competitors. AEROSPATIALE and SNPE thereby reinforce their partnership while enhancing the position of CELERG, a subsidiary to which additional French or foreign partners will be added to obtain a truly significant dimension in Europe, benefiting by important commercial and technical synergies.
