FR940419-1-00013 FR940419-1-00006 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Occupational Safety and Health Administration 29 CFR Part 1903 [Docket No. C&hyph;03] Abatement Verification AGENCY: Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Labor. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: OSHA is developing a regulation requiring employers to certify abatement and submit abatement plans and progress reports as a result of OSHA citations. In addition, OSHA is proposing the placement of a tag on cited equipment to alert affected employees that a hazardous condition exists while abatement is being accomplished. Violation of the regulation would result in civil penalties as prescribed by section 17 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. This notice invites interested parties to submit comments and recommendations on the issues detailed in this document, as well as other pertinent issues. All the information received in response to this notice will be carefully reviewed. The comments received will assist OSHA in developing the final regulation. DATES: Written comments on the notice of proposed rulemaking must be postmarked no later than July 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments and information should be submitted in quadruplicate to the Docket Officer, Docket No. C&hyph;03, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, room N&hyph;2625, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20210; telephone: (202) 219&hyph;7894. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. James Foster, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Office of Public Affairs, room N&hyph;3647, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20210; telephone: (202) 219&hyph;8151. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purpose of this proposed rule is to require employers to inform OSHA and their employees about measures they will take or have taken in response to OSHA citations, as well as to inform employees about OSHA citations and the alleged safety or health hazards described therein. I. Background Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (i.e., ``the Act'' or ``the OSH Act''), 29 U.S.C. 651 et. seq. , OSHA inspects workplaces to determine whether employers are complying with OSHA standards and other statutory or regulatory requirements. If OSHA believes that an employer has committed a violation, a citation is issued. The citation will reference the requirement allegedly violated, the alleged violation, and note the proposed penalty and a date by which the violation is to be corrected, i.e., the abatement date. Section 9(a), 29 U.S.C. 658(a). Currently, the cover letter to the employer which accompanies an OSHA citation states that the employer must notify the Area Director promptly by letter of abatement of violations. (OSHA Instruction ADM 1&hyph;1.12A CH&hyph;7, August 3, 1987. ``IMIS FORMS Manual'', Appendix C, page C&hyph;22). No specific regulation, however, authorizes this notification action. When, therefore, an employer does not provide written verification of abatement, OSHA may, depending on the circumstances, seek to verify abatement by making further efforts to communicate with the employer (e.g., by telephone), or by conducting an on-site follow-up inspection.
