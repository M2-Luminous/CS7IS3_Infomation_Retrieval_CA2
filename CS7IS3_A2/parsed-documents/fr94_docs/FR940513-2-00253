FR940513-2-00253 FR940513-2-00097 I. Purpose and Substantive Description A. Authority Section 22 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437t) provides for the establishment of Family Investment Centers (FIC). The Department has proposed regulations for this program as part of the Tenant Participation and Tenant Opportunity (TOP) rule, published on April 19, 1994 (59 FR 18666). This NOFA is being issued in conformity with the statutory requirements of FIC, in order to make funding available as soon as possible. B. Allocation Amounts In the NOFA for Public and Indian Housing Family Investment Centers published on February 28, 1994 (59 FR 9592), as amended on April 19, 1994 (59 FR 18570), the Department announced the availability of $69 million for funding Family Investment Center activities by public housing agencies (PHAs) or Indian housing authorities. In today's NOFA, an additional $5 million is being made available to public housing agencies (PHAs) under FIC for the Youth Development Initiative, to further advance the goals of FIC and the Administration's Operation Safe Home (OSH). If the entire $5 million is not needed to carry out the Youth Development Initiative, remaining funds will be made available for funding FIC activities. The FIC Youth Development Initiative grants will be targeted to assist youth in gaining access to education, employment, and supportive services. HUD expects that this funding will demonstrate the importance of comprehensive supportive services in contributing to the reduction of unemployment among our youth and crime and violence in public housing communities. This Youth Development Initiative requires the design and implementation by the targeted youth in partnership with the PHA. Each applicant may submit only one application under this NOFA. For this Youth Development Initiative, the maximum grant amount per applicant under this NOFA is $1 million. Although both PHAs and IHAs are eligible applicants in the main FIC NOFA published earlier, only PHAs may apply for the set-aside funds announced in this NOFA. C. Overview and Policy The stated purpose of Section 22 for FIC is: [T]o provide families living in public housing with better access to educational and employment opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency and independence by: (a) developing facilities in or near public housing for training and support services; (b) mobilizing public and private resources to expand and improve the delivery of such services; (c) providing funding for such essential training and support services that cannot otherwise be funded; and (d) improving the capacity of management to assess the training and service needs of families, coordinate the provision of training and services that meet such needs, and ensure the long-term provision of such training and services. Although section 22 is phrased in terms of ``families'' living in public housing, because of section 527 of the National Affordable Housing Act (104 Stat. 4216; 42 U.S.C. 1437aa note) (NAHA), the definition of ``families'' may be used interchangeably as individuals. This special Initiative is being made available to individuals (youths, ages 13&hyph;25), including noncustodial parents with child support agreements for children living in public housing and who would be made capable of meeting their obligations by being provided these services. The Department envisions that this Initiative under FIC will complement other youth programs, drug elimination efforts, and Youth Sports activities to increase the rates of school completion, enrollment in advanced education, or training and employment. PHAs that are recipients of or applicants for other programs with youth training opportunities must coordinate this FIC Youth Development Initiative with these programs. As an incentive to becoming self-sufficient, the earnings of public housing ``individuals/youths'' participating in this Youth Development Initiative shall not be treated as income for the purpose of rent calculation, and services are not treated as income for the purposes of any other program or provision of State or Federal law, including rent assistance, subject to the limitations set out in section I.F(5), ``Treatment of Income,'' of this NOFA. This Initiative is administered by the Department's Office of Resident Initiatives in the Office of Public and Indian Housing, with assistance from a network of Community Relations and Involvement Specialists in HUD Field Offices. D. Definitions For purposes of this NOFA, the following definitions apply: Eligible Residents means public housing residents aged 13&hyph;25 of a participating PHA, including noncustodial parents with child support agreements for children living in public housing when those parents would be made capable of meeting their obligations by being provided services. Secretary means the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Service Coordinator means any person, including youth, who is responsible for: (1) Determining the eligibility of individuals to be served by this Youth Development Initiative; (2) Assessing training and service needs of eligible residents; (3) Working with service providers to coordinate the provision of services on a PHA-wide or less-than-PHA-wide basis, and to tailor the services to the needs and characteristics of eligible residents; (4) Mobilizing public and private resources to ensure that the supportive services identified can be funded over the five-year period, at least, following the initial receipt of funding under this NOFA; (5) Monitoring and evaluating the delivery, impact, and effectiveness of any supportive service funded with capital or operating assistance under this program;
