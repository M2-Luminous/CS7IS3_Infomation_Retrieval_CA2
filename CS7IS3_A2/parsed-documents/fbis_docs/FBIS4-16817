The session also decided to consider reasonable the decision by the presidents of Russia and Ukraine to the effect that further joint basing of two fleets in Sevastopol was impossible. The Sevastopol City Council is soon to make a request to the new Ukrainian parliament and the Russian Federal Assembly to urgently help solve, in line with the Massandra Russian-Ukrainian protocol, the problem of the Black Sea Fleet. The city council proposed that the presidents of Ukraine and Russia invite a delegation from Sevastopol and the Crimea for the bilateral talks on the Black Sea Fleet scheduled for April 24. The session adopted an address to the peoples of Ukraine and Russia, which says that the Black Sea Fleet will be Russian and will be based in Sevastopol. The resolution says that the conflicts between the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy have become constant. Since the matter went as far as to threats to use force, says the document, the residents of Sevastopol, the inhabitants of the Crimea and of other places where units of the Black Sea Fleet and of the Ukrainian Navy are stationed cannot feel safe. The session denounced the confrontation within the fleet, caused as deputies believe, by a lack of resoluteness and consistency on the part of Ukrainian and Russian leaders. The city council urged the Russian and Ukrainian peoples to launch a public movement for the early implementation of the Russian-Ukrainian agreements on the Black Sea Fleet. Meanwhile, Nikolay Savchenko, leader of the Ukrainian Navy press center, told Interfax that the decision on basing the Ukrainian naval force in Sevastopol was outside the competence of the city council. He said that a relevant statement by the Ukrainian naval command could appear shortly.
