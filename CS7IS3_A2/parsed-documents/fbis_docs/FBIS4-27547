"If (North Korea) does not talk without reserve, it will lead to an undesirable direction," Hata told reporters at his official residence. "North Korea should take a serious view of the concern of the international community." The United States has warned it will seek economic sanctions against North Korea if the IAEA is prevented from carrying out tests on nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon some 90 kilometers from Pyongyang to determine whether spent fuel has been diverted to the manufacture of nuclear weapons. North Korea over the past week has been removing spent fuel rods from the reactor. The IAEA has warned that its capacity to carry out tests will be lost "in days" without proper technical arrangements. North Korea has repeatedly prevented IAEA inspectors from carrying out full inpections on its nuclear plants, fueling suspicions that the country is secretly developing nuclear weapons. A government spokesman later said Japan's position is to seek a peaceful resolution of North Korea's nuclear issue. "We still hope this issue will be resolved in a peaceful manner through efforts by the parties concerned," Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara told a news conference. Ishihara also noted the government is scrutinizing North Korea's virtual refusal to accept Monday's UN Security Council statement that urged Pyongyang to comply with nuclear safeguards requirements. Despite the harshly worded rejection, Ishihara said, no noticeable shift in North Korea's stance on the matter can be seen. It is not known how the countries involved will respond to Pyongyang's renewed refusal to allow international inspections of its nuclear reactor as IAEA inspectors are still continuing observation in North Korea, he added.
