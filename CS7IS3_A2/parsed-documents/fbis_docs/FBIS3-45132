Motorola's high-capacity electronic mobile switching system has been working well since Shanghai Posts and Telecommunications Administration began trial operations last month. Shanghai is the first city in China to introduce such a sophisticated mobile phone system. Beijing officials also signed an agreement last year with Motorola to buy the system, called EMX 2500. Motorola, an American company has sold the cutting-edge system to many countries. More than 120 Chinese cities currently use cellular phone switch systems made by Motorola. The introduction of the larger-capacity system to Shanghai will triple the possible number of mobile phone users in the city. Pertti Johanson, Vice President and General Manager of Motorola's International Cellular Infrastructure Division, said that the software of the EMX 2500 in operation in Shanghai has been modified to better meet the requirements of China's telecommunications networks. He added the introduction of the large-capacity switch system in Shanghai will not only enhance call processing speed, but also lay a solid foundation for the network and capacity to expand. According to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, China had about 638,000 mobile phone subscribers at the end of last year, with many applicants waiting for phones. The ministry plans to increase the total number of mobile phone users to between 900,000 and 1 million by the end of this year. In another development, Motorola China Inc has decided to invest nearly $200 million this year in the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area (TEDA). See Peng Hong, chief representative of Motorola China Inc, said in Tianjin that he had full confidence in the areas investment environment and China's economic reforms. The company has now set up two factories in the Tianjin area since March 1992. The first factory assembles pagers, making about 40 percent of Motorola's digital radio pagers on the Chinese market.
