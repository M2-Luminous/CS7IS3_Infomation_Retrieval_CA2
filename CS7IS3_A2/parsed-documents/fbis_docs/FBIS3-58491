The alliance reconfirmed its traditional function -- safeguarding the territorial integrity of all members. The aim, point, and objective of NATO have once again proven themselves indispensable and irreplaceable. [applause] At the same time, the alliance defined clear cut objectives for the future. In doing so, it is continuing its process of change and strengthening its ability to act. Who would have believed the role NATO would be given with the disappearance of the bipolar world, following its original task as a collective defense system against the East. Conflict scenarios have been replaced today by strategies for cooperation, and that is to be welcomed. [applause] This means NATO is moving into a new epoch in which security is having to be considered in a wider sense. Widened in geographic terms, as the summit decided in principle, widened in functional terms by early warning and conflict prevention, widened in conceptual terms by early warning and conflict prevention, and by means of economic, ecological, social, and cultural components, because security can only decreasingly be guaranteed by military means alone. [applause] The NATO summit decided on the evolutionary concept of a gradual, organic expansion of the alliance. I have supported and suggested this concept of a differentiated, multilayered interlocking with the East from the beginning, and the former Warsaw Pact countries are pushing powerfully into our alliance. What greater change can there be in this world than that those, who just a short while ago were, so to speak, our arch enemies, now want to meet their security needs by entering our Western alliance, NATO. [applause] The summit showed the path toward membership for these countries. We must now, however, move along it patiently but with purpose and determination. The alliance is thus consistently pursuing the course begun in 1991. At that time, on a German-U.S. initiative, we began with the founding of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council to open the door to cooperation with the Eastern neighbors. The Partnership for Peace supplements the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and widens the range of concrete cooperation. Without discrimination, it opens up further opportunities for differentiated interlocking relations. The German Government has always taken very seriously the worries and expectations of our eastern neighbors and partners. We understand their warnings about a gray zone and their concern about isolation. However, the answer cannot and must not be to divide Europe again between black and white. Germany sees itself, and I adhere to this image, as the advocate of the interests of our neighbors to the East, and we do not merely say that, Herr Klose, but we act in accordance with it, in all areas. [applause] The reforming countries of Central and Eastern Europe know they can depend on us in a special way. They also turn to us in a quite definite way but also Russia, Ukraine, and the other countries come to us and say: You will take special care that we do not become isolated, pushed away. We need a balanced solution, and we found that at the NATO summit in Brussels. [applause] [Parliamentary Speaker Rita Suessmuth] Mr. Kinkel, would you permit a question from Deputy (Seifert)? [Kinkel] Yes. [Seifert] Foreign Minister, could you tell me why you are channeling so much effort into realizing your strategies for cooperation through a military alliance and not through the CSCE, which is already in existence and which was set up expressly as a body for cooperation? [Kinkel] Who says we are not also trying to do this through the CSCE? The new European security architecture we have to build is, of course, linked to NATO, the CSCE, the NATO Cooperation Council of the WEU [Western European Union], and the European Union in both political and economic spheres. And it is precisely this which we are trying to bring about. The CSCE is playing a decisive role in the interlinking architecture that we want to and have to find, a point to which I shall return. So, the CSCE is not being neglected. [applause] On the other hand, it is the case that no third state has ever been able to claim a right of veto with respect to alliance membership, and this is how it has to stay. But we should not create any new grounds for antagonism or any new rifts. At the same time, however, it is true that in the end the best security guarantee for Europe lies in a stable, democratic, economically efficient, and cooperative Russia. Russia has taken decisive steps toward this objective, thanks not least to our massive political and economic support. It is on the historically unique path from a planned to a market economy, from Communism toward democracy. And it would be naive, really naive not to expect setbacks, mistakes, erroneous paths being taken by extremist, nationalist policies, as well as problems of economic policy. Nevertheless, we shall not allow Mr. Zhirinovskiy to talk us into any new hostile images [applause], quite simply because we want partnership, not hostility. I remain confident, very confident actually, that the majority of the Russian population thinks exactly the same way. We cannot say no to Russia as long as Russia says yes to Europe. At least it was right, and I adhere to this view, to deny Mr. Zhirinovskiy an entry visa to Germany for his 18-day political show, a propaganda tour, the direction of which one could predict. [applause] Ladies and gentlemen, it is just as important that countries such as Ukraine, the Baltic republics, and the countries of southeastern Europe should not get the impression that the door to the expansion of Western structures of stability will open only once, and just for a few, only to close again all the more firmly afterward. No, our guiding principle is a unified Europe in which no new chasms are created. [applause] Ladies and gentlemen, a certain impression arose at the summit as if NATO expansion, relations with the East, were the only topics. That was not the case. The great tasks lying ahead for German security policy in Europe were also discussed at the NATO summit in Brussels. First, the NATO summit gave an impressive commitment to the European security and defense identity. The U.S. President supports the efforts for more European independence in the fulfillment of our European security interests. The opportunities for action by the WEU were considerably broadened, and some NATO resources were placed at its disposal. The European pillar is being strengthened, but it must remain placed firmly against the Atlantic pillar. If the European Union takes on additional competences on issues relating to politics and security, there must be deepened transatlantic consultation and coordination mechanisms, and the Atlantic must not be allowed to widen. [applause] The United States of America has made a strong avowal of lasting commitment to Europe. We welcome, in particular, the declaration by the U.S. President that in future hundreds of thousands of soldiers will be left in Europe. This is of extrordinary significance for us and our European allies. Now I come to what Herr Klose was urging this morning: Second, the opening of markets, intensification of trade and economic relations, in addition to cultural exchange are also elements of security. And the prospects of NATO expansion that have now opened up must be seen in the context of these other prospects of interlinking and expansion for the European Union. Both the prospects are interlinked and interconnected. A Europe that left its security up to NATO alone will remain incomplete. But at the same time, a European Union without the same security for all members is inconceivable. [applause] Third, my French colleague [Alain] Juppe and I proposed that those countries with the prospect of joining the European Union should be brought closer to the WEU now, giving them additional anchorage and interlinking in terms of security policy, and I will emphatically press the WEU, as I have already done, to implement this proposal. [applause] Fourth, the CSCE has long since made the concept of expanded security its own. It links military aspects of security with questions of human rights, democratic checks on power, and economic cooperation. It is to the CSCE's lasting credit that the huge political and military change in Europe was able to take place without the serious threat of military confrontation between the former blocs. We Germans of all people wish to retain the idea of the renunciation of violence, understanding, and the willingness to compromise. And this applies particularly with regard to former Yugoslavia. The situation in former Yugoslavia figured largely at the summit, and in some respects overshadowed the talks a little. Our ability to help and mediate is not inexhaustible. The willingness to help is also declining tangibly among those countries that have contributed troops, with all the incalculable consequences, by the way, for the supply of humanitarian aid that would then no longer reach those in need if there actually were a withdrawal of the soldiers on the ground. The signal coming from the summit, that reaffirmed its willingness to mount possible air strikes, is also an expression of growing impatience and disappointment. Nevertheless, the European plan of action, that is still based on the Franco-German initiative, remains urgently necessary. The signal from the summit, I have to repeat, was also that a certain turning point has been reached regarding the situation in former Yugoslavia. It might be difficult to remain confident on this issue, but peace is too important for us to give up hope. However -- and this is something I stressed clearly to Izetbegovic and Tudjman during the Petersberg talks -- peace will only be possible if the warring parties want it and work to make it happen. [applause] We give thanks to all those who are helping, even to the extent of laying down their lives, to prevent the dreadful violations of human rights, or at least are trying to alleviate them. Fifth, the offer of a peace partnership is aimed beyond the range of the members of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, but also at other CSCE members. I have already advocated the North Atlantic Cooperation Council opening up in principle to all CSCE members. This will give the CSCE process greater substance and effectiveness. The North Atlantic Cooperation Council and thus, also NATO, are being given new options for prevention of conflicts, crisis management, and peace missions. The CSCE summit in Budapest this year must further develop the scope of action of the CSCE and its interlinking with the United Nations and NATO. Sixth, NATO declares its readiness to support peacekeeping measures and other missions by the CSCE and the United Nations. In this way the alliance is affirming the unique responsibility of the United Nations for international peace order. That means for us that we also must be prepared to take part in these alliance tasks. If we do not wish to isolate ourselves here, then we urgently need a clarification of the constitutional issues. [applause] I will repeat my appeal to you, ladies and gentlemen of the opposition, to shoulder your share of the responsibility -- give up your blockade of a constitutional amendment! [applause] Our country is being damaged. During the Brussels summit, the chancellor and I were on several occasions -- and I add this to the appeal -- in a very, very difficult situation, in a situation that is sometimes beneath the dignity of a country that is now the largest at the heart of Europe and that has additional responsibilities. I can only reiterate: In the interests of this country, we will not put up with this situation for very much longer. Give up your blockade! Seven, with great emphasis the heads of government in Brussels declared the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as a danger for international security. The members of the UN Security Council had already made it clear at their summit meeting two years ago that a legitimate concern, a very, very important concern of the community of nations, was to control and stem weapons of mass destruction and their carrier systems. Germany is the only country to have voluntarily and permanently renounced weapons of mass destruction. At the beginning of December, I already formulated my proposals in a 10-point plan to strengthen the policy of the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. We will energetically pursue this initiative. Our aim is to prevent new nuclear weapons states from coming into being in the world by means of timely, active cooperation with the countries in question. [applause] Nine [as heard], Ladies and Gentlemen, an agreement to regulate the elimination of the former Soviet nuclear weapons based in Ukraine is scheduled to be concluded tomorrow. The Federal Government made a decisive contribution to this breakthrough by means of intensive dialogue with Kiev on security and disarmament questions. And we hope that this agreement finds sufficient internal political support in Ukraine. For then, the path will be free for Ukraine membership in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear state. This will increase the chances for an unlimited and unconditional extension of this treaty. Then intensive and comprehensive cooperation with this hugely important state -- a particularly important country for Europe's security architecture -- could at last be concluded. The cooperation agreement between the European Union and Ukraine must also be concluded. The difficult relationship between Ukraine and Russia should be eased by means of a treaty on good-neighborly relations and the renunciation of the use of force. We are prepared to help in this to the best of our ability, but as far as Ukraine is concerned, the European Community has undertaken a lot -- thank God -- because we must ensure that we carefully observe and watch what is going on in Ukraine, as we have done with the Central and Eastern European states, and particularly with Russia. Ladies and Gentlemen, the result of the NATO summit fits smoothly into the concept of increased security for the whole of Europe. This concept arises from our interest in peace and stability in the whole of Europe. And we will continue to pursue this with determination. Clarity, conflict prevention, and confidence-building are the central issues. The last 45 years have produced an exemplary network of stability through the European Community in Western Europe. Now it is important finally to connect the security network in the second half, so to speak, of the European Union process. We will have achieved our aim when old differences in the east of our continent are overcome by the strength of the European Union, to the same extent as this has been achieved in the West. We will have achieved our goal when the other states bordering on Europe, and this also includes our partner Russia, do not see this growing together of Europe as a threat, but as an advantage for their own security and prosperity. The road there is long but we want a foreign policy that goes beyond the present day. Ladies and gentlemen, let me say one more thing in conclusion that occurred to me at the NATO summit and which I think is important for us: Our Bundeswehr enjoys enormous respect within the framework of NATO and in NATO. I think we should be proud of that. [applause] It [the Bundeswehr] is and remains the guarantor of our security and an effective tool of our peace policy. Our alliance capacity depends on it, and I say that it needs secure planning, not only with regard to finance, but even more with regard to an unambiguous definition of its tasks. It cannot and must not be right for us to say that we have such-and-such an amount of money, we can afford such-and-such a size of Bundeswehr. It should be the other way round: We must say we need the Bundeswehr for such-and-such tasks, and the money needed for this must then be available. [applause] And we should be careful to keep the Bundeswehr, which is a very important part of our society, out of attempts at party political posturing -- this is a prime concern for me.
