"I feel that we must come up with a government program that is not `principlist,'" says Lula. The dictionary does not record the jargon used in PT assemblies, but Lula provides the translation: "It is right for a party to defend its principles, but in economics, the right program is the one that is feasible." A better translation is that Lula will defend the PT's right to keep its dogmas but that when the time comes to formulate a government program, the party will not be able to prevent him from adapting those principles to the realities of the country and those facing someone who needs to expand his range of alliances in connection with the election of a president of the republic. In other words, it does the PT no good to put its ideal--its dream of a revolutionary rupture--down on paper because if it does come to power, it will do so not by force but by the free will of the voters. The party must come down to the real world and propose a government program that can actually be carried out with the broadest possible support from society. The foreign debt is a good example. The PT's outline of a government program claims that when Lula becomes president, he will decree a moratorium. The majority of the party's leaders may even be conscientiously convinced that that is the best way to deal with all foreign debt owed by Third-World countries. But they will be demonstrating political blindness if they try to impose that formula in the conditions now prevailing in Brazil, which is making an effort to come to terms with the international financial community. Lula even says that "the foreign debt cannot be looked at today the way it was in 1980, when there was an oil crisis and interest rates rose from 6 to 21 percent." And he adds a basic economic fact for consideration by the PT's orthodox members: "There is a commercial debt, and Brazil must pay it." The treatment Lula is imagining for the foreign debt is political and, therefore, much broader than a simple choice between the two solutions of pay or no pay. He recognizes that every $1 billion leaving the country and going to creditors is money taken away from the fight against poverty. But instead of refusing to pay, he is thinking about uniting Brazil and the debtor countries in a bloc that will negotiate with the creditor countries. "You are going to argue using the political strength you have," Lula says. He feels that if they unite, the Third-World countries will be strong enough to persuade their creditors to reduce their debts. "Didn't they reduce Poland's debt by 50 percent? Why don't they do the same for the other countries?" Magnifying Glass Lula likes to say that the PT's internal disagreements are viewed with a magnifying glass. "The problems are smaller than they are depicted as being," he says. According to him, the uproar over the government program arose because a draft program had been made public even before it was reviewed by the party's Executive Committee. The Executive Committee is scheduled to meet on the 17th to approve the program. The program will then be distributed for broad debate until the PT holds its national meeting on 30 April and 1 May, when Lula's candidacy will be made official. At the same time, Lula wants to open the program up for debate with the other parties. Concerning the disagreements with the PT's federal bloc in Congress, Lula says that the Executive Committee has not been as hard on the bloc as has been reported. He points out that the Executive Committee authorized the bloc to vote for the Emergency Social Fund which Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso needed so badly. "The problem is that in constitutional revision, people are just going through the motions. There are important things that the bloc should be participating in, but the conservatives have set a steamroller going to approve everything they want. There is no way that the bloc is going to support that and pretend that it is democracy," Lula says. Stalled On the day when the Executive Committee meets to approve the PT's government program, Lula will start another of his caravans. He will tour Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Parana through 4 March. Like everyone, he feels that the presidential race is sort of confused. "The fact that Quercia is a candidate again proves that the Right has not yet found someone. If it cannot find someone, it will do what it did with Collor: choose one to be anti-Lula," says Lula. The PT candidate does not believe that Antonio Britto will be the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] candidate. "Getting elected requires a little professionalism. The big professional in the PMDB is Quercia, who controls the party machinery and a lot of money," he says. Lula practically rules out the possibility of an arrangement with the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]: "They are expecting Fernando Henrique's star to rise. His economic plan may actually work out two or three months from now, but it will not make up for the losses it is causing." To those who belittle his chance of winning the presidential election on the grounds that he has stalled in the public opinion polls, Lula responds with a smile: "Comical. I am at 30 percent. It is more likely that I will reach 50 percent than that the runner-up will reach 30 percent. They only say that Lula has stalled at 30 percent. No one is saying that Brizola has stalled at 7 percent, Maluf at 12 percent, and Sarney at 10 percent."
