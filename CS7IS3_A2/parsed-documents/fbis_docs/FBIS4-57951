FBIS4-57951 "drlat103_c_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-103 Daily Report 26 May 1994 MEXICO Candidates React to Clash Between Zedillo, UNAM Students Candidates React to Clash Between Zedillo, UNAM Students PA2605232794 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 26 May 94 PA2605232794 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network Spanish BFN [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Sotero from the "ACIR Radio News"] [Text] Cecilia Soto Gonzalez, Labor Party [PT] presidential candidate, commented on the events that occurred yesterday at the National Autonomous University of Mexico [UNAM] involving Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate, and accounting faculty students. Ernesto Zedillo visited the UNAM, specifically the Accounting and Business Administration Faculty, to meet with university students in a closed forum at a faculty auditorium. What took place instead was several instances of verbal and even physical abuse against Zedillo. Things got so out of hand that the PRI candidate was nearly hit by a bottle or a stone. Insults may not cause any physical harm, but they do undermine an individual's morale. Ernesto Zedillo had agreed to meet with the university students, who requested an open dialogue in the university's esplanade, not in a closed auditorium guarded by presidential security agents for several hours prior to the meeting. As a result, the dialogue never took place. The media, including Radio ACIR, have commented extensively on what took place. The PT candidate said it would be a mistake to stop trying to hold dialogues at public and private universities and demanded respect for all presidential candidates. Ms. Soto was interviewed after a breakfast meeting with bankers, businessmen, and investors at a Mexico City hotel. Naturally she condemned the abuse to which the PRI presidential candidate was subjected, saying it was an unfortunate incident that could jeopardize dialogues at the nation's universities. She called on everyone to keep working for dialogues at the universities. Cecilia Soto stressed that the presidential candidates should not be attacked and should be received with respect. She added that the attack against Zedillo is an irrational action reminiscent of the dinosaurs. Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate of the Mexican Green Ecologist Party [PVEM], said that what took place at the UNAM yesterday with Ernesto Zedillo must be analyzed within its real perspective. He added that university students have always been very serious about dialogues with the authorities. According to Gonzalez, the PRI candidate must also respect the guidelines in force at the UNAM. The PVEM candidate said that perhaps the person most responsible for the incidents,which fortunately did not develop into anything more serious, was Zedillo himself. The PRI candidate organized a meeting with students that even included PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] members. In addition, it was a dialogue during which the genuine students were not the ones who spoke out. Gonzalez Torres warned that there is pent up dissatisfaction among the population that is ready to explode throughout the country. He said that what the people really want is a closer, more genuine relationship with the presidential candidates, not violent confrontations such as that which took place this Tuesday between PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce and UNAM students. During a visit to the community of (Pericos) as part of his campaign program, Gonzalez Torres rejected the figurative type of democracy that the government's candidate is offering as well as the Defense Secretariat's decision to purchase more weapons. [Begin Gonzalez Torres recording] The campaign programs do not address genuine needs. You all witnessed how one attempt turned out. This indicates that first there is a need for prior contacts. Contacts cannot take place hastily; they must be gradual. I hope we will all be able to understand this. If not, we will be going along with a figurative democracy believing that everything is fine when the truth is that there is rising dissatisfaction throughout the nation and it is ready to explode The Mexican people do not want more weapons to repress them, they want assistance. The government's responsibility is to serve, not to repress or to remain in power by any means. [end recording] The PVEM candidate's visit to (Pericos) was quite colorful. Gonzalez Torres distributed calendars and [words indistinct] to businessmen. Amid shoves and shouts, he stopped and spoke to the people, who were demanding answers from the federal district about increasing garbage, candidates not honoring their campaign promises, and a closer relationship with the candidates. (Pericos) businessmen, mostly young adults, shouted slogans such as "Green is Life" while the PVEM candidate toured the community. Gonzalez Torres expressed his opposition to the appointment of citizen advisors, whom he described as more advisers to the PRI, the National Action Party, and the PRD than to society in general.
