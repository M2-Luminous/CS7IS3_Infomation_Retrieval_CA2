A general mobilization is under way at Sextant Avionique, Thomson's and Aerospatiale's specialized subsidiary. The just-in-time method of production, launched around the beginning of 1992 in a pilot workshop at its Bordeaux plant, will be generalized this year at the group's five main sites: Bourdeaux, Chatellerault, Valence, Velizy, and Vendome. With the aeronautics industry currently in a slump, the change will not be all that easy to manage. Sextant's revenue dropped 10 percent in 1993, to 4.9 billion French francs [Fr], versus Fr5.4 billion in 1992. After getting off to a late start and trailing behind its American competitors, Sextant is bent on recovering lost time. For, looking beyond the current crisis, the pressure being exerted by clients, aircraft manufacturers, and airline companies, is mounting. Boeing and Airbus have both placed priorities on reducing production cycles. "Until now," says Francis Lefebvre, the company's industrial manager, "these cycles have been running on the order of around one year at Sextant. Today, our clients are demanding a normal turnaround time of one month. In other words, they are demanding that in the normal course of activity we be capable of modulating our production cycle within a maximum delivery time of one month." During 1993, these external constraints were compounded by the instituting of a new organization. Five market-oriented divisions (civil avionics, military avionics, helicopter avionics and instruments, space, and automatic testing) have replaced the former product-oriented divisions. The company's industrial sites, which until then had been managed by a central industrial head office, have been placed under the new divisions. Velizy, for example, which manufactures all the flight computers, has taken over the civil avionics division. Bordeaux, which specializes in displays, has become the seat of the military avionics division. At the same time, each plant can become the supplier (or the client) of the others. The introduction of the just-in-time method has followed a classic format. The first stage is the creation of individual product lines. At Velizy, the Airbus A 320 computer line began operating in February. Three others will follow: A 300-A 310 computers, A 330-A 340 computers, and military computers. Heretofore, these different products have been processed in a single workshop. The operation was made all the more complex by the existence of several types of computers for each model of Airbus (eight for the A 320), with a few hundred of each being produced each year (Sextant manufactures a total of 22,000 pieces of equipment and sensors per year). The system was identical at Bordeaux, with four lines of displays (the monitor screens that equip the cockpits), three for the Airbus, one for military planes. The second stage is the putting in place of the kanban system in the workshops. Sextant has contracted for the services of a specialist, Yves Milles, manager of the Gopal company, who for 10 years exercised his talents in the workshops of the PSA [Peugeot Corporation]. His credo: There is no need to upset the manufacturing process in order for kanban to yield its results. The important thing is to not halt production because of a contingency. Hence the need to make the process fail-safe, whether that process be related to supplies, staff, or production capacity. Thus, Yves Milles has developed circular kanban panels that provide maximum visibility and display the status of manufacturing orders. "The more contingencies you have, the more interested you are in tying the flow of information to the physical flow of the process. That interest is what kanban is all about," he sums up. The method was first tested at Bordeaux in a pilot plant that manufactures electric power supplies. The results speak for themselves with, among other things, a production cycle divided by eight. Kanban is now taking over at Sextant's other plants. At Velizy, on the A 320 computers line, the objective is to reduce the production cycle from nine months to three or four. "The books will reflect the economies beginning in 1995," says Francis Lefebvre. Something to look forward to while awaiting the recovery of the aeronautics market.
