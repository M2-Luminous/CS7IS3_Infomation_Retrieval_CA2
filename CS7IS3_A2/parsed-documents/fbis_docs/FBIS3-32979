The Finance Ministry is having difficulty accepting the 1993 and 1994 accounts of the state governments. Additionally, state enterprises are not submitting the results of their 1993 activities nor are they submitting their programs for 1994. The government does not know the volume of the surplus of 1993 accounts that will be disbursed by the Treasury in 1994. Jose Cechin, the Finance Ministry deputy secretary for economic policy, told the IMF that in 1994 Brazil's public accounts will have an operational deficit (excluding monetary correction) equivalent to zero. In other words, neither a surplus nor a deficit. Jose Fajgenbaun, head of the IMF delegation, who on 10 February held a brief meeting with Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, termed the congressional approval of the Social Emergency Fund during the first round of voting as "an important stage toward attacking the imbalance in the public accounts." He emphasized that the government needs to implement more measures to maintain the economic plan.
