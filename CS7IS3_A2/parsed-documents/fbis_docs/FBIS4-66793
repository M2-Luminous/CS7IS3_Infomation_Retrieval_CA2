Viswam] [Text] On board the Prime Minister's aircraft from London to Edinburgh, March 16: Britain's stand on Kashmir, though not identical with that of India, was nonetheless not very far either, the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao said on Wednesday. Talking to newsmen accompanying him on his visit to the United Kingdom on board his aircraft, the Prime Minister said that the three-point formula being advocated by Britain needed to be studied and analysed further. He said he was aware of the British position and had seen the three points advanced by the British government in the recent past. "On the whole," he said, "their position is not identical with ours, but then it is not very far either." "We will study their position further before making an assessment," he added. The three points advocated by Britian are first, a resumption of dialogue between India and Pakistan, second the restoration of the democratic process in Kashmir, and third, the cessation of external terrorism in the valley. India, on the other hand, has been insisting that the Pakistan abetment of subversion and terrorism should cease first as a pre-condition for the normalisation of the situation in the valley. India has made it clear that it is very keen on restoring the political process in Kashmir, and it has also expressed its readiness to initiate bilateral discussion with Pakistan on Kashmir, and if Pakistan was not willing to do so, it was prepared to talk to Pakistan on settling other outstanding bilateral issues. However, on the broader question of terrorism, which was a crucial element in respect of the Kashmir question, the views of India and Britain converged. Britain appeared to have a better understanding of what India is going through, what it is suffering and what the experience has been. Nothing illustrated better the impact of the "menace of terrorism" than the fact that a visitor to Britain had to go from airport to airport to land or take off to ward off danger from the menace. The Prime Minister was obviously referring to the fact that following the series of mortar attacks on the Heathrow airport mounted by the IRA [Irish Republican Army] terrorists, his own aircraft had to be diverted to Gatwick, some 50 miles away, similarly, by way of abundant caution, the British arranged for his flight to Edinburgh from London take off not from Heathrow or Gatwick but from the royal air force base at Brize Norton, which is a two-hour drive from the heart of London. "Just imagine," said the Prime Minister, "all this happening in their own capital and all because of terrorism. They are experiencing the same kind of terrorism which we have been experiencing. Therefore, there is no elaborate need for the two of us to convince each other about this menace." Assessing the outcome of his goodwill visit to the United Kingdom, the Prime Minister said it had "gone off very well." His overall impression was that the atmosphere during the visit was great friendliness and greater closeness. As a result of which both economic and political relations had firmed up on a constructive footing. The thrust of the discussions he had had with his counterpart, Mr Major, as well as with other British Ministers was a combination of both economic and political. Apart from bilateral issues, he had the opportunity to discuss with them a lot of other issues in the international sphere, such as Bosnia and the crisis in that region. The British Prime Minister had informed him that there had been some improvement in the Bosnian situation and he expected the improvement to continue in the months to come. Asked whether India was being approached to send more troops to Bosnia, the Prime Minister said in the kind of situation which prevailed, there was no point in making new proposals. The Prime Minister said he had seen newspaper reports in London about the intended purchase of Hawk trainer aircraft by India from Britain. Dismissing suggestions that the deal figured in the discussions, Mr Rao said that decisions in respect of acquisition of military hardware were not taken during visits such as his. There were established procedures for such transactions, and so if there was any impression that the visit was made as a result of decisions on such transactions it was erroneous. The Prime Minister left London for Edinburgh on the final lap of his journey after planting an oak tree at the Magna Carta Memorial, the first time, he said, that any world leader had been requested to do so on the spot where the charter was signed. The rights figuring in the charter were the same as he had been incorporated in chapter three of the Indian Constitution.
