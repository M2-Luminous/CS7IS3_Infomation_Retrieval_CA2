Francois Leotard spoke at a memorial service in honor of a French UN soldier killed in northwestern Bosnia last week. After the incident, France criticized the United Nations for its "lack of resolve" in responding to attacks on UN peacekeepers in sensitive Bosnian zones. Leotard warned that the "resolve" of France and its soldiers in Bosnia could be sustained "only if our soldiers are, through the use of legitimate force, protected against aggression." "We cannot accept that the rule of law is being disarmed and that violence is going unpunished," he said. [passage omitted]
