This was done by the previous New Democracy (ND) government and is being repeated by the new Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government, the editorial maintains. According to the editorial, such moves destabilize the Armed Forces and waste highly trained manpower. The editorial quotes honorary National Defense General Staff (Geetha) chairman Gen Ioannis Verivakis as recommending that, as in other European countries, the leadership of the Greek Armed Forces should be appointed for at least a two-year period preceded by special training. Verivakis is also quoted as saying that we must cease thinking that a Papadhopoulos [junta leader] is lurking behind every officer's uniform."
