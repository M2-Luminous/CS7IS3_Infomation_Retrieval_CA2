"Only early, simultaneous presidential and legislative elections can bring legitimate power to the country," Rutskoy said in an interview conducted Thursday [7 April] with AFP. Rutskoy, 47, said it was still to early to speak in detail about his plans for becoming a presidential candidate, noting that Russia still had no law on presidential elections and that no date for the vote had yet been fixed. "It is not enough simply to want to run," Rutskoy stated. "But if I am asked to run I believe I would accept because I know what to do and how to do it to stop the current chaos and assure that Russians have a life worthy of citizens of a great country," he said. Rutskoy, who provided written and oral responses to questions from AFP, denied he favored rebuilding the Soviet Union, but called for a "new union" based on the Russian empire as it existed prior to 1917, excluding Poland and Finland. "The creation of a new, powerful, federal state which would be called Russia can be done," Rutskoy stated. He also sharply criticized President Boris Yeltsin's plan for all the main political forces in the country to sign a pact known as the "Agreement on Obtaining Civil Accord" which the Kremlin says is needed to curtail extremism in Russian politics. "An accord with whom and for what?" Rutskoy said. "I don't want to sign anything with the people who have devastated the country and fired on its parliament and its people." The former Afghan war hero, elected vice president in June 1991 as President Boris Yeltsin's running mate, was dressed casually and appeared relaxed during the 40-minute interview, conducted in an office in his central Moscow apartment. He said he had spent a good deal of time reflecting on the state of Russia during the five months he sat in Moscow's high-security Lefortovo prison after being jailed for his role in leading the October 1993 parliamentary revolt. Referring to the latest spate of rumors on his former boss's health, Rutskoy said the country had a right to be kept informed on the physical and psychological condition of the head of state. "All the more so when you're talking about a nuclear power," he stated. Rutskoy repeated his previous criticism of reforms carried out over the past two years, saying during that time Russia had become "a third-rate, colonial, mafia, totalitarian and corrupt state." "The dollar has become the national money and the ruble a crumpled candy wrapper," he stated. Rutskoy said his new ideology was based on a combination of religious faith and a "national spirit" that had been forgotten by many during the seven decades of communist rule and in the past two years of democratic change. Implementing this ideology "will produce the most important thing: the rebirth of Russian power," he stated. Rutskoy has joined a newly-created opposition bloc known as "Accord for Russia" which is due to hold its founding congress next month and which some analysts view as the organizational springboard for his presidential bid. He said he was currently working on two books -- "Collapse of a Power" and "The Discovery of Faith" -- recounting his personal experiences and his views on the events that have rocked his country in recent years. "I will make an objective study of what has happened to us and how we have found ourselves in this shameful situation," he said. "There will also be new approaches on building the state and economic reforms" in the books, Rutskoy stated. [Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in Russian on 8 April, page 2, runs an INTERFAX report under the "Opposition" rubric, which adds: "The constituent congress of the "Accord for Russia" movement will take place in Moscow on 19 May, said Vasiliy Lipitskiy, leader of the `Free Russia' People's Party and a State Duma deputy. This date was set 6 April at the meeting of the movement's group of activists, attended by former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy, Constitutional Court Judge Valeriy Zorkin, Agrarian Party leader Mikhail Lapshin, Petr Romanov, and Amangeldy Tuleyev, as well as Federation Council deputies and other signatories of the declaration on setting up the movement."]
