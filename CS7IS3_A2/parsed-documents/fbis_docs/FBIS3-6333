Several Cambodian and foreign newspapers have become very worried and disappointed with what they call the desire of our Cambodian Royal Government [RCG] and National Assembly to issue a law to restrict the rights and freedom of the press, particularly the foreign press. 2. I do hope that the beloved RCG and National Assembly of Cambodia will continue allowing all Cambodian and foreign newspapers to enjoy full rights and freedoms and provide all facilities for those journalists to carry out their work conveniently. I believe that we need not arrange any regulations nor draft any laws for the Cambodian and foreign press. During the 1991-92 period, in my capacity as the chairman of the Supreme National Council of Cambodia, I promised, on behalf of the new Cambodia, to all journalists that Cambodia, which desired to pursue a modern liberal democratic system, would allow all newspapers to enjoy every right and freedom this system permits. In the event that a newspaper article presents groundless information that affects our interests, we should have the right and duty to ask that newspaper to issue a responsible correction. 3. I do understand that the king reigns but does not control state power. Therefore, I would like the beloved RCG and National Assembly to freely make their own decision on this matter as well as on other issues. I have said this only in view of the interests of our Kingdom of Cambodia which desires to gain prestige as a champion of press freedom. Nevertheless, we do not have to strive to overcome any journalists who oppose us. I have gained quite a lot of experience concerning this matter from my numerous struggles in the past vis-a- vis journalists and researchers. Although my cause was right, I was all along the big loser while they remained the everlasting winners. [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk
