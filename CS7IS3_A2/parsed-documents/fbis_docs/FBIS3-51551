Calderon Sol, who was accompanied by his running mate, Dr. Enrique Borgo Bustamante, and the candidates for deputy in the country's 14 departments, emphasized the importance the next Legislative Assembly will have, given its support will make the executive work smoother for the benefit of the neediest families in the country. According to Calderon Sol, the candidates for deputy, as well as the presidential ticket, will conduct a lofty campaign aimed at making Salvadorans aware of the work ARENA will conduct in the Executive Branch to continue upgrading the country's legislature. This is the fourth time ARENA has participated in elections to choose representatives to the Legislative Assembly. It has controlled the assembly with a conservative majority of deputies during the last two assemblies. "El Salvador wants to live in harmony, peace, and social welfare, and that is why it wants Executive and Legislative Branches that coordinate with each other to give continuity to the country's social and economic development," he said. During the announcement made at ARENA headquarters, Calderon Sol said the 60-percent reduction of U.S. aid to the country had been programmed already, and so it must not cause surprise, much less uncertainty, he added. The reduction is a recognition of the president's actions over the past years, Calderon Sol said, adding that El Salvador is no longer a country that needs to be held by the hand, given that it has sufficient forces to move ahead. As proof of the above, he said the inflation rate in 1993 decreased by 12 percent; better control over fiscal funds were established; exports rose; and local and foreign investment grew considerably. According to the ARENA presidential candidate, a public debate with his opponents, Fidel Chavez Mena and Ruben Zamora, would not make sense, given the public challenges they have made are part of a publicity strategy from which they hope to extract electoral gains. "They are dropping considerably in the people's preference, and they lack popular support," he said, adding that his life has always been a challenge, and now he is facing the biggest challenge, namely serving society and meeting its needs as future president.
