FBIS3-32045 "drlat021_g_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-021 Document Type:Daily Report 1 Feb 1994 Guatemala Preliminary Figures Indicate Referendum Approved PA3101145294 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1117 GMT 31 Jan 94 PA3101145294 Mexico City NOTIMEX Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Guatemala City, 31 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Sunday's constitutional referendum reforms package was approved by yes votes totaling 67.65 percent, although there was an abstention rate of 83.9 percent, according to preliminary figures disclosed after midnight last night. A total of 3,439,405 Guatemalans cast their votes on 30 January to approve or reject 37 articles of the Constitution. Among other things, the reforms shorten the legislative and presidential terms and restructure Congress and the Supreme Court of Justice. After accounting for the votes cast in 280 of the country's 330 municipalities, Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] confirmed early today that barely 16.01 percent of registered voters had participated in the referendum. After the preliminary results were released, President Ramiro de Leon Carpio, during a news conference held at TSE's computation center, called for a "national agreement" to overcome the country's political, economic, and social crisis. De Leon admitted the results indicate an exhaustion of the democratic system, which demands from political, entrepreneurial, union, and popular sectors, as well as the Church, greater responsibility and participation in the country's leadership. Hours earlier, before arriving at the TSE, de Leon expressed his satisfaction over the yes vote's "triumph" and said, albeit minimum, this result was an expression of the people's will and must be respected. According to the TSE, 5,054 polling sites had reported, and 843 were pending at 0100 (0700 GMT). The reported 5,054 sites had produced 319,550 yes votes, 61,212 no votes, 84,820 void votes, and 6,768 blank votes. Electoral authorities said the results of all polling sites will be reported in a few hours, because the votes of many distant villages with scant communications have yet to be accounted for. Speaking to the press at 0030 (0630 GMT), de Leon demanded the establishment of a "Governability Pact" to overcome the country's serious backwardness. He urged the guerrillas to sign peace to make it possible for the country to move forward. The president pledged to sign peace with the rebel National Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity [URNG], establish economic and social peace, and launch a moral "bloodless" revolution. De Leon Carpio stated that henceforth Guatemala will begin to march on the path of stability and governability, after pledging to strongly promote economic plans and security measures. The head of state affirmed the referendum met the Guatemalan people's expectations, but he expressed regret over the high rate of abstention, something that must be of concern to the political parties, he said. He reiterated, however, that "regardless of the result, democracy is getting stronger." Regarding the possibility that the Social Multisector Forum (Foro Multisectorial), which represents unions, mass, and business groups, may challenge the vote result, de Leon warned it is uncalled for, because the law does not demand a percentage in the referendum. Sunday's voting took place under a tense climate due to terrorist threats and bomb explosions, as well as due to the rejection of political and social organizations that urged the people to vote "No" or cast a blank vote. Upon arriving at the TSE last night, the president admitted voter abstention "happens everywhere in the world," but he attributed the low turnout to last week's attacks,. With the approval of the amendments, the term of the president and the Legislative Branch is cut from five to four years, and the Supreme Court term from six to five years. The president's confidential expenditure and the shared vice president's responsibility in the president's activities will be eliminated. The amendments ban the Monetary Board, the regulator of the economy, from authorizing the Bank of Guatemala from finance state, decentralized, autonomous, and private nonfinancial entities. Budget allocations for the country's 333 municipalities went from 8 percent to 10 percent of fiscal revenues. The government's ability to transfer funds from its investment programs to its operations plans or to repay the public debt will be eliminated. In addition, extraordinary expenses related to the national budget will be suppressed. Concerning the Judicial Branch, the Supreme Court of Justice will consist of 13 magistrates instead of the current nine, and this institutions' practice of nominating its own candidates to magistrate positions will be annulled. The District Attorney's Office (MP) will no longer represent the state, which from now on will be represented by the Attorney General's Office. In addition, the Guatemalan Prosecutor General's Office is created. The legislative reforms are expected to become effective within 60 days; fifteen days afterward the TSE will summon elections to renew the current Congress within a 120-day period. Newly elected deputies will be sworn in one month after the elections and will replace the current deputies whose term was scheduled to concluded on 14 January 1996, the date when the congressmen elected during the 1995 general elections were slated to take over. Eighteen months after the new reforms have entered into effect, the president must forward a bill to Congress aimed at modernizing the government system. Congress, in turn, will determine the mechanisms to modify the Comptroller General's Office, the District Attorney's Office, and the Supreme Court of Justice. Sunday's referendum, which entailed a $2-million expenditure, was held under strict security and military patrols, and public transportation was halted.
