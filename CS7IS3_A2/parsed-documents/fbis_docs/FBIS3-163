The troops are accompanied by UN military observers. In a communique, Gen. Inienger stated that the various factions expressed the will to withdraw from the frontlines as of today. "I approved this decision and ordered the ECOMOG troops to be deployed immediately in those regions," he explained. This initiative constitutes "a great stride toward peace," the ECOMOG commander commented. He specified that 1,700 Ugandan and Tanzanian soldiers would be positioned in the country's northeastern regions under the control of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL], the main armed faction. Concerning the deployment of the other contingents, sources close to the ECOMOG indicate that the Nigerians would be dispatched to the country's southeastern areas where an armed militia, the Liberian Peace Council, has been trying since September 1993 to be established much to the detriment of the NPFL. The Ghanaians will be dispatched to western and northwestern regions which are dominated by the United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia, the NPFL's rival faction. Finally, Monrovia and its region, administered by the Interim Government of National Union and the Armed Forces of Liberia, will be placed under the responsibility of the Guinean contingent of ECOMOG. The role to be played by the Sierra Leonean, Gambian, and Malian elements of the force was not specified. According to the estimations of the National Readjustment Commission, some 60,000 fighters from all sides are expected to be disarmed and demobilized as of 7 March. Simultaneously, transitional institutions will officially assume office, and their mission will be to lead the country to free elections in September. According to UN estimates, the Liberian civil war has claimed 150,000 lives since it began in December 1989.
