Is it true that they will take place in September? [Kolodziejczyk] Yes, I hope so. We are in the midst of working out the details of the exercises along with NATO officials. They will take place during the first 20 days or so of September. [Woyciechowski] Can you say where they will take place, in what region of the country, or is that a military secret? [Kolodziejczyk] No, it is not a military secret. By the way, we will make efforts for the public to know quite a lot about the nature of these exercises, about their participants, about events taking place there, but the final decision has not yet been made.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Who will come from NATO? Will they be just generals and officers, or ordinary soldiers as well? [Kolodziejczyk] There will also be so-called fundamental subdivisions: platoons and companies. We still do not know how many countries will send troops, but we do intend to invite observers to these exercises, which means all of our neighbors must definitely be here, as well as volunteers from among those who have declared their willingness to participate in Partnership for Peace. We simply think that the process of building mutual trust is [hesitating] a very crucial thing at this stage, and we want to demonstrate our exercises for the sake of peace and demonstrate that we want to learn the standards and procedures that are in effect in NATO. We want to establish rapid-deployment forces for the sake of prevention and maintaining peace and... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But, General--I am sorry, I mean Admiral--could you speak a little more about the exercises? They will be the first landing operation--it is just a figure of speech--by NATO in Poland. So my question is: Will NATO troops be seen around? Will U.S. soldiers be running around fields in rural areas? Will we see tanks.... [Kolodziejczyk, interrupting] Well, not exactly. [Woyciechowski] Or perhaps the military will be the only one to see anything like that? [Kolodziejczyk] To make a long story short: This will be the first instance of an exercise within the Partnership for Peace because, by that time, we will have signed an individually negotiated partnership program. Still, this will not be our first experience of that type since, for a few years now, we have been conducting joint training sessions. This year, we will have the joint exercises. Not so long ago, our mountain riflemen returned from the French Alps with a great many memories of their time there. We have also trained British and Dutch soldiers here in Poland. We will also take part ourselves in very large-scale peacekeeping [preceding word in English] exercises in the Netherlands, but.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What is that? [Kolodziejczyk] Peacekeeping [preceding word in English] is about having forces for the maintenance of peace, about preparing [words indistinct] for peacekeeping operations. It is a very important element when you think about how unstable the world continues to be and how many dangers... [Kolodziejczyk pauses] I do not even mention Yugoslavia because everybody knows about that part of the world, and everybody laments that the peacekeeping operations there are not efficient enough. Now, one of the goals of these exercises [with NATO] is to search for ways of improving efficiency. Still, the thing is that the issue is not up to the Army but up to the appropriate provisions of international law. [Woyciechowski] Let us talk for a moment about the Individual Partnership Program. You said the negotiations are about to end and the program will be finalized soon. Will it be made public in its entirety? Will all that be made public [words indistinct]? [Kolodziejczyk] I think that, if one were to publish the program in its entirety, it would be an extremely boring document because, apart from the political preamble, which, by the way, is very short indeed, it is slightly over one page long, and, in it, I can reveal some secret here by saying that some formulations were included there that are very beneficial to us; we have made very strong efforts for that, and they were indeed included in the preamble. Now, when it comes to the entire remainder of the program, it consists of a compilation of tables that implement a gradual harmonization in a step-by-step way, and they include very specific measures in many different areas, beginning with.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Let us explain it to our listeners: The minister means the measures that aim at our integration into NATO. [Kolodziejczyk] Exactly. [Woyciechowski] Are they very [word indistinct] and very military items? [Kolodziejczyk] Yes, exactly. You are exactly right. The items cover integration of communications systems, unification of procedures, which, after all, were different, tactical signs, maps, exercises with maps, computer exercises, the command language, and a whole range of great undertakings [words indistinct]. [Woyciechowski] My understanding is that it is a very detailed time schedule that begins in the so-called Year or Month Zero, and when is the final date in the time schedule, Admiral? What is the final deadline? [Kolodziejczyk] The schedule will be of a gradual nature. Over the years, we will be giving up those undertakings we deem... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But can one see an end? In other words, to put it in different words [words indistinct]...? [Kolodziejczyk, interrupting] No, one cannot see an end because, up to now, no criteria have been defined that have to be met by countries to be included in the NATO family. We are making intensive efforts for that sake, and I hope that, in the near future, such criteria will indeed be defined. At any rate, we will be making intensive efforts for that sake because, as has been said on many occasions, our strategic goal is to integrate into the European security system; we want to be an active participant in that system, and we will do everything possible for the road to be as short as possible. [Woyciechowski] Do you mean the European security system or NATO? [Kolodziejczyk] You know, NATO has become quite a misleading label. It brings to mind a bloc type of defense system, whereas, currently, NATO is not a defense bloc of any kind but is, instead, the basis for constructing a security system and has been undergoing transformations, while, to many people, the label is misleading while many others deliberately use it--I mean our neighbors to the East--by saying: Here comes NATO, an aggressive bloc, approaching our borders. [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, what about our eastern neighbors? What does Russia's participation in Partnership for Peace imply? In other words, is it a good thing or a bad one for us? [Kolodziejczyk] You know, generally speaking, it sends a good message that means that, at least formally speaking, the Russians have approved the Partnership for Peace initiative, but their goodwill will be measured with their level of participation and involvement in the building of a security system that, after all, will include Russia as well.
