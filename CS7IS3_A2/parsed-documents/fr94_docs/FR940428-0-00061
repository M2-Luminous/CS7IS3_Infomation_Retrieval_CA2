FR940428-0-00061 FR940428-0-00022 International Trade Impact Assessment The rule will have little or no impact on trade for either American firms doing business in foreign countries or foreign firms doing business in the United States. In the U.S., foreign manufacturers will have to meet U.S. requirements, and thus will gain no competitive advantage. In foreign countries, American manufacturers need not comply with these requirements if the foreign country does not require them and, therefore, will not be placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to foreign manufacturers. Federalism Implications The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Conclusion For the reasons given above, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not significant under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA has determined that this action is not significant as defined in Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). Since the aircraft involved are not manufactured by small entities, the FAA certifies, under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities.

List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 25 Aircraft, Aviation safety, Federal Aviation Administration, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 25 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) as follows: PART 25_AIRWORTHINESS STANDARDS: TRANSPORT CATEGORY AIRPLANES 1. The authority citation for part 25 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 1344, 1354(a), 1355, 1421, 1423, 1425, 1428, 1429, 1430); 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 49 CFR 1.47(a). 2. A new ยง25.1316 is added under the undesignated center heading ``General'' to read as follows: ยง25.1316 System lightning protection. (a) For functions whose failure would contribute to or cause a condition that would prevent the continued safe flight and landing of the airplane, each electrical and electronic system that performs these functions must be designed and installed to ensure that the operation and operational capabilities of the systems to perform these functions are not adversely affected when the airplane is exposed to lightning. (b) For functions whose failure would contribute to or cause a condition that would reduce the capability of the airplane or the ability of the flightcrew to cope with adverse operating conditions, each electrical and electronic system that performs these functions must be designed and installed to ensure that these functions can be recovered in a timely manner after the airplane is exposed to lightning. (c) Compliance with the lightning protection criteria prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section must be shown for exposure to a severe lightning environment. The applicant must design for and verify that aircraft electrical/electronic systems are protected against the effects of lightning by: (1) Determining the lightning strike zones for the airplane; (2) Establishing the external lightning environment for the zones; (3) Establishing the internal environment; (4) Identifying all the electrical and electronic systems that are subject to the requirements of this section, and their locations on or within the airplane; (5) Establishing the susceptibility of the systems to the internal and external lightning environment; (6) Designing protection; and (7) Verifying that the protection is adequate.
