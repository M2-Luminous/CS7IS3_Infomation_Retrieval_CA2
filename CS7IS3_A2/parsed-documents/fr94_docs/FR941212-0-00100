Approval and settlement authorities will follow the procedures set forth in subpart B in paying, denying, or making final offers on claims. A copy of the notification will be forwarded to Commander, USARCS. The settlement authority will notify the claimant by certified mail (return receipt requested) of a denial or final offer and the reason therefor as set forth in §536.37. The letter of notification will inform claimants of the following: (1) They must accept or appeal as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. (2) The official who will act on the appeal and that the appeal will be addressed to the settlement authority who last acted on the claim. (3) No form is prescribed for the appeal but claimants must fully set forth the grounds for appeal, or state that they appeal on the basis of the record as it exists at the time of denial or final offer. (4) The appeal must be postmarked not later than six months after the date of mailing of the notice of action on the claim. If the last day of the appeal period falls on a day on which the post office is closed, the next day on which it is open for business will be considered the final day of the appeal period. (b) Acceptance and appeal. For final offers, a settlement agreement releasing the government from all liability will be mailed along with the final offer notice. Claimants will be advised that they must either submit an appeal or accept the offer within 180 days of the date of mailing of the final offer notice. If they fail to do either, the offer will be withdrawn, the claim will be denied and the file will be closed without further recourse. (c) Companion FTCA claims. Where a claim for the same injury has been filed under subpart D, and the denial or final offer applies equally to such claim, the letter of notification must advise the claimant that any suit brought as to any portion of the claim filed under the FTCA must be brought not later than 6 months from the date of mailing of the notice of denial or final offer. Further, the claimant must be advised that if suit is brought, action on any appeal under this subpart will be held in abeyance pending final determination of such suit. §536.64 Action on appeal. (a) The appeal will be examined by the settlement authority who last acted on the claim or his or her successor, to determine if the appeal complies with the requirements of this regulation. The settlement authority will also examine the claims investigative file; and decide whether additional investigation is required; ensure that all allegations or evidence presented by the claimant, agent, or attorney are documented in the file; and ensure that all pertinent evidence is included in the file. If the claimant states that he or she appeals, but does not submit supporting materials within the 180 day appeal period, the appeal will be treated as being on the record as it existed at the time of denial or final offer. Unless action under paragraph (b) of this section is taken, the claim and complete investigative file, including any additional investigation required, and a tort claims memorandum will be forwarded to the appropriate appellate authority for necessary action on the appeal. (b) If the evidence in the file, including information submitted by the claimant with the appeal and any necessary additional investigation, indicates the appeal should be granted, in whole or in part, the settlement authority who last acted on the claim or his or her successor will attempt to settle the claim. If a settlement cannot be reached, the appeal will be forwarded in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. (c) As to an appeal that requires action by TJAG, TAJAG, or the Secretary of the Army or designee, the Commander, USARCS may take the action in paragraph (b) of this section or forward the claim together with a recommendation for action. All matters submitted by the claimant will be forwarded and considered. (d) Since an appeal under this subpart is not an adversary proceeding, no form of hearing is authorized. A request by the claimant for access to documentary evidence in the claims file to be used in considering the appeal should be granted unless access is not permitted by law or regulation. (e) If the appeal authority upholds a final offer or authorizes an award on appeal from a denial of a claim, the notice of the appellate authority's action will inform the claimant that they must accept the award within 180 days of the date of mailing of the notice of the appellate authority's action or the award will be withdrawn, the claim will be deemed denied and the file will be closed without further recourse. §536.65 Cross-servicing of claims. (a) Single-service claims responsibility. Per DODD 5515.8, the DOD has assigned single-service responsibility to the various military departments for the settlement of claims in specified countries.
