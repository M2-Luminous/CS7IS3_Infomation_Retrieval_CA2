They also want to bring the nation to its knees and make it surrender to their will and wishes. Addressing delegations taking part in the Baghdad meeting of Arab journalists, organized by the Iraqi Journalists Association, 'Aziz said: This meeting in Baghdad boosts the morale of all of us and sends a signal to imperialist forces and those collaborating with them that their hopes and aspirations will not be achieved. 'Aziz added: The meeting in Baghdad at this time in particular and in this holy month has a special importance and a great symbolic meaning because it takes place after years of the aggression and the unjust embargo against Baghdad, which still represents a bright center of patriotism and nationalism and a bulwark that believes in the nation's issues that have a bearing on its destiny. Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz added that the basis of any political or diplomatic activity is steadfastness and adherence to patriotic and nationalistic principles. He pointed out the major reasons for the change in the international position on the question of the unjust embargo against Iraq, attributing this primarily to the steadfastness of Iraq and its leadership and their firm adherence to national and pan-Arab principles. The deputy prime minister added that the aggression against Iraq did not bring Iraq to its knees, as the enemies had planned and dreamed. The embargo has also not made the leadership and the people of Iraq abandon the national and pan-Arab principles in which they believe and for which they have struggled. He underlined in this regard the reconstruction campaign, which has not been a purely technical process. He said the reconstruction process was launched by a decision from the leadership. However, the people took part in making this decision and implementing it. This means that the entire population rejects the threat of former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and the U.S. scheme and is sending a clear message in this regard. Tariq 'Aziz added: The reconstruction process is a great act of jihad, which remarkably demonstrated the creativity of the Iraqis and reflected the people's resolve to reject aggression. This also reflects the strong relationship and harmony between the leadership and the people. Tariq 'Aziz added: Steadfastness, success in reconstruction, and the strong relationship between the leadership and people are all behind the aggression states' reconsideration of their positions and their listening to Iraq. The steadfastness of the Iraqis made all the facts come out in the open. The strong relationship between the leadership and the people has become clear for all, including the enemies. In his comprehensive conversation with Arab journalists, Tariq 'Aziz reviewed developments in the international arena and the national and pan-Arab constant principles in Iraq's policy, whether before or after the aggression. He said Iraq sticks to its option to live. He further explained the current split in the Security Council toward many issues, saying this points to the decline of U.S. hegemony. This means that the forces that have faith in their central causes are gaining more ground. 'Aziz also discussed the material and historical losses of some countries that took part in the aggression and the embargo against Iraq, saying these countries have started to feel that they have lost more than the bribes and rewards they gained, and this is an important fact.
