FR940505-1-00035 FR940505-1-00012 The South Coast is classified as a serious CO nonattainment area and is required to attain the CO NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than 2000. Given these attainment deadlines, the principal technical objectives of the proposed FIPs are to: (1) Determine the pollutant emission reductions needed to attain the NAAQS in each area; (2) select the additional control strategies best suited to achieve these reductions; and (3) develop specific measures for each strategy. 1. Required Emission Reductions The first task depends on the collection and analysis of critical data relating emissions to ambient concentrations. To the greatest extent possible, EPA's proposed FIPs use data compiled by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the responsible local agencies (e.g. the local air pollution control districts and councils of governments) regarding current and future sources and levels of emissions in each area. In order to remain consistent with state and local planning efforts, EPA has made adjustments to these data only where absolutely necessary to correct errors, improve the precision and currency of the data, or analyze more effectively the impact of control measures. Of necessity, the proposed FIPs rely on air quality measurements and meteorological input from the extensive CARB and district monitoring networks. Finally, in order to relate emissions levels to ambient pollutant concentrations, EPA has chosen to rely on modeling analyses developed cooperatively with the involved state and local agencies and used in their ongoing SIP development activities. These technical foundations of the FIPs are discussed in section III.H., and further details may be found in the technical support documents accompanying this proposal. The data and analyses will be revised to reflect the final FIP strategies and to conform, to the extent possible, with new information and assumptions used by the state and local agencies in the 1994 ozone SIPs for each area. The results of these complex technical assessments confirm the need for massive further reductions in emissions of the ozone precursor pollutants in each area. 6 In the most challenging case, current levels of VOC must be reduced by 90 percent and NO X emissions must be reduced by 70 percent to reach attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the South Coast by the target date of 2010. In Ventura, approximately a 40 percent reduction of both VOC and NO X appears to be necessary for ozone attainment by 2005. The reduction requirements for the Sacramento area are slightly lower, but still amount to roughly 40 percent for VOC and 30 percent for NO X by 1999 or 2005. Finally, approximately a 45 percent reduction in CO emissions is needed in order to attain the CO standard in the South Coast Air Basin by 2000. 6 Ground-level ozone, more commonly known as smog, is formed when nitrogen oxides (NO X ) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) react with high temperatures. Strategies for reducing smog generally require reductions in both VOC and NO X emissions. Ozone causes health problems by damaging lung tissue and sensitizing the lungs to other irritants. 2. Selection of Control Strategies EPA's selection of control strategies for the FIP areas began with a review of the existing emissions inventories to determine which pollution source categories were present in each area and the extent to which each category contributed ozone precursor (VOC and NO X ) pollutant emissions. All mobile source categories are present in each FIP area with the exception of ocean-going vessels in Sacramento, but the relative importance of individual mobile source categories varies significantly among the three areas. While the South Coast area includes most industrial and commercial source categories, the emissions inventory for the Sacramento area includes very few of these sources. The importance of agriculture in Ventura County is reflected in the unusual proportion of that area's VOC inventory assigned to pesticides use. More details on the inventory profile for each area may be found in sections II.A and III.H. For stationary sources, EPA next reviewed the extent to which each category was currently controlled under either federal, state, or local regulations. In those few cases where the existing level of control failed to meet existing national requirements for application of reasonably available control technology (RACT), EPA prepared remedial regulations for specific industrial sources identified in section III.C.2., below. EPA then reviewed the potential for further reductions from each stationary source category in each area, based on upgrading the level of control to match that required by the best existing rules, by further enhancements to existing rules to reflect available technology, or by imposing requirements that could be met through technology transfer from similar sources. From this exercise, EPA selected and prepared most of the industrial and commercial source control measures discussed in section III.C.3. That brings us to the first decision point where the awkwardness of having the federal government undertaking air quality planning for a particular state or locality becomes obvious. How will the remaining emission reductions be apportioned among mobile sources, factories, and consumer products and services? The choice is best made with both a consideration of the costs and benefits associated with particular control measures and a knowledge of the local impacts that will occur when a specific choice is made. In addition, each locality has a different mix of industries in different states of economic health and with differing capabilities to absorb the costs of emission control.
