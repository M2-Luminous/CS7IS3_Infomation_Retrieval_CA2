At the same time he is of the opinion that the relations with Russia, with which markets of commodities, raw materials and technology are linked, are being restrained by the Dniester area's uncertain status. For example, Marakutsa said, "we agree to independently repay debts to Russia for gas but the Russian Gazprom signed an appropriate agreement only with the Moldavian [Moldovan] Government." In connection with the fact that the Dniester Republic, which has not been recognised by Moldavia, cannot pay with its own products and money for gas supplied by Russia, Marakutsa suggests taking the road followed by Baltic states, Ukraine and Byelorussia [Belarus]. His opinion is that one can pay for the supplied raw materials and energy resources by property, the establishment of joint ventures and apply other economic forms of cooperation.
