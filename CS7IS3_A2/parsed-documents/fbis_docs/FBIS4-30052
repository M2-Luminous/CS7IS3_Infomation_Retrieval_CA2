"It's a great honor that the Korean Government has recommended me as a candidate for the position, but at the same time I feel a heavy responsibility to compete for the post at the world organization which is called the United Nations of the economy," Kim said in an interview. He explained that the new WTO secretary-general is entitled to officially launch the trade body next Jan. 1 or at the earliest possible date thereafter. The new secretary-general, he continued, should also push for negotiations on the service sector that are still pending after the Uruguay Round. In addition, the group's chief must exercise leadership in solving the myriad world trade problems linked to the environment, economic policies, labor standards and technology policies, he noted.
