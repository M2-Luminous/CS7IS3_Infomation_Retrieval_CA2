The second privately operated mobile communications system is scheduled to go into operation in early 1994. The system will be operated in the Berlin and Leipzig regions. Herbert Brenke complains that "whenever E-Plus looks for sites for its transmitters, it finds that D1 and D2 have already been there." The managing director of E-Plus Mobilfunk, the third largest mobile communications company, knew as early as April 1993 what lay in store for him. He would have to try to operate in the same market that his competitors Telekom and Mannesmann had entered two years earlier. The launching of the new system is to be in eastern Germany, where the need to catch up in the communications field is still great. The inauguration of services in Berlin and Leipzig simultaneously signals the rapidity with which the networks between Ruegen and the Thuringian Forest will be connected up. Since unification, Telekom has accomplished an incomparable feat in East Germany. In its "Telekom 2000 Program," this government-operated company set forth the schedule according to which the state-of-the-art of communications in the new federal states was to be brought up to the level existing in West Germany. Telekom is already way ahead of its own schedule. It will conclude work on the digital communications system this year. In the first half of 1993 alone, 540,000 customers in eastern Germany were provided with telephone service, i.e., 53% more than in the entire previous year. Some 3,500 public telephones were installed this year, mostly in rural areas; 12,000 phones had to be replaced, 5,000 of which were inoperable. The rapid tempo was made possible by the expeditious installation of most of the digital trunk node exchanges and the 500 local digital exchanges. Every second local network was substantially expanded and modernized. In late September, Quedlinburg and Gera became the first cities in the world to have a fiber-glass system in operation. "These are the kind of accomplishments that bring the company considerable favorable recognition from abroad," Dr. Wilhelm Paellmann, Telekom board member, said. With its 11 billion German marks [DM] invested, Telekom is the greatest single investor in the new federal states this year. A considerable volume of the tasks in data and mobile communications has already been resolved. Telekom established its mobile communications sector this summer. The 100% subsidiary is called "DeTeMobil." It is designed to make D1-system users more flexible. D1 has at least 315,000 customers in Germany. However, neither the subsidiary nor the parent company enjoys the profits, since all proceeds go into the common Post Office pot. Nonetheless, Brenke, the head of E-Plus, has to reckon with both governmental as well as private mobile communications competition. He has to operate with another handicap as well. While the D-systems operate in the Global System for Mobile Communications Standard at 900 mHz, the E-Plus system is designed for a frequency range of 1.8 GHz. It transmits and receives in the Standard DCS 1800 (Digital Personal Communication System). However, given the same transmitting power, the range of the higher frequencies is less. Consequently, a transmitting and receiving station in the E-system can only service a smaller area than one in the D-system. In its final expansion, E-Plus will have 4,000 to 6,000 cells in Germany. Even Brenke doesn't know the final number yet. It depends on the locations of the base stations. In large cities, the radius of operation is between one and three kilometers, while in a flat landscape it can be up to 20 kilometers. Brenke's wish is for infrastructure-sharing: "We would gladly share transmitting masts and other facilities with our competitors." Unfortunately, the market is a battle field. The head of E-Plus is now hoping for a developmental breakthrough in the matter of base stations and mobile telephones. He expects smaller, lighter, and more powerful equipment and facilities so that he would not have to incur the same expenditures as his two competitors. Brenke knows that there are also certain advantages when one enters the market later. Potential customers have already accepted mobile communications. In addition, the technology has already matured and been perfected and can be procured at cheaper rates. In late October, ESCOM offered Motorola's International-3200 Handy along with the D2-card for a measly DM389. This offer could drive the second million mobile communications customers, who have been waiting for digital systems and cheaper equipment, into the open arms of E-Plus Mobilfunk GmbH. But even this order of magnitude does not satisfy the ambitious Herr Brenke at all. In the year 2000, ten million customers will be using mobile communications systems in Germany. Brenke will have a large part of them. His marketing strategy is to open up new layers of buyers. "Mobile communications must assume the certain aura of elegance. If they are to be considered affordable, the potential private customers will have to be convinced that the mobile telephone will create new possibilities and a greater degree of personal freedom."
