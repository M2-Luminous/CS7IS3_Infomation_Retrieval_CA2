[Spadolini] In 1987 I passed from a position in the political battle, as a party secretary, to the position of an impartial arbiter, which is what the Senate speakership is, or, rather, should be. An arbiter during some very exciting years. It was a sharp break, a new way of approaching issues. A radical change of lifestyle, of outlook -- approaching every issue in accordance with my impartial role, at the very time when the crisis of the parties became more acute, the system of party domination became more invasive, and corruption -- which I condemned back at the time of P-2 [outlawed Masonic lodge] -- grew worse. [Valentini] What is your personal and political assessment of this experience? [Spadolini] It is the assessment of someone who never adapted to the patterns of what is now being called the "First Republic," though that is a misleading term. I realized the need for innovation and consistently devoted myself to modifying parliamentary rules during the 10th legislative period. I also broached the issue of the reform of the Senate, the first example in Italian history of an assembly correcting itself. [Valentini] What could the Senate role be in the future? Some people argue that it should become the Chamber of the Regions.... [Spadolini] Under my speakership, there was a debate on the rationalization of relations between the two houses, in which the theory of so-called procedural bicameralism prevailed. That is, the theory that envisages a limited number of necessarily bicameral laws and, apart from that, an acceleration of the progress of bills through parliament by means of "silent assent." I see that there is talk now about major simplifications and major innovations in the Senate too, which depends on its traditions. Well, there are hundreds of acts of the Constitutional Affairs Committee to be assessed. There are the conclusions of the Bicameral Committee on Institutional Reforms, including the idea of increasing the powers of regional government, without the Senate's becoming something like Germany's Bundesrat, since Italy is not a federal state. What is certain is that it will not be necessary to start from scratch. Nothing in history is invented. [Valentini] What role do you intend to assume now? Will you be leader of the opposition in the Senate? [Spadolini] No. Leader of the constitution. I intend to be the leader of the forces that identify with a sincere and profound constitutional reformism, but without overturning or disrupting the Constitution. This, always within a European outlook: the Italian nation as part of the European nation. [Valentini] Does that mean that you are opposed to any institutional revision? [Spadolini] There has always been confusion between the commitment to institutional revision -- concerning the form of government -- and an outright subversion of the form of the state. The former path can be pursued; the latter cannot. It is one thing to talk about a parliamentary, presidential, or semi-presidential republic, or one based on a chancellorship. It is quite another matter to question the form of the state. There must be no ambiguities about this. There is only one republic and it is indivisible. The same applies to the fundamental principles of the first articles of the Constitution. [Valentini] But the new majority does intend to modify it, by means of the twofold reading by the two houses, as envisaged by Article 138. How legitimate do you think this is? [Spadolini] Article 138 originated under the proportional system. Under a first-past-the-post system there should have been, and there must be, more guarantees. It was a mistake not to have provided them. Be that as it may, as things stand, any modification of the Constitution must take place through scrupulous observance of the constitutional charter. And that includes Article 138. [Valentini] Can the government alignment do this on its own, by dint of parliamentary votes? [Spadolini] Any plan for the reform of the Constitution must necessarily be the result of a debate that cannot be confined to the narrow parameters of a majority. No coups d'etat. The Constitution is an asset belonging to the entire country, to the forces of both the majority and the opposition. The ideal forum within which to develop institutional reforms is parliament. And that alone. [Valentini] But on the basis of the new first-past-the-post system, the winning alignment is claiming the right to decide autonomously. [Spadolini] Let us be clear about this: When we refer to the first-past-the-post system, we do so entirely incorrectly. The first-past-the-post system presupposes the presence of consistent and compact forces that sought votes in order to govern together. Here we have a completely different kind of alliance. Three parties brought together with all kinds of reservations which are tantamount to differences, contrasting stances, and splits, some of them deep. The first events on the parliamentary agenda will show us whether a numerical majority -- which does not even exist in the Senate -- also constitutes a political majority. This is the real test. [Valentini] You have always been a defender of national unity. Do you think that the plan for federalism put forward by the League could jeopardize our country's identity? [Spadolini] I have not yet seen any federalist blueprint worthy of the name. I have seen scribbles, notes, and fragments. If anything, I have seen a confederal-type plan which outlines a voluntary association of independent states. This negates the first and second Risorgimento. [Valentini] With regard to presidentialism, some support the direct election of the chief of state, while others advocate that of the prime minister. What do you think is the most efficient solution for ensuring greater governability? [Spadolini] The presidential republic is an entirely respectable idea. But I think that the German system of the chancellor is preferable, the best antidote to the instability of governments. The direct election of the prime minister, however, could bring about a situation in which the prime minister elected directly by the people is not matched by an adequate and corresponding parliamentary majority, with all the easily imagined problems that this would entail. I would call this quite irresponsible. [Valentini] Having been defeated by a single vote [for Senate speakership], do you consider yourself the first victim of the Second Republic? [Spadolini] I do not consider myself defeated at all. I did not want to win, either by one vote or by five. I merely accepted the idea of an agreement on my candidacy on the part of the future government parties and the future opposition parties -- what is known as an institutional majority. There was no majority in the Senate. So it is very rash to regard the Senate on the same basis as the lower house. We tried to avert a laceration (or something even worse) and were successful. Now I am regaining complete freedom of action and resuming the same civilized battle that I have always waged. [Valentini] In this transition from old to new, do you not think nevertheless that you have disregarded the fact that you represented the previous system? [Spadolini] But what is new? I am not a professional politician; I did not emerge from any apparatus. I joined the Senate at the age of 47, as an independent within the Italian Republican Party, having made my way in life through my historical research and journalism. It takes some nerve for those who, out of respect for the system of party domination, are deciding everything -- even whether or not a ministry should be subdivided (what a mistake to think of splitting the Interior Ministry in two!) -- behind closed doors, for them to talk in terms of "the new." The so-called First Republic -- an expression that I do not like -- never went that far. No, quite frankly, I really do feel that I represent the new. [Valentini] Will it prove possible to correct the electoral law? Which would be better: a plain single-candidate system or two rounds? [Spadolini] I am in favor of two rounds, which would facilitate the establishment of homogeneous majorities and enable the people's will to be fully expressed, within the complexity of our political life. A plain single-candidate system presupposes an entirely different history. It should be pondered extremely carefully before adopting it. [Valentini] In recent days you have been mentioned as a possible guarantor, or super-guarantor, to be set alongside the next prime minister.... [Spadolini] Yes, the newspapers have spoken about it. I have received no proposals in this regard, and I would not even have discussed them unless they had been accompanied by adequate instruments. Be that as it may, there is an issue regarding the private television companies owned by the prime minister-designate, and no one should think that it can be avoided by means of humorous rejoinders.
