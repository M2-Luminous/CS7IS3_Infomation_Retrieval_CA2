Security Council is expected to adopt a resolution on the North Korean nuclear situation around the end of this month, a Foreign Ministry official said Friday. "The five permanent members of the council are in the middle of actively exchanging opinions on the content and strength of the resolution right now. They're almost finished and the resolution is likely to be decided soon," the official said. The content is said to be rather weak so that China will not exercise its veto power, the official said. The key point in the resolution is the International Atomic Energy Agency's additional demand to inspect two sites inside North Korea's radiochemical laboratory, believed to be a nuclear reprocessing facility, that were sealed off from earlier monitoring. "The general feeling is that adoption of the resolution should not be too late," he said.
