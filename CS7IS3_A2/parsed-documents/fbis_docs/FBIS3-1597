He answered reporters' questions about the international and regional situation and China's relations with South Asian nations. Replying to a question on the idea of a nuclear-free zone in South Asia, Qian Qichen pointed out: The domestic situations in most South Asian countries are stabilizing. The relations among countries in the region have been improving, and regional cooperation is also being developed. However, there are still some destabilizing factors in South Asia. There are still some differences among the countries of the region. He said: China supports the proposition of a South Asia nuclear-free zone. China also hopes that an arms race would not occur in the region. An arms race will not benefit peace and stability in the region. On Sino-Indian relations, Qian Qichen said: Since the normalization of Sino-Indian relations, we have been satisfied with the development of bilateral relations. We hold that the development of Sino-Indian relations should by no means affect China's friendly cooperation with other countries in the region. We hope that the development of Sino-Indian relations will aid the development of China's cooperative relations with South Asia as a whole. Qian Qichen emphasized: Tibet is an inalienable part of China's territory, and the Indian Government has more than once openly acknowledged this fact. China hopes that India will handle some existing questions in accordance with this principle. As regards the Kashmir issue, Qian Qichen said: China's policy on the issue remains unchanged. China hopes that India and Pakistan can resolve the problem through friendly and peaceful negotiations in accordance with the United Nation's resolutions and the relevant agreements reached between the two countries.
