"But there is nothing new about that," he told DIE WELT yesterday. "I have never been in a state of euphoria, and I kept saying that the middle of the year would be a problematic time." "The current situation is difficult because the coalition parties might create the impression that everyone is in a positive mood," Verheugen continued. "In addition the outcome of the European elections is unforeseeable, just as the outcome of the presidential elections was." At the same time, Verheugen described the SPD situation as "stable." "The objective of the forthcoming party congress in Halle must be to eradicate all signs of a depressive mood." In the meantime, the SPD is concerned about getting rid of the impression that there might be differences of opinion on central issues concerning election strategy. Verheugen described rumors that he and party chief Scharping were at odds with each other concerning a coalition statement as "pure speculation." "The voters continue to determine the makeup of coalitions," he said. Therefore, the Halle party congress cannot adopt any specific statements apart from the one that the SPD does not want a grand coalition. In answer to a question about his remarks about the Greens being interpreted as a desire for an alliance with that party, Verheugen said he had merely wanted to express various options. "In this matter, I am in complete agreement with Scharping," he said. The SPD chairman is generally considered in favor of a socioliberal alliance. In the meantime, voices can be heard within the SPD saying that the Halle congress will insist on the SPD sharpening its political countenance. "That need not necessarily lead to a coalition statement, but an alternative to the present government must be presented with greater determination than so far. The accompanying difficulties are being seen with increasing clarity. Last but not least, it remains to be seen in what way reforms, such as the environmental reforms concerning industry, can be financed," said Verheugen.
