As a result, the state- owned industrial enterprises are continuing to play a dominant and backbone role in Shanghai's industry and economy. According to statistics, the total sales value of Shanghai's state-owned enterprises rose year after year -- 15.7 percent in 1991, 10.9 percent in 1992, and 2.3 percent in 1993, as compared with the year before. The 1993 sales income amounted to 158.3 billion yuan, accounting for 56.6 percent of the total sales income of Shanghai's independent-accounting industrial enterprises. In the three years, the total amount of profit delivery and tax payment made by state-owned independent-accounting industrial enterprises rose 15.7 percent in 1991, 1.7 percent in 1992, and 12.9 percent in 1993, over the previous year. In 1993, their profit delivery and tax payment totalled 21.1 billion yuan, accounting for 55 percent of the total amount made by Shanghai's independent-accounting industrial enterprises. In 1993, the state-owned industrial enterprises covered in local budget earned $2,196 million in foreign exchange from export trade, and their earnings accounted for 29.5 percent of Shanghai's total foreign exchange earnings in the year. Shanghai has enhanced the overall strength of its state-owned industrial enterprises mainly because of its efforts in deepening reforms and changing the operational mechanisms of enterprises. At present, most of Shanghai's state-owned industrial enterprises have been given the decisionmaking power in operation. The ratio of mandatory plans has dropped to 2.4 percent in Shanghai. The number of products subject to price control by the municipal government has been reduced to seven. The state-owned industrial enterprises have made great efforts to open up market with the development of products of high marketability, quality, and economic returns. In 1993, the sales rate of their products exceeded 98 percent. In the meantime, new internal operational mechanisms are taking shape within enterprises. The labor contract system, operating and marketing mechanism, development mechanism, and motivational mechanism have been gradually set up, and the local accounting system is converging with the international accounting practice. As of the end of 1993, the 1,118 state-owned industrial enterprises covered in local budget were practicing the labor contract system for full-time workers, as well as the job post contract system [shang gang he tong zhi 0006 1511 0678 0681 0455]. These systems, concerning 1.49 million workers and staff members, have helped reduce surplus personnel, widen the wage difference, and arouse the enthusiasm among workers and staff members. The number of marketing personnel in state-owned enterprises have generally increased, and they now account for 2 to 3 percent of the total number of workers and staff members. A sales contract system has been implemented. In Shanghai, 147 enterprises (involving 1,108 factories) have been given the import-export trade authority. In 1993, the foreign exchange earnings from their export trade totaled $835 million, up 38 percent from 1992. In recent years, Shanghai's state-owned industrial enterprises have accelerated the shift from an adaptive structural readjustment to a strategic structural readjustment. They have invested more than 50 billion yuan in technological transformation focusing on a number of key projects, and have imported advanced technology and equipment. As a result, more than 1,400 old state-owned enterprises have greatly improved their products, technology and equipment, so that their technological level remains higher than other industrial enterprises in Shanghai. Shanghai has accelerated the development of a number of new pillar industries and technologies, based on state-owned industrial enterprises. In 1993, the total sales volume of six pillar industries -- iron and steel, automobile, telecommunications equipment, power station equipment, petrochemical, and household electric appliances -- amounted to 106.9 billion yuan, accounting for 33 percent of Shanghai's total industrial sales value. In recent years, a number of Shanghai's state-owned industrial enterprises, using foreign capital and local private funds, have run joint ventures or turned themselves into limited liability joint-stock companies. In 1993, the total sales income of those joint ventures and limited liability companies whose shares are under state control was 236.7 billion yuan, accounting for 84 percent of Shanghai's total industrial sales income; and the total amount of their profit delivery and tax payment was 32.8 billion yuan, accounting for 84 percent of the total profit delivery and tax payment made by all industrial enterprises in Shanghai. Many of Shanghai's state-owned industrial enterprises are old enterprises with old factory buildings, old equipment, and old products. During the course of shifting to socialist market economic structure, their efforts to improve economic efficiency are impeded by their economic setup, industrial structure, and internal weakness. This is why some state-owned industrial enterprises are having difficulties and a small number of them are operating in deficits, while other state-owned industrial enterprises continue to play a dominant role in economy. To deal with the problem, the municipal party committee and the municipal government, acting in accordance with General Secretary Jiang Zemin's instructions on "having a new concept of development and truly switching onto the track of enhancing economic efficiency," are continuing to deepen reforms, adopt effective measures, and strive to make all Shanghai's state-owned enterprises operate successfully.
