Viewed by Premier Vacaroiu as the most significant, the agreement on trade and economic cooperation (signed by Minister of Trade Cristian Ionescu, on behalf of Romania, and by Liliana Canale, the Peruvian minister of industries, tourism, integration and international trade negotiations) stipulates the principles for trade operations based on market economy rules. The Romanian premier and his Peruvian counterpart Efrain Goldenberg, who is also Peru's foreign minister, sealed an agreement for investment mutual guarantee and protection. The third document -- the collaboration agreement between the National Agricultural University "La Molina" in Peru and the Bucharest Agricultural University -- was signed by Education Minister Liviu Maior on Romania's behalf and by Jose Dance Caballero, rector of the Peruvian institution. Also sealed were two understandings by an exchange of letters signed by the two countries' foreign ministers, one setting up a mechanism of consultation between the two ministers, and another for free diplomatic, special and service visas. Before the signing ceremony, Romanian Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu and his Peruvian counterpart, Efrain Goldenberg (whose parents are Bessarabian natives), had an interview during which stress was laid on "the extremely fine ties" between Romania and Peru. Also on Monday, another agreement was signed by Aurel Ghibutiu, president of Romania's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, with the leadership of the National Confederation of Private Employers Institutions, which stipulates the setting up of a collaboration committee and envisages Peruvian economic missions to Romania.
