Moreover, it is also possible to use this material as a gas detector. The fact that the stoichiometry is controllable when the layer structure is synthesized and the lack of defects in the crystal package reduce the effect of chemical activity of the working medium. In the broad range of partial hydrogen pressures, the ZnSe layer is characterized by a relative change in resistance of 5-50% with little sluggishness, fast recovery and a good reproducibility rate for the results. 2 figures, 5 references
