The eyewitnesses said that at least 10 people were wounded in the clash and "scores" arrested. Demonstrators assembled at the Ghalu Bandak [as transliterated] crossroads in southern Tehran near the bazaar, shouting slogans of protest at high prices, the scarcity of food supplies, and shortage of medicine. They also denounced corruption. The eyewitnesses said "hundreds" took part in the demonstration. They said that security forces surrounded the demonstration and fired shots in the air. As a result a number of demonstrators were wounded, while security forces arrested "scores" of them. The value of the Iranian riyal has dropped over the past two months by 40 percent, causing the prices of local and imported commodities, especially essential ones, to rise at rates exceeding 80 percent. The soaring prices provoked a tide of demonstrations in a number of Iranian cities. Last Saturday Central Bank Governor Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli blamed government economic establishments for the high prices. Local media services said that car assembly plants belonging to the public sector have increased the prices of their products by 30 percent in less than a month. As is known, the Iranian regime bans media services from broadcasting any reports about antiregime demonstrations. It also accuses demonstrations of "being hostile to the revolution and Islam." And the publication law considers broadcasting such reports "collaboration with the enemies" and imposes severe punishment for violators.
