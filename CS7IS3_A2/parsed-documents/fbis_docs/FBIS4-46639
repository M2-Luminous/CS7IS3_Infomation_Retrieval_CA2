This question, very topical today, is arising more and more often for the commanders of flight units and formations. The young armed forces of our nation, after all, still do not have enough experience of their own. What was accumulated during the times of the former Soviet Union is not very useful--the army structures have changed and the Military Doctrine is completely different, as are views of the possible nature of combat operations and the employment of armed formations in general. It is thus necessary to gather, summarize and analyze, bit by bit, everything that we are able to get during flights and training. A whole series of measures have thus been carried out in the Air Forces of Ukraine for this purpose--practical-science conferences, seminars, operational-tactical training etc. The corresponding work in this area is being carried out by the lower echelons as well. The 14th Air Army, commanded by Lieutenant-General Viktor Lyashenko, has conducted an operational-mobilization training session of the command personnel of the larger units and formations. It was held for five days at the Lviv training area. Here is what Colonel Leonid Podnosov, acting chief of staff of the army, had to say about this session: "First, we studied--or rather, devised--new views on the utilization of frontal and army aviation in defensive combat operations," he said. "The participants in the session diligently studied the experience of combat operations during armed conflicts in recent years, and first and foremost the employment of aviation in them. A considerable role, by the way, was assigned to it. The combat operations in the Persian Gulf testify to that. The combined armed forces of the NATO countries carried out a quite prolonged bombing of the battle positions and military facilities of Iraq before the ground forces entered into battle." "Aviation was used quite recently on the part of some Western powers on the territory of the former Yugoslavia in order to halt the combat operations of the warring sides. Other examples could also be cited. "All of these were cases in which aviation was employed in order to carry out preemptive strikes. We need primarily skills in the utilization of air power in defensive combat operations, since Ukraine has no intention of being the first to attack anyone. We are thus trying to perceive the experience of the cases cited above in a different way. We are selecting only what we need. That was emphasized both in the lectures given by the chiefs of directorates and services, and in the speeches of participants in the session during the group seminar. "However rich other peoples' experience may be, however," emphasized Colonel Podnosov, "you cannot get by without your own as well. And we do have some of our own, even if it is not all that rich. Tactical exercises were conducted recently, as is well known, by a motorized-rifle regiment with live firing at the Lviv training area. Aviation took an active part in it, with the delivery of on-board weaponry. The leaders of our army intentionally saw to it that more aircraft and helicopters were allotted to this exercise than were stipulated by tactical norms. This was done, first of all, so as to give as many of the fliers as possible, from all branches of aviation, the opportunity to gain some skills. They had one task--know the capabilities of your aircraft during the performance of combat operations, so as to defend the territory of our nation. And they were able to do so." Almost all of the unit commanders whose aviation subunits were assigned to the exercises--the experienced pilots Colonels Anatoliy Baranov, Oleksiy Kotov and Volodymyr Tsymbal, among others--expressed their ideas during the session with regard to new forms of combat employment of aircraft and helicopters. All of this provided grounds to conclude that the assigned tasks were achieved by the session. All participants gained a certain amount of the experience that they need in their everyday combat training. It would be worthwhile to add to the story of Colonel Leonid Podnosov that the assembly was conducted in quite interesting and intensive fashion. The most diverse types of instruction were employed in it. They included, aside from the lectures, tactical drills and seminars during which each of the officers was able to express his opinion or point of view, make a suggestion or share his own experience. Staff gaming was also conducted here, during which the operation of command-and-control structures was practiced. A number of demonstration classes, including on the troop services, were also held for the participants in the assembly. A visit was organized to a tank regiment of the Zaliznyy Division, where the commanders of aviation units were shown how the soldiers of that model military garrison live, serve, train and relax. It would also be worthwhile to point out that the assembly did not require a great deal of material funding.
