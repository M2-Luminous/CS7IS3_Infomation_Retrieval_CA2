This is always an enigma. International human rights organizations and Amnesty International have made painstaking efforts to discover the facts. The CPC authorities have never made public the relevant figures. Between 7 and 9 April, at the national work conference attended by heads of the public security organs, the state security organs, the armed police units, and the judicial organs, the CPC authorities for the first time revealed the numbers of people charged with the counterrevolutionary crimes of subversion, sedition, and sabotage, or who were serving prison terms after being found guilty of such crimes, or who had been arrested and detained on suspicion of such crimes. According to the reports submitted by the local public security and judicial departments and the statistical materials (up to the end of March 1994), 1,730 people were serving prison terms after being found guilty of counterrevolutionary crimes. At that time, 87 people had been arrested and were awaiting trial on charges of counterrevolutionary crimes. More than 160 people were being detained for investigations. Prisoners of this type released on bail or receiving medical treatment outside prison but still deprived of political rights numbered 135. The following are the numbers of prisoners jailed in some localities: Qinghai, more than 380. Sichuan, 357. Anhui, 82. Guizhou, more than 100. Liaoning, 66. Xinjiang, 220. Yunnan, more than 60. Ningxia, 83. Hunan, 37. Hebei, 41. Shaanxi, more than 60. Beijing, 28. Jiangxi, 46. Tibet, more than 80. The above figures are cited from the document (file number 940028) issued by the Ministry of Justice on 6 April.
