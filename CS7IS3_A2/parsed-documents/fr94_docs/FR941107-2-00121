FR941107-2-00121 FR941107-2-00068 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,942] Fuelco; Denver, CO; Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration On September 19, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration for workers and former workers of the subject firm. This notice will soon be published in the Federal Register . The workers were previously certified eligible to apply for trade adjustment assistance under petition TA&hyph;W&hyph;27,295 which expired on July 22, 1994. Findings on reconsideration show decreased sales in the first 10 months of 1994 compared to the same period in 1993. Substantial worker separations occurred in 1994. A further finding shows that the subject firm is expected to close in the first quarter of 1995 when all workers will be laid off. U.S. imports of crude oil and natural gas increased absolutely and relative to domestic shipments in the twelve month period beginning in April 1993 and ending in March 1994. On reconsideration, the Department surveyed other customers of Fuelco and found that they reduced their purchases from Fuelco and increased their import purchases. Conclusion After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that the Fuelco workers in Denver, Colorado were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with natural gas or crude oil produced by Fuelco in Denver, Colorado. All workers of Fuelco in Denver, Colorado who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after July 22, 1994 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974. Signed at Washington, DC, this 27th day of October 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.
