This was learned at the "International Seminar on Soilless Cultivation" held here last week. Vegetables like tomatoes, aubergines, peppers and cucumbers raised in soilless hothouses have been supplied to markets all the year round in some provinces and cities. Rice is the main grain crop grown using this technique. China's Agriculture Ministry began to research soilless cultivation in 1985, with more than 30 colleges and agricultural research institutes taking part in the project. Vegetables grown this way have many advantages, such as saving water and fertilizer, high output, fine quality and resistance to pests. Meanwhile, progress has been made in planting rice on water surfaces. Such rice in Zhejiang Province has an output of 7,500 kg. per ha. Soilless cultivation helps to makes good use of China's inland water resources and build them into grain production areas, which, it is hoped, will help China to solve the contradiction between population increase and the shrinkage of arable land. If the technique were spread to China's current 10-million-ha lake surfaces and 4.3-million-ha reservoir water surfaces, it would bring about great economic and social benefits, according to specialists. They predict that soilless cultivation will become the next trend in agricultural development in both China and other parts of the world.
