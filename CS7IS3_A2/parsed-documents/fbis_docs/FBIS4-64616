The bank, owned by a leading industrial group, has been suffering from a shortage of foreign currency funds and failed to meet foreign currency obligations to hundreds of customers recently. It cannot repay foreign exchange accounts to depositors, who wish to close such accounts or withdraw a major portion of their savings, sources said. One senior banker said a group of leading banks were warned by the "authorities" that this bank was in serious crisis and that the group should act accordingly. "Like a few others, we received an official letter of warning noting that...bank had for some time failed to meet foreign exchange obligations to its customers because of a shortage of foreign funds," explained the same source, who asked not to be named. He mentioned reports that most of the foreign exchange depositors have been given repayment dates in the future. "This might be a temporary liquidity problem. Yet the letter signals that things might actually be much worse," he said. Meanwhile, the Treasury declared that it had no fault in "not warning" the relevant parties on time before the collapse of three banks; TYT [Foreign Trade] Bank, Marbank and Impexbank. It said in a written statement that the officials had carried out the necessary (financial) supervision and ruled out any delays and negligence with cases of three collapsed banks. The Treasury had come under fire for not warning (at least) the government banks about the worsening financial structures of the three banks and thus causing substantial public losses--at around $80 million. In a related development, Yalim Erez, chairman of the Turkish Union of Chambers and Bourses (TOBB) said on Friday [29 April] that the banks should either "do decent banking" or become extinct.
