FR941028-2-00041 FR941028-2-00027 Panhandle states that, in a further effort to improve the jurisdictional pipeline operations of the facilities located west of its Haven, Kansas Compressor Station, the abandonment proposed herein would enable Panhandle to streamline its jurisdictional operations, to reduce its existing transportation rates and to assure producers and shippers that gathering services in the future would not only continue to be available but would be provided on a more efficient and competitive basis. Panhandle proposes to abandon by sale to AGC approximately 126 miles of pipeline, ranging in size of 6-inch to 26-inch in diameter, 7 compressor stations, and 8 measuring and regulating stations, as more fully described in Exhibits Z-1 and Z-2 of its application. Panhandle states that the facilities would be sold at the book value of the facilities, $22,700,000. Panhandle also states that, in addition to the purchase price, AGC has also agreed to pay Panhandle $4.0 million to cover environmental-related costs and $1.3 million to cover the costs associated with the modifications to the Elkhart Station. It is indicated that Panhandle states that the purchase of its Hugoton Area facilities by AGC, who currently has a gathering system in a portion of the Hugoton Area, the HUGS System, would eliminate the need for the further construction by AGC of duplicative facilities and would allow Panhandle to continue its effort to utilize and operate its system in the most efficient manner and in an effort to continue providing the best service it can to its customers. Panhandle further states that the authorization of the abandonment would serve the public interest by reducing jurisdictional rate base and related cost of service, thereby having an impact on Panhandle's current Field Zone transmission rates. Panhandle also proposes to abandon by transfer to Field Services 10 units at the Elkhart Compressor Station located in Morton County, Kansas. Panhandle indicates that, if the remaining units at the station were not transferred to Field Services, they would become a non-contiguous isolated compressor station in the middle of gathering systems operated by AGC and Field Services. Panhandle states that these facilities would be transferred to Field Services at the net book value of those facilities, $1,472,440. Comment date: November 9, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 4. Anadarko Gathering Company [Docket No. CP95&hyph;22&hyph;000] Take notice that on October 14, 1994, Anadarko Gathering Company (AGC), 17001 Northchase Drive, Houston, Texas 77251, filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP95&hyph;22&hyph;000, as supplemented on October 17, 1994, requesting that the Commission declare that AGC's proposed acquisition, ownership, and operation of certain natural gas gathering systems and other facilities currently owned by Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company (Panhandle) would not subject AGC or any portion of its facilities or services to the jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act (NGA), all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. AGC seeks a declaratory order finding that: •The facilities described in its petition that AGC wishes to acquire from Panhandle will be gathering facilities exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act; •AGC will not be a ``natural gas company'' pursuant to Section 2 of the Natural Gas Act by virtue of its proposed acquisition, ownership, and operation of such facilities; •The gathering services to be performed by AGC will be non-jurisdictional gathering services exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act; and •AGC's rates, and charges for gathering services will not be subject to the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act. AGC states that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko). AGC indicates that it would acquire facilities directly from Panhandle as well as facilities currently owned by Panhandle but proposed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;151&hyph;000 to be transferred to Panhandle Field Services Company, Panhandle's affiliate. It is indicated that recently Panhandle and AGC (APC) concluded negotiations concerning the sale to AGC of Panhandle's Hugoton System. It is indicated that AGC's affiliate, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) produces approximately 76 percent of the natural gas connected to the subject facilities. AGC states that, subsequent to the transfer of facilities by Panhandle, it would upgrade the subject facilities to maximize productive capacities of the wells connected to the system. AGC also indicates that it would offer continuity of service to all existing gathering customers. It is argued that the facilities to be transferred to AGC meet the physical and non-physical criteria for determining gathering as set forth in Farmland Industries, Inc., 23 FERC ¶ 61.063 (1983), as modified by subsequent Commission orders. AGC states that the vast majority of the 1,147 miles of pipe are short in length and range from 2 to 26 inches in diameter, with 71 percent being 10 inches or less in diameter. AGC indicates that of the 29 percent of the facilities 12 inches in diameter or larger, all but 31 miles of the pipe are located behind field booster stations. AGC also indicates that the 31 miles of pipe on the discharge side of the Hugoton Compressor Station still serve to aggregate area gas production. Also, AGC submits that all of the facilities are located upstream of the Liberal Compressor Station, which it indicates is the central point in the field. In addition, AGC states that virtually all of the gathering systems are web-like or rib-like in configuration, with the facilities being located in a production area forming a network of short-length pipelines originating at wells and connecting to aggregation points. It is also indicated that the gathering facilities contain a total of 57 field booster compressor stations. AGC indicates that the suction pressures of the booster stations range from 30 to 375 psig, with 46 of the 57 stations having a suction pressure of less than 100 psig. AGC also states that wells are located all along the facilities. With respect to the operating pressure of the lines, a review of the operational pressures reveals that 87 percent of the pipelines operate below 100 psig, 10 percent operate above 100 psig but less than 450 psig, and 31 miles of pipe operate at above 450 psig. With respect to the non-physical criteria, AGC notes that Anadarko, its affiliate is primarily engaged in the exploration and production of natural gas and petroleum, with a working interest in 833 wells attached to the subject facilities. AGC also indicates that substantial effort would be expended to upgrade the gathering facilities to maximize the efficient production on natural gas benefitting both producers with wells connected to the gathering facilities and consumers consistent with the objectives of the NGA, Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and the Commission's Order No. 636. AGC requests that its petition be consolidated with Panhandle's abandonment application filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;21&hyph;000 which involves the abandonment by sale to Anadarko of a portion of the facilities at issue in AGC's petition. Comment date: November 18, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 5. Panhandle Field Services Company [Docket No. CP95&hyph;23&hyph;000] Take notice that on October 14, 1994, Panhandle Field Services Company (Field Services), 5400 Westheimer Court, Houston, Texas 77056&hyph;5310 filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP95&hyph;23&hyph;000, requesting that the Commission disclaim jurisdiction over services to be performed by Field Services involving facilities to be acquired from its affiliate, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company (Panhandle), all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Field Services seeks a declaratory order finding that: •Panhandle's South Elkhart Station and related facilities in Morton County, Kansas are facilities to be used for the gathering of natural gas and therefore exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act; •Field Services will not be a ``natural gas company'' pursuant to Section 2(6) of the Natural Gas Act by virtue of its proposed acquisition, ownership, and operation of such facilities; •Field Services' rates, and charges for gathering services will not be subject to the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act. Field Services states that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Panhandle and that the facilities at issue in this petition are the subject of Panhandle's abandonment application filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;21&hyph;000.
