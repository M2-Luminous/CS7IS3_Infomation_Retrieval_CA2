FBIS3-47327 "dreas008__a94014" FBIS-EAS-94-008-A Document Type:Daily Report 12 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Report on Changing UN PKO in Somalia Noted OW1101124794 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 10 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1101124794 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] Regarding UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report to the Security Council recommending a stop to efforts to disarm the fighting forces in Somalia by the use of force by UN troops, and switching to a more conventional type of PKO [peacekeeping operations], a senior Foreign Ministry official reacted calmly, claiming "this has been expected because the United States and other countries have expressed their wish to withdraw." The government has, so far, shown understanding of the idea of "peace enforcement force," although "due to constitutional constraints, it would not be possible for Japan to participate." As a nonpermanent member of the Security Council, Japan has approved of the dispatch of forces to Somalia and the former Yugoslavia. Therefore, it is interesting to see how the report will affect PKO in the former Yugoslavia, which has also been authorized to take action as a peace enforcement force similar to Somalia. Some members of the Liberal Democratic Party and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] believe that if it is under UN command, Japan can also participate in peace enforcement forces. However, right now, the government is even constrained in its participation in conventional PKO because the PKO Cooperation Law freezes participation in UN peacekeeping forces (PKF). The senior Foreign Ministry official said, "This report is not expected to affect Japan's policy on PKO." A more active debate on the use of force in PKO is expected to occur in light of the Butrus-Ghali report. In anticipation of a review of the PKO Cooperation Law in the future, this report will certainly create a stir in the domestic debate on UN intervention in regional conflicts.
