FR940603-0-00052 FR940603-0-00024 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 46 CFR Parts 12 and 16 [CGD 93&hyph;051] RIN 2115&hyph;AE54 Proof of Commitment To Employ Aboard U.S. Merchant Vessels AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard amends its regulations covering applicants for merchant mariner's documents to eliminate the requirement that the applicant provide proof of a commitment of employment as a member of the crew of a United States merchant vessel. Because of new requirements pertaining to applicants of merchant mariner's documents, the requirement for proof of a commitment of employment is no longer necessary. This action will relieve applicants and employers of an unnecessary regulatory burden. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 5, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Mrs. Justine Bunnell, Project Manager, Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environment Protection, and Ms. Helen Boutrous, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel. Regulatory History On December 6, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled ``Proof of Commitment to Employ Aboard U.S. Merchant Vessels'' in the Federal Register (58 FR 64278). The Coast Guard received four letters commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and one was not held. Background and Purpose Section 12.25&hyph;5 of title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations requires an applicant for an original merchant mariner's document (MMD) endorsed for service in ratings for which no professional examination is required to produce satisfactory proof of a commitment of employment (letter of commitment) as a member of the crew of a United States merchant vessel. This requirement was established in 1937 as a means to ensure that those persons obtaining MMDs were actually to be employed as merchant mariners. Because no fee or renewal requirements had been associated with application for an MMD, many applying for an MMD were doing so to obtain a desirable form of identification, and had no intention of seeking employment as a merchant mariner. On March 19, 1993, the Coast Guard published a final rule establishing user fees for services relating to marine licensing, certification of registry, and merchant mariner documentation (58 FR 15228). That rule established an issuance fee of $35 for an MMD with an additional $17 charge for an FBI criminal record check if the application is for an original MMD. As noted in the preamble of the user fee final rule, as a result of the user fee and other expenses, individuals with no intention of returning to sea may choose not to renew a license. Likewise, the user fee will deter individuals with no intention of obtaining employment as a member of the crew of a United States merchant vessel from applying for an MMD. For this reason, the Coast Guard now considers the requirement for a letter of commitment unnecessary, and the requirement is removed by this rulemaking. This final rule also makes conforming changes to 46 CFR part 16 to remove references to ``commitment of employment.'' Discussion of Comments and Changes Four comments were received during the comment period. All of the comments supported the rulemaking as proposed. Therefore, no changes have been included in this final rule. Regulatory Assessment This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. It is also not significant under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Assessment is unnecessary. This final rule will relieve applicants of the burden of obtaining a letter from a new employer evidencing the employer's commitment to hire the applicant. Employers will be relieved of the burden of supplying such letters. While the cost of obtaining and supplying such letters is considered minimal, this action will relieve industry and applicants of an unnecessary regulatory requirement. Small Entities This final rule will eliminate the requirement that an applicant provide proof of a commitment of employment as a member of the crew of a United States merchant vessel. The amendments will have minimal economic impact on the maritime industry. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .), that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This final rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .).
