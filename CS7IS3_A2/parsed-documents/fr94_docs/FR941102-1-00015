FR941102-1-00015 FR941102-1-00004 It would take approximately 7 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection at an average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspection proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $32,725, or $385 per airplane. It would take approximately 54 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed modification at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total impact of the modification proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $252,450, or $2,970. Based on above figures, the total cost impact of the proposed inspection and modification on U.S. operators is estimated to be $285,175, or $3,355/per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
