FR940705-0-00029 FR940705-0-00002 (7) The armor tape must be so applied as to enable the cable to pass the bend test as specified in paragraph (q)(1) of this section. (8) The protective coating on the steel armor must meet the Bonding-to-Metal, Heat Sealability, Lap-Shear and Moisture Resistance requirements of Type I, Class 2 coated metals in accordance with ASTM B 736&hyph;92a. (9) The ability of the plastic-clad metal to resist the flooding compound must be determined as required by ASTM D 4568&hyph;86 using a one meter length of coated steel which must be aged for 7 days at 68 # 1 â—‹C. There must be no delamination of the coating from the steel at the conclusion of the test. (10) When the jacket is bonded to the plastic coated armor, the bond between the plastic coated armor and the outer jacket must not be less than 525 newtons per meter over at least 90 percent of the cable circumference when tested in accordance with ASTM D 4565&hyph;90a. For cables with strength members embedded in the jacket, and residing directly over the armor, the area of the armor directly under the strength member is excluded from the 90 percent calculation. (l) Optional support messenger (aerial cable). (1) When a self-supporting aerial cable containing an integrated support messenger is supplied, the support messenger must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (l)(2) introductory text through (l)(6) of this section. (2) The fully flooded, stranded support messenger must be 6.35 millimeters diameter, 7 wire, extra high strength grade, Class A galvanized steel strand conforming to ASTM A 640&hyph;91 with exceptions and additional provisions as follows: (i) The maximum lay of the individual wires of the strand must be 140 millimeters. (ii) Any section of a completed strand containing a joint must have minimum tensile strength and elongation of 29,500 newtons and 3.5 percent, respectively, when tested in accordance with the procedures specified ASTM A 640&hyph;91. (iii) The individual wires from a completed strand which contain joints must not fracture when tested according to the ``Ductility of Steel'' procedures specified in ASTM A 640&hyph;91 except that the mandrel diameter must be equal to 5 times the nominal diameter of the individual wires. (3) The support strand must be completely covered with a corrosion protective floodant. The floodant must be homogeneous and uniformly mixed. (4) The floodant must be nontoxic and present no dermal hazard. (5) The floodant must be free from dirt, metallic particles, and other foreign matter that may interfere with the performance of the cable. (6) The floodant must be compatible with the polyethylene outer jacket and must be acceptable to REA. (7) Other methods of providing self-supporting cable specifically not addressed in this section may be allowed if accepted by REA. Justification for acceptance of a modified design must be provided to substantiate product utility and long term stability and endurance. (m) Outer jacket. (1) The outer jacket must provide the cable with a tough, flexible, protective covering which can withstand exposure to sunlight, to atmosphere temperatures and to stresses reasonably expected in normal installation and service. (2) The jacket must be free from holes, splits, blisters, or other imperfections and shall be as smooth and concentric as is consistent with the best commercial practice. (3) The raw material used for the outer jacket must be one of the five types listed in paragraphs (m)(3)(i) through (m)(3)(v) of this section. The raw material must contain an antioxidant to provide long term stabilization and the materials must contain a 2.60 # 0.25 percent concentration of furnace black to provide ultraviolet shielding. Both the antioxidant and furnace black must be compounded into the material by the raw material supplier. (i) Low density, high molecular weight polyethylene (LDHMW) must conform to the requirements of ASTM D 1248&hyph;84(1989), Type I, Class C, Category 4 or 5, Grade J3. (ii) Low density, high molecular weight ethylene copolymer (LDHMW) must conform to the requirements of ASTM D 1248&hyph;84(1989), Type I, Class C, Category 4 or 5, Grade J3. (iii) Linear low density, high molecular weight polyethylene (LLDHMW) must conform to the requirements of ASTM D 1248&hyph; 84(1989), Type I, Class C, Category 4 or 5, Grade J3.
