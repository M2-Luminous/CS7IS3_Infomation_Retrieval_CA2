"Historically speaking, South Africa has three cultural pillars--that of the whites, that of the Indians, and that of the blacks. Our task is to ensure that these three cultural groups cooperate to such a degree that a distinctive South African culture is created. "To attain this goal, my department has already set up a commission of reconstruction to determine, among other things, what we can do to stimulate art and culture in the townships and the rural areas, for this is where most of the people are. "We must begin with the premise that every person has the right to live in accordance with his own culture and to express its outward manifestations. We must accept the fact that every individual has the right to use his own language. "If, for example, I want to speak Afrikaans, then I speak Afrikaans, without apologizing to anyone. "The role of the government will simply be to bring the cultural groups together and to correct imbalances in the community. There are no organized cultural activities in black neighborhoods, for example. This state of affairs must be remedied. "But in the final analysis, the people have to play the most important role. All the people of the nation must reach consensus about how the imbalances of apartheid are to be put right." The ANC has definite plans concerning the continued existence of monuments and museums. "The first question that has to be asked is whether the museum in question is to have national, regional, or group status. "We are aware of the sensitivity and emotional content of such issues, but everyone has to accept the fact that changes are going to be made. "What, for example, is to become of Robben Island? Our contention is that it should become a monument that can serve as a symbol of the struggle against discrimination that was waged there. "The museums that now exist are not representative of the entire population. We want to change museums in places where people can see not only objects from the past, but also present-day items. Museums must be alive. There must be restaurants. People from the various population groups must get to know one another there. "Then there is the whole question of symbolism and statuary. The government must consult with the people of the nation on this score. All the people of the country must be convinced of the fact that all symbols and statues belong to everyone. This does not mean that the Voortrekker Monument or the statue of President Paul Kruger in Church Square, Pretoria will come crashing down after 27 April. "My feeling is that such monuments and statues must be left as they are. The question is simply this: Can they always be recognized as national symbols? Speaking of the Voortrekker Monument, I believe that this is not the case. Existing monuments and statues will only be eliminated if absolutely necessary." What about the names of symbols, cities or streets that remind us of the apartheid era, such as the town of Verwoerdburg? "This is once again a case where a new government must consult with the people of the nation concerning whether or not such names have an offensive content." Concerning the future of Afrikaans in a country with eleven official languages, Mr. Serote says that negotiations between the ANC and the government for the establishment of a language council are in progress. "We shall have to examine how each language is used in each province, how it is used in education, the media, and the world of work? "But if I wish to speak Afrikaans in parliament, I must be able to do so. If you go to see your doctor, you must be able to communicate with him in the language of your choice. All people feel strongly about their language. We must respect their feelings. "This holds true for education as well. An Afrikaans-speaking child must receive his instruction in Afrikaans. Concerning the question of a national flag and anthem, Mr. Serote says: "The ANC has put certain proposals before the Executive Transitional Council, and the council has to make decisions in this respect. Our proposal is that a new flag has to symbolize unity in South Africa. "Furthermore we have recommended six colors: green, yellow, red, white, blue, and black. "With respect to a new national anthem, the ANC has yet to make its final proposals. Whether "The Voice" will survive is a question that is still under discussion."
