In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Shusei Tanaka, special assistant to Hosokawa, said "the prime minister is not the type of person who seeks to cling to a position." "The prime minister has made it his principle to live up to his promises. His resignation is highly possible," Tanaka said. Tanaka, a House of Representatives member belonging to Sakigake (harbinger), was apparently referring to Hosokawa's promise to "take the responsibility" if he failed to push the political and electoral reform package through the Diet by Saturday's closure. The pledge has been widely interpreted to mean that Hosokawa would resign as prime minister. In the event of the killing of the reform bills, Hosokawa has the alternative of dissolving the House of Representatives for a snap general election, political sources say. Soon after assuming the premiership last August, Hosokawa vowed to take the responsibility if he could not achieve political reform by the end of 1993. But because of delays in deliberations in the House of Councillors, Hosokawa extended the deadline to coincide with the end of the current extension of the Diet session. The Diet session was extended once to last through Saturday. The upper house rejected the package last Friday. Tanaka said the possibility remains that Hosokawa may opt to dissolve the lower chamber and call a snap general election in lieu of disbanding his cabinet. Tanaka said, however, "the current economic situation does not allow for dissolution." Many economists and legislators say dissolving the Diet would further put off parliamentary passage of the fiscal 1994 state budget, needed to revive the floundering economy.
