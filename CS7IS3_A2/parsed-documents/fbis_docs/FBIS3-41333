Nevertheless, the PGR [Office of the Attorney General of the Republic] authorities warned that these chemical substances accelerate considerably the irreversible damage to the human body among persons consuming them. They are particularly harmful to the brain and other vital organs. The office noted that the drug dealers, faced with the large confiscations made and the destruction of over a million marijuana and poppy crops, are known to have been forced to curtail their activities. They must now import most of their narcotics, including the synthetic types processed mainly in the United States. By way of example, it mentioned the seizure of approximately 70 kg of Thai heroin, discovered in offices of the Mexican Postal Service in Tijuana and Ensenada, Baja California. It also gave a reminder of the interception, in the port of Manzanillo, Colima, of 10 tons of Colombian marijuana discovered in containers of vessels named Cordoba and Chimborazo. Furthermore, in Mazatlan, Sinaloa, the authorities confiscated a shipment of South American cocaine and cannabis indica worth millions. It stressed that, because of their strong intoxicating power, the synthetic or laboratory-produced drugs cause irreversible damage to the human body, and that, as a rule, those using them become automatically addicted.
