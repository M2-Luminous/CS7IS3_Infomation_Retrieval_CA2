Eijiro Hata, minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries did not deny, however, the newspaper's report that the agency informs trading companies of their share ahead of grain auctions. He said the procedures have been applied to imports of wheat, but not to the government's recent emergency imports of rice. Hata said that allotting shares for trading companies ahead of grain auctions "prevents excessive competition among trading firms and therefore puts a stop to excessively high or low prices." He said, however, that "improvements must be made where necessary," noting that the general public, unlike experts, might find it difficult to understand the procedures and could feel suspicious. In its Friday morning editions, the ASAHI said that the Agency gives written notifications to trading companies twice a year as to the share each will have in upcoming grain auctions. The daily said it obtained a paper dated October 1, 1993, sent from the director general of the Agency to one company stating, "We notify you that we have decided on the following," and giving the percentage share the company was to have in the wheat auction in latter half of fiscal 1993. After receiving the Agency's notifications, the trading companies routinely confer among themselves so that their bids would be in line with their allotted shares, the newspaper said. The ASAHI noted that such government instructions and "bid-rigging" have gone on for decades, and indicated that the practice was at the expense of the public.
