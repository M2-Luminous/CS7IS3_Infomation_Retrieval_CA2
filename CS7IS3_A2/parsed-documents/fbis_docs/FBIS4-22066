Refusing to specify whether the dead were SL members or civilians, Caceres said he had recently visited the region, and charged that military forces are "harming the civilian population" with helicopter attacks. Caceres said he had toured several areas in Huanuco's Leoncio Prado Province, where security forces are conducting the military operations. The legislator, who is a member of the Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD) Human Rights Committee, said he has asked the CCD to summon Defense Minister Victor Malca and Interior Minister Juan Briones to explain the situation in the region. Caceres has also asked the CCD to summon Attorney General Blanca Nelida Colan. In a communique issued 20 April the Defense Ministry denies that civilians are either being bombarded or attacked, and reports that the antiterrorist military operations were launched on 5 April. Moreover, a communique issued by the National Coordinating Board of Human Rights reports "massive crimes against a defenseless civilian population" in districts on the left bank of the Huallaga River. Citing settlers who have fled the region, the Coordinating Board reports that "armored helicopters are firing upon the civilian population, while military columns on land are torturing survivors, raping women, and burning down the peasants' huts." Peruvian media reports state that bombardments have been carried out during the 15 days the operation has lasted. The Lima newspaper "ONDA" reports that the Army "has launched an attack by air and by land" and that it is estimated that SL forces in the area total 500 men. According to newspaper "ONDA," 70 SL members were killed, but the killing of civilians has been ruled out. The Defense Ministry communique states that from 5 to 18 April, 14 terrorists were killed and 12 others arrested in clashes between military patrols and SL columns. The communique adds that three soldiers were injured. It also states that the military operations "are being conducted without affecting local settlers." President Alberto Fujimori has "categorically" denied any helicopter bombings. Moreover, Coordinating Board Executive Secretary Rosa Mujica insists that civilians have been killed, and has requested that the Red Cross be allowed to visit the area.
