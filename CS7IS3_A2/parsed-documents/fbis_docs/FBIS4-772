Party leader Constand Viljoen told a public meeting in Kraaifontein in the Western Cape last night that the aim was to ensure that the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the Conservative Party [CP] could also be included in the poll. [Begin recording] [Correspondent James Barkhuizen] The Kraaifontein meeting was the biggest so far on the Freedom Front election tour. General Viljoen told more than 1,500 supporters that election in the present climate of violence and without the IFP was unthinkable. He said the smaller parties would urgently have to consider the fairness of the election. [Viljoen, in progress]...and if we decide that it is not the case, then we should put a joint case to the Independent Electoral Commission to say that we smaller parties, with the exclusion of the ANC and the National Party, we feel that this is not a free and fair situation.
