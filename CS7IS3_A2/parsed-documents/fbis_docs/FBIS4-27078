Eight hours into the debate in the Legislative Council, the outcome of an historic vote on the last and most complex part of Patten's reforms was too close to call. "Nothing is certain. We won't know until it comes to the vote. It's that close," Liberal Party deputy leader Selina Chow told AFP during a break in the proceedings. Local radio station Metro Plus estimated that as many as 29 legislators might vote to back Patten's original blueprint -- with another 29 going for the Liberals' version, aimed at appeasing Beijing, which takes back the British colony on July 1, 1997. With one member, Jardine Matheson executive Martin Barrow, promising to abstain, a 29-29 outcome would force council president John Swaine to make a rare tie-breaking vote. The Liberals are hoping that by boiling down Patten's proposals by limiting the popular vote, China would be less likely to scrap any changes, as it has vowed to do when it takes back Hong Kong in 1997. "Society has been destabilized (by the governor's proposals). There have been ups and downs," Liberal Party leader Allen Lee, who has close contacts with Beijing's Communist Party leaders, said. "Our ultimate target is not to opt for radical changes," he said. But the Liberals' move was condemned by pro-democracy legislators, including Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce representative Jimmy McGregor, who condemned it as a "convoluted nightmare." "It's a dog's breakfast and dinner that the Liberal Party is serving up today," he said. If the Liberals' amendment is passed, the spotlight will shift to Patten to see if he would accept such a radical change to the proposals that he first spelled out in October 1992 to Beijing's fury. Fourteen amendments were on the order paper, including a long-shot attempt by independent firebrand Emily Lau for all 60 seats to be directly elected -- even though China has vowed to scrap any electoral reforms after 1997. The Legislative Council has already adopted an earlier part of the reforms, which, among other aspects, enshrines the principle of British-style, first-past-the-post elections -- in lieu of proportional representation, which many say would help usher in pro-Beijing politicians. In favor of Patten's reforms Wednesday were the United Democrats, Hong Kong most popular political group, whose vice-chairman Yeung Sum called Wednesday's vote a last chance for true democracy. "We should make use of the present opportunity," he said. "We already have the basic conditions for democracy." Besides setting aside 20 seats for direct election in 1997, Patten's reforms would give almost every man and women -- about 2.5 million altogether -- the chance to vote for 30 seats known as "functional constituencies." Such seats are set aside for special interest groups and business sectors, and now are filled by corporate voting, which Patten feels are open to manipulation and corruption. The remaining 10 seats would be decided by an electoral college that itself would be directly elected. Launching the debate, Patten's second in command, Anson Chan, repeated the governor's oft-stated position that only his reform package can guarantee human rights and the rule of law in Hong Kong after 1997. "It is essential for the protection of the fundamental aspects of Hong Kong's way of life that it holds so dear," she said. She added: "Whether China will dismantle (the reforms) is a question only China itself can answer."
