Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko was asked to comment on the situation that has taken shape after the United States of America refuted yesterday's statement by President Kravchuk. Here is what the minister replied. [Begin Zlenko recording] The only thing that I can tell you is that following the decision about START I ratification by the Supreme Council, the Ukrainian foreign minister has undertaken extremely active efforts to resolve conditions and reservations put forward in the resolution. I could tell you about the whole range of measures that the ministry has taken over this short stretch of time. They include negotiations with the Russian and American delegations and trilateral consultations recently held by Ukraine, Russia, and the United States. In other words, we are currently looking for approaches to settle the issues connected with the destruction of nuclear weapons, as stipulated by the Supreme Council resolution. This is why I would like to say that there is nothing here to refute. The fact is that the negotiations were held and the search for solutions to this problem is under way -- including the participation of such great nuclear states as Russia and the United States of America.
