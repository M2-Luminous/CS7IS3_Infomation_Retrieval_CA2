A joint committee of the two organizations could, within a few days, repport back on whether a basis could be found on which supporters of the volkstaat [homeland] idea can work together outside and inside Parliament. The division in right-wing ranks started when Gen. Viljoen and a group of supporters broke away from the National Front shortly before the elections and participated in the election under the banner of the newly-formed Freedom Front. They are now claiming that the Freedom Front mustered the most right-wing votes -- a claim which is being strongly rejected by the National Front. Reconciliation While there is strong insistence on reconciliation from certain quarters, Gen. Viljoen sounded a warning this week: "We knew from the outset that we had chosen the right strategic path by participating in the election. We had to endure many insults as a result of this choice. The Freedom Front cannot at this stage let its supporters down and this does not mean that we are reluctant to cooperate. But the Freedom Front will not subject itself to the authority of the National Front." According to Dr. Hrtzenberg, the initiative is being taken to unite as many Afrikaners as possible, not only the right wing, but even supporters of the NP National Party are also being targeted. He believes that the joint objective of a "free, Christian, Afrikaner republic" presents sufficient basis from which work on unity can be extended. All right wingers must be included in this union, Dr. Hartzenberg believes. New Grouping But according to Gen. Viljoen, he cannot say at this juncture that he is optimistic. "In the election the Freedom Front got together a brand new grouping of Afrikaners; not only right wingers, but many from the NP as well. The needs of all have to be taken into consideration now." According to his estimate the Freedom Front received 35 percent support from adult Afrikaners with more than 30 percent among those that abstained. This represents a majority of all Afrikaners, Gen. Viljoen said. -- In some circles within the National Front this week there had been little enthusiasm regarding cooperation with Gen. Viljoen. "There is no basis for unity because the Freedom Front's policy differs drastically from that of the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement]," says AWB Executive Committee member Fred Rundle. "The Freedom Front is nearer to the ANC than it is to us," he said.
