A report released by the bank's research division suggested today that, with stable inflation and exchange rates, costs and prices in the manufacturing sector should hold steady at this year's levels for the next couple of years. The IMI study said that, in 1994-95, pre-tax operating results should come out at about 10 percent for 1994-95. The study also confirmed a forecast from ISCO [National Institute for the Study of the Economic Sitation], the short-term economic analysis unit, of an increase of about 1.3 percent in gross domestic product this year. According to IMI, even though industrial activity closed 3 percent down in 1993, this may turn out to have been underestimated by a number of other research units, which would put a number of the other projections out of line, making them too pessimistic. The IMI study suggested that fixed investments had begun moving ahead "firmly" and output was increasing, also to rebuild stocks to the basic minimums. Other important factors were said to be continued fair weather on the trade account; stronger domestic demand, and further progressive reductions in interest rates. All this, said IMI, should enable firms to reduce their debt. The study suggested that the biggest winners would be home appliances, paving tiles, plastic and rubber products, chemical products for retail sale and, profiting by strong foreign demand, machine tools and automation and numerical control equipment. The sectors which IMI said had failed to profit by the lira's devaluation were steel, basic chemicals and fibres, vehicles and paper products. Car sales, in particular, could only be expected to pick up when family expenditure does, while the chemical industry has its old problems plus the world crisis in the sector to deal with.
