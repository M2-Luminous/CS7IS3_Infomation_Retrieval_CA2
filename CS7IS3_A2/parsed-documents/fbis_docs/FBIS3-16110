The former U.S. president, who is visiting Moscow for the tenth time, noted that statements alleging that "America has triumphed over Russia" are a myth. Nixon also said that America jointly with Russia can cope with the global problems which "impose certain obligations on the two great powers." Richard Nixon did not rule out the possibility of some frictions between the United States and Russia in the future but expressed confidence that "these will be differences between friends, not enemies." Nixon stressed the importance of open discussions of these differences. Nixon described as "a positive phenomenon of the new time" the good personal relationship between Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin. Along with this, Nixon sought to bring home to the Russian parliamentarians the concern felt by a part of American society about Russia's relapse to the aggressive policy. The ex-president said, "Russia is of course entitled to make its own steps in foreign policy, which do not always coincide with America's." "We are now friends, so let us work together in order not to poison our relations," Nixon stressed. He pointed out the importance of strengthening cooperation between Russian and American parliamentarians.
