Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-14JAN94-YUGO-BOSNIA Yugoslavia--Bosnia-Herzegovina Serbs Defy NATO Warning SUMMARY Shrugging off threats of NATO airstrikes, Serb leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and Bosnia-Herzegovina have denied responsibility for taking the offensive in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bosnian Serb leaders flatly rejected NATO's call for the opening of Tuzla airport to humanitarian aid flights. END SUMMARY Reacting to the 11 January communique issued following the NATO summit in Brussels that warned of the possibility of air strikes to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo and other threatened areas, Serb leaders and media have denied that Serb armed forces have gone on the offensive and complained that the international community has unjustifiably singled out the Serbs for punishment. Reaction in Belgrade Slobodan Milosevic, President of the Republic of Serbia in the FRY, described the "threats of bombing" Serbian positions as incomprehensible" because he said Bosnian Serb forces have "not waged war for more than seven months" and the "Muslim leadership" is "undoubtedly" responsible for recent "armed provocations" (Tanjug, 13 January). Milosevic similarly denied Bosnian Serb responsibility for recent armed conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina in a speech to the Geneva peace conference on 29 November (Belgrade radio, 29 November). He gave no indication in his most recent statements that he would attempt to persuade Bosnian Serb forces to desist from their shelling of Sarajevo and their interference with humanitarian shipments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Although the NATO communique issued a general warning to all sides about the possibility of air strikes, the Yugoslav media have asserted that the threat was part of a wider international campaign of unjustified criticism of the Serbs. A Tanjug commentator asserted that, "although the word 'Serb' was not explicitly mentioned," NATO had aimed its warning at the Bosnian Serbs. Echoing Milosevic's objections to the international community's criticism of the Serbs, the commentator complained of the unfair treatment of the Serbs. He maintained that "only the Serb side has so far fulfilled all it has been asked" at the peace talks but the international community "continues to make threats" to the Serbs alone "while looking with benevolence on the bloody fighting" between Muslims and Croats (Tanjug, 13 January). Bosnian Serb Defiance The Bosnian Serb leadership was unanimous in its rejection of the NATO communique's call for the opening of Tuzla airport to flights carrying humanitarian aid. The Serbs insisted that the Muslims would use the airport to smuggle arms for their army (Tanjug, 12 and 13 January). Reinforcing this assertion, one Tanjug report claimed that Tuzla airport was already being used to receive flights carrying arms from Germany and Turkey (Tanjug, 13 January). The reaction of Bosnian Serb leaders to the communique's warning of airstrikes varied from outright defiance to dismissal of the idea as militarily impracticable: -- Bosnian Serb "President" Radovan Karadzic described the threats of airstrikes as "counterproductive" to the peace process, "to put it mildly," charging that the possibility of NATO intervention encourages the "Muslim side to carry on with the war." He claimed that "even UNPROFOR reports clearly indicate" that the "Muslims have been attacking" Serbian forces in and around Sarajevo (Tanjug, 11 January). -- Bosnian Serb "presidency" member Nikola Koljevic was openly defiant in his reaction to the NATO communique. He said that "Serbs have had enough of threats" and warned that those who issued them were "thinking incorrectly" because they "do not know Serbs, their history, and aspirations" (Vecernje Novosti, 13 January). -- Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the assembly of the self- proclaimed Republic of Srpska in Bosnia-Herzegovina, criticized the NATO communique's warning of air strikes and its demand that Tuzla airport be opened but assessed positively what he maintained was a "new approach" to the Bosnian crisis. He claimed that NATO had "abandoned" its "ultimatum-style tone" that it had previously used in its statements on the crisis. He dismissed the warning to end the strangulation of Sarajevo as "superfluous" for the Serbs since the Serbian side "is not the one strangling Sarajevo" as outsiders "keep saying" (Tanjug, 12 January). -- The chief of staff of the Bosnian Serb army, General Manojlo Milovanovic, dismissed the possibility of air strikes as impracticable. Milovanovic claimed that air strikes on his forces would "directly threaten" UNPROFOR units and Muslim and Croat forces "that are deployed very close to Serbian forces on all the fronts" in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He further belittled the communique's warning as a "scheme used too frequently" when a "peace plan likely to be rejected by the Bosnian Serbs" is about to be presented at the international peace negotiations (Politika, 13 January).
