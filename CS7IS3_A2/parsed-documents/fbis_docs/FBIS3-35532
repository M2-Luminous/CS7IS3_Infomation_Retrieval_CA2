He accused it of failing to put an end to the violence, killings, and highway assaults that the settlers have been perpetrating for the past several months. In a statement to MENA's Tunis correspondent, Ghawshah said the Palestinian leaders will hold an urgent meeting later today to discuss the massacre and adopt appropriate decisions in light of the reactions that will proceed from the international community and the UN Security Council, particularly the United States and Russia in their capacity as the sponsors of the Middle East peace process. Ghawshah added: We will discuss the situation and adopt a firm stand, not only with regard to the negotiations but also on how to confront these dangers and prevent their recurrence. He stressed that this massacre is directed at the peace operation and at the negotiations, which the perpetrators want to undermine. Ghawshah urged Rabin's government to arrest the culprits and punish them, promptly implement the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, and withdraw the Israeli forces from Gaza and Jericho. He assured that when the PLO assumes responsibility and authority in these areas, these assaults will stop. He called on the world community to help end these acts and urged Washington and Moscow--the sponsors of the peace process--to make Israel fulfill its obligations and play its role in giving impetus to the peace process. He said: While we condemn this massacre against our Palestinian people at the hands of Israeli settlers, we emphasize the need for all patriotic Palestinian forces to unite and confront these brutal actions that seek to undermine the peace process.
