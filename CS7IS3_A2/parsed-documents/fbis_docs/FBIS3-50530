The leader of the Movement for the Establishment of Democracy in Haiti [MIDH] believes that the country is threatened by civil war and foreign military intervention. Bazin explained that violence can in no way contribute to a lasting solution to the crisis. For the first time since he resigned, the MIDH leader cited the work done by his government of consensus and public safety. He recalled that at the same period of time in 1992, his government already had several achievements to its credit. Marc Bazin admitted, however, that he did not manage to bring the two opposed parties to the negotiation table. The MIDH leader said a negotiated, peaceful, fair, realistic, Haitian solution must be found to the crisis. [passage omitted]
