Hata, who is also leader of the Japan Renewal Party, the coalition's core force, told a press conference in Tokyo that the eight-month-old alliance has not broken up because meetings of the representatives from the ruling parties are still being held. "It is true that various emotions are entangled," Hata said,"but if we go back to the starting point of why we established the coalition, I believe we can restore it." The coalition is splitting into two camps over who should succeed the outgoing prime minister. The camp led by the Renewal Party today rejected a call by Social Democratic Party Chairman Tomiichi Murayama to hold a meeting of all the seven parties' leaders to discuss the choice of Hosokawa's successor.
