Chairmen of the local organs of authority will be elected, but what attracts special attention in the republic is that its head will be elected. Today we present Yuriy Spiridonov, chairman of the Komi Supreme Soviet, a candidate who was nominated by more than 100 Komi organizations. The leader of the Komi Republic was heard of for the first time in Russia when the newly organized Council of the Heads of Republics (SGR) rapidly began to take on importance in Russian politics. A group was formed in the SGR--Spiridonov (Komi), Stepanov (Karelia), Shaymiyev (Tataria), Nikolayev (Yakutia), and Rakhimov (Bashkiria), which actually has been determining the policy of the republics with respect to the Center. [Begin boxed item] No matter which way you turn, you cannot get a panorama of our 170 degrees of Russian longitudes without the Republic of Komi. But what do we know about it? Mining Vorkuta, Polar Inta and strikes, miners' pickets at the White House in Moscow... More? The capital of the GULAG under Stalin, where the model of "camp socialism" was tested, at present belongs to regions whose dominant idea is clearly mining. It is difficult to judge the whole republic after visiting only Syktyvkar. The capital city draws another picture, how to resolve the problem of the Pechora coal basin. Some hotheads are demanding the closing of unprofitable mines. Perhaps this is justified from the economic aspect. But it should not be forgotten that in 1941, when the German troops cut off the Donets Basin, it was Vorkuta coal that saved the country. A new coat of arms--a one-headed eagle--will soon appear in the Republic of Komi. Will the election results justify this symbol? [End boxed item] Every SGR meeting with the president caused ironic comments behind the scenes: How many and what kind of quotas and licenses were haggled for one or another political decision... It would be ridiculous to deny this: The right of the "to dispense favors" remains with the center as before. However, the SGR tried to change this tradition. After signing the Federative Treaty, Spiridonov and his colleagues consistently tried to get a redistribution of powers from the Center. Today the leader of Komi thinks that it is quite realistic to get away from the system of coaxing subsidies. [Spiridonov] I want never to have to plead with Moscow, and we are ready to do this, if the president of the Russian Federation removes his structures... Give us equal conditions of price formation. And do not hinder the sale of products. And the taxes that the state does not collect in full now, we will bring on a silver platter. Then it will be able to resolve questions of the defense industry, the military, and pensioners. [end Spiridonov] The president has now approved a schedule of signing of treaties between the federal center and the components of the Russian Federation. Spiridonov, one of the leaders of the regional Russian elite, believes that from an economic aspect the krays and oblasts should have equal opportunities with the republics. Today's crisis is difficult for everyone, but Komi's situation can be called extremely difficult. Therefore, Spiridonov consistently lobbies in the Federation Council for laws that promote a change in the situation in the republic. [Spiridonov] The main thing for us is to adopt a law on the Northern Territories that regulate questions of benefits and compensation for people living in the rayons of the Far North and those comparable to it. Moreover, a state program for the development of the northern regions is absolutely necessary today. After all, more than 90 percent of all of the mineral-raw material potential of Russia is concentrated in them. [end Spiridonov] Spiridonov's style of work was noticed in the Center a long time ago. And for those in the know, Viktor Chernomyrdin's decision to draw the leader of the republic into the Government of the Russian Federation for the position of first deputy in charge of fuel and energy questions was not a big surprise. However, Spiridonov preferred to remain in Komi... Sources It is not easy to understand Yuriy Alekseyevich's strong attachment to this severe land. It seems that he was not even born here, but in faraway Omsk Oblast. He graduated from an institute in Sverdlovsk, and later worked at the Gornyy mine in Magadan Oblast. He went through the school of life there, starting out as a foreman. He turned up in Komi in 1964. [Spiridonov] Every day of work at that time brought happiness. Just the construction of the hot water system to Bagan was worth a lot. Instead of a hundred meters, we began to lay a kilometer to a kilometer and a half in a day. Now--it is not the same. Some kind of dissatisfaction always remains. [end Spiridonov] Veterans of Usinsk, people who worked with him, call him "Pop" to this day. He "captured" the people, it is said, with trustworthiness. If he called for "plowing," then he was the first to set an example. But the main thing is that Spiridonov succeeded in inspiring trust in people, in changing attitudes toward the land, to which either romantics after a "will-o'-the-wisp" were drawn, or, just the opposite, self-servers who were after quick and easy money. It is recounted that when he received the assignment to Usinsk, there were not many enthusiasts there. People, who were housed in barracks, had "started to become brutalized." They were sick of the disorder. They came to earn a little money--and go back. At that time in 1981, all of Usinsk's wells produced an increase in production of 20,000 tonnes of oil annually. Spiridonov raised this to 70,000 in two years. The more oil, the more income there was in the city budget. They started to build more. People were housed not in communal accommodations but in separate apartments. And people stopped scattering. Immediately after this, Spiridonov was appointed to the Komi Oblast CPSU Party Committee as second secretary. When Spiridonov was elected first secretary, elections were going on in the country to a renewed and restructured Supreme Soviet of the USSR. He was nominated as a candidate, and his rivals were Father Gleb Yakunin and ARGUMENTY I FAKTY Editor in Chief Starkov... Spiridonov, who did not make an abrupt change from the communists to the democrats and patriots, then had to render an account to the voters of Ukhta for the entire CPSU and for all leaders from Lenin to Brezhnev. It is amusing and sad to acknowledge this, but witnesses recall that a female cloakroom attendant, who, attracted by the noise of the crowd, accidentally ended up in the hall, stuck up for Spiridonov. She put to shame the denouncers, who were not letting him say a word clearly. Spiridonov was elected. Yakunin and Starkov withdrew their candidacies before the elections. Comrades-in-Arms It is the same story today before the elections to the post of head of the republic. Estimating the situation realistically, Anatoliy Karakchiyev, the mayor of Syktyvkar, withdrew his own candidacy and joined a group in support of Spiridonov. After the affirmation of the head of the city, young and fresh forces were oriented to Spiridonov. They were confident that changes in the republic were possible if Spiridonov led the process. The same opinion is held by Vladimir Torlopov, the first deputy of Spiridonov's main rival, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Khudyayev. He believes that without a renewal of the government and without involving new personnel, it will be impossible to contain the situation. In the present extreme situation no one except Spiridonov, Torlopov is convinced, will be able to execute leadership, or, moreover, to ensure change. The people in the group supporting Spiridonov are principally those who went through the entire election campaign with him. The reason for this constancy is one and the same--he does not desert people. In any situation. Valentin Kotelnikov, director of Syktyvkar's personnel center, recounted the following story. Masha Trikhanovich, a single woman and secretary of the city party committee of the Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League], who almost died in a car accident in 1980, worked with Spiridonov a long time. The first one to rush to the hospital at that time was Yuriy Alekseyevich. Dropping his own affairs, he helped the accident victim--he himself fixed blinds, repaired a mirror... And although many years have passed, to this day he supports Masha, who became an invalid. People's teacher A. Katolikov, director of the Syktyvkar agricultural boarding school, appearing on the local television program "Pyramid of Power," probably most accurately defined the inner substance of the republic's leader: He is good in a purely human way... Children are attracted to him." Spiridonov often visits the boarding school. Always with gifts. Once, as A. Katolikov recounted, a "Farmer" tractor was sent to him from Holland. And along with it, another one--a small one, which bore the inscription "To Fedor Spiridonov." "We wondered a long time who it was for. And then we realized, this was Spiridonov's grandson...! Two weeks passed, and Yuriy Alekseyevich drove up, towing this tractor behind him: "You know, I was told that your lads liked it very much..." Hostage It would seem that it was not necessary for him, who still did not lose any of his human qualities on the road to authority, to remain in high politics. Especially in this period, when it is unlikely that anyone will say thank you, and why take the burden of such an unenviable economy on one's shoulders? It is simpler to go upward, where he will be taken at any moment. But it would be a pity for Spiridonov to leave hundreds of started projects. [Spiridonov] I cannot drop all of this today... I have simply become hostage to all these matters. I know what I must bear. [end Spiridonov] This is understood in both the Center and in the republic. For Moscow, Spiridonov has become almost the last conductor through whom they can still influence a region that goes on strike regularly. He is the last guarantor of the future for the republic and for the miners. It is understood in the republic that were it not for Spiridonov, it would take even longer to wait for a real payment of debts, and the transferred sums could be "idle" to this day. Yes, Spiridonov will also periodically have to play the role of "no-nonsense expediter." But, as he himself hopes, temporarily, as long as the Center continues to fulfill functions that are uncharacteristic for it. As for his preelection program, Spiridonov thinks that these are the priority directions in his strategy: --reanimation of laws adopted by the Supreme Soviet of Komi: "On Additional Guarantees for Maternal and Child Protection," "On Social Protection of Invalids," and "On Social Protection of Veterans in the Republic of Komi"; --ensuring financing of the state programs: "Childhood" and "Health of Women--Planning a Family"; --further development of the fuel-energy and lumber complexes; the main thing here is to increase the quality of produced products owing to the creation of a higher technological processing standard, which will ensure their competitiveness on the world market; --establishment of a new mining-metallurgical complex for mining and processing bauxite, titanium and manages ores, barite, rock salt, and other minerals; --establishment of a scientific-production center for processing preplanned and pre-project materials for the development of productive forces, an economic estimate, and the creation of effective technologies for processing raw minerals without waste; --preservation of an atmosphere of international peace and harmony, which is traditional for the Komi region.
