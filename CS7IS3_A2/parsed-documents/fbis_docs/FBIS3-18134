According to the Federal Statistical Office, the positive balance amounted to 59.4 billion German marks [DM] (1992: DM33.7 billion). This was due to the fact that imports dropped more strongly than exports. While exports decreased by 10.1 percent to DM603.5 billion, imports went down 14.7 percent to a level of DM544.1 billion. As a result of deficits in the sphere of services and transfers, the export surplus was transformed in a deficit of DM36 billion (DM39.4 billion) in the balance of payments on current account. In December, the export surplus reached DM8.5 billion (DM0.4 billion), while the deficit in the balance of payments on current account was DM0.8 billion (DM4.9 billion). Compared to November, exports increased by 4.2 percent to a level of DM56.4 billion, thus being 2.2 percent higher than the December 1992 level. Imports were up 2.8 percent on the previous month, reaching a level of DM47.9 billion, thus remaining 12.5 percent below the level of the end of 1992.
