If the plan is not modified before 28 February, when it will be released, Barelli will resign. In an effort to convince Fernando Henrique Cardoso that Congress will not approve the plan, Barelli asked for the cooperation of PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] President Tasso Jereissati -- because party members are dissatisfied with implementation of the URV [Real Value Unit]. A PSDB economist said that the plan will cause hyperinflation because it will not control prices. Barelli did not resign on 24 February only because -- clinging to a statement by President Itamar Franco -- he insisted on the modification of the plan by 28 February. During a meeting between entrepreneurs and unionists on 24 February, Vicente de Paula -- the president of the union of Sao Bernardo do Campo metalworkers -- appealed to Franco to prevent the deterioration of salaries. The president replied that he should rest assured, explaining that he ordered Barelli to watch the plan's design. "There will be no salary deterioration in my government," Franco said.
