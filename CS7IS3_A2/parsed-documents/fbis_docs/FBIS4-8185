It is obvious that neither the United States nor the UN are ready for the establishment of peace in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Krajisnik told Radio Yugoslavia following yesterday's bombing of Serb positions near Gorazde. The Serbs have the right to defend themselves and will not allow the UN to help the Muslims to improve their positions, Krajisnik added. He stressed that the Serb side has demanded to be told by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] who ordered the bombing and that those who made the decision to authorize the attack would be unwelcome in the Srpska republic. Krajisnik said the Serb side has clear evidence that UNPROFOR provided help in arming the Muslims and that it is biased in favor of the Muslims. "The bombing by the U.S. planes was further proof that UNPROFOR is not impartial in the civil war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina", Krajisnik said. "We cannot solve problems partially and establish peace in the areas where the Muslims are suffering military defeats. We said this to General Michael Rose on three occasions yesterday and asked him to use his influence with the Muslims so that we can achieve peace in Gorazde." The Serb side, according to Krajisnik, agreed to have Gorazde defined as a protected zone and to find a way to define its borders, but the Muslim side has rejected such proposals.
