This figure, according to the most modest estimates of specialists from the Defense Ministry (and indeed the ministries of finance and the economy, too), will not meet even the minimum level required. That will require around 15 trillion more. Thus, in saying "yes" to such a budget it may be presumed that the deputies were leaving the Army to sort out its own problems, saying to it: "you'll manage somehow." It is curious that even those deputies who just the day before considered it almost a crime to agree to military spending of less than R55 trillion somehow suddenly decided to make do with scarcely more than R40 trillion. Look at the results of the voting and remember the deputies' public statements... The figures speak for themselves -- only 40 parliamentarians felt it necessary to say "no" to this budget. Of course, not all of them are concerned for the fate of the Armed Forces -- the present budget will also reduce science, culture, and health care to starvation rations. But those who said "yes" to the government draft law did agree to a defense budget of R40.6 trillion. And that means that they agreed to a level of officers' pay which is a pittance by present-day standards, to a chronic shortage of housing in the Army, to ships which will have to perform combat duty even though they can barely stay afloat because there is no money to pay for repairs, to aircraft which have been standing idle for months for want of fuel, to test ranges overgrown with weeds, to a defense industry which is paralyzed... There are many things that those deputies agreed to when they voted so hastily for the government version of the budget. An analysis of the results of the vote clearly show that the following factions did not consider it necessary to fight for a decent defense budget: the Communists, the Agrarians, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Women of Russia, the majority of deputies from New Regional Policy, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, and the Democratic Party of Russia. A section of Russia's Choice preferred to abstain while another section did not vote at all. Only the Yabloko (Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin) faction actively opposed the government's draft budget. And even that faction objected not so much to the reduced military spending as to the general approach to budget policy itself. Strange as it may seem, the members of the State Duma's Defense Committee also accepted the loss of R15 trillion. None of them voted "against." To be fair it should be noted that until recently the committee sought to influence the government's position and acted as an ally of the Defense Ministry. Thus it is all the more incomprehensible why members of the committee surrendered their right to vote without a battle, as it were. How else is one to interpret the failure to take part in the voting? Eight committee members actually said "yes" to the budget. Although at the moment that the vote took place, Aleksandr Piskunov, for example, was actually standing at the microphone making one last desperate attempt to persuade his colleagues not to rush into the adoption of the budget. Incidentally, Sergey Glazyev, who recently told KRASNAYA ZVEZDA readers (see the 7 June issue) how it was possible to get 55 trillion for the Army without increasing the budget deficit at the same time, decided for some reason against making such an attempt. To cut a long story short, there is one conclusion which instantly springs to mind: The rumors about a military-industrial lobby in the State Duma proved to be exaggerated, to put it mildly. There is no reasonably cohesive force, faction, or party in the State Duma today which would seriously defend the military's interests. Barely more than a dozen [yedva li bolshe desytaka] members of the entire corps of deputies sincerely care for the Army and the country's defense. I do not want to resort to conjecture or cast a slur on people whose absence from the session or failure to vote may well have been due to factors which are even quite valid. The results of the voting are in front of us. One vote out of many. No more than that. True, these results may affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and indeed the fate of the Russian Army itself. I hope that the deputies were aware of this when they decided which button to press or whether to press a button at all. The results of the voting which took place at 1647 hours on 8 June may prove historic. And when in the future we look at the names of the people's elected representatives, we will have a special feeling when we think of the first State Duma in post-Soviet Russia and its attitude to the defense capability of the Armed Forces, the problems of the Army and Navy, and its concern for the "man with the gun." The Roll-Call Vote Shows Who is Who The discussion of the 1994 federal budget at the second reading took place behind closed doors, as is well known. And the decision was also made "in-house" -- in the absence of the press and television. However, among the people there was, for quite understandable reasons, considerable interest in this vote. Within the Armed Forces, too, the logical question was asked: Which of the people's elected representatives said "yes" to such an patently meager defense budget? In response to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA readers' requests, we now publish the results of the roll-call vote on the 1994 federal budget (second reading). Those Who Voted in Favor M.M. Abdulbasirov, S.N.
