There are thousands of newspapers, tens of thousands of magazines and journals, and hundreds of television and radio stations in our country covering extensive areas, wielding great influence, in touch with the masses every day, and swaying people's minds and behavior. As "water can keep boats afloat as well as sink them," correct guidance of public opinion can cohere people's hearts, invigorate spirits, raise the fighting spirit, and promote unity; while wrong guidance of public opinion fwill confuse opinions, dissipate hearts and minds, sap the fighting spirit, and result in the serious consequence of political, economic, and social destabilization. Ours is a country of 1.1 billion population and a party of 50 million members in pursuit of a socialist market economic system to achieve the unprecedented objective of the "three-step" development strategy. The international situation which confronts us is complicated and volatile and the domestic situation contains radical differences. Given the circumstances, it becomes much more important to insist on correctly guiding public opinion; maintaining a stable, unified, active, and lively political situation; and creating a good social and opinion climate for the pursuit of reform and construction by people throughout the whole country and the party, under leadership and in an orderly fashion. Both positive and negative experiences since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee show us that it is of vital importance to correctly exercise the functions of media opinion, so far as leading people's thought and behavior in the direction of pursuing socialism with Chinese characteristics is concerned. Leading cadres of party committees, propaganda departments, and press and publication units at all levels must tackle the job of guiding public opinion with a high sense of responsibility and must not take it lightly. Correctly guiding public opinion is ultimately and fundamentally determined by successfully clinging firmly and unwaveringly to the party's basic line and unifying the thinking of the people of the whole party and country with it through vigorous propaganda and ideological mobilization. We must correctly grasp the situation amid the kaleidoscopic, complicated, and confusing social phenomena; strengthen the awareness of the whole situation; propagate practically and graphically the party's line, principles, and policies, so that people can understand, as quickly as possible, momentous party and government reformist and opening up measures and transform this understanding into voluntary actions; and, in this way, mobilize and encourage as much as possible people to devote themselves to the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This year will be most critical for deepening reforms and promoting development and will see the unveiling of many reformist measures for building a socialist market economic system. The breadth, depth, intensity, and degree of difficulty of reforms this year will be greater and harder than in any previous year. This means that press and propaganda work must be closely coordinated; investigations and studies of social climate and trends in people's views must be strengthened; personnel must keep themselves updated on the latest changes in concepts of value, thoughts, moods, and mentality, so that they can detect trends from small rumblings, deal with things in advance, dissolve contradictions, straighten out grievances, guide people with a clear-cut stand toward reforms and to support and participate in reforms in order to ensure victory for this year's initial battle of deepening reforms. They must uphold materialistic dialectics, prevent partiality and simplification, and properly handle relations between reforms and development, those between reforms, development, and stability; and those between the local and overall situations. They must look out for the possibility that one trend may lie hidden another, prevent rushing headlong into mass actions or uniform and indiscriminate administrative measures, and the situation where everyone jumps on the bandwagon. They must concentrate their energy on showing the rapid progress of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics; enthusiastically eulogize people's shining achievements and their noble character reflected in transforming the world and creating a new life; review the situation and judge the times well, and be good at providing guidance; take and present their clear-cut position on significant issues concerning principles and the entire situation, instead of being wishy washy about them; promptly defuse sensitive and hot issues instead of "hyping them up"; refrain from fruitless debate; determine the "amount" of coverage and propaganda on issues of immediate concern to the masses; explain and allay their doubts and anxieties incisively; and be the voice of the people. One of the important channels through which the people exercise their democratic rights is the media reflection of people's views and demands and the monitoring of party and government organs and their workers. It helps make our decisions scientific and improves our work. Strengthening the media's watchdog role also represents the need to correctly guide public opinion. The key to properly exercising the media's watchdog role lies in critical reportage and the reflection of the masses' opinions. The media must deal seriously with their work, from selecting typical events, ways and methods adopted, to timing. They must do everything with an eye on promoting work, solving problems, enhancing unity, maintaining stability, and boosting people's confidence in pushing ahead. In guiding public opinion, they must strictly observe propaganda disciplines. Party newspapers, party journals, and radio and television stations from central to local levels must all actively propagate the party's beliefs and political outlook and play a leading example. Meanwhile, they must be innovative, encourage variety in their newspaper, radio, and television broadcasting reporting styles with a view to forming a unique style. In short, guiding people with correct public opinion means guiding people with public opinions that are conducive to further deepening reform and opening up; creating a socialist market economic system; developing socialism with Chinese characteristics; strengthening socialist spiritual civilization and socialist democratic and legal system; encouraging people to work arduously and explore and innovate for national wealth and strength, the people's happiness, and social progress; telling truth from falsity, upholding truth, good, and beauty, and resisting falsity, evil, and baseness; and helping the unification of the country and national unity, political, economic, and social stability. That way, we will definitely guide, protect, and develop the energy of the people and various circles; encourage and stimulate the people to be confident, unified in mind and heart, to be mindful of the overall situation, strive forward, tackle the key problems in this year's deepening reforms, and score greater achievements in economic development.
