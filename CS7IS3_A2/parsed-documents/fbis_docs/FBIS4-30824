After the elections, MSZP Deputy Executive Chairman Imre Szekeres gave us an interview about the party's election successes and short-term concepts. [Hammang] In view of the results, in your opinion, has the MSZP overwon itself or it has simply carried its best form? [Szekeres] It is very difficult to answer this question. We repeatedly said that it is difficult to determine the concept of overwinning [tulgyozes]. If the voters thought to vote for the MSZP or its individual candidate, naturally this is a great pleasure for us and, in my opinion, the 270,000 extra votes compared to the first round of elections and the total of close to 2 million votes show a serious confidence in the MSZP. This support shows that everything that we thought about the country, the tasks, and the people's needs in the past four years was right. [Hammang] After the first round, the public thought that only the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] was capable of forcing the MSZP back regarding the individual candidates and thus creating a proper balance in the next parliament. As shown by the results, the SZDSZ failed to achieve this. On the contrary: The well-known SZDSZ candidates failed to obtain a single mandate in Budapest, for example; only the MSZP and the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] were able to do that. In your opinion, what is the reason behind this? [Szekeres] I think that they put the question wrongly and also answered it wrongly. The MSZP behaved very politely between the two rounds and argued very calmly that the opposition should represent the balance against a government coalition, but this is not needed within a government. Given the results, the citizens also thought so. The results of the second round clearly proved that no negative campaign whatsoever leads to results in Hungary. If the SZDSZ had formulated its campaign differently -- saying that it knew the situation better or that its candidates were better than the candidates of other parties -- they would have achieved better results. [Hammang] At its upcoming congress on 4 June, the MSZP will determine the party's candidate for the position of prime minister. Will the coalition talks start already this week, or will you only be preparing them until the upcoming MSZP congress? [Szekeres] Our plan is unchanged: The congress will decide on the two major issues on 4 June. The two issues are: With which parties we should start coalition talks, and who should be the MSZP's candidate for the position of prime minister? This agenda will not change and I think every party needs to evaluate the election results and to consider the situation. [Hammang] It has been said that, regarding the coalition possibilities, you are open to every democratic party. However, it has also been said that, along with the most probable partner, the SZDSZ, the MSZP only considers parties that did not compromise themselves with their participation in the losing coalition. In addition, in view of the considerable differences between the ideas of the MSZP and the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP], only the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] remains as a possible coalition party among the six parties. [Szekeres] We must consider several things in this respect. One of them is the need to find out which party program can be adjusted to the MSZP concepts. It is also an important factor to find out who thought in terms of different government policy than the one prevailing so far. In this respect, we can consider the SZDSZ and the Fidesz. I would regard this as a starting point. Theoretically, we cannot exclude the cooperation of all the three political poles in a government either. Cooperation with the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], the only force to be considered in this respect, is only possible after the necessary political changes. Naturally, all these are only theoretical possibilities. In the course of coalition talks, it is essential that the composition of Hungary's next government should not be determined by party or individual interests. The people have lost their patience and the current situation is quite difficult, so it is very important to create a stable government that is able to function. [Hammang] We learned that several SZDSZ leaders think that, given the 54-percent parliamentary majority of the MSZP, there is no longer need for a coalition. [Szekeres] The best thing for the SZDSZ is also to wait for the coalition talks and then decide on possible cooperation. All the more so because the SZDSZ is also obliged by the elections in a certain respect, at least in the sense that the SZDSZ was speaking about a different government in the past years and, in their view, they have an adequate program for this. All this could be implemented in a coalition government. This 54-percent magic totally contradicts the elementary logic of an attitude toward a consensus. I say that we should sit down and talk, and then think about each other's percentage. [Hammang] At his late-night news conference, MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn said that the MSZP will be able to solve the problems and will take short-term measures that will lead to improvement. Are there really possibilities for this? [Szekeres] It is very important that Gyula Horn made these promises after the elections, rather than before the elections; in other words, the citizens did not vote for the MSZP because of these promises. Gyula Horn and those who are engaged in politics in a responsible way in Hungary think that changes must be made in the people's situation. There are things that do not cost money and nevertheless can lead to considerable changes, like the style or the government's attitude toward the people. In addition, some ideas can also be implemented under the current financial conditions. Naturally, issues that imply considerable expenses can only be solved in the long term.
