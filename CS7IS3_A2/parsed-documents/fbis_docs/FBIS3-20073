Britain appeared to back down from its hardline stance in the row about voting rights in an enlarged European Union, conceding the principle that a larger number of votes would be needed to block measures. But critics said the proposed compromise, worked out during an informal weekend meeting, was a "time bomb" which opened the door to future delaying tactics by dissident minorities within the EU. London and Madrid had objected to changes in the minimum number of votes needed to block measures if the Union is enlarged. Currently, countries with 23 out of 76 votes can veto decisions. The other 10 EU members want the entry of four would-be newcomers to raise the blocking minority to 27 out of 90. Influential rebels in Britain's ruling Conservative Party have opposed any compromise, insisting that the 23-vote threshold be retained so that Britain's veto powers are not diluted. According to the compromise studied by ministers at the weekend, the ratified membership treaties of the four new states would stipulate a 27-vote threshold but a parallel political declaration by the Council of Ministers would allow a conciliation process if the vote falls between 23 and 26. The problem is that the new formula does not specify a cut-off period for the conciliation process, although French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe suggested three months. The president of the EU's Executive Commission, Jacques Delors, has expressed reservations about the compromise proposal and was submitting it for discussion by the Commission at its next meeting on Tuesday, an EU source said. Greece, current head of the EU's revolving presidency, has submitted details of the proposal to its 12 member states who were expected to respond by Tuesday. Unless settled by the end of next month, the voting row threatens to delay EU membership for Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden which are scheduled to join at the start of next year. Any compromise would be valid only until a major overhaul of the EU's institutions planned for 1996. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, fighting to stem rebellion in the Conservative Party ahead of local and European elections, told BBC radio on Sunday that Britain was winning ground in the debate and its concerns were now "more fully understood." "People have moved towards us and we have said that we are willing to consider a satisfactory compromise, but we're not there yet," he added. His Spanish counterpart Javier Solana felt "significant advances" were made at Ioannina on what he called a "balanced" formula. But Hurd said Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg are worried about the new proposal, because they think it goes too far in Britain and Spain's favour. This was backed up by Dutch Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans, who described the new formula as "a real time bomb." Juppe said the absence of a cut-off point could allow de facto blocking at 23 votes, which he described Saturday as "unacceptable." His Belgian counterpart Willy Claes agreed, saying Sunday it would have been "wiser" to establish a two- to three-month period, but he did not see the formula as a British victory. "It is not a victory for the British because the principle of a 27-vote blocking minority has been granted, and they have no guarantees on the length of the conciliation period," he commented.
