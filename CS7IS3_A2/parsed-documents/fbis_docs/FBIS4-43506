With this in mind, a CNPF [National Council of French Employers] delegation will go to Baghdad on 24 or 25 June. Some 20 companies will be represented, among them Renault, Citroen, Alcatel, Schneider or EDF [Electricite de France]. Officially, however, Iraq remains under UN embargo. Olivier Dalage: [Dalage] Everyone these days thinks that the lifting of sanctions is only a question of time, only months perhaps. French companies, like many others, are taking their places at the starting block to be ready to sign contracts the moment the UN Security Council lifts the sanctions. The first to do so were the oil companies, Elf and Total, who were on the scene in the months after the defeat of Iraq -- discreetly of course, but with the blessing of the French authorities. Before the Gulf war Iraq was an important market for France. Since then, the United States has taken most of the Gulf markets. Only Iraq remains, if of course the embargo is lifted, but also if the French companies play their cards right against the competition. The French note that American managers have been much in evidence in Baghdad lately. These French-Iraqi contacts, which started off very discreetly, now take place in full daylight.
