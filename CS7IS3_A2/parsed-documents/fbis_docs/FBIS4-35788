CONTENTS: 1. Last Hours of Lawyer Madani 2. Interrogation of Brotherhood Leader Called Off 3. Editor Warns Government Not To Smother Liberties 4. Egyptian Sudanese War Feared 5. Al-Ghazali Sermon Banned 6. Mufti's Views on Jews, Palestine 7. Copts Not a Minority LAST HOURS OF LAWYER MADANI The death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani while in police custody remains in the news and AL-SHA'B publishes on page 1 a 500-word report on the last day of his life. Citing sources at Cairo's al-Qasr al-'Ayni Hospital, the paper says a police colonel brought a blindfolded man, unable to speak or move, to the hospital at dawn on 27 April, telling the intern on duty: "See if this kid is playing the fool or what is wrong with him." The intern discovered that the man's body was covered with bruises. The report adds that the colonel refused to reveal the man's identity. He also would not allow the man's blindfold to be removed until he was seen by two resident physicians, one of whom suspected internal chest bleeding and wrote a note to this effect to the resident heart and chest surgeon. This note was disregarded and the patient was transferred to the detainees' ward where he died in the afternoon. The report continues that when one of the resident doctors who had seen him in the morning reported for duty again in the afternoon, she was asked to write out a death certificate saying that the "unidentified" case who had been moved to the detainees' ward had died of an asthma attack. AL-SHA'B says that Madani had never complained of asthma in his life. INTERROGATION OF BROTHERHOOD LEADER CALLED OFF A brief item on page 1 reports that al-Jizah's public attorney, following a meeting with Muslim Brotherhood General Guide Hamid Abu-al-Nasr's lawyer Sayf-al-Islam Hasan al-Banna, rescinded his earlier order to summon the general guide for interrogation. Abu-al-Nasr had been sought for interrogation in connection with the distribution of a leaflet carrying his signature shortly before the 'Id al-Adha Muslim feast. He had committed a technical illegality by signing the leaflet as the Muslim Brotherhood general guide. The Muslim Brotherhood is not formally recognized by the government as a legal movement. EDITOR WARNS GOVERNMENT NOT TO SMOTHER LIBERTIES Chief editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn discusses in a 2,500-word editorial on pages 1 and 2 the "official media's campaign against the Muslim Brotherhood" following the government's "dismal failure" in dealing with the Lawyers Association and its legally elected Council. He says: "The government is creating a climate suggesting that it is time to pounce on the moderate Islamic stream by means of a media campaign that uses all methods except the truth. The claim is being emphatically made that the Muslim Brotherhood is part and parcel of the terrorist movement, although all those who write about this issue, relying on security reports, know in their hearts that this is not true." Husayn warns the government not to encroach on the already narrow margin of liberties and says its vicious campaigns will merely serve to isolate it further from the citizens. He cites the government's decision to ban Islamic preacher Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali from delivering a sermon on 'Id al-Adha, its arrest of Socialist Labor Party young members without specific charges, its hostile attitude to the Lawyers Association, and its contempt for journalists like himself. He declares: "You are ridiculing us and telling yourselves that this newspaper has been clamoring for months and years while we enjoy the seats of power. You say: Let them clamor while we rule. We can silence them at any time." Husayn continues: "I tell you that the sense of the passage of time is a relative matter. When the day of which we warn you finally comes, you will regret but it will be too late." EGYPTIAN-SUDANESE WAR FEARED A 400-word article in the "Topic of the Hour" column on page 7 by Tal'at Rumayh warns of a possible Egyptian-Sudanese war over Hala'ib or over the Egyptian buildings and other installations that the Sudanese authorities periodically take over. He says he suspects that the "United States and Israel have a magical recipe to strike a decisive blow against Egypt's current and future role in the Arab world and to abort the Sudanese experiment at the same time." AL-GHAZALI SERMON BANNED A detailed report of 2,000 words on page 3 speaks of the government's "recent provocative acts against the Islamic stream" including the tight security measures in various places of worship during the 'Id al-Adha Muslim feast and the banning of well-known Muslim preacher Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali from leading the 'Id al-Adha prayers and delivering a sermon in the square of the Mustafa Mahmud Mosque in Cairo's al-Muhandisin District. The government sent an Awqaf Ministry preacher to lead the worshipers in prayer. The report describes the security measures around various mosques during the feast's religious observances and says the security forces tried to prevent worshipers from forming large crowds in village squares or in open areas before the mosques. There are references to the substance of the sermons made by various imams in various parts of the country. Shaykh 'Abd-al-Mu'izz 'Abd-al-Sattar, a prayer leader in Hulwan advocated the application of Islamic shari'ah and the nation's return to Islam. Members of East Hulwan's Youth Center distributed a leaflet which said, in part: "This is the current condition of the Islamic nation and Palestine is being sold." A 700-word commentary next to the above report is entitled: "The Accredited Preacher and the State-Owned Prayer Rug." The writer, AL-SHA'B journalist Khalid Yusuf, who was under police custody during the 'Id al-Adha observances, describes how he was allowed to worship surrounded by police officers, many of them plainclothes security personnel, and how he overheard them saying that the imam who was going to deliver the sermon was "the accredited speaker," meaning a preacher considered safe by the authorities. MUFTI'S VIEWS ON JEWS, PALESTINE In the newspaper's "Dialogue" section on page 9, Dr. Mahmud Himayah, an al-Azhar academic, writes a 4,500 article which appears to be a book review of an unnamed book by Mufti of the Republic Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi. Himayah does not say he is reviewing a book but the headline of the article reads: "The mufti said: The Zionists Are People of Treachery, Espionage, and Corruption." In his introductory paragraph, Himayah again says "in the mufti's words" and halfway through the article this sentence appears: "Toward the End of the Book the Mufti Wonders: What Are the Main Reasons for the Palestinian Catastrophe?" A two-column photograph of the mufti accompanies the article. The apparent review outlines the mufti's views, based on Koranic verses, on the Jews's "killing of prophets" and their espousement of espionage methods to "promote their interests and work corruption on the earth". The review then discusses the conversion of some Jews to other religions with the aim of promoting Jewish and Israeli interests. Dr. Ahmad Shalabi is quoted as saying that in several Far Eastern countries there are Buddhists of Jewish origin or Buddhists married to Jewish women who work in their countries' embassies in Indonesia and rather than serve those countries' interests, they are always seeking to promote the Israeli cause. Part of the review is devoted to 19th century British Prime Minister Disraeli who is said to have converted to Christianity to help Jewish causes, including emigration to Palestine. He is also blamed for "stealing" Egypt's share of the newly built Suez Canal in the late 19th century by purchasing that share for a mere 4 million pounds from Khedive Isma'il. There is a section about the "evils and sins" that the Jews are encouraged to perpetrate by their scriptures and other books. In this connection the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion" are mentioned and the first, second, third, eleventh, and seventeenth "protocols" are cited. These are said to refer respectively to the clash between morality and politics, the power of the press, the benefits of the diaspora in enabling the Jews to "attain world dominance," and the need to undermine clerics of other religions. The Jews are accused of "seeking to undermine religions, morals, and spiritual values" and using the media, including the cinema and theatre, to disseminate "debauchery and moral dissolution among individuals, communities, and nations." Concerning the Palestinian issue, the mufti is cited as saying that the efforts of world Jewry to Judaize Palestine, the feeble religious sentiment among the Arabs, and Arab disunity were behind the loss of Palestine. He criticizes the fact that the defenders of Palestine at the time of Israel's establishment were motivated by nationalist, political sentiments alone to the exclusion of religious feeling. He stresses the need to correct this attitude and to keep the memory of Palestine alive until the time comes for its liberation. As noted above, the name of the mufti's book is not given. Nor is there any indication of when the book was published. COPTS NOT A MINORITY Also on page 9, Ibrahim al-Bayyumi Ghanim discusses in a 3,000-word article entitled: "The Conference on Minorities and the Policy of Division" the status of Egypt's Coptic community. He refers to the attempts of foreign powers to use the minority issue to "serve their ambitions and promote their objectives in some of our countries where some minorities live, this being a well-known and long-established policy of Western and U.S. colonialism." The article recalls the controversy surrounding the plan by Cairo's Ibn-Khaldun Center and the London-based Minority Rights Group to hold a conference on minorities in Cairo and issue a declaration called "The Cairo Declaration on Minority Rights." The controversy forced the organizers to change the meeting's venue from Cairo to Cyprus. The writer points out that "the issue of minorities is an extremely sensitive issue and one of the most controversial worldwide." He adds that "foreign colonial and Zionist powers seek by actual intervention to foster ethnic and religious conflicts with the aim of turning these groups into new statelets and warring factions that will be easy to swallow." He expresses reservations about the UN declaration of 18 December 1992 about the rights of "individuals belonging to national, ethnic, and linguistic minorities" and says it cannot serve as a reference for handling minority issues in "our Arab and Islamic societies." The writer denies that the Copts are a minority in Egypt and recalls how they were removed from the agenda of the conference in question following the uproar that surrounded their original inclusion in it. He writes: "They are not an ethnic minority or the descendants of a different national group. Actually the Muslims of Egypt are the descendants of the Copts of the pre-Islamic era. The Copts have no special language or culture that would isolate them from others but are a basic component of Egypt's social and cultural fabric." He asserts that an Islamic system joins Muslims and the adherents of other religions in a united homeland and in a framework of common interests and emphasizes that an Islamic society always guarantees freedom of worship for non-Muslims. He remarks: "The relationship between Egypt's Muslims and Copts was not disturbed until foreign colonialism entered our land. Nowadays a vicious foreign element or a disloyal domestic element is sowing suspicion among the sons of the same homeland and provoking disputes among them, thus serving the interests of colonialism and Zionism." He continues: "It is our view that if the minority concept prevails in any society, it will have unlimited destructive repercussions that will eventually waste the united majority and lead to its dissolution. This can only be followed by its disappearance and assimilation into greedy foreign entities that seek to dominate us and control the whole world." He ends the article by calling for the inclusion of all citizens in a free discussion of national issues.
