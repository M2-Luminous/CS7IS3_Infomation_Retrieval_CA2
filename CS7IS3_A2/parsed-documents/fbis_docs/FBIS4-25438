Wei Jianxing, member of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat and secretary of the Discipline Inspection Commission of the CPC Central Committee, addressed the conference. He said: Party committees and governments, as well as discipline inspection and supervision organs at all levels should continue to earnestly carry out the three tasks of the anticorruption drive in line with the party Central Committee's plans. Currently it is necessary to pay particular attention to intensifying investigation of major and serious economic offenses involving leading officials at and above the county and section levels. Meanwhile, it is necessary to halt all kinds of malpractice and corruption adversely affecting the progress of reforms, economic growth, and stability; and to strive to deepen the anticorruption drive and make it a still greater success. According to statistics, in the first quarter of this year, discipline inspection and supervision organs nationwide received a total of 366,000 tips from the masses, completed the investigation of 14,718 cases, placed an additional 22,981 cases on file for investigation, and disciplined 15,216 party and government officials. These officials included 450 county or section-level, 35 prefectural or department-level, and 3 provincial or ministerial-level cadres. Of the 15,216 officials, 1,416 were handed over to judicial departments for prosecution on criminal charges. Through investigating and handling discipline violation cases, a total of 642 million yuan in economic losses were recovered for the state. Wei Jianxing said: Despite some successes in the anticorruption drive, there remain a number of problems which must not be overlooked, and which must be resolved by taking effective measures. He emphasized: We must further strengthen the leadership over handling of cases and must conclude the investigation of a number of major cases within the next few months. He said: All localities and departments should work out plans and take action, concentrating attention on major cases involving economic offenses, such as embezzlement, bribery, financial frauds, smuggling, and serious violations of financial and economic discipline. Leading departments of the party and government, judicial departments, administrative law-enforcement departments, and economic administrative departments should remain the main targets; while investigation should be focused on major and serious economic offenses by leading cadres at and above the county and section levels. He said: While investigating major and serious cases, it is also necessary to pay keen attention to the work related to leading cadres' honesty and self-discipline, and correction of style. As far as the work related to honesty and self-discipline is concerned, efforts should be concentrated on self-examination and correction by leading cadres. Where a department or locality has failed to convene a democratic meeting to examine leading cadres' honesty and self-discipline, it is necessary to promptly do so. Where such a meeting has been convened, it is necessary to report the meeting results as they really are to cadres and people at large, and to accept their evaluation and supervision. Problems which have been revealed during the self-examination or investigation should be promptly corrected and handled according to regulations. He said: The main targets of correction this year should be focused on screening of wanton collection of fees, investigating use of government funds to go on sight-seeing tours outside the country (territory), and checking power abuse by party and government organs and their functionaries in using enterprise money and materials free of charge, and halting salient malpractice in various departments, trades, and professions. Meanwhile, he emphasized: We should coordinate various forces to review progress of the anticorruption drive and earnestly supervise and inspect the implementation of the three tasks, especially the progress in investigating major and serious cases, thereby deepening the anticorruption drive. State Councillor Li Guixian spoke on the need by various departments and governments at all levels to step up efforts to correct unhealthy practices in various trades and professions and promote the construction of clean government. Responsible persons from the relevant departments attended the conference.
