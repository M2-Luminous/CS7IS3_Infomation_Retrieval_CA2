President Mubarak also listened to a large number of intellectuals, thinkers, and opinion makers about their concepts of these problems and issues, both at the internal and external policy levels. They also discussed the cultural challenge under peace, the national dialogue, and the various problems facing books and the theater. The president emphasized a number of issues and principles during this dialogue. President Mubarak also stressed his pledge to respect the law and Constitution without resorting to any emergency measure in the confrontation with terrorism, even though that means that it might take longer to eliminate terrorism. The information minister added that President Mubarak also stressed that corruption is not being covered up, saying that every such case is referred to the courts for investigation. He said that not a single case of corruption is covered up by the state; on the contrary, the government has always taken the initiative in following up and exposing such cases and referring them to the judiciary. The president stressed that every person who indulges in corruption is brought to account and tried so that others will be deterred. He said: We should respect the values of publication and not belittle or insult ourselves. The information minister went on to say that, on the issue of freedom of opinion, President Mubarak stressed that there is no confiscation of an opinion, idea, or book. He said: We will not permit the confiscation or the recollection from markets of a book because of an administrative decision made by an establishment or government department. The president also stressed that the housing law will not be referred to the People's Assembly until after an exhaustive discussion and debate, adding that there will be no law that harms the sons of society. He said: Up to this minute, no draft law has been prepared. All we have are studies and views on this subject. The president called for setting up a higher specialized committee that includes experts in civil planning and housing to draw up the plan for tackling the issue of slums all over the republic. On the issue of the national dialogue, which he has called for, the president stressed that the dialogue's objective is Egypt's present and future, adding that it will include all the political parties, national forums, intellectuals, thinkers, experts, and specialists. President Mubarak added: This dialogue will have working papers that will be prepared before it starts. He proposed that the dialogue start on 1 April. The information minister said that the president emphasized his responsibility to protect the security of Egypt and its sons and to achieve stability on its land, noting that there is a red line that no human being or group is allowed to cross. President Mubarak stressed that the achievement of a just peace in the region will lead to the development of a better life and to a rise in its sons' standard of living. He said that this can come only through the use of advanced technology and cooperation and coordination between the countries of the region. President Mubarak affirmed that the emergency law will continue and that, with the ongoing acts of terrorism, drug trafficking, and unusual circumstances, it is impossible to change or abolish it. He noted that this law was passed to safeguard society and that it will not affect freedom of speech and of the press. President Mubarak called on the government to reconsider certain laws to close loopholes regarding the illegal buildings and to deter violators. He stressed that buildings that have technically and structurally safe foundations will not be demolished. He requested that fines imposed on floors built in violation of the law be transferred to the popular housing fund. He said that expropriation of property should be partial and in accordance with a legal decision and verdict in favor of popular housing. Al-Sharif noted that President Mubarak stressed that with peace Egypt is capable of dealing with the region with self-confidence to achieve progress and increase and improve production. President Mubarak stated that he referred to the People's Assembly a bill requesting abrogation of the agreement of the Arab Cooperation Council [which includes Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Yemen]. President Mubarak ordered the formation of a tripartite committee of the ministers of information, culture, and education to meet monthly to coordinate efforts to educate and enlighten society. He requested that the government study the problem of books and their prices to ensure export and competition in foreign markets. He requested reducing customs fees on paper so that Egypt will retain its vanguard cultural standing. Al-Sharif said that President Mubarak declared that Egypt will not sign the agreement banning the use of chemical weapons unless it is linked to banning the use of nuclear weapons. President Mubarak said that Egypt's stance is firm on this issue and it will not sign this agreement unless the other is signed. President Mubarak stressed that national dialogue will involve all legal parties and national forces. He emphasized respect for the law and that there will be no dialogue with illegal groups. He said that the Constitution in Egypt bans the establishment of religious parties and that the experiments of Jordan and Algeria will not be repeated in Egypt. No one will impose a view on Egypt or its people in the name of religion. At the beginning of the meeting, President Mubarak broached the issue of terrorism, stressing that it preoccupies every Egyptian citizen despite the fact that it is an international phenomenon. He noted that we see acts of violence taking place everyday worldwide. He said that despite this we will not be lenient in confronting terrorism and stopping bloodshed and its impact on stability and the people's wellbeing. He noted that terrorism can be ended in a short time but will require exceptional measures. He stressed that in its firm confrontation of terrorism, Egypt wants to entrench the supremacy of law and respect for the Constitution, although settling this phenomenon once and for all will take time. He said that we are determined to ensure respect for the law and the Constitution without taking any exceptional measures to confront terrorism. President Mubarak said that certain people speak of human rights and defend the rights of those who commit crimes of terrorism, forgetting the rights of victims and the state's right to protect and ensure security for its people. He noted that there are forces and states seeking to harm Egypt's stability and that certain parties fund the fugitive criminals. These parties finance terrorists to commit their crimes thinking that they will escape law and justice.

He stressed that there is a need to give and to take to serve the region's people.
