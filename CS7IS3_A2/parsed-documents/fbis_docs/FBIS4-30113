The cancellation was decided because the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) submitted a no-confidence motion earlier in the day to the House of Representatives against the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, the official said. If the lower house approves the motion, Hata must either resign with his entire cabinet or dissolve the house for a general election. "Under the circumstances, it is not appropriate for the foreign minister, who is a member of the cabinet, to go to the U.S. and negotiate," the official said. Kantor said Tuesday he plans to discuss macroeconomic and sectoral issues when he meets Kakizawa. On Tuesday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said Kakizawa's visit to the U.S. has yet to be fixed because of uncertainties in Japan's political community. Kakizawa was to leave Japan on Friday and return to Tokyo on Monday. Japan and U.S. officials have said they hope to reach an agreement in the talks on setting up a new bilateral trade framework before the Naples summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations in July. Under the framework negotiations designed to rectify the chronic trade imbalance between the two countries, the U.S. is pressing Japan to set "objective criteria" to measure progress in market- opening. But Tokyo rejects binding criteria, saying they could lead to managed trade.
