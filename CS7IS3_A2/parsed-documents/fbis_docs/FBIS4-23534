"In negotiations with representatives of the far-right parties we have found a new determination to resolve problems by peaceful means," he told a gathering organised by the National Peace Secretariat in Johannesburg to honour peacemakers. "We do differ and differ sharply. But it is our obligation to ensure that these differences are thrashed out in rational discussions and negotiations." He said many of his supporters believed that by talking to the right-wing the African National Congress was conceding too much. "They (our supporters) forget that when we launched the peace process the National Party [NP] was in the same position as the right-wing today. Today the NP is part of the government of national unity." Mr Mandela said the most effective method of dealing with the right-wing was to use the power of persuasion and to point out the need to love other people. "Our obligation is to draw their attention to those issues that bind us, not separate us. The government will continue to pursue this course with a patient determination. We do recognise the moral and historical obligation to ensure that the wounds of the past are healed," he said. Mr Mandela added his government would ensure maximum openness and disclosure so the healing process was meaningful, permanent and a beacon to future generations. In this regard, the "truth commission" announced earlier on Tuesday by Justice Minister Dullah Omar was aimed at reconciling the nation and not at retribution.
