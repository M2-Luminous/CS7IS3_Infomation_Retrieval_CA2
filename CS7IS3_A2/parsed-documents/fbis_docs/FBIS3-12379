The committee (?failed) to return the military units of the al-Wahdah Brigade, which were moved from the Hadramaut Governorate to the Mudiyah area in the Abyan Governorate, and the 30th Brigade forces, which were moved to the village of (Kumkawz) in the Abyan Governorate because the other party did not respond to the committee's instructions and insisted on keeping the forces in these positions, thereby violating the decisions of the Presidential Council and the provisions of the pledge and accord document. The source regretted the committee's failure in its mission as a result of the obstacles placed in its way. This, the source added, will escalate tension in the area and aggravate the situation. The source added: At 1530 today, Friday, two military planes flew at low altitude over the city of Mudiyah and the al-'Amaliqah Brigade garrison and broke the sound barrier. This caused a state of fear among citizens. These irresponsible and reckless acts fall within the framework of provocative acts and continuous blatant aggressions to which the innocent, defenseless people in the steadfast Abyan Governorate are being exposed. Furthermore, the source added, these acts aim at tightening the siege on the al-'Amaliqah Brigade, which began on Sunday, 10 Ramadan [20 February], the moment the pledge and accord document was signed in Amman. The source urged the Political Forces Dialogue Committee and the military committee to shoulder their responsibilities at this delicate moment and put an end to these reckless acts which only aim at obstructing the ongoing efforts to implement the pledge and accord document and at endangering the unity of the homeland and its Armed Forces.
