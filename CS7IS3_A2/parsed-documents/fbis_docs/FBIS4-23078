It is here that a host of problems have arisen associated with defense conversion, high-tech advances, development of a market for information-related products, and of course, these problems are becoming especially acute in connection with the privatization of these businesses. It seems that enterprises of this kind are tottering on the edge of extinction due to the comparatively intense influx of Western information technology into Russia and bordering nations, which is quite natural, given that we are so dreadfully far behind in this area. Bankruptcy, outside leasing, or sale of premises and hands to foreign companies--is this the end? Our correspondent Nataliya Lazareva talks with the deputy science director of Zelenograd Scientific Research Institute of Molecular Electronics and the ``Mikron'' Plant, Pavel Prikhodko. Also taking part in the discussion were representatives of the small scientific production enterprise ``Silikon'': its director Anatoliy Skvirya and vice president Aleksandr Sokolov. [Prikhodko] Heretofore, most of the output of our enterprise was produced for the defense industry. Today this is no longer a secret. Nor is it a secret that our economic situation and development has been stable and secure: state orders, government support, priority funding. We have developed in conformity with long-term ideas and plans. In the period of 1984-1985, in my opinion, we were minimally behind the world level of the electronics industry, probably only about 3-4 years. We were being used by as many as 18 Soviet ministries: ultrapure materials, electronic equipment and precision machine tools, nonferrous metals, chemistry. Everything was clear and comprehensible for people, and salary was guaranteed. Moreover, the standard of living in Zelenograd was much better than that in other regions of the country. We could pick the best college graduates for our plants and institutes, engineers and workers were in competition for jobs. [Lazareva]And was everything really so tranquil? [Prikhodko] In reality, not at all. The main creeping danger was that people who had a comparatively high wage for those times were making no effort to improve quality and increase productivity of their labor. [Lazareva]Indeed, that was no small danger for this kind of production. And when did the situation change drastically? [Prikhodko]Our main troubles started in 1991. There was a dramatic reduction of state orders and budget funding, the Soviet-wide division of labor disappeared, and we were left without suppliers. Figuratively speaking, we were in a potential well. The simplest thing to do in such a situation is to let the buildings be used for commercial warehouses, and start making knickknacks, but that is not what was done. It ought to be mentioned that a microelectronics enterprise can't be shut down, something like an open-hearth furnace: purification of water and air, preparation of energy carriers, everything has to operate continuously. Besides, we knew that if people were laid off for very long without pay, we would not get them back. Therefore, simultaneously with curtailment of our usual production, we began to retool and set our sights on conquering our sectors on the international market. [Lazareva]That was tough for sure; there wouldn't be many outside our country who could believe that we were in any condition to compete on the world level in microelectronics. [Prikhodko] That's right. We were hard put to find foreign partners. A lot of times we took part in several delegations in a day. At first we were unable to make contacts; at that time we didn't have a handle on the way things were done. But it was explained to us by a representative of a Japanese company that according to their lights it is considered normal to make a little headway in one out of 200 talks. We had our first success with representatives of the Samsung Company. We agreed to produce on franchise a small clock chip for sale on their market. This is where the switch began from the Soviet to the Western style of production. We were well aware that this switch would take enormous capital investments: a different production structure would have to be set up. And incidentally, it cannot be said that this would have been beyond our reach. The level of production and quality control at our plants was still the highest in the nation: items went directly to outfit special facilities and space vehicles. In 1991, we experienced some decline in facilities for production development. In 1992, they began to arrive, and were mainly put to use in elevating the technical level of production. Samsung was followed by agreements with companies in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and some European companies. Now more than 40% of the volume of our production output is exported by agreements. For businesses like ours, there has been a sharp decline in the number of previously planned state defense orders. We need a lot of money to acquire new equipment operating on the level of the latest technologies. Construction has now started on two new shops for producing LSI chips with micron design standards. A conglomerate of state structures is investing money in construction of one of these, and the ``Korona'' Joint Enterprise that operates in contact with a Hong Kong company is investing in construction of the other shop. [Lazareva]And what have been the results? [Prikhodko]The Russian production line is now in its third year of construction. The production cycle is totally dependent on the dynamics of incoming budgetary finances. ``Korona'' has promised to complete construction in 20 months. Right now, 49 percent of the investment in this enterprise is foreign, and 51 percent is ours. We, of course, will have the controlling block of shares. [Lazareva]But you can see that this is not a very productive way. The production manager is engaged in lots of talks, looking for partners... the next thing to hustling. [Skvirya] We realized long ago that a new approach is needed here. And we are best suited for it: a small mobile enterprise where scientists work together who have a lot of contacts in their fields throughout the world. We know the directions of promising research, the interests of partners, and a host of foreign companies where talks will lead to the desired outcome. Many Western specialists and managers prefer to deal first with a small non-governmental company. So it is just this scientific-technical ``pimping'' that we are taking as one of the areas of our operations. It is convenient, effective, and mobile. On the other hand, we are the very ones who are concerned about Zelenograd enterprises. After all, they are like our children. ``Silikon'' originated at one time in the bowels of the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology. Graduates of that institute are now working in the research institutes and plants of Zelenograd. Even Pavel Prikhodko and the director of ``Mikron,'' Gennadiy Krasnikov, are former MIET students. So our specialists are well aware of the industry in Zelenograd, its needs and specifics. [Lazareva]And who else is ``Mikron'' involved with? [Prikhodko] The mainland Chinese are very much interested in our technical advances. They are now marshalling considerable efforts and state funds for development in microelectronics; but Western franchises are too expensive, and therefore they are giving a lot of attention to markets of Russian microelectronic technologies. Contacts with the People's Republic of China may be quite profitable. I have been in China, and have had a lot of talks with their managers. Although it is well known that they are the oldest traders in the world, many of them are seriously studying marketing in Japan. Talks with representatives of Chinese companies always necessitate carefully reasoned strategy and tactics, bordering on art. Within the scope of this cooperation, we are also hoping to penetrate into the remaining markets of China and other Southeast Asian nations. You know, to all appearances, Western European nations are in no hurry to deal with us. And the situation with the U.S. is even more ambiguous. It looks like things are getting easier with regard to KOKOM organizations, but in connection with defense conversion--and they are involved in that, too--there are now already about 65,000 unemployed in their ``Silicon Valley''. So it is unlikely that there would be any profit from selling them franchises to the Russian market. [Sokolov] According to some information, recently ``Silicon Valley'' companies that have been trying to establish relations with Russian businesses are having a tough time, and even being fined. But on the other hand, they won't be able to get by without contacts with Russia. The microelectronics industry is really quite hazardous. The U.S. is desperate to get it out of their country. Up until now, they have got by on contacts with Southeast Asian nations. And they are extending these contacts to us, as well--labor is cheap here, too. We would rise up against ecologically unsafe production, but that would put an end to our hopes for the future. Russia has to go through the stage of production by franchises, working to some extent for the Western market. In doing so, we must not fail to give some thought to the ones with whom we make contact. It would not be in our best interests to acquire technologies that are outdated (for them), going nowhere from the engineering standpoint, and ecologically dirty; and so far, that is what we are being offered. We have to look for the most promising franchises: comparatively new, competitive, and with opportunities for further independent development. This is the direction that our company is trying to take. [Lazareva] But by your own words, the implication is that this is scarcely possible under present conditions. [Sokolov]The main thing is to understand with whom we can deal. For example, we have been well aware that specialists of the well known U.S. company ``Sun Microsystems'' are working with Russian scientists, with the Moscow center of SPARC technologies, and with the largest Russian developer of supercomputers, Associate Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Boris Babayan. We have understood that these are the contacts that are needed. We have not procrastinated in starting talks, and have achieved some promising results. ``Sun'' has offered a franchise to ``Mikron'' for producing microprocessors by the most progressive SPARC technology. [Lazareva]SPARC is a homonym of ``spark''. So is the franchise from ``Sun'' a spark of hope? [Sokolov]To some extent, yes. The fact is that ``Sun'' takes pride in its open technical policy. And that policy includes the opportunity, if that is the right word, of further creative development of their circuits. We have purchased not just a technology, but also data about the theoretical principles of production of the chip, mathematical groundwork, and architecture. On this basis, we have acquired access to international standards. And thanks to the considerable experience of scientists in our nation, we will be able to use the acquired technology as a springboard, or to put it in a better way, to skip over several steps and create our own Russian devices that are modifications of U.S. chips meeting specifications on the world level. There are companies in Russia that are ready to use these chips. It has been suggested that we use them for Russian workstations based on powerful personal computers. Design problems are being studied by Vladimir Betelin, director of NIISI [not further identified] of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In future he is hoping to arrange for industrial production. To carry out this project, monetary credits are being requested through the line of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The same source will allocate the necessary funds for ``Mikron'' to acquire a franchise for the chip. [Lazareva]But are you sure that you will be able to carry out such ambitious plans just now? [Prikhodko] Thanks to maintaining our potential for this period, we have not yet run out of energy. We are now starting to carry out large-scale international programs. The first is tied up with the ``Sun'' franchise. The second novel technology that we have developed is ultrathin silicon films on an insulator. This is called the SIMON process. A Russian- U.S. joint enterprise has already been set up. The money is being contributed by the U.S. side and some Russian businesses and organizations. Billions of rubles are needed for this promising technology. Our minister of science Boris Saltykov is very interested in this project. His technological fund is now ready to invest the necessary money in the SIMON process. To have the capability of carrying out the most flexible technical and economic policy, as well as to establish the closest working contacts with the world microelectronics community, our plant and his research institute have now set up a joint-stock company of open type. We feel that this is the most convenient form of privatizing a large state enterprise. [Lazareva] Well, have you lost any of your essential personnel? [Prikhodko] Of course, small businesses have taken away a lot of my specialists, and incidentally the best of them. One expects this. It is the educated, inventive, linguistically talented people with a feel for technology who can confidently count on independent success in small business. And many have been successful, but unfortunately are losing the qualifications necessary for our work. Right now in our association the average pay scale is 62,000. And the salary reaches something like 120 in a bread-baking plant, and even more in some small enterprises. Naturally, some are leaving for commercial structures, especially banks. We are also aware that the most successful of those who have left us for free enterprise are trying to get the greatest number of our shares when they are auctioned off. It is natural that in this situation we look out for the interests of our team of scientists and workers, so that they will be able to make continued use of the potential in microelectronics that they have created. Let us hope that the controlling block of shares will go to people with clarity of purpose who have staked a lot and know what is worth attaining by their investment. And in the given case, the only thing worth attaining is getting the Russian microelectronics industry properly into the world distribution of labor, and making a profit.
