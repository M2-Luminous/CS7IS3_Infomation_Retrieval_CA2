FR941004-1-00124 FR941004-1-00019 The Proposed Amendment The Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 11 as follows: PART 11_GENERAL RULEMAKING PROCEDURES 1. The authority citation for part 11 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. app. 1341(a), 1343(d), 1348, 1354(a), 1401&hyph;1405, 1421&hyph;1431, 1481, 1502; 49 U.S.C. 106(g). 2. A new section 11.17 is added to subpart A to read as follows: ยง11.17 Direct final rule. Whenever the FAA anticipates that a proposed regulation is unlikely to result in adverse comment, it may choose to issue a direct final rule. The direct final rule will advise the public that no adverse or negative comments are anticipated, and that unless a written adverse or negative comment, or a written notice of intent to submit an adverse or negative comment is received within the comment period, the regulation will become effective on the date specified in the direct final rule. If no written adverse or negative comment, or notice of intent to submit such a comment is received within the comment period, the direct final rule will become effective on the date indicated in the direct final rule. The FAA will publish a document in the Federal Register indicating that no adverse or negative comments were received and confirming the date on which the final rule will become effective. If the FAA does receive, within the comment period, an adverse or negative comment, or written notice of intent to submit such a comment, a document withdrawing the direct final rule will be published in the Federal Register , and a notice of proposed rulemaking will be published with a new comment period. Normal procedures for the agency's receipt and consideration of comments will then apply. Issued in Washington, DC on September 27, 1994. Mark L. Gerchick, Chief Counsel.
