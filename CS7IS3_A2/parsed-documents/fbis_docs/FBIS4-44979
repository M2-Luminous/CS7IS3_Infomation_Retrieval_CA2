Elections to town panchayats, municipalities and municipal corporations would be held before November this year and elected councils to these bodies would be formed by that month, the Local Administration Minister, Mr. T.M. Selvaganapathy, announced in the Assembly today. The Minister was replying to the discussions on Bills seeking to bring the Municipalities Act in conformity with the Central Government's Nagarpalika Act. He expressed his inability to hold the elections in the next three months, as the Government had to take follow-up action on several heads after the passage of the legislation. He said the Government had to prepare the electoral rolls, identify the seats and posts for reservation for SC/ST [expansion not given] and women and frame the rules under these statutes. Hence it required the six months time-limit provided for in the Act for the holding of the elections. Mayoral Poll With the upgradation of the municipalities of Tiruchi, Tirunelveli and Salem into municipal corporations, direct elections would be held for six posts of Mayors. Of these six posts, two would be reserved for women and one for SC/ST and the reservation would be by rotation. Chairpersons of municipalities would be elected directly and one-third of the posts would be reserved for women. For SC/ST, the reservation would be on the basis of their population for which the 1991 census would be the base. These reserved posts too would go by rotation. Municipalities with more than three lakhs population would have independent ward committees, for which suitable provisions had been made in the new Act, he said. Mr. Selvaganapathy detailed the salient provisions of the Bill, and said the new statute would enable these local bodies to associate themselves in the planning process. Turns Down Demand He turned down a demand that MLAs [Member of Legislative Assembly] and MPs [Member of Parliament] participating in these elected councils should have no voting right. The 74th amendment to the Constitution made it mandatory. Likewise election to the post of Mayor too had to be directly by the people under the Central Act, he said. In the discussions, Mr. Gnanasekaran (Cong.-I) welcomed the mandatory election to these local bodies once in five years. He wanted the Government to hold elections within three months after the passage of the bill. Mr. M. Sundardoss (Cong.-I) opposed direct election to the post of Mayor of municipal corporations. The reservation for women and SC/ST should not be by nominations, but by enabling these segments to win the elections through proper identification of the wards for them. Others who participated included Mr. Deivanayagam (Cong.-I), Mr. O.S. Amarnath (AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]) and Mr. V. Thambusamy (CPI-M [Communist Party of India-Marxist]). After the Minister's reply, the Bills were passed. The House also adopted after a brief discussion the Bill which amended the Public Property (Prevention of Damage and Loss) Act. The new Bill provides for punishment of the persons who actually caused damage or loss to the private property and to make the political parties or communal or ethnic groups which organised procession, assembly, meeting, agitation, demonstration or other activities leading to violence also liable to pay compensation. Authorised Officer Replying to the discussion on the Bill, the Leader of the House, Mr. V.R. Nedunchezhian, said that the Commissioner for Revenue Administration would be the authorised officer to whom the petitions for compensation should be made. He also said that this legislation would itself be a deterrent to those indulging in violence. In the absence of this measure the Government would be handicapped against taking action against the culprits.
