Since it was mooted by Malaysia more than three years ago, the U.S. has firmly said no to the idea. However, what is most discouraging is that the reason for its opposition to the caucus did not hold water. America thinks that it will have a negative effect on the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC. It is difficult to accept such an explanation. The EAEC has been proposed as a forum to propagate the free trade. Rather than posing any obstacle, it will complement APEC. As such, there is no basis to the claim. APEC was formed to sustain the growth and dynamism of the Asia-Pacific region. However, East Asian economies have evolved in a somewhat different manner. Their economies unlike that of the U.S. have become a success story. Therefore, the promotion of the EAEC is a natural step forward in view of the rapid pace of economic integration in the region. What is more remarkable is that the integration has been driven by market forces. In the process and without doubt, East Asia has become an important economic entity in the global scenario. As a mere consultative forum, the EAEC will provide a platform for these countries to discuss trade and other issues of common interests. It is clear that from the very beginning, the U.S. was annoyed with the idea since it was left out. But, the U.S. is not part of East Asia. How can they be part of the EAEC. Nevertheless, the EAEC, which has now progressed into an ASEAN proposal, should look forward to its formation. Enough time has been spent on debating the pros and cons of the caucus. The time has come for the EAEC to get off the ground with ASEAN countries as the core members. Of course, there are concerns that Japan may be reluctant to join up now that the U.S. has rejected the idea. But this should not be the case. As a major economic superpower in the region, Japan's membership will have a tremendous impact in enhancing the structure of the EAEC. At the same time, Japan has to realize that there is also much economic dynamism in the other potential members. They include emerging China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Therefore, Japan should consider the benefits of an EAEC comprising the most dynamic economies of the world. No less important is the immense combined market opportunities these countries will offer. Another vital role is that it could provide the platform for member countries to act as a single unit in holding out the cause and principles of free trade in international trade negotiations. It is clearly evident that the Western powers dominate issues and decisions in international trade talks. Moves to institutionalize APEC are an example of how strong countries dominate others. This should not be the case any longer. As successful economies, East Asian countries need to have a stronger voice in the international arena so that any decision arrived at is equitable to all. This being the case, the speedy establishment of the EAEC is highly justified. This is no time for listening to both the skeptics and the critics. It is time to act.
