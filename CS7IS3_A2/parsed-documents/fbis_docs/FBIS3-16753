He told Interfax Monday that the telephone lines in the building had been put out of order by hot water from a broken pipeline. As a result, some telephones were cut off and some only receive calls from the city, while calling from them is hopeless. Officials in the Communications Ministry confirmed for Interfax the fact of a breakdown in the pipeline which resulted in disruption of telephone links with the government headquarters. City utility services on Monday intended to pump water out of the trench where the cable is laid. The cable itself is to be dried out Tuesday and the damage repaired. If need be, the entire lines will be replaced.
