[Verheugen] The CDU has provided another piece of evidence of its helplessness. It analyzes and criticizes matters, but it does not take the appropriate steps and, furthermore, it keeps silent about the fact that it is responsible for these matters. The people know very well who has ruled in Bonn for the past 11 years. [Rosenbaum] However, there is no doubt that Helmut Kohl was able to convey the mood for a new start.... [Verheugen] This was an artificial good mood and nothing else but auto-suggestion. This party congress will not have any long-term effect. [Rosenbaum] Are you underestimating Kohl's qualities as a fighter? [Verheugen] We have known from the very start that he can and will fight. However, over the next few months the problems will catch up with him. Unemployment will rise. And the debts are assuming uncontrollable dimensions. Kohl's room for maneuver is increasingly narrowing. Therefore, it is no wonder that he tries to escape into topics of yesterday and the day before yesterday. [Rosenbaum] How do you assess the CDU's basic program? [Verheugen] We will analyze it with the appropriate attention. In general, I consider it a step backwards, because it does not look to the future but is just the imitation of failed government policy. I would called it moderate Thatcherism. And when I see how the working people have been pushed back, I am seriously worried about the CDU's character as a people's party. [Rosenbaum] Are you overlooking that new statements -- for example, on the ecological market economy -- are indeed looking to the future? [Verheugen] I would like to believe it, if one could hope that this will have any effects on practical policy. We will not spare the CDU this test. Government policy so far has contradicted that. [Rosenbaum] The idea of family-splitting does not seem to be far away from the ideas of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] to change spouses' splitting [for taxation purposes]. [Verheugen] The SPD has repeatedly called for a fair equalization of families' burdens. It must be recognized that now the CDU, too, thinks that something has to be done in this respect. We want the abolition of tax allowances for children and a limitation of the advantages derived from splitting. Instead, child allowance should be paid for each child; we are thinking in terms of about 250 German marks. At the moment we are working on a procedure that could save a lot of administrative work: Child allowance would be directly deducted from payable tax. Nontax payers or those who pay very little tax would get the sum directly.
