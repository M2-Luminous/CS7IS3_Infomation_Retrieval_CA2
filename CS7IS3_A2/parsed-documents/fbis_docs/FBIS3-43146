Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-20JAN94-PALESTINIANS Mainstream Palestinians Continue Pressure on PLO for Reform SUMMARY Recent meetings between PLO leaders and a delegation of mainstream Palestinians demanding reform of Yasir 'Arafat's autocratic leadership appear to have achieved little to resolve the growing internal Palestinian dispute over PLO decisionmaking. 'Arafat's evident unwillingness to heed the reformer's demands is likely to exacerbate dissent among mainstream Palestinains, irrespective of the course of negotiations with Israel. END SUMMARY PLO leaders and a delegation of seven Palestinians led by the prominent Gazan Haydar 'Abd-al-Shaf i met in Tunis in early January following growing public Palestinian criticism of PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat's leadership. In November, more than 100 prominent Palestinians in the Occupied Territories and Jordan reportedly signed a memorandum demanding reform in the PLO. According to the Amman daily Jordan Times, the signers reaffirmed their recognition of the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people but said that they "are not satisfied with the working method of political leadership at this stage," with regard either to "running the difficult and sensitive negotiations with the Israeli side" or to "preparing for . . national development in the transition stage" envisaged for the territories under the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles [DOP] (21 December). While media accounts of the reformers' demands have differed on details, the demands clearly include measures to make the PLO leadership more accountable, assure creation of democratic institutions in the proposed autonomous Palestinian entity, and ensure that professional competence will be the primary criterion for choosing Palestinian officials in the autonomy regime (see box). According to the French news agency AFP, 'Abd-al-Shafi said that the objective of the reformers is "to broaden the decisionmaking structure so that it does not stay entirely in Abu-'Ammar's ['Arafat's] hands" and to establish a "collective leadership" (3 January). Meager Results, Continued Criticism Judging from comments by 'Abd-al-Shafi and others, the Tunis meetings did little to further reformers' goals. Speaking to journalists in Amman on 8 January, 'Abd-al-Shafi proclaimed the meetings a success, but his awkward and contradictory language suggested an effort to paper over unresolved differences. As quoted in the Jordan Times on the 9th, he said that the PLO leadership's response to his delegation was "not rejectionist to our calls for democratic reforms but not actively supportive." In the same interview, he said that PLO leaders acknowledged "the importance of democratizing the structure of the PLO and of adopting democracy in our political life as a whole" and "endorsed" the statement presented by his delegation, but he also said "not all demands were accepted." 'Abd-al-Shafi confirmed that the PLO had accepted one demand, authorizing him to initiate a "popular dialogue" among all Palestinian factions, including those opposed to the DOP. Nonetheless, he clearly implied a lack of agreement on calls for institutional reform within the PLO, saying on the one hand that "expanding the decisionmaking body and collective leadership cannot be done at this stage" but adding on the other hand that "it is unacceptable that Abu-'Ammar ['Arafat] alone makes the decisions." According to the report, he also insisted that Palestinian elections be carried out as scheduled next summer. Other remarks attributed to 'Abd-al-Shafi immediately after the Tunis meetings left no doubt that he was dissatisfied with the outcome. On 7 January, the London-based Saudi daily Al-Sharq Al- Awsat quoted him as criticizing both 'Arafat and the PLO Executive Committee, saying that "'Arafat is still monopolizing the decisionmaking" and that Executive Committee members "are making it easy for him to continue to do so by accepting that he is the decisionmaker." According to the paper, 'Abd-al-Shaf i warned that if 'Arafat did not accept reformers' demands, they would seek recourse to "the PLO's legitimate institutions," possibly a reference to the Palestine Central Council or the Palestine National Council, and "after that we would seek the verdict of the masses." Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to bilateral Middle East peace talks until her recent resignation- -apparently out of frustration with 'Arafat's autocratic leadership--from all formal PLO activity, stepped up her own criticism of the PLO leader in a recent interview. Indicating her disenchantment with the PLO leadership and in particular resentment over the limited role of residents of the territories as Palestinians prepare for autonomy, she said that Palestinians currently "have a leadership that has not lived in its own country, with its own people, with a system of accountability, of control, and critical commentary for a long time." As Palestinians undergo the transition to self-rule, she said, "we must ensure that the new government respects citizens' rights and is truly democratic," adding that Palestinians must not emulate "many Third World countries wherein a monolithic authority puts itself, not the people, at the center." Ashrawi avoided a direct answer when asked explicitly whether 'Arafat exercised too much power, but made her opinion clear by saying that "the PLO leadership should be more open and more democratic" and that "the old decisionmaking process is no longer valid." It "remains to be seen," she added pointedly, "whether the PLO is capable of effecting this change." Asked directly whether PLO leaders in Tunis or Palestinians from the territories should occupy key position in the autonomy regime, Ashrawi replied "there should be a good mix" and "the people who have lived permanently in a coherent Palestinian society should get an effective say" (Vienna Der Standard, 10 January). Dissent within PLO's Leadership . Notwithstanding 'Abd-al-Shafi's complaints about the PLO Executive Committee's inaction, several of its members have also reportedly voiced objections to 'Arafat's leadership. The London daily Al-Hayah cited Executive Committee member Samir Ghawshah as saying that he, along with prominent Executive Committee members Mahmud 'Abbas, Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, and Sulayman al-Najjab had sent a memorandum of their own to 'Arafat calling for more democratic decisionmaking and had only recently resumed attending committee meetings following a "period of seclusion" (8 January). And Grumbling in the Ranks In addition to facing increased criticism from prominent mainstream Palestinians in the territories, the PLO leadership also appears to be encountering protests from some of its own cadres in the territories. Some of these less prominent individuals, who see themselves as having borne the primary burden of sustaining the Palestinian uprising, evidently fear a loss of status if the PLO makes the transition from a revolutionary organization to a more conventional political establishment and in particular resent the possible rise at their expense of mainstream Palestinians both in the PLO and the territories whom they perceive as lacking militant credentials. For example, Israel's Qol Yisra'el radio broadcast a statement by Husayn al-Nazir, identified as one of three Fatah officials from the area of Hebron who recently resigned their Fatah posts, attributing his resignation to the "deteriorating internal situation in Fatah institutions in the past few months," specifically the "absence of a democratic policy" and the existence of "bad personalities who hold sensitive posts inside Fatah." Alluding to fears that the PLO leadership in Tunis might use the proposed Palestinian police force to impose its will on PLO cadres in the territories, al-Nazir cited unnamed individuals charged with "forming a security apparatus" and warned that "entrusting a bad personality with running this apparatus will practically destroy Fatah's internal structure." While professing loyalty to 'Arafat, Al-Nazir complained that 'Arafat is "surrounded by a group of personalities who do not brief him on the true reports sent from the territories" and blamed such people for "the rise of traditional personalities who are outside the organization and . . . away from the suffering of the strugglers" who "were always in the confrontation lines" (6 January). PLO Lip Service The PLO's own account of the Tunis meetings strongly suggests a strategy of paying lip service to the reformers' demands while resisting any measures that would effectively reduce the PLO's domination of Palestinian decisionmaking. In its newscast on 7 January, the PLO radio Voice of Palestine (VOP) in Algiers reported a press conference by 'Abd-al-Shafi on the 6th, giving no hint of any tension or disagreement between the delegation and the PLO leadership. (See Note 1) While saying that the meetings were held to discuss "proposals . . . to entrench the democratic conception and consolidate the unity of our people on the basis of political plurality and democratic practices," the report portrayed 'Abd-al-Shaf i as indicating that agreement had been achieved on how to proceed toward these ends. (Note 1) Al-Hayah reported that 'Abd-al-Shafi's press conference included critical remarks (8 January). In the same broadcast, VOP carried the text of a statement by the PLO Executive Committee that purported to welcome the reformers' demands but conveyed a veiled warning to mainstream Palestinian dissenters not to cause trouble. The statement affirmed the Executive Committee's commitment to "the principles of democratic dialogue, political plurality, the respect of views, and the practice of democracy." It also stressed, however, "the importance of consolidating our national unity" and called for "more cohesion and unity. . . . in order to realize the establishment of a patriotic Palestinian authority to complete the Israeli withdrawal [from Gaza and Jericho] as a first step along the path of retrieving the inalienable national rights of our Palestinian people." Alluding to the delegation, the Executive Committee welcomed "the efforts made by some brethren with a view to strengthening national unity and reinforcing the bases of the democratic process" but characterized such efforts as proof of "the health and vitality of the Palestinian arena and our people's determination to rally around the Palestine Liberation Organization." The statement pointedly asserted that "this is the time for unity and not for disunion" and "the time for solidarity that is based on common denominators and not on elements of division." Implications Although most mainstream Palestinians support or at least acquiesce in the PLO's move toward a negotiated settlement with Israel, growing disaffection among mainstream Palestinians, rather than the often more publicized opposition of Palestinian rejectionists, constitutes the greater long term challenge to Yasir 'Arafat's and the PLO's primacy in the Palestinian movement. Tensions between the PLO leadership and mainstream critics--primarily from within the Occupied Territories--are likely to continue regardless of how successfully the PLO conducts negotiations with Israel. Progress toward establishment of a Palestinian autonomy regime could well bring further into the open a thus far semi-veiled struggle for influence among various mainstream Palestinian elements, while deadlocked negotiations and continued disarray in the territories would heighten the perception among many Palestinians that the PLO leadership is incapable of defending their interests. An escalation of disputes among mainstream Palestinians could ultimately weaken the PLO leadership's ability to deal with the complex pressures arising from the current negotiations, especially if protracted difficulties continue. 'Arafat is undoubtedly aware of mounting criticism of his leadership and probably has recognized the need for tactical concessions to his critics. Thus far, however, there is little indication that he has any intention of abandoning his tight control over fundamental decisionmaking, thus leaving open the possibility of a major collision with reform-minded dissidents. Box 1 Palestinian Delegation's Demands According to AFP on 4 January, the list of demands presented to the PLO leadership by 'Abd-al-Shaf i's delegation included the following: --Creation of specialized councils to pursue national action on Palestinian autonomy and also with the Arab and international worlds. --Calling on qualified people and experts to form councils and the planning and executive structures that depend on them. --Giving priority to professional and political competence in forming working groups and negotiating committees and teams instead of favoritism and clan loyalties. --Working out a plan of negotiation based on the text of the [Israel-PLO] Declaration of Principles and ensuring complementarity and coordination among the various commissions and negotiating groups. --Forming a supreme authority for guiding, directing and following up the negotiations process. --Forming a Palestinian Development and Reconstruction Council based on specific criteria so that it should be credible in the eyes of [the Palestinian] people and the donors of funds for building and national economic infrastructure. --Finalizing the work of the [PLO] legislative committee charged with drawing up the basic law--constitution--of the national Palestinian authority in a way that brings out its democratic nature. --Creating as soon as possible a supreme committee to organize a wide national dialogue grouping all Palestinian tendencies. --Creating a high consultative committee of experts with a parallel status to that of the PLO Executive Committee, which has already been weakened by the departure of several of its members. Box 2 The Palestinian Constitution--All Power to 'Arafat? Mainstream critics of Yasir 'Arafat may have had their concerns heightened by the publication in the Jordanian daily Al-Ra'y on 26 December of a reported draft text of the constitution for the proposed Palestinian interim authority in the Occupied Territories. As reported by Al-Ra'y, the constitution clearly concentrates effective power in the hands of the PLO in general and 'Arafat in particular. The draft establishes that the chairman of the PLO Executive Committee, that is, 'Arafat, will be president of the "national authority government" and will "exercise his prerogatives as given to him in the PLO bylaws and the decisions of the Palestine National Council, Central Council, and Executive Committee" as well as specified by the constitution itself. Among other powers listed in the draft, the president is to be "the supreme commander of the Palestinian security forces, which will take orders from him." The draft specifies that the president may serve two six-year terms of office (AFP reported on 8 January that the presidential term was set at five years). It does not, however, mention presidential elections. In addition, the president is empowered to appoint his own vice-president. The draft also outlines the structure and function of the rest of the national authority government, specifying that it will be "appointed by the Executive Committee and will be responsible to it." The draft devotes only one short paragraph to legislative authority, establishing that all legislative power will be exercised by the national authority government "until the legislative council is elected," but omitting any mention of the powers of the prospective legislative council.
