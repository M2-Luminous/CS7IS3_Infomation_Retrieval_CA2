Over three years, 170,000 schoolchildren tested 415 rivers and streams: 75 per cent were in "great" or "good" condition, based on ability to support insect life. Jane De'Ath, who co-ordinated the National RiverWATCH project, said that was a 5.7 per cent improvement since 1971. "This is a welcome improvement but we cannot afford to be complacent," she said. "There were big regional variations, with rivers in the North generally faring much better, while water quality in some southeastern counties has declined." The children monitored their local rivers during September, October and November in 1991, 1992 and last year. They were given kits to measure acid and nitrate levels and fashioned other equipment from household rubbish. Water quality was rated "great" in 28.2 per cent of rivers, meaning they were able to support insects that need high oxygen levels, and 47.2 per cent of rivers rated "good". The worst 2.9 per cent supported no animal life. There were big regional variations. On the insect test, quality improved most in Warwickshire and Lancashire and declined most in Bedfordshire, Suffolk and London. The poor showing of the South East is due to concentration of industry and population, intensive farming and drought. The 13 most litter-strewn rivers were the Cottingham Beck (Humberside), Stour (Worcs), Idle (S Yorks), Lukely Brook (loW), Severn and Rea (Shrops), Lostock, Irwell and Calder (Lancs), Trent (Staffs), Aire (W Yorks), North Esk (Midlothian) and Cam.
