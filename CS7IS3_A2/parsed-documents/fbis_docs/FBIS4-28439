The Burundi-Korea Friendship Association said in a statement that it was an open secret that the U.S., Japan and South Korea have been building up their tripartite military alliance from long ago in an attempt to stifle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but they revealed its true picture as they entered into a phase of real action this time. This is very dangerous and belligerent, added the statement. Noting that the United States has started a reckless war game around the Korean peninsula by instigating its followers under the pretext of "nuclear suspicion" against the DPRK, thus rendering the regional situation further strained, the statement urged an immediate halt to it. The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of the DPRK in a statement said the United States is becoming all the more undisguised in its intention to take military action against Korea on any account through such a joint operation as Rimpac military exercise. The statement strongly demanded that the United States ponder over what consequences would arise from its adventurous military action, stop it at once and accept the peace arrangement proposal of the DPRK. If the United States take the road of a war of aggression, ignoring the desire of the Korean people and the world people for peace, it will face condemnations and destruction, it warned.
