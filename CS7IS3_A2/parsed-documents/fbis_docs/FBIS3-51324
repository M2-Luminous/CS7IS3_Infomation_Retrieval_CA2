Meta Department Governor Omar Armando Baquero asked the national Navy command for an explanation of the task being carried out by foreign soldiers in Puerto Lopez and why regional and municipal authorities were not informed about this. EL TIEMPO has learned that some 70 U.S. soldiers, guarded by Colombian soldiers, have been in Puerto Lopez for one month, apparently building a pier for the national Navy in Rio Meta. It appears they are the soldiers who stayed six months in Guaviare Department where, according to local authorities, they built a naval base. The U.S. troops are under the command of a lieutenant whose identity could not be established, while Major Alvaro Rico, commander of the Advanced River Port No. 63, is in command of the national units. The operations base is located only five minutes away from the urban area of Puerto Lopez, near the road to Puerto Gaitan, and is camouflaged by big trees in a place called Senar, on the banks of Rio Meta. Some kind of camp and several shacks can be observed at the site where the Colombian sentries stand guard. So far, some land movement and flattening work has been performed with heavy equipment such as backhoes, bulldozers, cargo trucks, dump trucks, etc. Puerto Lopez Mayor Hernan Saavedra stated he learned of the foreign troops' presence some 20 days ago, not from an official report from authorities but because he observed some soldiers in the municipality's urban area. The municipality residents explained it is customary to see groups of Colombian soldiers escorting foreigners who come to town to make telephone calls or to shop. Brigadier General Luis Bernardo Urbina Sanchez, 7th Brigade commander, admitted knowing about the troops' presence in Puerto Lopez from early December. He added the U.S. soldiers will conclude their works in mid-February and will then leave the region.
