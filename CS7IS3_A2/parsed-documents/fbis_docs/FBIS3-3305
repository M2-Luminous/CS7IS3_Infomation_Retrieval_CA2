This is the first official announcement since Xi Yang was arrested and charged nearly six months ago where the authorities have disclosed that Xi Yang is being tried and that his case will be concluded soon. Zeng Decheng, a Hong Kong deputy to the NPC, said last night that yesterday afternoon, the NPC Secretariat arranged a meeting between Supreme Court Vice President Zhu Mingshan and NPC deputies from Hong Kong. Zeng Decheng quoted Zhu Mingshan as saying: Xi Yang is now on trial at the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court on the charge of stealing state secrets. Since Tian Ye, vice director of the General Office of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the People's Bank of China and high-level state secrets are involved in the case, the hearing is not open to the public, and Xi Yang is not allowed to see his family or a representative of his employer. Zhu Mingshan said: The Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate Branch lodged an indictment on 14 December 1993 against Xi Yang in the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court. On 22 December, the court held a closed-door trial of Xi Yang. On 27 January this year, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court returned the case to the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate Branch, requesting additional information. According to PRC "Criminal Proceedings," the procuratorate must supply the requested information within one month. On 22 February this year, the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate Branch supplied the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court with the additional information and the trial resumed. Zeng Decheng said that according to the provisions, the court hearing should only last one month, and, in any case, no more than one and a half months. Therefore, Xi Yang's case will be concluded at the end of this month or by early April at the latest. Zeng Decheng said: When Hong Kong NPC deputies inquired of Zhu Mingshan about proof of evidence in Xi Yang's case, Zhu Mingshan said the establishment of a case did not require harmful effects of a criminal act; the intention to do such harm would suffice. He termed it criminal intention. Zhu Mingshan further claimed that there is a written record which shows Xi Yang declined to hire a lawyer. He also said Xi Yang had met his family earlier. Zeng Decheng said that so far there was no evidence to show that Xi Yang had been denied his due rights, and Hong Kong NPC deputies handed Zhu Mingshan a letter from the Hong Kong Journalists Association requesting lenient treatment to Xi Yang. He emphasized that as a Hong Kong NPC deputy, he hoped the mainland authorities would try Xi Yang's case strictly in accordance with the due process of law, saying that the fairness of the trial depends on the final verdict. On the other hand, CPPCC delegate Xu Simin yesterday quoted a personal friend of his from the PRC Ministry of Justice as saying the week previously: Xi Yang went through his first trial hearing in the middle of last month and sentence is expected any time soon. Initial signs indicate that Xi Yang will receive a suspended jail term of one to two years, and he can return to Hong Kong shortly afterward with a bond provided by his family or his employer. Xu Ximing qouted concerned personnel as saying that during the trial Yang was found to have broken Chinese law. However, since he made the mistake while covering events and not in the context of any intelligence work, Xu would very likely receive a light sentence. Xu Ximing said that if Xi Yang received a heavy sentence, he would appeal to the Higher People's Court and request permission to be present at the appeal hearing. CPPCC delegate Luo Hsiang-kuo also said during the session that he had, in a personal capacity, announced to the conference this Tuesday that he hoped the Ministry of Justice would treat Xi Yang with leniency and would reveal details of the whole matter to the public. He said he would try to bring up the matter in a panel discussion. However, the conference did not allow him to discuss this matter at the panel meeting for the reason that this was an individual matter. A MING PAO spokesman said that he did not know about the latest developments in Xi Yang's trial. MING PAO would contact the departments concerned today to get updates on the situation. The spokesman reiterated his hope that the Chinese authorities would treat Xi Yang with leniency.
