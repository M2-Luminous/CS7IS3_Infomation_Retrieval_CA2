FR940506-2-00008 FR940506-2-00004 Interested Party Comments Certain comments cannot be discussed in this notice due to their business proprietary nature. The comments which have been excluded do not lend themselves to public summarization, and therefore have been discussed in the business proprietary version of the Final Concurrence Memorandum dated May 2, 1994 (Final Concurrence Memorandum), on file in room B-099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce. Comment 1: Petitioner argues that the Department of Commerce (the Department) should include in its calculation of U.S. price Akzo's shipments during the POI made pursuant to a long-term agreement negotiated prior to the POI. Petitioner contends that the particular terms and circumstances of Akzo's agreement with this customer do not create a binding commitment on the part of either the buyer or seller and therefore do not create an enforceable sales contract. Akzo argues that these shipments were pursuant to a long-term contract established prior to the POI and therefore are properly excluded from the U.S. database. Akzo further argues that certain terms and circumstances of the agreement should not prevent it from being considered a contract with a date of sale prior to the POI because the two parties acted upon and adhered to the contract. Finally, respondent points out that the Department confirmed at verification that all sales to this customer during the period of the contract were at the contract price. DOC Position: In order for this agreement to be considered a long-term contract established prior to the POI, the agreement must fix both the price and quantity. At verification we examined all invoices to the customer for sales pursuant to the agreement during its effective period. Although we found that all sales were made at the specified price, we also found that the quantity purchased was substantially less than the amount specified in the contract. Therefore, we conclude that the quantity was not fixed by the terms of the agreement because the quantities actually purchased over the period of the agreement were unrelated to those specified by the agreement. For this reason, we determine that the date of the agreement does not constitute the date of sale. Accordingly, we have used the date of shipment as the date of sale and have included all shipments to this customer during the POI in our calculation of U.S. price. Comment 2: Petitioner argues that the Department should include in its calculation of U.S. price Akzo's shipments during the POI pursuant to a supply agreement which was signed prior to the POI but modified during the POI. Petitioner asserts that the modification to the agreement, in effect, created a new agreement with a date of sale within the POI. Akzo argues that the contract modification did not alter the essential terms of the contract. Therefore, according to Akzo, all POI shipments pursuant to this agreement have a date of sale prior to the POI and thus are properly excluded from the U.S. sales database. DOC Position: We agree with Akzo. We verified that the essential terms of the contract, the price and quantity, were not altered as a result of the modification. Therefore, we consider Akzo's agreement with this customer to be a long-term contract with a date of sale prior to the POI. Consequently, the shipments in question were properly not reported. Comment 3: Petitioner argues that Akzo's shipments made pursuant to supply contracts with two customers during the POI should be reported as U.S. sales, if not already reported. Akzo contends that these sales have been reported. DOC Position: The sales in question were reported. Comment 4: Petitioner argues that the Department should find that imports of subject merchandise were massive over a relatively short period of time and that consequently, critical circumstances exist in this investigation under 735 (a)(3)(B) of the Act. In its analysis, petitioner compared shipments to the United States with a base period prior to the filing of the petition of May-July, 1993, with shipments to the United States in the post-petition comparison period of August-October, 1993. Using this comparison, petitioner found that imports had increased during the comparison period by more than 15 percent, the Department's benchmark. Akzo argued that imports were not massive, and that the petitioner's methodology was not consistent with the practice of the Department. DOC Position: We agree with Akzo. In this case, the petition was filed on July 2, 1993. It is the Department's standard policy, in cases where the petition is filed during the first half of the month, to include the month of filing in the post-petition comparison period, not the base period, as petitioner suggests (See, e.g., Certain Portable Electronic Typewriters from Singapore, 58 FR 43337 (1993)). Additionally, although 19 CFR 353.16(g) requires that we examine at least three months, it is the Department's practice to examine the longest period for which information is available up until the preliminary determination (See, e.g., Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate from the United Kingdom, 58 FR 37216 (1993)). When the five month period subsequent to and including the month that the petition was filed is compared to the previous five months, we find that imports were not at levels we consider massive. Comment 5: Petitioner argues that certain sales of scrap (which were excluded from our analysis in the preliminary determination because the quantity involved was insignificant) should be included in the calculation of U.S. price for the following reasons: (1) The fact that the quantities are small is irrelevant; (2) other sales of the merchandise in question are included in the cost of production calculations; and (3) according to product specifications in Akzo's invoices, the merchandise in question is clearly a form of PPD&hyph;T aramid fiber which is subject to investigation.
