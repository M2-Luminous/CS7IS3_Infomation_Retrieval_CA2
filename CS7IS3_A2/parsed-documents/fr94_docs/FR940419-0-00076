FR940419-0-00076 FR940419-0-00019 _In Alternate V (Headquarters Support), paragraph (c), we have added ``unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer.'' This change is made in response to public comments expressing concern that there may be circumstances where the nature of the work under such contracts would not pose a significant conflict for the EPA, and this clause should not categorically exempt contractors from performing work without examining requests on a case-by-case basis. We agree that the Contracting Officer shall make conflict of interest determinations on a case-by-case basis and this change reflects our intent. The objective of this and all of the LOFC clauses is to identify work which we believe may pose significant risk of conflict of interest and provide EPA the opportunity to avoid conflicts that would damage the integrity of the Superfund program. In Alternate V (Headquarters Support) paragraph (c), FIT and Remedial Engineering Management (REM) contracts are removed from the list of examples of contracts which include response action work. Although FIT and REM contracts included response action work, it is no longer appropriate to include them as examples since these contracts are being phased out of the Superfund program. Other public comments and EPA's response include: 1. Applicability of LOFC clauses to types of work. One commenter requested that the LOFC clauses should be unambiguously keyed to types of work since the nature of work in different contract types overlap. We disagree. The basic LOFC clause and each alternate are identified by the Superfund program contract type, i.e., ARCS, TCRR, TAT, ESAT, TES, Headquarters Support, and Site Specific. These are the standard terms used in the Superfund program to describe types of contracts by nature of Superfund work. To key the LOFC clauses to other types of work would be confusing, ambiguous and difficult to track both for contractors and the EPA. 2. Different time periods for LOFC clause and alternates. Several commenters expressed concern that there was no justification provided for the different time periods and suggested that EPA make the reporting time frames in the LOFC clauses consistent. Additionally, commenters stated the reporting requirements should either be applicable after completion of the work assignment or reporting should be limited to the duration of the contract. Still other commenters suggested the reporting period should be no longer than three years after work assignment completion. And other commenters stated the reporting requirement after contract completion was overly restrictive if it is to be applied to any new contracting activity but would be less objectionable if site references were restricted to only National Priorities List (NPL) sites. We agree reporting requirements for work performed at a site should be limited to a period of time after completion of the work assignment rather than after contract completion and have made the changes in the appropriate LOFC clauses. Each LOFC clause has been carefully studied and specifically tailored to fit each program with appropriate time periods based on the nature of work performed under the contract and the risk of conflict. Because each of the different programs requiring an LOFC clause has a different role in Superfund cleanup and enforcement, it is necessary for some programs to have different reporting requirements. The establishment of each time period was made after extensive discussion of program and enforcement issues. Every attempt was made, however, to be as consistent as possible without jeopardizing the Superfund program. We disagree that reporting requirements should be limited to the duration of the contract or for only three years. These time limits would not adequately protect the interests of the Superfund program. Because environmental enforcement cases are averaging seven years from start to completion, it would be very damaging to EPA's enforcement cases if an EPA contractor could at will perform related work for a PRP at or relating to the same site after it had performed work for EPA. For example, the TES reporting requirement of seven years is necessary to avoid the potential for compromising highly sensitive enforcement support information. To reduce this time frame would significantly jeopardize our ability to enforce CERCLA. Therefore, to prevent such occurrences, it is absolutely necessary for EPA to have procedures in place which require contractors to request approval before entering into future work with PRPs that could negatively impact the work performed for EPA. 3. Limit LOFC clause to NPL sites. Several commenters recommended that the LOFC clause and its alternates apply only to NPL sites. Some expressed concern whether ``sites'' includes Federal Facilities and requested clarification.
