In the meantime, the former SISDE treasurer, Ugo Timpano, who was arrested last week, obtained house arrest. It is said that he has made the first admissions on the movement of funds, termed top-secret, the origin and destination of which were not clear; 35 billion lire per year and none of it under any form of control. A new, sensational chapter has been opened in the scandal. Ten billion lire from SISDE are said to have been spent in order to support the electoral campaign of one of the governing parties. That sum is said to have come from the money used to buy the site of SISDE's new headquarters in Via Polli, which was sold to the security service for 25 billion lire by the architect, Adolfo Salabe.
