The IRGC denouncing Washington's domineering policies, said the operation planned with "savage" precision and carried on 25 April 1980, miserably floundered in the deserts around Tabas (over 600 kms southeast of Tehran) in Khorasan Province, burning beyond recognition the aggressors and their aircraft. It was a miracle for which Iran will always remain thankful to the almighty. The statement also condemned Washington's tacit support for Serb aggressors and their unabated "brutal" attacks on the defenceless Bosnian Muslims.
