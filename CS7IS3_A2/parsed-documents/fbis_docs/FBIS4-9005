FBIS4-9005 "dreeu076__a94023" FBIS-EEU-94-076-A Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria More Deputies Expected To Leave BSP More Deputies Expected To Leave BSP AU1704192494 Sofia BTA in English 1649 GMT 16 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1704192494 Sofia BTA English BFN [Text] Sofia, April 16 (BTA) -- Several more MP's of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) are expected to join the independent Civil Alliance for the Republic (GOR) next week, according to GOR leader Alexandur Tomov. Then it will be clear if their number is sufficient to form a new faction. Even if no BSP MP's join GOR, a programme will be worked out for joint action in parliament. This has been necessited by the last vote in parliament on allowing UN equipment to pass through Bulgaria, said Tomov. GOR believes parliament's approval of the UN transit is in the national interest and is consistent with what MP's said earlier. It is not a prelude to or a sign of a mitigation of the stand against any passage via Bulgaria of armed peacekeepers from Balkan states that may be involved in the Yugoconfllct. Tomov will maintain this position during his upcoming visit to Turkey. Tomov coordinated his opinion with Bulgaria's formal position, and this was probably on the agenda of his meeting today with President Zhelev.
