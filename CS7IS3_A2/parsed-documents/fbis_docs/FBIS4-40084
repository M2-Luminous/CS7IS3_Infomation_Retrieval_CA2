He inaugurated on Tuesday a round-table conference on "Topical Problems of Collective Security in Europe". "We all wish to make Europe more secure and stamp out military conflicts that flared up in the territory of the former USSR", he said. Participants in the "round-table conference", among them British MPs, noted that certain caution had become apparent in relations between Russia and NATO of late. Russia and the West have not agreed on any legal principles of the stay of Russian troops in CIS countries, Russian expert Aleksandr Nikitin pointed out. He believes a draft concept of collective security of the CIS countries should be discussed by a meeting of the State Duma. This concept should also be discussed with NATO representatives so they could rightly understand the concept. Member of the British parliament Bruce George said the Partnership for Peace programme is just an initial step in the establishment of closer relations between Russia and NATO. This is also an attempt to prevent rapid integration of East European countries in NATO to which Russia may react negatively. Russia's joining in the Partnership for Peace programme will lead to greater mutual knowledge and confidence. The integration process can then be embarked upon, Bruce George said.
