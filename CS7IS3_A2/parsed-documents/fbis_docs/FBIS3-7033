Citing concrete facts proving that Kim Yong-sam the traitor fully laid bare his true color as a pro-Japanese traitor in the relations with Japan, the article says: Last year, he often met Japanese reactionaries and made a clean sheet of the Japanese imperialists' history of aggression on Korea and crossed off the thrice-cursed crimes committed by them against the Korean people in the past including the drafting of "comfort women for the army" and flung the door open for their reinvasion, saying that the relations between South Korea and Japan must developed into "new ones". Worse still, he entreated the Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to suspend the DPRK-Japan talks for normalising diplomatic relations till the "nuclear and missile issues" of the North were completely settled and to take a joint action with South Korea and cried that "the axis of South Korean diplomacy is predominant relations with Japan and the United States." Kim Yong-sam is throwing himself deeper into the military and economic spheres of Japan in an attempt to keep his power with the backing of Japan. He further broadened economic opening to the Japanese reactionaries than his predecessors and is moving toward legalising the infiltration of the reactionary culture of Japan. It is only too natural that the traitor Kim Yong-sam who pays no heed to the dignity and interests of the nation and commits treacheries to gratify his greed for power has become a target of overthrow by the people. The traitor Kim Yong-sam will face a stern judgement by history for his treacherous crimes.
