FBRs use molten natrium to extract heat from the reactor core. At present, this natrium is circulated by a mechanical pump that uses a propeller, but since an electromagnetic pump would not generate vibrations, it is expected to reduce the probability of breakdowns. The electromagnetic pump will be an important element technology for the commercial FBR that will follow the demonstration reactor. Natrium is a metal, and in accordance with the Fleming rule, it will start to move when a magnetic field is created and electricity is passed. JAPCO and DOE will co-develop the electromagnetic pump based on this principle. Natrium is extremely reactive, and will cause serious accidents if it leaks out and comes into contact with moisture. Problems with natrium have been a weak point of FBRs in other countries as well. Breakdowns will be rare with the electromagnetic pump because there will be no mechanical drive system and vibrations will not occur. The prototype FBR ``Monju,'' in which the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC) plans to achieve criticality in 1994, as well as FBRs under research in other countries use mechanical pumps with propellers to circulate natrium. Development of an electromagnetic pump will encourage the development of commercial FBRs. FBRs operate the same as light water reactors (LWRs) used commercially in nuclear power plants that use heat created by nuclear fission to make steam, which turns turbines to generate electricity. They were called breeder reactors because they produce plutonium, which can be used as a nuclear fuel, at the same time as they produce heat. While the LWR uses water to extract heat from the core, however, the FBR uses 580ï¿½C molten natrium. If it used water, it would slow down neutron speed created by fission,and this would not be suitable for plutonium breeding. That is why the FBR uses natrium, which does not slow down neutrons.
