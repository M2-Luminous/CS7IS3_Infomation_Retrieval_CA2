The inauguration of this new project is highly significant from the integration and economic viewpoint. On this occasion the Chilean chief of state said: We may have differences because brothers and friends are not obliged to always share the same interests or think alike. But we know how to overcome our disagreements by searching for agreements or through procedures established by law for peaceful solutions that will be mutually beneficial. President Aylwin said that this is the path we have always taken. Argentine President Carlos Menem, in turn, thanked God for allowing him to participate in this event. He praised Aylwin and said that the Chilean people were marvelous. He also referred to the Argentine bible, the gaucho bible, saying: As I was telling Patricio, in Argentina we have another bible, the gaucho bible entitled Martin Fierro by author Jose Hernandez that in one of its paragraphs, probably paraphrasing God, says: one of the first rules is that brothers should remain united because if they fight among themselves they will be devoured by others. President Menem also voiced his hope that this climate of understanding and unity shared by Chile and Argentina will continue during the next Chilean administration, which will be Peaded by Eduardo Frei. He noted that history has been very generous with the two countries that this is the challenge they face in the future.
