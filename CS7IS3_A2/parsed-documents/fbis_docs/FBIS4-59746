He stressed that the Syrian-Israeli negotiations are the most complicated because they represent the center of power in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Speaking at a Koranic interpretation lesson yesterday, Fadlallah said the Israelis demand economic, security, and political normalization first. Later they can discuss withdrawal and the possibility of delaying it for 10 years. During this time, he added, they will wait for any changes that might prompt them to back down on that to which they had committed themselves. Fadlallah expects the negotiations between Syria and Israel to last long, because the enemy does not want to reach any positive results with any Arab party before weakening it first. Israel, along with the United States, wants an Arab or Islamic nation without a will to make it easier for them to control the region's economy, politics, and security, he noted. Concerning the self-rule agreement, Fadlallah stressed that Israel will do its best to make it fail, to stir differences and conflicts, and to complicate things for the self-rule authorities. He said the Palestinians must be cautious about handling their differences so as not to give Israel the chance to thwart and undermine self-rule. On the U.S. State Department's charges of terrorism leveled against Iran and Syria, Fadlallah said the U.S. Administration and some Western states accuse countries with policies not in line with or opposed to their own of being terrorist states. This accusation applies to any movement that works for liberation. Thus we have no respect for the U.S. assessment of terrorist movements or countries that support terrorism. He added: The United States backs regimes that use terrorism against their own people. If we look closer at the U.S. world policy we will conclude that the United States is a first-class terrorist state. Turning to the war in Yemen, Fadlallah said it is a U.S. trap, because Washington's policy is to try to contain any oil country. In Yemen's case, this can be achieved only by fragmenting it politically, economically, and socially, he added.
