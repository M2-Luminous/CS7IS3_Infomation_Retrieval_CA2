Experts estimate that at present there are about 5 million descendants of Cossacks in the Russian Federation, who as a rule reside both in areas of traditional settlement of their ancestors (Don, the Kuban, Terek, the Urals, and the Transbaykal area) and in large cities (Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, Omsk, Samara, and Voronezh). Many of them have formed the social foundation for the organizational establishment of the Cossack estate in Russia in the late 1980's and early 1990's. The modern-day Cossack movement emerged in stages. The creation of cultural-educational and military-historical Cossack societies in 1988-1989 can be considered the point of departure. At the first stage these structures resembled organizationally amorphous discussion clubs with a patriotic orientation. However, it was precisely within these societies that the process of perceiving and ideologically expressing the need for the rebirth of the Cossack estate developed. This phenomenon did not escape the attention of local party committees. Moreover, some of them, perceiving the Cossacks as a major sociopolitical force capable of becoming the backbone of the authoritarian regime, tried to lay their hands on the movement. In the future, this fact engendered a contradictory response to the rebirth of the Cossack estate among the population and major differences within the movement itself. The second stage of the assertion of the Cossack movement embraced the period from the beginning of 1990 through August 1991. During the first half of 1990 extensive preparations were made for holding the Cossack Grand Assembly, which was held on 28-30 July 1990 in Moscow and drew 200 delegates and 457 guests. The assembly founded the Union of Cossacks, elected Ataman A.G. Martynov and members of the board, and adopted a statute and an appeal to the Cossacks in the country and abroad. According to the statute, the Union of Cossacks was proclaimed to be a voluntary public association of the representatives of Cossack areas, districts, and communities on the basis of common socioeconomic, spiritual-cultural, and other interests. The historic and spiritual renaissance of the Cossack estate as an original ethnic formation was declared to be the main objective. Certain contradictions shone through in the principles of operations. On one hand, free economic development was proclaimed, while on the other hand, private ownership of land was rejected. The mandatory nature of Orthodoxy appeared next to religious tolerance, and assembly-run democracy--next to the restoration of the prerevolutionary status. The formation of the Union of Cossacks inaugurated the organizational establishment of the Cossack movement. Within a few months, unions and societies were formed locally, primarily at the middle level (okrug, kray, oblast). Expansion of the chain of primary Cossack structures in cities, rayons, Cossack settlements, and hamlets is still underway. The creation of Cossack formations on the principle of compatriot communities has become characteristic in territories that have never been populated by Cossacks and to which they had not been deported on a mass scale during Soviet times. In particular, such organizations were founded in St. Petersburg, Tula, Voronezh, and a number of other cities of the Russian Federation. In Riga, the Baltic Cossack Community was formed, which united Cossacks from different hosts who by the will of fate ended up in the Baltic area. A trend toward interregional unification emerged: This was how the Union of Cossacks of the Volga Area and the Urals (organizations and communities of 15 oblasts and republics of the Russian Federation) appeared. The disintegration of the USSR and the strengthening of centrifugal tendencies in Russia, the aggravation of interethnic and state-to-state relations on Russia's borders, the overall growth of instability and social tension, the growth of the anti-Russian sentiment in nearby foreign countries, the ever increasing flow of refugees and forced resettlers streaming to the territory of Russia from the CIS countries, the need to fill the spiritual vacuum that formed after the rejection of communist ideology, and the striving of the people to plug into some kind of stable community in order to counteract the mounting atomization of society may be considered the main factors stimulating the growth of Cossack entities. The third stage in the development of the Cossack movement (from the end of 1991 to present) has been marked, on one hand, by the creation of a state-legal foundation for the renaissance of the Cossack estate and, on the other hand, the increasing politization of Cossack organizations and an organizational split within the movement on ideological and political grounds. The Union of Cossack Hosts of Russia was created as the successor of the "White" movement to counterbalance the "postcommunist" Union of Cossacks. The main differences between the two unions in question may be reduced to the following: first, their orientation toward differing political forces and, as a consequence, differing attitudes toward the policy of the Russian authorities: from moderately hostile on the part of the Union of Cossacks (SK) to enthusiastic on the part of the Union of Cossack Hosts of Russia (SKVR); second, differences in interpreting the role of Cossacks in interethnic conflicts: from direct involvement in them of SK representatives to the orientation toward the need for negotiations on the part of the SKVR; third, differing attitudes toward private ownership of land: from its negation by the SK to its recognition by the SKVR. The complex processes of division among the Cossacks locally can be traced using the Kuban as an example. In addition to the largest organization which was the first to appear, the Kuban Cossack Rada (ataman V.P. Gromov), the Cossack Host of the Kuban (ataman Ye.A. Nagay), the "Russia" Cossack Association of the Kuban (ataman V.I. Kayuda), and a number of other, smaller organizations have taken shape organizationally and made their presence known in the Kuban. Despite the efforts of the leaders to consolidate the Cossack movement, which have brought about the creation of the Cossack Host of all the Kuban, the main confrontation between the Rada and the Cossack Host of the Kuban has not been eliminated. The ataman of the latter has ignored the unification congress. The differing sociopolitical orientation of the organizations, which may be conventionally called "statist" and "market-oriented," as well as to a certain degree the personal ambitions of their leaders are at the root of such divisions. In the political struggle of 1991-1993, the Cossack Host of the Kuban (KKV) invariably supported President B.N. Yeltsin, the ideas of a Russia united and indivisible, and private property. KKV leaders affirm their anticommunism and consider themselves the sole successors of the prerevolutionary Cossacks of the Kuban. The KKV Statute which was adopted by the Grand Assembly on 13 April 1992 proclaims the unification of "all progressive Cossack forces" that are interested in bringing back the traditional way of life. Orthodoxy is acknowledged to be the spiritual foundation of the movement. Taking issue with the Rada and its legal successor, the Cossack Host of all the Kuban, the KKV Statute codifies collective leadership and democratic principles in the structure of the host and emphatically advertises the restoration of prerevolutionary symbols and forms of governance. The existing split in the Cossack movement testifies to its objective sociopolitical and economic nature. The division will continue, and will possibly exacerbate in the immediate future. It is much more serious, and its roots are far deeper than personal enmity between and ambitions of the atamans. No matter how desirable it is, the task of the Cossack renaissance will continue to be interpreted differently in a society with a sharp social stratification and periodic civil wars. As we see it, at present efforts should be directed toward mitigating the forms of struggle between "Reds" and "Whites" and the prospects for unifying positive actions rather than toward searching for an illusory unity of "Reds" and "Whites." A genuine rather than superficial perception of Orthodoxy may become the most important factor in rallying the Cossacks. The "Declaration of the Cossack Estate" stressed: "The renaissance of the Cossack estate is inconceivable and impossible without Church affiliation and away from the bosom of the Church." Belonging to the Orthodox religion is becoming one of the requirements for anybody joining the movement. At the same time, sociologists who have surveyed the world-view principles and political orientation of the population of the Kuban have concluded that the levels of religious commitment of the Cossack and non-Cossack populations differ little. Order, social protection, combating crime, and the integrity of Russia are the main priorities and ideological planks of the Cossack estate that ensure its consolidation. The involvement of Cossack organizations in regional conflicts on the territory of the CIS has become a certain factor of consolidation, although based on "negative unity." The Cossacks perceive themselves as a force capable of defending the interests of the Russian-speaking (Slavic) population. This perception makes it possible to push internal contradictions into the background. First of all, at issue are conflicts associated with the lack of correspondence between administrative-territorial and ethnic boundaries in the areas historically populated by the Cossacks. Thus, the Area of the Don Host at present includes parts of Lugansk and Donetsk Oblasts of Ukraine and the lands of Volgograd and Voronezh Oblasts of the Russian Federation. Rayons in the Stavropol area, Karachay-Cherkessia, and Cossack settlements at the Georgian border belonged to the Area of the Cossack Host of the Kuban. Two tactics and strategies for settling these conflicts have come to the fore within the movement. The supporters of resolute and uncompromising measures favor restoration of the status quo of 1913. Thus, five republics have now been proclaimed on the territory of the former Karachay-Cherkessia Autonomous Oblast within Stavropol Kray, of which three are Cossack republics--the Batalpasha, Zelenchuk-Urup, and Abaza Republics. Such surges of sovereignization hamper the search for compromise solutions substantially. The supporters of a moderate course come out for taking into account the reality that has come to exist in the past decades. They strive to grasp the experience of recent years, which has indicated that not only the redistribution of territory in and of itself but even a "claim" to such is capable of causing unpredictable consequences for all parties. Cossacks are also being drawn into conflicts on the territories of other countries. Military formations of Cossacks from various regions of the Russian Federation have participated in combat actions in the Dniester area, Abkhazia, and on the side of the Serbs in Bosnia (according to some data, in 1993 up to 300 Cossacks from Russia were there). It is hard to predict all the direct, indirect, and remote consequences of the participation of Cossack formations in armed conflicts. However, we can talk about one thing with a measure of confidence--these are the consequences of the accumulation of weapons in the regions of traditional Cossack settlement. The existence of these weapons and easy access to them draw criminal elements into the movement. Their arbitrary and unlawful actions not only discredit Cossack organizations in the eyes of the local population but frequently bring about serious public clashes. An analysis of the contemporary Cossack movement presupposes the meticulous consideration of its real and potential social base. Before 1917 the numerical strength of the Cossacks was determined quite accurately on the criterion of estate affiliation and the requisite legal aspects. However, such an estimate is impossible at present. For the last time, affiliation with the Cossack estate was noted by the All-Union Census of the Population in 1926. A survey taken in August 1992 by the Monitoring Russian Sociological Service made it possible to come up with an approximate estimate of the number of the Cossacks in Krasnodar Kray by the method of self-identification and outside identification. It comes to approximately 18-27 percent of the kray population (that is, between 900,000 and 1.3 million people). This data may be accepted as a working hypothesis. The educational level and occupations of the Cossacks do not differ from the remainder of the population of the Kuban. At the same time, as we see it, a certain contradiction exists between the hypothetical number of the people who identify themselves with the Cossack estate and the real base of Cossack organizations which have so far been unable to activate this potential. The degree to which the activities of Cossack organizations adequately reflect the interests of the reborn community is not clear. In particular, the programmatic documents of these organizations include the demand to withdraw land traditionally settled by Cossacks from the process of privatization. At the same time, 72 percent of Cossacks polled in the Kuban came out in favor of the right of Russia's citizens to privately own land. For comparison, 59 percent of non-Cossacks came out in favor of this. A majority of the population is now quite loyally disposed toward the Cossack movement. At the same time, the already mentioned poll in Krasnodar Kray registered considerable differences in the evaluation of the Cossacks from "within" and from "without" this community. The fact that 40 percent of the non-Cossacks take a negative view of the rebirth of the Cossack estate indicates a source of possible social tension. Non-Cossacks frequently view the renaissance of the Cossack estate as a random phenomenon (and in some of its manifestations--a vaudeville) based on superficial, temporary, extraneous factors, and the Cossack estate of our times as an "illusory" community. In view of this, it is important that regulatory acts of the Russian state devoted to the Cossacks stress the impermissibility of infringements of the rights of any other group of the population, the reinstatement of estate privileges, and the forcible foisting of the Cossack lifestyle on citizens. Despite the nonpolitical nature of the movement being proclaimed at the first stage of the movement under study, it developed from the outset as a sociopolitical organization. The Union of Cossacks set forth its programmatic demands in the "Declaration of the Cossacks of Russia." Most of its points have now been carried out (with the exception of the points on exempting the Cossacks from state taxes, including those on land, until 1995 and on taking state measures to bring administrative-territorial borders into conformity with ethnic borders in areas traditionally settled by Cossacks). In particular, all acts passed concerning the Cossacks beginning 1918 have been canceled as illegal with regard to taking repressive measures. The rights of the Cossacks to restore the traditional social and economic lifestyle and cultural traditions and to establish territorial public self-government, traditional forms of land use, the restoration of the traditional names of inhabited localities and areas, and the creation of public associations of Cossacks with historically established names have been acknowledged. Obviously, the legislative acts were intended not only to do historic justice but also to expand the base of support for executive and legislative structures in the environment of a crisis of power. The Unification Congress of the Cossack Host of all the Kuban (October 1992) reflected the sociopolitical evolution of the movement: The main principles of the statute were approved, amounting to the "assumption by the Cossack organization, which had previously been merely sociopatriotic, of the responsibilities of a state structure and the impermissibility of membership in any political party for Cossacks" (see KUBANSKIYE NOVOSTI, 28 October 1992). This aspiration was expressed in the "Declaration of Cossacks" dated 30 January 1993, which said that at the present stage the Union of Cossacks plays the role of an organizational center which should be transformed into a state structure assuming the functions of governing the Cossack estate. The ataman of the Union of Cossacks, the atamans of troops, regional unions, districts, divisions, communities, and Cossack settlements were viewed as official representatives of the Cossack estate in the local organs of state power. The possible forms of state service by Cossacks reflecting their traditions were specified. The above facts indicate that attempts to restrict the Cossack movement to a cultural-historic, "folklore" framework are unsuccessful. Only a conflict with the power structure may result from such attempts. Under present-day conditions, the Cossacks are becoming one of the most active and--this is particularly significant--most politically organized groups of the population.
