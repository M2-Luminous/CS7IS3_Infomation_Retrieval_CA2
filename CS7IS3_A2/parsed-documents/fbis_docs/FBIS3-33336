"The soldiers gave us a 15-day deadline to fall back; or otherwise suffer the consequences," said Carlos Ovando, mayor of the Guatemalan hamlet of Los Dolores in northern Peten Department. The official told the Guatemalan Congress that Belizean soldiers threatened to kill the peasants in the area if they remain in the border region. Ovando asked for the Guatemalan Government's intervention to exercise greater control along the border in light of what he labeled a Belizean invasion. Last year in October, the Guatemalan Defense Ministry confirmed that Belizean soldiers had raided Guatemalan territory on several occasions; however, the Belizean Government ruled out an "erosion" of diplomatic relations. On 16 February, residents of the De Melchor de Mencos municipality in Peten, approximately 10 km north of here, charged that soldiers from the neighboring nation had entered Guatemalan territory, destroying maiz and rice fields. Guatemala maintains -- since the time Belize was a British colony -- a demand on this territory that gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1971.
