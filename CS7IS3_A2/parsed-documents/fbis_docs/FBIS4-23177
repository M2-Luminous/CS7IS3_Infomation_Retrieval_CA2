Northern Cape Premier Manne Dipico said during the second sitting of the provincial legislature that there was consensus Kimberley should be the legislative seat of the province. It was also recommended the province should have four official languages: English, Afrikaans, Tswana and Xhosa. Mr Dipico said in his opening address he was satisfied with the boundaries of the region but would appreciate it if parts like Namaqualand and Kuruman remained part of the Northern Cape. According to legislature these parts can decide by referendum if they want to form part of the Northern Cape or not. However, the premier appealed to people living in these regions not to consider a referendum but to remain part of the Northern Cape. He said it was important that the mining industry should find ways of retaining the wealth generated within the province through job creation mechanisms by the development of allied secondary industries and local business. Mr Dipico said the Northern Cape Government had already started encouraging potential foreign investors to the province. The government was also determined to consider the provision of suitable housing for all its citizens a top priority. He said a provincial policy on agriculture should be developed to encourage sustainable agriculture as the area displayed considerably low levels of agricultural potential. This was largely due to the shortage of surface water, and a drought management programme was essential. Another matter which also needed urgent attention was the question of the landless. Vast tracts of productive land were held by the Defence Force. This land was needed and everything would be done to gain access to it to unlock the full agricultural potential of the province, Mr Dipico said.
