The Japan Federation of Construction Contractors Inc. issued the comments in a written form after the cabinet Tuesday morning approved the action program to make bidding for public works more open. In the statement, the federation said, "It is necessary for the Japanese industry as a whole to tackle seriously the problem of averting unfair practices." It noted that the program includes stronger penalties for those involved in illicit deals. Japan's construction industry has been shaken by a series of major bribery and bid-rigging scandals in the past year.
