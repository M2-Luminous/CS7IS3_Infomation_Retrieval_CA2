The return here today of the vessel "Haihua" from a six-day round trip to Nagasaki completed the first direct sea link between the two cities since 1942. Nagasaki, only 462 miles away, is the nearest Japanese sea port for Shanghai. There used to be a shipping line between the two cities. It was suspended in 1942. In order to promote exchanges between the two port cities, Nagasaki County government proposed in 1988 to resume the shipping line. Through efforts by both of governmental and non-governmental organizations of the two cities, the shipping line was finally opened. Yang Zhengding, general manager of the Shanghai-Nagasaki INternational Ferry Co. Ltd., said that the reopening of the route reflects the common will of the people in the two cities and the needs of economic development of the two cities.
