The restructuring of the British Army of the Rhine under Options for Change -- Britain's largest movement of troops and equipment in modern times -- had descended into "chaos and pandemonium," an audit office spokeswoman said. In some units there had been a virtual breakdown of control, with large numbers of dangerous and expensive items of equipment unaccounted for. Only four out of the 116 units shut down in Germany could account for all their equipment, and in just one small survey the audit office found that several vehicles were missing, one for nearly three years, as well as 60lb of plastic explosive and 110 detonators. The audit office warned that the taxpayer would lose much of the expected "peace dividend" through write-offs for missing items and other organisational problems. The Ministry of Defence now expects to save only 35 million pounds a year in the early stages of the withdrawal 24 million pounds less than originally expected. The National Audit Office described the losses as "very worrying indeed'' and pointed to the "very slow progress" made by the MoD in improving controls. Army commanders at all levels have now been reminded of the need for correct accounting procedures and for prompt action to resolve any discrepancies. Inquiries are to be extended to ammunition stores. The audit office acknowleged the enormity of the task facing the Army, which is having to move 13 billion items from 38 locations in Germany to 48 sites in the United Kingdom. By 1995, there will be 27,000 fewer Service personnel in Germany, 2,900 fewer armoured vehicles and 18,000 fewer non-armoured vehicles. Much of the withdrawal has been conducted during a time of "unparalleled upheaval" with military operations both in the Gulf and the former Yugoslavia. Last year more than 5 million pounds was raised from sales of surplus equipment. But the audit office wants more vehicle sales to be made in Germany, where prices are higher, and for saleable vehicles to be cannibalised for parts only when this is essential and cost-effective.
