Brewer said the Council of Ministers decided to reform Article 2 of the VAT and that merchants must request the necessary authorization from the Finance Ministry prior to 28 February. He added that consumers cannot be charged the VAT until merchants obtain the authorization and duly display it in their stores and outlets. [Begin Brewer recording] This means that retail merchants cannot charge consumers the VAT until they obtain the proper authorization. Of course, any VAT collected up to this point must be turned over to the National Treasury. The Tax Office will fine merchants according to the current tax law if they violate this law in any way.
