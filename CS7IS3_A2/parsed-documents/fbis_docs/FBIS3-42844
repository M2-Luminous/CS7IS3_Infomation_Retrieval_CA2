At this pivotal stage of Moldovan history a return to the old ways and the forms of the organization of society and management of the economy which have exhausted their possibilities cannot yet be completely ruled out. Reactionary-conservative forces, gambling on the masses' fatigue from the inordinate politicization of life of recent years and nostalgia for the "replete" Brezhnev years and presenting as democracy the arbitrary action in economic activity and the lack of respect for the order established in society not without the participation of representatives of these circles, are nurturing the hope of exacting vengeance. In the absence of resistance on the part of real democratic and progressive forces, which remain fragmented and frequently in thrall to their corporate interests and ambitions, the parties and movements of a manifest or concealed pro-communist persuasion are endeavoring to make all of us hostages of the times of stagnation, unfinished undertakings, and their own ignorance. However paradoxical, the conservatives are being rendered the utmost assistance by social and political organizations and parties which appeared in the political arena following the split of the People's Front. Having monopolized the right to call themselves "democratic" and having pinned on themselves all possible designations, they are essentially far removed from a constructive approach to the accomplishment of the economic, social, and political tasks confronting the people of Moldova and are, as before, committing the sin of populism and posturing, idealizing individual aspects of our historical past, and remaining captive to their vision and understanding of the events of recent years to the detriment of a responsible approach to a surmounting of the crisis in which the country has found itself. The social and political reality of Moldova is manifesting increasingly distinctly the main trends in the activity of the following political formations: 1) right-liberal geared to the continued reform of society and the creation of a full-fledged multiparty political system and a market economy; 2) left-conservative endeavoring overtly or covertly, while employing market rhetoric, to take the republic back to the administrative-directive system and to the old forms of government customary for the nomenklatura; 3) forces opposed to the independence and statehood of the Republic of Moldova, both pro-unionist and pro-Soviet, for which ideological orientation is secondary and is replaced by posturing and outright populism. Under these conditions the Liberal Convention of Moldova, advocating further constructive and specific steps en route to the implementation of liberal reforms, announces its emphatic support for the progressive forces and its readiness to influence the course of the election campaign in accordance with current legislation with its own program principles also. The recent decision of the Central Election Commission, which limits the Liberal Convention's possibilities of participating in practice in the consolidation of the democratic forces, leaves the LKM [Liberal Convention of Moldova] no choice but the utmost and active support for the independent candidates who share the program principles and endeavor of the Convention to contribute by actual deeds to the continuation and intensification of the progressive transformations and reforms in Moldova and to an imperative nature being imparted to this process. While not questioning the right of the presidium of parliament and the election commission to limit in this way or the other the right of political organizations to participate fully in the formation of the representative authorities, the Liberal Convention nonetheless attributes these decisions to the imperfection and immaturity of society's democratic institutions. All independent candidates registered by the Central Election Commission, sharing the program principles of the LKM, and prepared to contribute with real action to their implementation, may call 24-07-04 or 22-61-43 to obtain additional information. [Signed] Liberal Convention of Moldova Republic Council
