Zoran Vaskovic reports from the Assembly: [Vaskovic] Eleven deputies took part in the discussion this morning. Their speeches, and the speeches by another 50 deputies still to speak, indicate that the debate will be long and polemic. With one exception, all the speakers were deputies from the opposition parties. They expressed the objection that the proposed program is too general and that it does not stand a chance of being implemented. They also demanded further cuts in the budget. The deputies from the opposition parties stressed that the cabinet of Mirko Marjanovic is not a government of national unity, as he had tried to achieve. The only member of the ruling party who spoke today was Zoran Andjelkovic. The essence of his speech was that the opposition has not achieved any results in the communes where they won. Let us repeat: We are facing a long debate, after which the deputies will vote on the new government. In order to be elected, the government needs at least 126 votes. Aleksandra Jankovic is currently addressing the Assembly and some 50 more deputies are still to speak. That is all from the Serbian Assembly.
