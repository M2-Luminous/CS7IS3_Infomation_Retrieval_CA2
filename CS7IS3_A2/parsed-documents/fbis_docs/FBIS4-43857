The court rejection took place by a narrow margin of one vote (six votes rejected the request and five accepted it). The law in question gives broad powers to the government to issue decrees in the force of law to privatize state enterprises. Junior coalition partner Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP) Deputy Mumtaz Soysal and his 90 colleagues from various political parties had applied a while ago to the Constitutional Court to abolish the law, asking for the `stoppage of the implementation of the law.' Privatization is one of the main objectives of the coalition government led by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and was included in the government's economic package on April 5.
