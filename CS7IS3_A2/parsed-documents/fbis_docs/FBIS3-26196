[Begin Francis Lo recording] I think that, with the international business community now focusing more and more on Asia, I think the normalization of trade relationship between United States and Vietnam will give this focus even further emphasis, and I think that would certainly be very good for Asia as a whole and very good for Hong Kong in particular, because Hong Kong is the operational base for a lot of international companies. It is the ideal marketing headquarters for these companies, and it is also a sourcing [as heard] center for any company wishing to buy products from this part of the world. I think it will actually reinforce Hong Kong's position as Asia's trade capital. [end recording] [passage omitted] The refugee coordinator, Brian Bresnahan, said the move by President Clinton would help Hong Kong solve the problem of Vietnamese boat people more quickly. [Begin recording] [Bresnahan] I think that the lifting of the American trade embargo on Vietnam is good news for this particular problem. It will dash hopes amongst those screened out in our camps--and that is most of the population--that they might end up one day in America, they will then see more clearly that their only future is in Vietnam, and it will encourage them to go home. Certainly it is good news; it certainly enhances our chances of meeting a late 95-early 96 target of emptying our camps in Hong Kong. [Unidentified reporter] Do you also think that it will have the effect of encouraging people who are now in Vietnam and might be considering coming to Hong Kong to stay there? [Bresnahan] Absolutely, because of course, I mean, we have already said that the root of the boat people problem has always been in Vietnam and of course, many of the people who came here came because Vietnam was so poor. The lifting of the embargo will enhance economic activity in Vietnam and thus encourage people to stay where they are. [end recording]
