In the course of these talks, various aspects of international life were discussed, as well as issues concerning Belarusian participation in the activities of this authoritative international organization. Given that the talks were held behind closed doors, I asked the officials for a short interview. Could you brief us on the essence of your conversation? [Begin recording] [Butrus-Ghali, in English fading into Belarusian translation] We have had a very constructive and positive meeting with the Belarusian minister of foreign affairs. We discussed the activities of the United Nations, the disaster at Chernobyl, and the possible participation of Belarusian peacekeeping forces in various operations around the world. We will have a second round of discussions, during which we will continue with the agenda of different items agreed for the exchange of information. [Krawchanka] I have presented [Butrus-Ghali] with two concrete drafts -- not mere declarations, not just general words, but two documents. The first project, worth approximately $12 million, provides for radiological and ecological monitoring on Belarusian territory. We hope that the UN Headquarters will find funds for this endeavor. The other project, which is worth $8 million, is aimed at building a factory to produce ecological baby food for Chernobyl children. We take quite an active part in many international activities, and the arrival of Secretary General Butrus-Ghali is proof that the international community recognizes the complex problems facing our motherland. [end recording] Later today, the UN general secretary held a meeting at the CIS Executive Secretariat. CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Karatchenya expressed gratitude to Butrus-Ghali for finding time to visit the CIS Headquarters in Minsk. He thanked the guest for the resolution passed by a UN session and the UN Secretariat on granting the CIS observer status in the United Nations. This will undoubtedly increase the prestige of the CIS as a regional international organization. The executive secretary also briefed Butrus Butrus-Ghali on the structure of the coordinating bodies of the CIS, as well as their tasks and goals. These include the reduction of conflicts on CIS territory and multifarious activities in the sphere of economic integration. Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, in his turn, pointed out that granting the CIS observer status in the United Nations is just the first step toward recognizing the CIS as an entity of international law. The United Nations is closely observing the activities of the CIS, and is interested in increasing the latter's peacekeeping and humanitarian role. According to Mr. Butrus-Ghali, the UN Secretariat is ready to closely cooperate with the executive bodies of the CIS in various spheres. At the end of the first day of his visit, Butrus Butrus-Ghali visited the UN mission in Belarus. Incidentally, this is the first UN mission opened in a CIS state.
