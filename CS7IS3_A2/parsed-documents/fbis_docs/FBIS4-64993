[Dell'Acquila] Even before the list of ministers was officially released, Roberto Maroni from the Northern League agreed to comment on his appointment as interior minister. He said that it was not a victory for the Northern League, but one for the entire ruling coalition. He added that the Northern League had asked for those ministries which were essential to carry out its plan for reform. Gianfranco Fini, leader of the National Alliance, said that the Berlusconi government signals the end of the First Republic and the beginning of an ideological swing to the right. He added that the government's priority objectives are the relaunch of the economy and social solidarity. The comments of Achille Occhetto, secretary of the Party of the Democratic Left, were scathing. He said that the contents of the letter which President Scalfaro sent to Silvio Berlusconi revealed that the country's democracy has reached an alarming state and its safeguarding -- as underlined by Scalfaro -- should not be consigned to the vacuous reassurances of Berlusconi, but to permanent vigilance. That's all for now.
