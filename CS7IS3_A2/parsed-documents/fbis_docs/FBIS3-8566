NATO needs to create the "backbone" [7 March] of a security system in Europe, where the changes taking place in the post- communist countries are creating a range of problems and conflicts whose consequences affect the whole continent, Baudys said in a lecture entitled "Security in Europe" at a conference organized by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. Europe requires clearly defined security structures - and defined procedures for discussion, information exchange and authority - should these conflicts escalate, he said. He said the Czech Army's cooperation this year with units from the French, German and Dutch armies should be taken only symbolically, because "we need to begin from the very bottom." Joint military exercises are already being planned for next year in the framework of the Partnership for Peace programme, he said, adding that materials clarifying the legislative status of the exercises are currently being drawn up. The Czechs have had bad experiences with international leagues and unions, he recalled. Czechoslovakia's first treaties and the Little Entente ended with the Munich Agreement in 1938, and following the Second World War membership of the Warsaw Pact was "forced on us." Baudys said he was certain the Czechs' association with NATO would be a different kind of experience.
