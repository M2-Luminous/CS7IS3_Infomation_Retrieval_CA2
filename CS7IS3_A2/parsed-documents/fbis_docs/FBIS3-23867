It is, of course, being mentioned, but more out of politeness, while all attention is on the main event--the freeing of the October "mutineers." The reaction to this event is panic, of the kind seen in the American action movie "The Russians Are Coming." Before the Lefortovo prisoners even got home our watchful television began to warn the population of the threat of civil war every couple of hours on all the channels. In reality the threat is different. Imagine for a moment that the person who walked out of Lefortovo gate Saturday night is... a future president of Russia. This immediately explains the panic on television (the cat knows whose meat he has stolen), Kostikov's hysterical statements, and some bureaucrats' feverish attempts to "put things in reverse gear"--through an immediate ban on political activities. Note: The amnesty also covered GKChP [State Committee on the State of Emergency] members, but somehow nobody remembers that. Which means that it is not because "principle prevailed" (in this instance the principle of inevitable punishment)--it is about concrete individuals. The elderly "putschists" of 1991, their health already undermined, no longer represent a real danger. The young, full of vitality and energy, "mutineers" of 1993 are a completely different matter, and one of them is especially dangerous. Had they all been released, while this one remained behind bars, there probably would be less clamor and fear in presidential and television circles. The "magnificent seven" who have been released represent a threat, of course, but not to society, to ordinary people--they are a threat to the authorities, to their--nor our--safety. They will not rush, as soon as they have a quick cup of tea with the family, to rouse people to storm the Kremlin; when the time comes they will run in elections. And these elections for some are worse than an assault--an assault can be repelled; after the elections, whether one likes it or not, it will be time to say goodbye to Kremlin accommodations. By the time this amnesty happened--so unexpectedly for everyone--a certain equilibrium had established itself in Russian political circles, a sort of "calm before the storm." The president is well and alive (suffering, perhaps, from a mild cold), and all the current political forces, without paying particular attention to him, began to quietly, surreptitiously prepare for the next presidential elections. Everybody suddenly remembered about party organizational development and urgently got busy creating new parties and strengthening existing ones. Everybody suddenly became concerned about their own image, and the press is doing its best to help them. ARGUMENTY I FAKTY, for instance, reminds us through the mouth of a Moscow University psychologist: "You need to find the right smile, gestures, stance, facial expressions...." The political leadership in Russia currently is experiencing a crisis stemming from the fact that the old leaders have practically outlived their utility while the new ones--their replacements--have not yet shown themselves to the full extent. By inertia Yeltsin is still recognized as an all-Russia leader, but his political useful life is largely exhausted. He has already destroyed everything he could, and there is no "work" of this sort left for him to do in the country. At this point there is no new national leader in Russia. He may not appear in an environment where the nation is split, stratified; a man whom some love and others hate, and vice versa. We can only talk of recognition of some or other leader by a relative majority of society. Such leaders come forward, however, not on a wave from the grassroots, from the people, but from the top--from parties, state and social structures; the base of such advancements are often the unrestrained personal ambitions of some or other individual, who uses a favorable historic moment for self-assertion. Troubled times in Russia have always produced a large number of pretenders, and our time is no exception. So far the disposition of forces on the political scene is rather simple. On one side of the spectrum are parties and movements set up by former members of the president's inner circle; on the other--by his political opponents; he himself is in the middle, practically alone. None of his former confederates is there with him--neither the early Burbulis, nor the late Gaydar, nor the eternal Poltoranin; even his pet Shumeyko now keeps his distance. Some new people, whose names evoke no recognition, currently "advise" and "help" the president, interpret his statements, or sometimes speak for him. All those who were earlier in the orbit of the powerful figure of B.N. Yeltsin have now gained political independence as parliament members, leaders of parties and blocs, and heads of centers and foundations, and do not want to leave the political scene with him, and are therefore increasingly distancing themselves from him. Closer to the elections they will make him, pardon me, a "scapegoat" and sacrifice him many times over in the election battle for the president's job. All the leaders of the democratic wing are strong insofar they have access to administrative levers and can actively use them to achieve personal political goals--as, for instance, Gaydar did in organizing the Russia's Choice bloc or Shakhray in setting up his PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord]. Had they not been deputy prime ministers in the government at the time, it is unlikely they would have managed to accomplish this as fast and easily. Still, the democratic movement has been unable to produce a political figure of Yeltsin's dimensions, and now it is unlikely that it will. Betting on Gaydar is a loss. Not only is his appearance a negative factor; most importantly, his idea has already discredited itself in the eyes of society, as well as his orientation toward the West. The leadership situation is different on the other end of the political spectrum. Several charismatic figures have appeared here lately, with a great range of abilities both in terms of theoretical activities (Zyuganov, Baburin) and organizational work among the popular masses (Anpilov, Konstantinov, Terekhov). Zhirinovskiy holds a place of his own--undoubtedly a born political leader, but a loner. Leaders of this wing have no levers, no opportunity to use state channels and mass media to organize their supporters; on the contrary, for quite a while now all of them have been operating in a mode of bitter confrontation with the authorities. Nevertheless, behind these leaders today are far greater groups of the population, ordinary people, including in the regions, than behind the dwarf capital city parties of democrats. The explanation is the popular, patriotic idea that is close and understandable to people. We have to admit, however, that neither does the patriotic opposition have a single leader today; there is no large-scale personality sufficiently popular among the people beyond the boundaries of one party. Aleksandr Rutskoy probably could become such a leader in a new environment. This is what politicians and journalists scared by the amnesty have in mind; it is this prospect they suspect when they say that a principally new political situation is now emerging in Russia. They are afraid of this situation. Can Rutskoy, after all that has happened to him, win the presidential elections? If we take as an indicator the experience of the recent past--yes, he can. The precedent was set by none other than Yeltsin himself in 1991. Compare: Like Boris Nikolayevich, Rutskoy was a member of the top national leadership when he started an open confrontation with it; just as Yeltsin in his time began a fight against party privileges, Rutskoy practically alone took a stand against corruption; just like Boris Nikolayevich, he sacrificed his career as a result and was subjected to persecution and massive discreditation by the press, which earned him--again, like it did for Yeltsin in 1990-1991--popularity among the people. As you can see, it all falls into place. But Rutskoy also has perceptible advantages: He is younger, stronger, and behind him is not a party nomenklatura past but the truly tragic biography of a warrior. Being held prisoner in Afghanistan and Lefortovo is not the same as falling off the bridge. Rutskoy's image among the voters is that of a hero, a fighter, a person who has suffered for the people--precisely what is capable today of eliciting empathy and trust. I do not idealize him--if for no other reason than because no politician is worth idealizing. Rutskoy has his weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Of course, he is not all that knowledgeable in economics and management, but neither is Yeltsin, as it turned out, knowledgeable about these things at all. He is too hotheaded, hot-tempered, too straightforward and gullible--in short, he is too unsophisticated for such a job state job. But life teaches us a lot of things, and the months spent in prison should have taught their lessons. Both he and the other Lefortovo prisoners had enough time to think everything through, gain an insight into everything--in a way to look into the mirror of life and politics, see both oneself and others in it, and understand where they were right and where they were wrong, and how they appeared in the eyes of their supporters and opponents, in the eyes of the people. People are not born political leaders--they become such in the process of struggle. Sometimes defeat is more useful for personal development than victory, and prison is of course not the best but, who knows, perhaps not the worst place for an individual to mature politically. The future that emerges with Rutskoy's return to politics can easily be figured out, which, of course, is exactly what has already been done. Therefore we should expect in the near future the most undemocratic--to the point of human rights violations--actions on the part of the executive branch aimed at neutralizing Rutskoy, eliminating him from the "game." It is not accidental that a likely prospective general procurator is one of the people who just recently followed Rutskoy's "Swiss trail..." So, what has really changed in Russia with the announcement of the political amnesty? The state Duma for the first time made a claim to being a serious entity, which undoubtedly strengthens its authority as a body of representative power. The opposition got powerful reinforcement and possibly will gain a strong leader. The president's positions have become even more shaky, while his attempts to punish "the guilty" will only finally undermine his authority in society. Democrats are being pushed into the background; their chances for success in the upcoming presidential elections are declining sharply. As to the "civil war"--"civil accord" dichotomy, there probably will be neither. The opposition has learned from bitter experience and will not allow new clashes, while reconciliation with the regime in this situation is impossible. Which leaves only one way open--to work through the parliament and prepare for new elections.
