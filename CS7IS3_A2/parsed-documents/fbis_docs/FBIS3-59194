"Initially, I am thinking of discussing files with the presidents and vice presidents of the Chamber and Senate national defense committees, which also include opposition members," he essentially affirmed during a press interview. "It is a question of explaining a posteriori the reasons for deciding to purchase this or that equipment rather than other equipment," a close associate of the minister explained. "If this initiative proves positive, Mr. Delcroix envisages further involving Parliament in discussions," he added. "This must be a step in the right direction," added Mr. Delcroix, who denied that he was acting out of opportunism, a reference to certain military purchases -- including Agusta helicopters for the army -- which are the subject of a parliamentary committee of enquiry. "But we must not go too far," added the minister, apparently excluding the setting up of a subcommittee charged with military purchases, similar to that which exists in the United States and the Netherlands.
