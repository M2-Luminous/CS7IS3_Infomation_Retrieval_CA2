Exports during the period totalled 1.89 billion dollars, a 4.4 percent increase over the same period last year. Imports however grew by 55.2 percent and totalled just over three billion dollars. The trade imbalance with the United States shot up by 132.3 percent while the only surplus of note was achieved in trade with the Netherlands (117 million dollars). Although there were small surpluses on trade with individual countries, in most cases these didn't exceed 10 million dollars as was the case with Bolivia, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, Venezuela, Denmark, Greece, Portugal and China. Trade with the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] southern-cone common market went from a 5.1-million-dollar surplus in January-February 1993 to a deficit 152.8 million dollars in the same period this year. Trade with NAFTA followed the same trend and shot up 135 percent to 638 million dollars. Exports of primary products continued to decline in the first two months, falling 19.6 percent with respect to the same period last year, although exports of value-added agricultural goods grew by 7.1 percent and industrial goods by 27.6 percent. Percentage increases in imports by product grouping were 114.7 for capital goods and 38.6 percent for their spare parts and 30.5 percent for consumer goods, almost five times the growth rate of the gross domestic product. Capital goods accounted for 40 percent of imports in January and 47.4 percent in February while consumer goods accounted for 18.7 percent of imports in the first month of the year and 15.6 percent in the second. Imports of semi-processed goods also increased by 34.4 percent as did buses, up 37.2 percent and fuels up by 178.4 percent. Most of the imported goods, or some 838.2 million dollars worth, came from the United States although Argentina's sales there were only a quarter of this. The deficit with Brazil, at 175 million dollars, was up by a whopping 501.4 percent.
