According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MSW], the number of applications presented and permits granted--in particular the total quantity of land--gives no cause for social concern. In 1990, the permits for the purchase of land related to 398 hectares, in 1991 to 534 hectares, and in 1992 to 705 hectares. In the view of representatives of the Internal Affairs Ministry, the law allows "in principle for the securing of the interests of the Polish Republic." In 1992, there ensued an increase in the number of applications for the granting of permits for the purchase of immovable assets by foreigners. There were 1,940 applications received (1,573 in 1991). A treasury fee is charged for the issuance of a permit, and the state Treasury altogether received the joint sum of 10.6 billion zlotys on this account. Two years ago, the MSW issued a total of 112 refusals to grant a permit for the purchase of immovable assets in Poland (31 in 1991). As was reported, the largest number of permits was issued to foreigners from the FRG, the former USSR, Sweden, and the United States. Among the companies with foreign capital participation, the greatest number of permits was issued to enterprises with the participation of capital from Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, the United States, and Italy. Foreigners most willingly buy land situated in the Opole, Gdansk, Katowice, and Warsaw Voivodships.
