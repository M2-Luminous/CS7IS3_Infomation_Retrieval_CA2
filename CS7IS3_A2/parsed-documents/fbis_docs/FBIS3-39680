The shelling of Sarajevo has been stopped. NATO has not actually launched any air strikes, but no one should doubt that its threat to do so was necessary. Perhaps the Russian intervention was also necessary. Certainly it made it much easier for the Serbs to comply (more or less) with NATO's ultimatum without loss of face. But without the ultimatum and the threat Russia would almost certainly not have intervened in this way, and even if it had done so the Serbs would have been less likely to comply with Russian requests. As it is, the ultimatum has had to be interpreted creatively to make it possible for General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander, to certify compliance. The effectiveness of UN "control" over weapons remaining within the 20 km-radius exclusion zone is uncertain. UN member states have lamentably failed to provide General Rose with the 3,000 extra troops he has requested, thereby continuing the pattern of irresponsibility which has characterised all previous international "action" in the former Yugoslavia. France and Britain, the two leading contributors to the existing UN force (UNPROFOR), have smugly refused General Rose's request, suggesting it is for others to take a share of the burden. However justified this implied criticism of the U.S., it is hardly a constructive response, nor is it calculated to strengthen Atlantic solidarity in the next phase of the crisis. Both countries should recognise that their national prestige and interests are now irrevocably bound up with the UN operation in Bosnia. If the operation fails for lack of manpower they may console themselves by blaming the U.S., but it is they who will look most foolish. Strategic Significance With luck, the cease-fire in and around Sarajevo will now hold, at least for a time. The Serbs will probably move their weapons to other fronts of greater strategic significance, such as Brcko and Bihac, where Bosnian Government forces are still in a position to threaten communications between the Serb-held areas in Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia proper. But a cease-fire does not in itself mean that the siege of Sarajevo is lifted -- though that was NATO's declared objective when it ordered the withdrawal of heavy weapons. Likewise, the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo would not relieve the suffering in other parts of Bosnia, including many that the UN has officially taken under its protection. In two of these (Srebrenica and Tuzla) specific actions ordered, on pain of airstrikes, by last month's NATO summit have yet to take place. And even the relief of all these places would not bring peace to Bosnia as a whole. Exploit Momentum So it is vital to exploit the momentum of the small success gained in Sarajevo before it evaporates. General Rose was right to press ahead yesterday with plans to open roads into and out of the city and to repair water, electricity and gas supplies. He is right, and should be given the fullest support by NATO and the UN Security Council, in seeking to extend the Sarajevo model to other parts of Bosnia. Opening the airport at Tuzla, through which desperately needed food, medicine and shelter could be brought to more than l million civilians in central Bosnia, is an obvious priority. But the plight of Mostar, which is worse than that of Sarajevo, must not be forgotten. The Serbs are not the only villains in this war. It is Croat forces, with active support from the Croatian regular army, that have destroyed the historic bridge of Mostar and are still raining down shells on the Moslem population trapped on the east bank of the Neretva. President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, a protege of Germany and the Vatican, has still given no indication that he will withdraw his troops from western Hercegovina. An ultimatum to the Croats around Mostar would be amply justified, would involve fewer political risks than that to the Serbs around Sarajevo, and would make it easier to maintain Russian support for a policy of firmness towards the Serbs. It is good, too, that U.S. and Russian officials are meeting with those of the EU [European Union] and UN in Bonn today, to push forward the diplomatic process. Only if the U.S., Russia and Germany are very firm in urging concessions on their respective proteges in Bosnia is there any hope of peace.
