He said that Russia supports the demand made by the Palestine Liberation Organization for the deployment of international forces on the occupied territories as a condition for the continuation of the talks after the mass murder of Palestinins by a Jewish settler at al-Khalil [Hebron] mosque on 25 February. Explaining the reasons for this position, the head of the Russian foreign policy department said that "we must also provide additional security, and we support an international presence" in these regions. Regarding the development of the peace process in the Near East A. Kozyrev stressed the need for further progress toward a solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict with a view to "making an attempt to stick the separate pieces together into a single whole and not allow negative points to prevail." Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, who welcomed Kozyrev at the airport, stated: "We shall be pleased to listen to what Kozyrev has to say in support of our proposals. However, the ideas that we have already heard from Russia will not in our opinion help to advance the peace process." In this connection, local political circles are noting in particular that Yitzhak Rabin, the head of Israel's Government, had on the previous day, on 10 March, rejected Russia's initiative on convening the Madrid peace conference on the Near East anew for the purpose of unblocking the Arab-Israeli talks and had also expressed his emphatic opposition to the deployment of international peacekeeping forces in the occupied territories. The head of Russia's foreign department will today hold talks with his counterpart Shi'mon Peres and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and will then leave for Tunis where he will have a meeting with Yasir 'Arafat, the chairman of the PLO Executive Committee.
