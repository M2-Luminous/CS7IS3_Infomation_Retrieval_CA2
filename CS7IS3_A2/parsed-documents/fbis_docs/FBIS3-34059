Jallaluddin Haqani, a respected mojahedin commander from eastern Paktiya province, had arrived in the capital to attempt to bring an end to the Afghan factional fighting, now in its 34th consecutive day, they said. Foreign Ministry officials said Haqani, who has set up a base at a military installation near Pul-e Charkhi, some five kilometres (three miles) east of here, sent a represenative to meet Rabbani but other sources say he came in person. It is understood that Haqani has already met with Rabbani's rival Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, who is allied with former communist militia General Abdol Rashid Dostum. Hekmatyar is demanding the resignation of Rabbani and the setting up of an interim government to administer general elections, while Rabbani has so far refused talks with Hekmatyar so long as he continues his alliance with Dostum. The talks here were not marred by shelling as both sides by and large held their fire Thursday, allowing civilians to move in large numbers on the streets. A brief burst of small-arms fire in the old city Jadayi Maiwand bazaar sent civlians running for cover just before noon but in the adjacent Mandayi bazaar, which is the main depot for consumer supplies for all minor Kabul markets, there was a brisk trade in items like tea, sugar, dried fruits, batteries and cigarettes. Meanwhile a five-truck relief convoy of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) arrived in the capital carrying nearly 17 tonnes of wheat-flour for distribution to the homeless on both sides of the eastern Kabul frontlines.
