Given the current distribution of forces in Parliament, every vote will count in whether the government bill or that of the opposition is approved, the daily writes. The opposition think that by pushing its bill through parliament, the government seeks to gain a decisive influence over the privatization process, which will basically define not only economic but also power developments in Slovakia for years to come. The daily SME, referring to the same topic, writes that the result of the vote will determine whether Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar will have everything or only almost everything. If he succeeded in getting his triple office -- the premier, privatization minister, and president of National Property Fund (FNM) -- endorsed by the supreme legislature then nothing would remain for the opposition than, in the words of Frantisek Miklosko (chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) deputies' group) to watch. Following the implemented purges in the state administration bodies and the breakup of the deputies' group of the government coalition Slovak National Party (SNS), Meciar will now only have to get an upper hand over privatization which, given the prevailing methods of the "division" of state property, offers boundless possibilities for producing new owners of small shops who would be appreciated for their staunch positions and who would be always reliable as far as voting is concerned." Although opposition deputies realize this, the question is whether they will be able to prevent this trend. The premier is also very well aware of what is at stake in this game and what the current distribution of forces looks like. The fact that the amended bill on investment funds, which met opposition from domestic and foreign businessmen, was withdrawn from the agenda of the current parliamentary session also testified to this. "And yet it could not be ruled out that several mini chess games will be played in connection with the bill on large privatization, because it is more advantageous for the premier to preserve the status quo than to risk the separation of the functions of FNM president and privatization minister, which could happen under a certain constellation of deputies' votes," the daily writes. SLOVENSKY DENNIK, close to the opposition KDH, writes that "the opposition was thus far able to just point to the accumulation of functions and power." The daily voices the view that this state of affairs will remain unchanged. It is likely that Parliament will not be able, during the vote on the Bill on Large Privatization, to approve the separation of the office of privatization minister from the functions of FNM chairman, and the functions of the finance minister from the functions of chairman of FNM Supervisory Council. The independent daily SME carries an interview with Mikulas Dzurinda, deputy chairman of the opposition Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), on the same topic. "It is high time that not only the opposition deputies' clubs realized the danger that the concentration of economic power in the hands of one movement or one person poses, not only for the development of the economy, but also for democracy in Slovakia," Dzurinda says in connection with the upcoming parliamentary session, at which government and opposition amendments to the Law on Large Privatization are to be discussed. Approval of the government amendment, Dzurinda says, "would mean that the premier will be able to influence changes to and interference in privatization projects, even approved ones, even more." Dzurinda also expresses fear that Meciar tactically did not decide to remove the large privatization amendment from the parliamentary agenda. "It is now clear to everyone that the premier is concentrating his power, and that through the concentration of economic power wants to increase his own political power. Even the smallest suspicion that this power could be weakened could lead him to remove the amendment on large privatization from the agenda. And this would be very bad," he says. In an interview with SLOVENSKY DENNIK, Peter Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL), also expresses disagreement with the government amendment to the law on large privatization. "I believe that opposition deputies and at least some from the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) are aware of the risk of approving such a proposal," he says. "We wanted to and continue to want to prevent the further concentration of power and the division of privatization for political reasons. The government did not accept this and decided to create a faithful structure of owners, because it will depend on the deputies of the governing movement what position it takes on this tendency. The opposition parties are united in the view that it is necessary to prevent the continuation of the personal union between the Privatization Ministry and the FNM," Weiss says. [passage omitted]
