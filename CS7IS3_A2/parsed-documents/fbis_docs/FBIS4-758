His meetings during this week's visit have been dominated by the consequences of the devaluation of the CFA [African Financial Community] franc. The Senegalese president told LE MONDE that, in his meetings with French officials, he had "above all stressed the problem faced by companies based in Senegal, both French and Senegalese, which cannot bear sole responsibility for the economic recovery." "We also spoke at length about the cost of medicines, which should remain at predevaluation price levels." Discussions also focused on the fate of the parliamentarians imprisoned two days after the 16 February riots. At a Foreign Ministry dinner on Monday, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe stated: "We hope that the trials will be concluded rapidly and that, as a result, the political climate will again return to normal." In reply, Mr. Diouf said: "I, too, want this to be the case, but I am a head of state who respects the Constitution, and this Constitution has separated the powers. I would therefore not give orders to the Justice Ministry. However, it would be good if justice could take its course very rapidly, as rapidly as possible." As for the cases of Mody Sy, a deputy of the Senegal Democratic Party (PDS), and Samuel Sarr, a member of the same party, who have been in prison for almost a year, the president said that a decision would be made soon: "I believe that the Justice Ministry is currently putting the finishing touches to their cases." Asked whether a trial would be held in the next few weeks, he replied: "I think so, yes, according to my sources, but again I refuse to get involved in the business of the Justice Ministry." The demonstrations of 16 February which led to eight people being killed, including six police officers, were mostly put down to a Muslim youth movement, the Moustarchidines, which was banned in the aftermath of the riots. Mr. Diouf was asked if the rise of this movement reflected a rise in religious fundamentalism: "What occurred on 16 February must force us to be more careful and extremely vigilant." Has the involvement of the Moustarchidines movement in the violence of 16 February been proven? The head of state replied: "I do not have access to the judicial files, but my sources tell me that this was the case, and that they assembled people from all over Senegal." In addition, Mr. Diouf informed us that talks with the Casamance separatists had not been broken off, despite the cessation of hostilities: "We are still talking, but not on the public stage. We remain in contact with all the protagonists." He admitted that "after the intervention of France, things have calmed down considerably." (At the request of the separatists, Paris had arbitrated on the region, the conclusions of which had been generally favorable to Dakar) Asked if the Senegalese head of state regarded himself as the new leader of the region, as some people had wished after the death of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, he replied: "I have no leadership ambitions. My only ambition is to govern Senegal wisely, of course in a framework of African and world solidarity, without worrying about leadership."
