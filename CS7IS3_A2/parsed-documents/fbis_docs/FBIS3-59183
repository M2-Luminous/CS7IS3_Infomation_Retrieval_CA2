In these two years he has made far-reaching reforms in his department. He wants to turn the Belgian Army into a professional army, and also make it a more open body. One measure in this direction concerns military command files. The defense minister wants to involve parliament, and in particular the president and vice president of the defense committees, to a greater degree. They would have a ex post facto right of examination, rather than only taking part in consultations. Is this an opportunistic move at a time when military orders are making headlines? Leo Delcroix denies this is the case. Openness will also mean the Army will be allowed to speak out: From April 1994, military personnel will be able to express themselves freely on all subjects except those relating to discipline and military secrets. Previously, they had to obtain authorization before speaking out. On a broader level, the Army will make a greater effort to keep the public informed. The Army must strengthen its ties with the nation, Mr. Delcroix said. We must make ourselves more attractive, as we are going to have to recruit, he said. This recruitment drive is a consequence of the decision to abolish military service. Finally, 1994 will see an unprecedented number of new postings in the Army. There will be 12,000 transfers this year -- three times more than usual. This is mainly due to the return of troops from Germany. The minister said he is concerned about the personal situation of these soldiers, and has announced his intention to create new housing, which will be financed by rents paid by the Army.
