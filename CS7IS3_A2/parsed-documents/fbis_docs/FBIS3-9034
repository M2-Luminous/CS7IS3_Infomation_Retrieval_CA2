Utterly groundless and fanciful correlations are being made with certain changes in the executive structures of the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI). The president of Romania cannot possibly be thought as due to react to such irresponsible absurdities, as it is rather the duty of those who launch them to substantiate their allegations with evidence and not by unproved assertions," says a press release from the presidential spokesman. "The decree of the president of Romania ruling the discharging from the position of secretary of Romania's Supreme Defense Council of Lieutenant General Marin Pancea and his transfer to the reserve was signed and sent for publication to the official gazette. The signing of this decree has nothing to do with the recent speculations in the press, his transfer to the reserve corps having been decided a longer time ago," the press release runs.
