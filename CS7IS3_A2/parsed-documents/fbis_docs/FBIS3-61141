Repchinskiy, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Culture Society and chief editor of the newspaper PROSVITA, by Marina Bazhutina; place and date not given: "'People Can Decide for Themselves'"] [Text] Ukrainians are second in our republic in terms of size of population. Questions of the coming elections cannot, naturally, avoid them and they disturb them no less than others. It was in this connection that a correspondent of NEZAVISIMAYA MOLDOVA met with Mikhail Nikolayevich Repchinskiy, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Culture Society, chief editor of the newspaper PROSVITA and, naturally, citizen of the Republic of Moldova. [Bazhutina] Mr. Repchinskiy, Moldova is preparing to elect a new parliament. Ukrainians, who constitute approximately 15 percent of the republic's electorate, are thus of considerable interest to the parties laying claim to power. But you will agree that the rich palette of political programs, with at times barely discernible differences between them, creates a certain difficulty for the ordinary voter: for whom to show preference. So for whom will Ukrainians vote? [Repchinskiy] The society, as a small part of the body of Ukrainians of Moldova, has never claimed to reflect the common opinion of all its fellow countrymen. At the same time, on the other hand, we are citizens, and each of us has personal political predilections and reference points, which in individual instances are focused ideologically: some cleave to communist, some to democratic convictions. I am citing polar-opposite views, let us say, here. Imposing on Ukrainians in advance some one political scheme common to all is simply unintelligent, therefore, for there is a considerable danger here that one could lapse into the sin of provoking a split in the community. And there are already sufficient splits in Moldova. We operate differently. We are familiarizing ourselves with the political programs of the various parties and conferring with their leaders, particularly on problems concerning a guarantee of economic and political liberties and the rights of the national minorities. In a word, conclusions and some advice for Ukrainians will be drawn only on the basis of a thorough study of all the "contestants" for parliamentary seats. At the same time meetings with representatives of Ukrainians of individual enterprises and organizations show that preference in this milieu is being shown to the forces that are not in power. And this is explicable: The parties that are represented in parliament today are wittingly or unwittingly evoking people's dissatisfaction on account of the policy that led to last year's fratricidal war and the ineffective solution of the economic, language, and a multitude of other questions. [Bazhutina] So what do Ukrainians expect of the future members of parliament? [Repchinskiy] The answer needs to be sought in the range of problems which affect people's vital interests. Language, as a means of communication, cannot, for example, be allowed to become a means of pressure, even less political blackmail. A person cannot be afraid of losing his job merely because of ignorance of the language. Not to mention the enormous intellectual losses that could occur if we fail to find an intelligent solution that does not impinge on Ukrainians. These losses, as deplorable practice has shown, are of a moral and political nature which is hard to restore.... There is the ancient oriental saying: If you fall out, do so in such a way that you can make up tomorrow. How far our politicians have abided by this rule I leave you to judge. Different, fresh forces which sensitively catch the demands of the people and respond to them accordingly are needed today. I shall use the following fact to illustrate this. There are, if I am not mistaken, approximately 40 Ukrainians in the present parliament. But with the very rare exception, Ukrainians themselves and their national and cultural problems have been of no interest to this group. Why is this? Because many of these deputies represented the interests not of Ukrainians but of yesterday's party-nomenklatura elite, which fed them and which they served faithful and true. It is not fortuitous that it is from there that charges against us of nationalism and "Bandera-ism" have most often been heard whenever we have raised the question of the development of Ukrainian culture in Moldova and the opening of our own national schools--a question, fortunately, their wishes notwithstanding, which has been supported by the president and the government. As far as the political structures are concerned, only one party--the social democrats--has in recent years regularly maintained contacts with the Ukrainian Culture Society and adopted an understanding attitude toward Ukrainians' specific interests. All the others would like to see us either as a blindly credulous driven mass or some conglomerate blend of the non-Moldovan, so-called Russian-speaking population. With regard for the current situation in the republic the social democrats, incidentally, were the first to speak about the need for guaranteed national representation in parliament. I agree that this is not the ideal solution either. Power should represent experience, knowledge, and intellectual potential multiplied by professionalism, regardless of the ethnic affiliation of its exponents. And someday, I believe, it will. But today's state of our democracy and the whole of society demands just such an approach. Disregarding this means disregarding the demands of reality itself. And it puts on the agenda such a question as Ukrainians being granted within the framework of national and cultural autonomy the rights of local government. This right should, incidentally, be guaranteed all. Let the state deal with questions of defense and foreign policy and formulate the strategy of economic policy, but not distribute fuel by the liter and not indicate from Chisinau what to sow and when to harvest. People can decide for themselves not only these but also other problems which are beyond the capacity of the state. I, as one of millions of taxpayers, say, would like to know on what these funds are being spent and to administer some of them--at self-government level. [Bazhutina] And the final question. How do you view the attempts to form an association of the "Russian-speaking" electorate? [Repchinskiy] In the same way as I view any actual anti-Moldovan coalition. We have experience--and bitter, at that--of this. I believe that the fate of the state and its future need to be decided not by a counterpoise of the interests of different groups of the population but by comparing them and making them commensurate and, where possible, combining them. Ukrainians, like the Russians and Bulgarians, have their own, characteristic interests, and they can be resolved perfectly well without the creation of various "fronts," which would only cause doubts as to the sincerity of their creators' intentions.
