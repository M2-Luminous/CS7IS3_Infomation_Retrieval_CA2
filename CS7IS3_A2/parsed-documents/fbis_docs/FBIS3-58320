The Bosnian horror throws a stain on the Western alliance. On Tuesday evening, when everyone returns to their day-to-day affairs of state, NATO would very much like to project the image of a united and satisfied alliance to the outside world. Former Yugoslavia in general and Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular have, however, revealed the considerable disunity which reigns within NATO, tensions which have gone as far as raising the question of whether NATO still serves any purpose. After the fall of the Soviet empire, President Ronald Reagan declared that America had won the cold war and that the United States was the world's sole remaining superpower. The allies promptly gave Washington the honour. And waited to see how the "leader of the free world" would indicate the path to be followed. People are looking for the present U.S. President Bill Clinton to give clear signals on his first official visit to Europe. The question is whether Clinton can. The American President's foreign policy to date has not shone out for its resoluteness or for having a straight line. On many points, Clinton has done just the opposite of his election promises. During his election campaign, Clinton denounced George Bush's policy on Haiti, Bosnia, and human rights in China. But once in power, Clinton did exactly the same as his predecessor: the Haitian boat refugees were sent back just as before, the Haitian generals remain in power, and democratically elected President Aristide has still not been able to return. Clinton attacked Bush hard for his conciliatory attitude toward China. Clinton said that, as President, he would defend the principle of human rights in China. The opposite is the case. At the recent Vancouver conference of Pacific rim nations, where the Chinese were the most welcome of guests, Clinton did not upset the Chinese with the question of human rights. In the same way, America's handling of the North Koreans' unwillingness to subject their nuclear installations to inspection by the Vienna International Atomic Energy Agency shows that Clinton will back off in a tough confrontation. Clinton is seeking to placate North Korea with promises of lifting North Korea's international isolation and of economic aid. But Kim Il-sung has still not permitted any inspection. Clinton promised a tough approach to the aggressors in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Ultimately, all he was ready to do was to carry out humanitarian food drops and order control flights to see whether the Serbians were holding to the flight ban above Bosnia. The American unwillingness to intervene actively in Bosnia-Herzegovina is naturally not due only to Clinton. Indeed, the Americans must have observed with a certain amount of bewilderment the rivalry between the various West European NATO allies -- primarily between France, Germany, and Great Britain, each of whom was running its own separate Balkan policy. Under American impetus, NATO decided in August 1993 to bombard Serbian positions if the Serbs continued to besiege Sarajevo or to hinder food convoys. Clinton even suggested lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia in order to enable the Muslims to defend themselves. None of these came to anything, because of total French and British opposition. Clinton just swallowed his hard words. But in any event, it is high time for the West to try to correct its now bankrupt policy toward former Yugoslavia. Whether a breakthrough will be achieved will ultimately depend on the "one surviving superpower."
