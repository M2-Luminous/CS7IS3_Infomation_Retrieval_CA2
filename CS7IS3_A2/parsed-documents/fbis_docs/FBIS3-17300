He said there would be Russian Orthodox and Muslim members in it, which reflected Russia's objective position. Russia rejects accusations of having a pro-Serb or any other position, he added. He said that relations between the leaders of Croatia and the self-proclaimed Republic of Serb Krajina must be normalized. "There are ebbs and flows in relations between Zagreb and Knin, fraught with the danger of violence that may bury peaceful settlement in former Yugoslavia," he said. He said that talks on a cease-fire were held in the Russian embassy in Zagreb on Tuesday. "The world community unanimously believes that cease-fire is the first thing to be achieved. Then economic relations must be normalized and then the political status of Croatia's Serb regions must be defined," said Churkin. He pointed out that the talks in Zagreb were held in an absolutely new context. They involved representatives of the U.S., the international peace conference on former Yugoslavia, the EU, the UN and Russia. "Unfortunately, no agreement on a cease-fire was signed, and individual details are still to be specified. We hope, however, that during the next few days representatives of the UN and of the UN protection force in former Yugoslavia will take charge of this. We also hope that the talks will be continued in the Russian embassy in Zagreb on 29 March," said Churkin. He emphasized that the agreement between Zagreb and Knin was not simply a cease-fire agreement, but a complicated military-technical document envisaging the disengagement of the conflicting parties and a number of security measures. Croat tourist companies have been actively inviting Russian tourists to visit Croatia lately, Churkin went on to say. "Before the Croats and Krajina Serbs reach a cease-fire agreement I would not recommend that Russian citizens spend their holidays in Croatia," he said.
