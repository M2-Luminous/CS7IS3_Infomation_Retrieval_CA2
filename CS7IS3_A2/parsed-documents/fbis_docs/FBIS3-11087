On 10 March, Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana Arango suggested breaking off relations with Cuba again because Cuba supports guerrilla and dynamite attacks in Colombia. Pastrana emphatically said: "Colombia should not have ties with Cuba as long as Fidel Castro's government continues to support the National Liberation Army, which kills our leaders, as in the case of late Senate Vice President Dario Londono, blows up oil pipelines, and sows terror." Pastrana noted that: "Given the crisis Cubans are facing, it is important Fidel Castro shows he is willing to facilitate an opening to democracy. That is what Latin America expects from him." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 11 Mar 94 p 17A) On 11 March, Liberal Party presidential candidate Humberto de la Calle Lombana stated he has always tried to establish the central points of his campaign and the differences and similarities with other candidates' campaigns. He added that he has not and will never resort to personal attacks. De la Calle said he does not agree with the idea that the runner-up should automatically become the vice president because Colombia needs a harmonious relation between the president and vice president. De la Calle emphasized that: "It is not a matter of Samper or de la Calle, Colombia is what is really at stake." (Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 11 Mar 94)
