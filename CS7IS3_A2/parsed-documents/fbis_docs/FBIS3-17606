According to the Commission, the turnout at these elections is lower than in the elections for the president of the Republic of Crimea at the end of January, when, for instance, by 1200 43.4 per cent of the electorate had voted already. [passage omitted] But all of that does not give rise to fears and the elections will take place. The election turnout in the rural rayons is the highest. There are rayons where over 40 percent of the electorate have voted, in particular in the Pervomayskiy [Pervomayskoye], Razdolnenskiy [Radzolnoye], and Sovetskiy rayons. Almost 20 percent of the electorate have voted in the city of Simferopol, and 21.45 per cent of the electorate in the city of Sevastopol -- the Black Sea Fleet base. As is known, elections to the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine are taking place simultaneously in Crimea and their are no instances of mass refusal to take part in the elections. A poll is also being carried out in which the people of Crimea have to express their attitude about Crimea building mutual relations with Russia and also about dual citizenship. Sergey Nikulin, spokesman of the President of the Republic of Crimea on relations with the Central Electoral Commission, reported that the poll is being conducted in an organized manner and the poll ballot papers are being given out along with the ballot papers for voting on elections to the parliament of Crimea and the parliament of Ukraine. John Finerti [name as received], the CSCE representative, gives the same assessment at the first stage of today's elections in Crimea. He said that his first impression from his acquaintance with the organization of the elections and his visits to a number of polling stations makes it possible to say that everything is proceeding as normal so far.
