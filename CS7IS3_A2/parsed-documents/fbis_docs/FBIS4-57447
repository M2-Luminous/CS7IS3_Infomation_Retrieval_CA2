Some time ago, you said this is more a moral issue than a legal one. In conclusion, how does the situation stand? Do you believe the national situation can tolerate these petty discussions? [Yoshiyama] Let me explain exactly what happened. First, there was great confusion about the electoral system. We wanted to implement the Constitution based on the three organizations [National Election Board, National Office of Election Procedures, and National Civil Registry] because this is the modern thing to do. This is not something we invented because this system is working in other countries. We believe an electoral system based on three organizations is perfect. When we started analyzing it, however, we realized that we might have some difficulties implementing it. For example, we had no control over how long it would take the professional boards to choose their representatives to elect the National Council of Magistrates members. [Tafur] No one realized this when you were drafting the Constitution? [Yoshiyama] Yes we did, but we thought the Constitution's drafting was not going to take that long. We drafted those chapters back in August-September 1993 and believed that if the Constitution was approved after the referendum, we would immediately start to work on all this. Aside from all this, we thought we would first implement the system. Only later did we realize that despite being the modern thing to do, we were taking risks and that perhaps we might be unable to implement it by election time. Not at our end, but because we depended on others and political problems always come up. Secondly, our main objective was to achieve an image of complete openness, of security and cleanliness. We sought to achieve a completely clean electoral system. After making a cost-profit analysis like economists do, we have no qualms in accepting what the opposition is upholding. We took the Bar Association draft, which in its sixth article clearly states: "You cannot seek reelection." That is what it states. We discussed it among ourselves and all of us decided "we are willing" to accept it. [Tafur] Whom are you referring to when you say all of us? [Yoshiyama] The people who helped the New Majority-Change 90 [NM-C90] internal group. Clearly aware that this article specifies that we cannot seek reelection, I asked: "Are we aware of this? Are we aware that this means we cannot seek reelection, that we are sacrificing our personal interests for superior interests so that the country gets a clear message about the electoral system?" [Tafur] All of them agreed? [Yoshiyama] Well, not everyone was present, only some... [Tafur] ... Who were the ones who attended the meeting? [Yoshiyama] I do not remember...I believe CCD members Robles and Sandoval were there, but... [Tafur] ... Was CCD and NM member Luz Salgado there? [Yoshiyama] Yes, I believe Luz Salgado was there...I cannot say because I do not remember but we made decisions of this sort. There were 30 of us. Not all of them are in Lima all the time. CCD member Martha Chavez was certainly not there because she was involved in all the dealings... [Tafur] ... Perhaps she refused to attend the meeting? [Yoshiyama] No, but perhaps she just did not know about it. We hold regular meetings but sometimes we do not know which issues are going to be discussed on the agenda because we discuss correlated issues. We are a very flexible group in this sense. We do not have a fixed agenda, taking of minutes, reading of minutes. A person stands up and starts speaking; that is all. [Tafur] In short, we can assert that the group accepted the proposal? [Yoshiyama] Yes, the group accepted it although perhaps some did not understand the issue. I am speaking on a personal basis. In that meeting, Yoshiyama understood that the group decided not to seek reelection. [Tafur] Beyond the constitutional provision, would you say there is a moral obligation to do this? [Yoshiyama] I believe there is a commitment I will assume when I vote on the issue. To my surprise, when we held the plenum session the friends in the minority, who have much more legal experience, were in favor. At the time, I was very pleased and of course I thought they also agreed not to seek reelection. This is why I say that I believe we assumed commitment when we approved the Bar Association draft bill. How can we speak of reelection? Personally, I will never propose it. I feel morally unable to propose an amendment to this clause because I voted in favor of it despite the fact that, as you know, the plenum president does not vote. [Tafur] Many people say you are not really making a sacrifice because you will run for vice president. [Yoshiyama] No, absolutely, no, no. That is what people say. They have even told me: "Obviously chap, you are already on the ticket, so why should you care." No, I emphatically declare, first, that I have no political ambition whatsoever and that I am not making electoral calculations. All the people who know me are aware that things are not like this. I have always thought that we are here to make a constitution and a series of laws, without thinking of personal objectives or reelection. I fully disapprove of lawmakers turning this into a profession. [Tafur] Do you think there should be professional politicians? [Yoshiyama] I do not think so. [Tafur] Do you think they should be amateurs? [Yoshiyama] I would not go as far as that, but at least they should not take this as a profession. The point is that there are extraordinary lawmakers, but a few of them are using their position for personal advantage. [Tafur] OIGA magazine claims that this Congress is too professional. In other words, that its salary level surpasses even that of the previous Congress. [Yoshiyama] No. Look, I have some information here. I emphatically maintain that this Congress is much more efficient than the previous ones. I will prove it by mentioning three figures. First, the previous Congress had 4,000 people. Today, we are 700 and the trend is to reduce this number. Each person now corresponds to six in the previous Congress. Don't you think this is highly efficient? Not only because of the lower number of people, but because fewer people means smaller facilities, lower transportation expenses, lower electric power consumption, and many other reduced items. Second, our annual savings amount to $70 million. This amount is enough for building 280 schools, of the type of beautiful schools President Fujimori is dedicating everyday. They are 280 schools; $70 million is a lot of money. Third, our average legislative production has been three times as much as that of the previous Congress and the Constituent Assembly. [Tafur] Are high salaries justified then? [Yoshiyama] No, wait a minute. Why did we reach this production level? Because in the past, all bills were studied at plenary sessions of Congress and committees worked very little. There was the impression that people worked harder, but debates were highly unproductive. Today committees are at work and only the bills that have been properly screened reach the plenary session for approval. We approved five laws yesterday (7 May). It is much more productive. Do you know how long it took the previous Congress to change the name of Cusco to Qosqo? Three days. Can you imagine the country using three days to change Cusco to Qosqo? We probably would have needed one hour to do the same. [Tafur] Going back to the question that you do not want to answer... [Yoshiyama] We earn an average $2,500 per month. You should compare this salary with the salary of, say, the general manager of EXPRESO -- which I can assure you is much more than $2,500. Therefore, I believe we are earning the right amount. Some people have said we earn 17,000 sols, but I believe this is foolish. But citizens want productive, efficient, and hardworking lawmakers. The salary issue has been magnified. It should not be a political problem. [Tafur] Lawmaker Torres y Torres Lara maintains that a series of constitutional amendments like the one dealing with multiple electoral districts might be necessary. Is that a majority bloc position or simply that lawmaker's idea? [Yoshiyama] That is his own personal idea. I should first say that we hold lawmaker Torres y Torres Lara in very high regard because he is the one who has practically directed the constitutional work; that is, his opinions are authoritative. The matter, however, has not been debated yet within the NM-C90 alliance. [Tafur] What do you think about it? [Yoshiyama] We will change a lot of things: the death penalty, the Constitutional Guarantee Tribunal, and the method for electing the National Council of Magistrates, which will end up in chaos the way it is. [Tafur] ...You will enforce such changes despite Dr. Ferrero's begin mad about them. [Yoshiyama] What else can we do? Concerning the constitutional reforms, over the past three months we have heard very authoritative opinions explaining to us how to improve the election of members of the National Council of Magistrates and the Constitutional Tribunal, the death penalty's enforcement, the implementation of the single district, and the cancellation of lawmakers' tenures, which we have considered very interesting. We have no problem at all admitting that we made some mistakes, but we are flexible and willing to consider those opinions for a possible amendment of the Constitution. [Tafur] About the electoral issue, is it true that NM-C90 will not compete, that a new political movement will be created for this purpose? [Yoshiyama] No. We have not made any decision about electoral issues. We have not decided if NM-C90 will compete or if we will create another movement. The only thing we want is to make it possible for the president to run again. Besides, we are convinced that we need strong support from independents if we want to succeed in the next election. This is why we have not made a decision. Today, to speak the truth, we, and particularly the president, are all busy governing the country. I am not sure if journalists are aware of how difficult it is to keep pace with the president's activities when he is visiting the provinces. He works from seven in the morning until three in the morning the next day. [Tafur] Are NM-C90 leaders as concerned as some government officials about Javier Perez de Cuellar's candidacy? [Yoshiyama] There is still a lot of time, is there not? [Tafur] But you are not concerned? [Yoshiyama] It would be hypocritical to say that I am not concerned; but we are taking it calmly. I do not need pills to sleep. [Tafur] But the president says he cannot sleep. [Yoshiyama] He does not sleep because he works too hard. What I mean is that Javier Perez de Cuellar is an excellent ambassador and a diplomat. He is attractive because he has great international prestige, which might make many things easier for him in a future government. A possible negative factor is that he is not acquainted with Peruvian problems. [Tafur] Do you not think that statement is rather misleading? How else could he have helped Fujimori at the beginning if he was not acquainted with Peruvian problems? [Yoshiyama] Perhaps I did not express myself well. I said Perez de Cuellar has many things in his favor. He is an ambassador with great international prestige, but he has to update himself on national problems. At this time, he is not up to date on national issues because he has lived abroad during the past 20 years. That is what I mean. [Tafur] Why do you think people support Perez de Cuellar's candidacy? Why is a government such as Fujimori's government, which has achieved important things in diverse areas, unable to convince the people as much as his accomplishments might lead you to imagine they would? [Yoshiyama] People's approval of the president continues to be high by all standards. The people are happy with his work. In the case of Perez de Cuellar, the people see an image. He is practically a stamp. They are comparing an ideal image with a real person like Fujimori. Besides, the comparison is being made one year before the election. I think it is too early to forecast anything. The only thing we know is that Ambassador Perez de Cuellar has yet to formally announce whether he will be a candidate. The leaders of traditional political parties, however, such as the Popular Christian Party, the leftist movement, and a group of American Popular Revolutionary Alliance followers, already have launched him, involved him. There are even discussions on a possible congressional ticket and in some places they are forming committees. I think they are using him. [Tafur] Would you accept that Fujimori's biggest shortcoming, compared to his achievements, is the handling of human rights, or at least the handling of reports on human rights violations in cases such as the "La Cantuta" or "Huallaga" case? [Yoshiyama] I am not aware of a country where the president has had such a high approval rate for so long. There have obviously been mistakes and we are determined to correct them. For instance, there were some abuses on the issue of human rights. In the Upper Huallaga case, it was the Armed Forces' duty to enter and eliminate the terrorist groups. Probably, and this is being investigated, some Armed Forces members committed abuses in isolated instances. It is denigrating to learn that a soldier raped someone. It is not a matter of counting to see if one or 18 people have been raped or killed. All cases are acts of aggression against human rights. These acts must be harshly punished. But it is wrong to generalize and involve the entire Armed Forces or police in these acts because it turns the issue into a political issue. It is also wrong to cover up things. [Tafur] Do you agree with Monsignor Cipriani that all those human rights commissions are nonsensical, as he has publicly said? [Yoshiyama] No, in no way do I agree. I believe that each commission of this type, like the Human Rights Coordinating Board, like all human rights groups, does play a role. They certainly operate as a counterweight within society. The problem begins when there is exaggeration, when groundless statements are made. If Monsignor Cipriani said what you are telling me, I do not agree with him. [Tafur] If Fujimori were reelected, do you think Commander Nicolas de Bari Hermoza should keep his post throughout the government term? [Yoshiyama] Ask him. Do not ask me. Work relations between two people are known to those two people. It is not only a matter of professionalism, but also of personal rapport, of all the things that make relations between people so productive. [Tafur] My question obviously was not aimed at the emotional side of the relationship. [Yoshiyama] No, I am not talking about that. I am referring to the professional side. I hear the news; I read. I believe General Hermoza is doing an excellent job in his fight against terrorism. I know Hermoza's merits because he is not a general who stays at a military building handling documents. He is at the battle front. If you read the news, you will learn that Hermoza is in Upper Huallaga, in Tarapoto, in Madre de Dios, just everywhere. To put it clearly, "it is the master's eye that makes the mill go." That is the reason for the successful drug enforcement effort. When the history of Peru is written, the name of Nicolas de Bari will deserve a special place. But the decision is to be made by the president. [Tafur] Will a second Fujimori administration bring anything new? Will there be any news from a structural viewpoint, say, in terms of a government program? [Yoshiyama] The main problem here is to fight poverty and create new jobs. I believe very significant steps forward have been taken, but we are still very far from this objective. Major reforms have been enforced, but this is over because the reforms have already been implemented. We should look at the future, continue with the reforms, like in the agricultural sector. We will not give up before Peruvian cherimoyas, for example, are sold on the international market. A Peruvian cherimoya costs $50 in Japan. Several things must be corrected. First, land deeds should be issued for farmers in order to create a land market; second, the Water Law should be thoroughly amended to give water the most advantageous use; third, transportation facilities, highways, and ports should be improved; and fourth, the dollar value should continue to be increased. This project, which seems as simple as exporting cherimoyas, calls for several things that have not been made yet, which are halfway done and have to be made.
