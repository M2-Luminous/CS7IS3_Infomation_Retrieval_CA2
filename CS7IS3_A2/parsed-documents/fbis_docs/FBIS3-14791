Speaking today at a meeting with members of the government, the presidium of the republican Supreme soviet (parliament) and heads of local government bodies, he stressed, however, that the meeting should be carefully prepared, and questions to be discussed by the two sides should be thoroughly analysed. In his opinion, the return of refugees to the populated localities of the Prigorodnyy district is the most complicated of them. It should be tackled in a comprehensive way on the basis of Kislovodsk accords. "The presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia will be able to tackle their problems by themselves, without intermediaries, to decide matters dealing with the settlement of relations between the two nations and to make all the problems clear. The negotiating process between the republics has been started, and it should be continued," Galazov said. Speaking about the current situation in the part of North Ossetia, where a state of emergency will be in effect until March 31, Galazov pointed out that it continued to be comparatively stable. Russia's peace-making forces in cooperation with local law-enforcement agencies are keeping the situation under control.
