The peace agreements, signed two years ago, put an end to the bloody civil war in this Central American nation. In an interview with the media, Salaverria noted that no one can ignore an international agreement involving the international community, represented by the United Nations, because to lie to or ignore the United Nations is a very serious offense. Salaverria added that Calderon Sol has already committed himself to fully comply with any issues pending from the peace agreements signed with the guerrillas. After declaring himself the winner of the elections on Sunday night, Calderon indicated that his first mission will be to consolidate peace, and in doing so, he will begin a dialogue with the opposition represented by the former guerrilla movement Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, among other political forces. Calderon Sol also announced that he will travel to New York in May, when he will meet with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to discuss the peace process and convey his intention of fulfilling the commitments of the peace agreements.
