FBIS4-32264 "dreeu120__a94010" FBIS-EEU-94-120-A Daily Report 24 May 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Competition With West for Oil Refineries Competition With West for Oil Refineries 94CH0298D Prague PRAGUE POST in English 24 May 94 p 7--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94CH0298D Prague PRAGUE POST English CSO [Article by Ann Marsh: "Western, Czech Interests Compete for Control of Oil Refineries"] [Text] Managers of the Czech Republic's oil refineries are fighting to keep control over their operations, while four Western companies have banded together with a proposal to spend over $500 million modernizing the local plants--in exchange for a 49 percent stake. Four Western oil companies have mounted a half-billion dollar bid to revamp the outmoded Czech oil industry, but they face stiff competition from Czech refinery owners who want to keep operations in their own hands. Calling themselves International Oil Companies (IOC), Agip of Italy, Total of France, the Dutch-English concern Shell, and Conoco, offspring of the U.S. firm DuPont, are awaiting word from the Czech council of economic ministers on the future of their proposal. In return for a 49 percent stage in the industry, they are pledging 15 billion Kc ($520 million) over five years toward restructuring and modernizing. Depending on regional demand for oil, that investment could more than double over time, according to IOC Project manager Gert J. de Bruin of Total. If approved, it would be among the largest investments in Central Europe to date. Approval, however, is far from certain. Although the IOC expects word sometime this week, the economic ministers have delayed past meetings, possibly to allow time for development of the so-called "Czech way" counter proposal. Dusan Nepejchal, general director of one of the two largest Czech refineries, Chemopetrol, believes the whole basis of negotiation may be changed, in part because of what he perceives as oversights in the IOC plan. The IOC proposed merging operations of the two main Czech oil refineries, Chemopetrol in Litvinov and Kaucuk in Kralupy. Both plants would undergo modernization to meet environmental requirements, increase safety measures and compete more effectively abroad. The plants would receive Western know-how and sell through Shell, Conoco, Agip and Total gas stations here and in neighboring countries. "If the Czech oil industry really wants to survive, then these small refineries should not compete one against the other, but be strong together," de Bruin said. Fuel producers abroad already undercut Czech oil with less expensive, higher quality fuels. Nepejchal claims no argument with this principle. "We realize that our market is very small and we must save it for our companies," he said. He believes, however, that integration should include not only Kaucuk and Chemopetrol, but also the country's two smaller refineries, Koramo in Kolin and Paramo in Pardubice. The "Czech way" proposal goes beyond oil-refining activities. Litvinov also has petrochemical operations and produces fertilizers. Kaucuk manufactures plastics and rubber synthetics for tires. The Czech refineries hope to modernize these sectors as well. Petrochemistry is of scant interest to IOC members. Although their proposal includes technical support and contributions of know-how to these sectors, it is not a focus for investment. "All four companies have said their interests are in refining and not fertilizing or petrochemistry," de Bruin said. "[They] do not have experience in petrochemistry." Given this fact, Nepejchal would like to see the refineries take their own lead, while using domestic and foreign capital to finance an industry overhaul. "It is not such a big problem for us to get the necessary know-how," Nepejchal said. "And there are investors, both from Czech and foreign banks, who are interested in giving us credit." The Czech industry will need help, however, in securing access to global markets. For Nepejchal, this portion of the IOC plan is the most attractive. He would like to see joint venture agreements concluded farther down the line. The IOC has high hopes for its vision of the future of Czech oil refining, especially since its proposal was designed in cooperation with the government. Several Western concerns responded last year when Vladimir Dlouhy, minister of trade and industry, asked for proposals to modernize the Czech oil refining industry, de Bruin said. Shell proposed modernizing the Kaucuk refinery, while Agip, Total and Conoco together proposed combining Kaucuk with Chemopetrol. At the ministry's behest, the two proposals were combined. Keeping in mind that market access is a key selling point of the plan, the Western oil companies are offering support for financing the long-planned Ingolstadt pipeline, stretching from the Italian port of Trieste through Germany to both Litvinov and Kralupy. It would bring new sources of oil to the Czech Republic, replacing the country's dependence on low-grade oil from the Russian Druzba ("Friendship") pipeline. In the planning stages for about five years, the pipeline is expected to cost DM 700 million ($421 million) to build. Frantisek Kubelka thinks the IOC proposal is a good one. As general director of the industrial section at the ministry of trade and industry, Kubelka has overseen negotiations with IOC members about the project. Still, neither Kubelka nor anyone with the IOC would venture a guess as to what the government will decide. "That is difficult for anyone to say," Kubelka said.
