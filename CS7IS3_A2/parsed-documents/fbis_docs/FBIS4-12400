Deploring the crimes being committed by the Zionist regime, Ruhani said that Israel through such practices has proved that it was not seeking to attain peace and stability in the region or let Palestinians achieve their legitimate rights. The Zionist regime, under the increasing pressure from the intifada and frustrated in its attempt to suppress the Palestinian uprising, has resorted to negotiations to maintain its security and get a grip on the region's economic resouces, Ruhani said. He stressed that Iran will stand by the Syrian Government and nation in their confrontation with the Qods occupying regime. As for Tehran-Damascus ties Ruhani epressed pleasure over the intimate relations between the two countries and voiced Iran's readiness for further expansion of ties in all domains including parliamentary and economic areas. Khaddam said that despite the passage of 30 months after the start of [word indistinct] Israeli negotiations, there has been no progress in the so-called peace talks. He added that it was unlikely for Israel and Syria to end hostility in a near future. The Zionist regime, he said, was dreaming of taking control of the region and materializing its hegemonist goals. Khaddam reiterated that nobody should think that the struggle against the Zionist regime would end. The Syrian vice president, too, welcomed the idea of broadening bilateral ties through continuous contacts between Tehran and Damascus. In another development Ruhani met with general secretary of the Lebanese Progressive Party Walid Junblatt at Iran's Embassy here today where the latter briefed him on the lateut developments in Lebanon. Ruhani expressed hope that the Lebanese people would manage to bring about solid unity between Islamic and nationalistic forces in that country. He called on the Lebanese people to neutralize the enemy's plot to sow discord among them, assuring them that nations always win over aggressors. Ruhani, who is here on a five-day official visit, said that Iran will continue to support the Lebanese people in their just defence against Zionist crimes. Junblatt stressed that as long as southern Lebanon is under Israeli occupation, resistance in the occupied territories will continue.
