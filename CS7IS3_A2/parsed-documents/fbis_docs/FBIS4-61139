According to Shavishvili, a significant part of humanitarian aid given by countries to Georgia in the form of medicines and food products either does not leave the warehouse for a long period of time or, after being allocated its place of destination, ends up in the hands of commercial structures. As an example, he mentioned 58,000 ampules of insulin and two dozen tonnes of cheese that could no longer be used as their consumption date had expired. Shavishvili also pointed out that, despite a multitude of similar facts exposed by the Chamber of Control during the course of recent checks, they still do not reflect the real state of affairs. Shavishvili believes the reason for such chaos lies in the lack of a single coordination center for the distribution of humanitarian aid.
