Erik Pozhdishev, speaking during a conference on nuclear security here, said leaks of cooling liquid and vapour at the Kola nuclear plant in northwestern Russia in the past week were "not serious," and both were rated zero, or insignificant, on the international seven-point scale of nuclear incidents. His statement contradicted an earlier higher rating given to the first incident on March 3. He also denied that anything had happened Sunday, when Swedish experts said there had been a small incident at the Kola plant in northwestern Russia, which is close to the Swedish border.
