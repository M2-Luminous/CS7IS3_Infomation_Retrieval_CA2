The congress has elected a new party secretary in Fausto Bertinotti. There were bitter arguments over the decision to change the Communist Refoundation Party into a force for government. Guido Dell'Acquila reports: [Dell'Acquila] The change in the Refoundation Party has been achieved. The manifesto proposed by the United Left group, which faced the thorny issue of governing the country, obtained 70 percent of the delegates' votes. In other words the majority, led by Cossutta, Magri, and Bertinotti, saw their manifesto win approval by a wide margin. However, the margin does not conceal the deep splits and the anxiety which this choice provoked. The results of the vote to elect a new executive will not be known for a few more hours. It is already known, however, that Bertinotti will be the new party secretary. He replaces Garavini, who resigned six months ago. In the meantime Cossutta has been reelected to the post of party chairman. After four days of debate this congress for change is coming to an end. The Refoundation Party, which is more used to being in opposition, is looking at the new political set-up with a mixture of hope and regret.
