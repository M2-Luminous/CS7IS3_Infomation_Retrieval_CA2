FBIS4-12515 "drnes069yy_94009" FBIS-NES-94-069 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Arab-Israeli Talks Palestinian-Israeli Talks Resume in Cairo Palestinian-Israeli Talks Resume in Cairo Sha'th: `Many Positive Things' in Talks JN1104111394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Arabic 0945 GMT 11 Apr 94 JN1104111394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Arabic BFN [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation, by Sa'id Mu'addi in Cairo on 11 April; from the "With the Midday Events" program--recorded] [Text] [Mu'addi] How do you evaluate the first day of negotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian sides? [Sha'th] I think many positive things were realized today, but we cannot say yet that something has been achieved. As you know, we are late, and we wanted and still want to complete our work before 13 April, and to sign the agreement as scheduled. This led us to call for not delaying the talks and to do what has to be done to conclude this agreement. Nevertheless, I say that the first day was not bad, and some positive things have taken place. [Mu'addi] What subjects were discussed today? [Sha'th] All issues were discussed. We discussed the subject of the Palestinian police, its armament, and number. We discussed security in the Gaza Strip. In the Legal Committee, we discussed issues relating to legal and judicial jurisdiction. We also discussed the transfer of civilian powers. We discussed the freeing of prisoners. I believe we made important progress on the full plan for releasing prisoners. I also believe that we made progress regarding civilian powers. Perhaps, we will be able before the end of this round to announce some specific achievements. We also strongly demanded an end to this security blockade that closed the doors before our people in the West Bank and Gaza, especially in Jerusalem, and threatened their livlihoods and business dealings at a stage that cannot tolerate much obstruction. We also discussed the need to end the security blockade and curfew in Hebron that suffered much after the Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre. Perhaps, we will be able to make some achievements in this field too. [Mu'addi] Will the negotiations resume next Sunday? [Sha'th] Yes, we will stay here, and if we fail to conclude our talks tomorrow, we will resume the talks next week. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, one final question. When will the vanguards of the Palestinian police arrive in the Gaza Strip? [Sha'th] This is one of the subjects that we are discussing. I believe that large numbers will start to arrive soon after the agreement is signed, and this is what we want to do as soon as possible. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation, thank you very much. [Sha'th) Thank you.
