Colombian President Cesar Gaviria won the election. Niehaus said: Costa Rica "views as very worrisome the little respect that certain member states have demonstrated in these elections to acquired commitments." He said: "Costa Rica on several opportunities listed the expressed backing it had, backing which was formalized in line with the most strict norms of diplomacy. At the polls there were some who simply discarded their word and honor, however, without showing Costa Rica the most elemental consideration of saying they were going to withdraw their support." In leaving OAS Headquarters, Niehaus said until the last minute he had written promises of support from 21 countries, but received the votes of only 14. The original coalition included the six Central American countries, the 13 Caribbean English-speaking countries, and four South American countries. Ecuador and Antigua and Barbuda, which had promised to support Niehaus, publicly announced before the voting they were going to back Gaviria, but because the voting was secret it was not possible to establish what other countries concealingly changed their votes at the moment of voting. Niehaus accused the United States, not mentioning the country by name, due to its pro-Gaviria campaign. Niehaus accused it of "exerting pressure and resorting to all sorts of mechanisms and antics to force others into changing their votes." He complained: "If this continues to be the OAS norm, it seems it would be better to forget formalisms and just allow the country at issue to continue to directly appoint the heads of all the posts. At least in this way we would be saving time, effort, rhetoric, and poetry about the respect accorded to states' sovereignty." Niehaus said reproachingly: "We must always remember, however, a colony-type attitude by the weak is worse than an imperialist attitude by the powerful."
