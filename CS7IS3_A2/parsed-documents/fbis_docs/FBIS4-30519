Noting that the reality facing the Korean nation now with one year to go before the 50th year of national division is grim, he expressed the belief that the holding of the North-South top-level talks would mark an important historical occasion in setting right the orientation of our nation. He said: The North-South top-level talks concern the prestige of the top-level authorities of both sides and the destiny of the nation and worldwide concern is focussed on the talks. The North-South top-level talks must be successful talks on all accounts to promote national reconciliation and unity and give all the fellow countrymen bright hopes of peace and independent and peaceful reunification of the country. It is our consistent stand to open a dramatic phase for achieving national reunification through top-level talks without any outside interference. As your side knows, respected President Kim Il-song personally initiated top-level talks already when the North-South dialogue began in May 1972 and has made particular efforts to arrange meaningful top-level talks for the reunification of the country. Our proposal in May last year for the exchange of special envoys was also part of the efforts for top-level talks. But these efforts failed to bear a proper fruit. It is, indeed, very lucky that the top-level talks which have failed to be realized for the past decades are going to see the light now, 50 years after division. Underlying this, I think, is the common stand of us concerned over the present and future of the nation. We would like to believe that this stand is, indeed, a manifestation of the spirit of independence for shaping the destiny of our nation by the efforts of Koreans themselves. We can say a success of the top-level talks is guaranteed, if the North and the South do not differ in this spirit of national independence. For, lying in this are the supreme idea that links the North and the South by one bond, the source of the nation's will and strength capable of shaping our destiny by ourselves, and a sure guarantee for defending the common interests of the nation without playing into the hands of outside forces that make scapegoats out of the interests of our nation. If both sides proceed from this spirit of independence and national stand, the North and the South can get reconciled to and unite with each other, transcending all difference in conformity with the principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity, break the deadlock by the united efforts of the nation itself and climb a peak of reunification and prosperity as desired by all the fellow countrymen. The North-South top-level talks we are going to arrange will mean creating a great new history of the nation, an undertaking for turning the history of antagonism which has lasted for half a century in our country into a history of great national unity, and the history of confrontation into a history of peace, and the history of division into a history of reunification. It will no doubt bring to our 70 million fellow countrymen bright hopes of reunification in the 1990s and restore the high pride of our nation with a fine history, tradition and resourcefulness. It will also give great joy to the peaceloving people of the world who are concerned over the situation on the Korean peninsula. This is our basic view of the forthcoming North-South top-level talks. Stressing the heavy responsibility of both sides in successfully preparing the historical North-South top-level talks, I would like to put forward our proposal concerning the basic matters that should be discussed at the current preliminary contact. First, the venue of the top-level talks. We propose that Pyongyang be designated as the venue of the top-level talks. As your side also knows, respected President Kim Il-song already invited "President" Kim Yong-sam to visit Pyongyang when the latter active in an opposition party and "President" Kim Yong-sam has repeatedly expressed his willingness to meet President Kim Il-song at any place and visit Pyongyang. We believe the designation of Pyongyang as the venue of the talks accords with this will of the top level of both sides. Second, the date of the top-level talks. We propose that the talks be held in mid-August. We think it is a significant time because it is around the liberation day of August 15 both the North and the South celebrate. Third, working procedures for the top-level talks. Various working procedures must be discussed for the top-level talks. We think it reasonable to discuss the working matters except such important ones as the venue and date of the talks at a contact of delegates -- a delegate and two support personnel from each side -- immediately after today's contact. The contact of delegates may begin on July 1 and discuss the composition and size of the delegation, the schedule of stay, the dispatch of an advance team, the procedures of travel, offer of conveniences, guarantee of personal safety and other matters of working procedures. Fourth, the creation of an atmosphere for the top-level talks. We think it important for both sides to create a good atmosphere, if the talks between the top-level authorities of the North and the South are to be arranged with success. Therefore, we propose that both sides stop any act that may mar the atmosphere of the top-level talks from July 1. This us our side's proposal concerning the opening of the North-South top-level talks. We suggest that an agreement of the preliminary contact for the North-South top-level talks containing this idea be adopted and published today.
