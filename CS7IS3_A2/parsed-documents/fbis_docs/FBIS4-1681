Due to start in June this year, construction of the 40.7-km expressway is to be completed in two years, with an expected investment totalling 500 million yuan. This will be the country's fourth expressway and also the first one in an inland province to be funded through the joint stock system. Opening up more channels for fund-raising compared with the former dependence on state allocation of funds alone, the joint stock system is sure to streamline the construction of the road, according to local officials. A share-issuing limited company is to be set up in June. Apart from responsibility for construction and preservation of the road, it will undertake the task of managing various service facilities along it and tapping the great potentials of real estate, tourism, advertising and entertainment in the area.
