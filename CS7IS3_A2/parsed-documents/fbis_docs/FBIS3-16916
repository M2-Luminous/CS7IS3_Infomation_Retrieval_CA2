Svanidze begins with the following: "Hello! Details continue to focus on versions of a coup d'etat that have been circulating in Moscow over the past few days, the objective being the overthrow of President Yeltsin. I say versions, because until recently people had been talking about one, and now we have a second -- version number two -- which is a virtual twin of version number one, but more detailed. It contains the same list of names of the plotters: Soskovets; Luzhkov; General Staff chief Kolesnikov; and Deputy Defense Minister Kokoshin. In comparison with the first version, the list also includes Kvasov, head of the government apparatus. However, there are certain reservations about participation in the plot by Skokov and Shumeyko. Moreover, in comparison with the first version, it says that a plot is possible after spring of this year. Well, like the first version, behind the backs of the plotters lurks the figure of Prime Minister Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin. "If one takes the thinking of the authors of the document to its logical conclusion, an attempt on Yeltsin is being prepared by the hierarchy of the Cabinet of Ministers, the Federation Council, the Moscow administration, and a powerful section of the army leadership, with the well-disposed neutrality of other power ministries. If one takes these anonymous notes on trust, then President Yeltsin will clearly remain alone. He will weaken and try to obtain satisfaction from his last days in the office of president. Thus, it would be impossible to counter a powerful alliance of the above-mentioned figures and state structures. But if not everything in these notes is true -- which is more than probable in view of the complex relations of the above-mentioned people among themselves and their very doubtful interest in Yeltsin's removal -- then a whole number of questions remain. The main one of these: why are anonymous letters of this kind appearing now?" Svanidze then turns to Valeriy Zorkin, member of the Constitutional Court, and asks who he thinks might gain from all this. Zorkin says he believes it is those who do not reckon with realities and believe the country can be brought back from the abyss by junta-type coups. If those who elaborated all this believe that they can carry out a "palace junta," Zorkin says, they are sadly disillusioned. Zorkin says he proposes another "version" where effective power should be linked with national accord. Svanidze wonders how real the possibility of a peaceful outcome of the crisis is and if there can really be accord in Russia in the foreseeable future. Zorkin believes that the existing institutions of power must be strengthened and that one must do everything to make society concentrate around presidential power, which is the only real capable institution. Svanidze notes that "all the politicians named in the documents represent the pragmatic center. Some of these -- Luzhkov, Shumeyko, and Chernomyrdin -- are possible strong candidates for the president's chair. A most probable task of their opponents is to cast aspersions on them." Svanidze asks Zorkin why he decided to become a member of such movements with the word "accord" in them. Zorkin says there is nothing strange or odious in joining such movements if you believe in what they stand for. But this is not what it is at issue, Zorkin says. It is true there are a number of people in these movements who may be called centrists, he says. What we must do is to find a delicate combination between democracy and authoritarianism on the basis of accord and clearly set-out rules with a social treaty of the whole people, Zorkin says. Svanidze notes: "According to an INTERFAX report, Aleksey Ilyushenko, acting Russian procurator general, today issued an amendment to a report regarding the intention to carry out a coup d'etat. According to Ilyushenko, the procuracy general is prepared to institute criminal proceedings on accusations of slander in combination with charges of a state crime. Members of the general procuracy, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the federal counterintelligence service will be brought into the investigation."
