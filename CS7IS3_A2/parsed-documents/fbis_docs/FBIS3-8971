"There is no reason for us to continue discussions with the PDSR," said Senator Ion Diaconescu. The PDSR was informed of this even during the meeting held with the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party [PNTCD]. Both the talks at Cotroceni and those conducted with the CDR parties were initiated by the other side, namely President Ion Iliescu and the PDSR. In the PNTCD's view the terms for continuing the dialogue are the participation of the entire CDR and only following an invitation coming from the PDSR, as it did so far. "The Convention will then decide whether it will participate and if the invitation is not sent, then no harm is done either way," Mr. Diaconescu also said. It seems that the PDSR executive president is concerned about the unity of the Convention, "he cares for it." The common desire and struggle to replace the current regime that has been in power in Romania since the 1989 revolution constitutes the commitment of the CDR, Mr. Diaconescu reiterated. The current regime is considered to be the continuer of the communist regime. All the parties within the CDR are united in this struggle and when the goal has been achieved, each one is to follow its own ideology and program. "If Mr. Nastase wants to say that the executive power is united -- at a time when we believed that the PDSR distanced itself from the viewpoints of Messrs. Funar, Vadim Tudor, or Paunescu -- the opposition will treat this bloc as such," the Peasant Party leader concluded.
