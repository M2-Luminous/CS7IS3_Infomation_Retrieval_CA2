Tanaka earlier told Hosokawa that he would serve as special adviser until Diet debate on political reform ended, the top government spokesman told a news conference. The government's political reform package, aimed at rooting out political graft, cleared the Diet on Saturday after Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, president of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party, struck a deal on making modifications in the next regular Diet session. Tanaka, the No. 2 man of Sakigake (Harbinger), a small component of Hosokawa's seven-party coalition, will concentrate on party affairs from now on, said Takemura, who heads Sakigake. He has pledged his continued support for Hosokawa, according to the chief cabinet secretary. Takemura said Tanaka's resignation has nothing to do with his remarks last week suggesting Hosokawa would disband the cabinet and step down from power if his political reform bid ended in failure. Tanaka, 53, has been elected to the House of Representatives three times from the No. 1 constituency of Nagano Prefecture.
