FBIS4-6515 "dreas077_d_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-077 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 South Korea Ministry Warns of U.S. Trade Retaliations Ministry Warns of U.S. Trade Retaliations SK2104015794 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES in English 21 Apr 94 p 8 SK2104015794 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES English BFN [Text] Korea is threatened with trade retaliations from the United States over its decision to destroy sausage imported from there in February. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and the Economic Planning Board [EPB] yesterday, the U.S. Meat Industry Trade Policy Council has recently filed a formal complaint with the U.S. Trade Representative calling for trade retaliations for Korea in connection with the sausage controversy. EPB officials said the USTR will likely launch a full-scale probe into what American officials said are Korea's unfair trade practices. Trade officials here expressed concern that the sausage issue may develop into a fresh trade dispute between Korea and the United States at a time when their bilateral trade relationship is liable to turn sour as a result of its growing dissatisfaction with Korea's closed automobile market. If the USTR reaches a conclusion that Korea's action was unfair, it can take retaliatory action against Korea under the "Super 301" section reinstated last month. The newest trade issue was prompted by Korea's Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, which ordered a halt to customs clearance of American sausage with the illegally-extended term of validity in early February this year. The ministry also ordered 24 importers of American sausage, mostly chicken and turkey franks, to retrieve the already-marketed products from distribution outlets. The ministry insisted that the American products had been heated and refrigerated and therefore they should be allowed only 30 days to be sold. Under Korea's food sanitation rules, frozen sausage has an expiration date of 90 days from the day of production whereas heated and refrigerated products must be sold within 30 days. But American meat processing firms as well as local importers reacted strongly to the ministry's decision, saying it is the Korean government's "arbitrary" application of their rules. About 4,800 tons of American sausage worth 25 million dollars had been shipped in since 1990, having been allowed an expiration date of 90 days, before the ministry's February decision, which put on hold some one billion won worth of sausage at the port of Pusan. EPB officials said the U.S. looks particularly unhappy with the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs' sudden change in its application of rules without prior notice. They said some USTR working-level officials have already visited Korea to lodge a formal protest, expressing concern that the incident may aggravate already-worsened trade relations with the U.S.
