Criticism was also voiced immediately after the conclusion of the national assembly in Mannheim by the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]. Our correspondent Golo Schmidt spoke with the party executive spokesman of the Alliance 90/Greens, Ludger Volmer. [Schmidt] Herr Volmer, does the flat refusal by the Social Democrats to enter into a coalition with the Alliance 90/Greens come as a surprise? [Volmer] Actually, the only refusal that was "flat" was that by Herr Rappe, who is also the chairman of the IG Chemie labor union. But that does not surprise me. Rappe has been on this tack for ten years. We are, after all, very critical of the chemical industry, and this naturally also impacts on the associated labor union. [Schmidt] But SPD party whip Verheugen also declined vigorously. [Volmer] He had to. As long as party boss Scharping wants to avoid all coalition statements and his course is still headed more in the direction of the Union and the FDP, his party whip cannot just get up and say that the Greens are the natural coalition partner. [Schmidt] The rejection is linked particularly to the demand of the Alliance 90/Greens for the abolishment of the Bundeswehr and NATO. Would this basic position of your party even be negotiable? [Volmer] What matters to us is the direction in which we go. NATO continues to represent a strategy of escalation, while we want deescalation. We know that the dissolution cannot be carried out within a coalition period of four years. But there has to be a party which preserves the vision of an armament-free foreign policy. And the switches have to be set toward a demilitarization and a "civilizing" of the foreign policy. [Schmidt] If the thesis of the Alliance 90/Greens is correct, i.e., that the SPD has made a shift to the right: Must radical demands not virtually force the SPD into a grand coalition? [Volmer] In the SPD, as well, there are reform forces which would gladly work together with us. One can speculate on how strong these are in their party. With our demands, we want in any case to apply pressure on the SPD to keep its own promises for reform. [Schmidt] Do you still believe in a red-green coalition following the next Bundestag election? [Volmer] In a purely arithmetic sense, the farther the SPD goes to the right, the greater the chances for such a majority become. Since this is currently the case, we are, however, also faced with the dilemma that the differences in content become greater. That makes the formation of a coalition more difficult.
