On Friday morning staff members recognized him. The hotel management went to talk to Pinochet and his party, says director F. van der Post. "We told him that we could not guarantee his safety or the safety of the others in the hotel. His security people then decided to leave." Pinochet and his party left the hotel on Friday night, according to Post. The former dictator is on a tour of Europe this week. He is leading a trade delegation from the Army's procurement department. Today [30 May] he is expected in the Czech capital Prague. Czech President Havel and Prime Minister Klaus openly dissociated themselves from the visit. "I am not thrilled about the fact that the first important Chilean trade mission to the Czech Republic is led by General Pinochet," Havel declared. "But I consider this notification." According to the president, Pinochet has not been invited by any official department and will not meet with government representatives. Pinochet was invited by the semi state company Omnipol, which is responsible for the sale of Czech arms.
