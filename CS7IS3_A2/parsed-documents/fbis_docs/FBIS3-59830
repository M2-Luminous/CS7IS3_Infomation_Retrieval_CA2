Shaykh Hasan 'Awwad was the students' imam in the regional mosque. Shaykh 'Awwad was not a member of al-Da'wah Party because, he said, he did not want to commit himself to any one party, regardless of what that party was. If he did, [Shaykh 'Awwad thought], his conscience would be subject to the party's decisions and not to the credibility of faith. At that time the most prominent figures of al-Da'wah Party were Shaykh Na'im Qasim, the party's current shaykh; Muhammad Ra'd, his current deputy; Muhammad al-Khansa; and Mahmud al-Qimati. In Lebanon their immediate loyalty was to Shaykh 'Ali Kurani, who was the brother-in-law of Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah. Kurani, who is married to the sister of Sayyid Fadlallah's first wife, was preoccupied with the concerns of wealthy Shiites in the Gulf countries. He was therefore unable to maintain a harmonious relationship with members of Lebanon's al-Da'wah Party who, at the same time, were frequenting a turbaned member of al-Da'wah Party from al-Najaf. That man from al-Najaf, namely, Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, had pledged to Sayyid Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, the man who founded al-Da'wah Party in Iraq between 1957 and 1959, that he would become his representative in Lebanon. Sayyid Fadlallah, who started his activity in the Brotherhood Society in East Beirut, was forced by the civil war to leave East Beirut and go to the southern section of the city where he started his activity in the mosque of al-Sallum Quarter (al-Karamah Quarter). The activity carried out by Sayyid Fadlallah as a member of al-Da'wah Party did not prevent him from speaking out on certain occasions as the representative of Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, president of the Supreme Shiite Islamic Council. Hizballah's most prominent leaders now may have been members of al-Da'wah Party. Among them we mention Shaykh Na'im Qasim, who serves as vice president of Hizballah. At the same time Shaykh Qasim serves Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah in a role like that, which was played by Saddam Husayn when Saddam served as deputy to then Iraqi president Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr. And there is Muhammad al-Khansa who functions in the political office. Actually, he is the one who runs that office in the presence of its chief, al-Hajj Husayn Khalil, one of Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah's two former attendants. Mahmud al-Qimati serves as the officer who is responsible for Hizballah's central funds. Hasan Nasrallah, Na'im Qasim, and Muhammad Ra'd make up the trio in Hizballah's Consultative Council, which represents the fanaticism in al-Da'wah Party.
