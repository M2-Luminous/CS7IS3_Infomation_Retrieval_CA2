FBIS4-52514 "dreas091_a_94041" FBIS-EAS-94-091 Daily Report 10 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Securities Association Names Doi New Chairman Securities Association Names Doi New Chairman OW1005125894 Tokyo KYODO in English 1234 GMT 10 May 94 OW1005125894 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- The Japan Securities Dealers Association has named Sadakane Doi, chairman of Daiwa Securities Co., as its next chairman, current association head Masaru Aratani said Tuesday [10 May]. Doi is to assume the two year-term chairmanship on July 1, Aratani told reporters. It will be the first time since a series of stock scandals in 1991 for an official from one of the "big four" brokerage houses to head the securities industry organization. Before the scandals, involving payments of loss compensation by brokerages to big customers after the collapse of the "bubble economy," the big four -- Nomura, Nikko, Yamaichi and Daiwa Securities Companies -- customarily took turns to supply the association's chief. In line with the association's self-governing rule, Doi will give up the rights to represent Daiwa, though he will remain the brokerage's chairman when he becomes the association chief. The Finance Ministry initially wanted a full-time chairman of the association, but the association argued that limits should not be put on the post. Giving up of the company representative rights by Doi is viewed as a compromise between the ministry and the association. The association will hold a general meeting on May 25 to change its articles so Doi can assume the association's chairmanship while remaining in his post at Daiwa.
