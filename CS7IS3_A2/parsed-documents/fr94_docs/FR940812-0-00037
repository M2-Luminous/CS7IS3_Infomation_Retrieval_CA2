FR940812-0-00037 FR940812-0-00011 20 CFR Part 416 [Regulations No. 16 ] RIN 0960&hyph;AC22 Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled; Continuation of Benefits and Special Eligibility for Certain Severely Impaired Recipients Who Work AGENCY: Social Security Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rules. SUMMARY: These regulations reflect changes in the law made by the Employment Opportunities for Disabled Americans Act and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. These statutes made permanent, simplified, and liberalized the incentives in the Social Security Act (the Act) for disabled and blind supplemental security income (SSI) recipients who attempt to work. They also liberalized the provision that provides an impairment-related work expense exclusion from the regular SSI income counting rules. In addition, we are making related administrative policy changes necessary to carry out these provisions. EFFECTIVE DATE: These rules are effective August 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Regarding this Federal Register document_Richard M. Bresnick, Legal Assistant, Office of Regulations, Social Security Administration, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21235, (410) 965&hyph;1758; regarding eligibility or filing for benefits_our national toll-free number, 1&hyph;800&hyph;772&hyph;1213. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: General SSI payments are designed to provide a basic level of support for certain aged, blind, or disabled individuals. Work incentive provisions in the SSI program generally enable blind and disabled individuals to return to work or increase their level of work activity without losing SSI disability or blindness status. Certain work incentives provide them some protection from having their SSI benefits reduced based on their increased earnings. In most States, some provisions also permit continued Medicaid coverage for qualified individuals even if their earnings preclude any SSI cash payments. Under the law in effect before July 1, 1987, regular SSI benefits (section 1611 benefits) were payable to a disabled SSI recipient who worked at the substantial gainful activity (SGA) level after a 9-month trial work period. Work at the SGA level resulted in the cessation of disability status and, thus, an inability to requalify for regular SSI benefits without filing a new application if the work continued after a 15-month extended period of eligibility (EPE). Section 1619, in effect from January 1, 1981, through June 30, 1987, permitted payment of special SSI cash benefits (section 1619(a) benefits) to disabled recipients who lost eligibility for section 1611 benefits because of SGA. Section 1619(b) provided special SSI eligibility status for Medicaid purposes to working disabled or blind individuals whose earnings made them ineligible for SSI cash payments. Transitions between the various statuses, particularly after the EPE, were complicated. Many felt that the complexity deterred people from participating in the section 1619 program. Amendments to section 1619 addressed these concerns. Sections 2 and 4 of the Employment Opportunities for Disabled Americans Act, Public Law (Pub. L.) 99&hyph;643, effective November 10, 1986 and July 1, 1987, respectively, made permanent and provided several improvements to sections 1619 (a) and (b). Section 5032 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, effective May 1, 1991, further amended section 1619(b) by eliminating the 65-year age limit for special SSI eligibility status for Medicaid purposes. Section 5033 of Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, effective December 1, 1990, liberalized the impairment-related work expense exclusion of section 1612(b)(4)(B)(ii) of the Act. These regulations were published in the Federal Register (58 FR 52458) as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on October 8, 1993. Interested parties were given 60 days to submit comments. The comment period closed on December 7, 1993. We received two letters containing comments. One commenter supported the proposed changes without modification. The other generally supported the proposed changes, but suggested that we add one clarifying statement. We explain below in the Public Comments section of this preamble the nature of those comments and how we accommodated the suggested revision. This commenter also discussed matters that were not relevant to the proposed regulations. We referred those matters to the appropriate component of the Social Security Administration and do not address them in this preamble. In addition, on December 3, 1993 (58 FR 63888) we published final rules which added a new paragraph (c)(1) to §416.1112 governing the exclusion from earned income of the earned income tax credit refund an individual receives, and redesignated existing paragraphs of §416.1112. Therefore, we have revised the references to paragraphs of §416.1112 in these final rules to be consistent with the new paragraph numbering. Further, we inadvertently did not provide a complete reference to all the relevant income exclusions in §416.1112 as we apply them in determining the State threshold amount for purposes of determining section 1619(b) eligibility. We have made this technical correction to §416.269 of these final rules. Therefore, except for adding the requested clarifying statement, updating regulatory references, and correcting typographical and technical errors in the NPRM, we adopted the rules as proposed.
