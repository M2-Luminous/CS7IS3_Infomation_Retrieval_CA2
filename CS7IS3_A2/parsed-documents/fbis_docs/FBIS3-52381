Aqazadeh pointed out that the Islamic Republic of Iran is ready for any kind of cooperation with other OPEC members. According to a report by our correspondent in Rasht, the petroleum minister proposed that OPEC production be reduced by four to five percent. An IRNA report mentions that the petroleum minister said OPEC and non-OPEC members' overproduction is the main factor in the decreasing trend of oil prices, but at the same time added that behind-the-scenes political issues have also contributed to the current oil price crisis. Aqazadeh added that during the first six months of the current year, average oil prices were above $16 and it was expected that they go even higher during the winter. But that failed to happen, which is not normal.
