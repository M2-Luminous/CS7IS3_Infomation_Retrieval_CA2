The organizers of the fair hope to further promote border trade and economic co-operation between China and Vietnam as well as other Southeast Asian countries, Liang Yuxiang, a senior official of Pingxiang, said last week. Liang is also executive director of the fair's organizing committee. Liang noted that Pingxiang shares a 97-kilometre-long border with Vietnam, has direct rail and highway links with Vietnam through the Friendship Pass, and is only 187 kilometres from Hanoi. This places Pingxiang in a favourable position for developing border trade and economic co-operation with Vietnam, Liang said. To make full use of the opportunity, more than 1,000 Chinese firms will offer overseas participants in the fair about 300 co-operation projects, in addition to displaying various commodities and technologies. The organizers are also considering organizing delegations of Chinese business managers to visit Vietnam after the fair. Vietnam will send a 150-person delegation, representing more than 40 enterprises, to the fair. Liang expects that individual Vietnamese visitors will far outnumber the official delegation. At the fair, the Vietnamese will exhibit sedan cars, motorbikes and air-conditioners that are assembled or manufactured in Vietnam by foreign companies. The Vietnamese will also display their own mineral, rubber and aquatic products. Entrepreneurs from Thailand Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan will also participate in the fair in order to tap new business opportunities, Liang said. Since the United States has lifted its trade embargo on Vietnam, this Southeast Asian country is attracting more foreign investment and creating more business opportunities. Thus, Liang noted, Chinese enterprises will be able to find co-operation and investment opportunities in Vietnam in addition to border trade.
