The latest proposal by Raimon Obiols, Socialist Party of Catalonia secretary general, for CiU to agree to form a coalition government with the PSOE was rejected yesterday both by Pujol and other leaders of both Convergence and Union consulted by this newspaper. In this case, there is agreement between Democratic Convergence of Catalonia and the Democratic Union of Catalonia in stating that "the solution that the PSOE has given to its crisis was just a mere exercise in internal balancing in order to make this legislative term last as long as possible -- in short, in order to stay in power." For CiU it is therefore inconceivable for it to involve itself more in government activity with a party -- the PSOE -- that remains "in a precarious political situation." In fact, the CiU leadership will follow closely the course of the Socialist regional congresses because it believes that "although the Catalan Socialists have already held theirs, the struggle between renewalists and Guerraists could be repeated -- especially in Andalusia and Madrid -- and then we will know Gonzalez' real control and Guerra's real intentions." Jordi Pujol himself told this newspaper following his first postelection meeting with Gonzalez: "With which PSOE would I reach agreement? With Felipe's, with Alfonso's, or with Felipe's and Alfonso's?" Those close to Pujol believe that the 33d congress did not resolve that uncertainty. Hence the CiU leadership, after analyzing the Socialist congress results, has decided to maintain its strategy of ad hoc parliamentary agreements with the PSOE, based on two parameters -- continuing to contribute to the legislature's stability and securing the greatest possible quids pro quo for this support.
