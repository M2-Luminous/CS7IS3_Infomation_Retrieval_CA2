It used to seem simply impassable -- in the political, economic, ideological, and military respects. One side was personified by the Warsaw Pact, the other by the North Atlantic bloc. But times have changed. There is no longer a Soviet Union or a Warsaw Pact. Even the former abyss has disappeared. Russia and the Western countries have taken the path of developing cooperation.
