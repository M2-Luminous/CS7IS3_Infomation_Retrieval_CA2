The engineering corps from Burcht, Jambes, Amay, and Peutie are supposed to relieve their French-speaking colleagues who have been stationed for the last four months in Kakanj, 40 km northwest of Sarajevo. However, fighting has turned this plan upside down. A first group of 38 men from among the newcomers got caught up in Sarajevo, from where they probably headed for Zagreb. The second group of 43 men had to wait in Split. The withdrawal of the French-speaking detachment also went completely wrong. Their convoy was stopped by the Serbian militia 20 km outside Sarajevo. They will probably try to reach Sarajevo again today. The fresh troops were meant to be flown in UN aircraft from Split to Sarajevo, in two groups. Armored cars were then supposed to take them on the last part of the journey to Kakanj. The departing troops were meant to cross with them in Sarajevo and fly back to Split in the same aircraft. Up to Split everything ran smoothly. As planned, the group split up into two sections. A first group of 38 men quickly boarded the plane for Sarajevo. However, fighting to the north of the city forced them to divert the flight, probably to Zagreb. The failure of the rendezvous raises another problem: The fresh troops were supposed to receive bulletproof vests and UN helmets from the colleagues they are relieving. The shortage of bulletproof vests and helmets has long been the subject of debate.
