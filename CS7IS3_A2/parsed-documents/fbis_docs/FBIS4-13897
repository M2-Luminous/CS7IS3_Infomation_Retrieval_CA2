The paper notes that progress in the peace process has long been contingent upon moves that Israel, rather than the Arab sides, must make, contrary to the claims in this regard by the Tel Aviv rulers. Syria and the other concerned Arab sides have declared their willingness to achieve full, just, and comprehensive peace grounded in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and the principle of trading land for peace. TISHRIN adds: During the sixth round of the Washington bilateral talks, Syria submitted constructive and balanced proposals to the Israeli negotiators. Had Israel accepted these proposals, peace would have been achieved in the region. However, the Tel Aviv rulers, who have been pursuing a policy of evasion and procrastination, have thwarted all the Washington rounds of talks, one after another, by their refusal to address the real issue; that is, Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories. TISHRIN goes on to say: As regards the issue of peace, what counts is action, rather than words and statements. The Rabin government has continued to earmark huge funds for the building and expansion of settlements although Rabin acknowledged the need to dismantle settlements. What the Rabin government should do in this regard is to curb settlement activities. Rabin is well aware that peace with Syria is impossible without the restoration of the Golan, and that the policy of evasion, procrastination, and circumvention of complete withdrawal will only obstruct the Washington talks and delay the achievement of durable peace in the region. It is insufficient for Rabin to make statements here or there. If his intentions are sincere, he must translate them into realities on the ground. TISHRIN says: The upcoming tour of the region by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is providing Israel with an opportunity to rid the Washington talks of the stalemate plaguing them. It could do so by reiterating its willingness to withdraw from the occupied territories, implement the relevant UN Security Council resolutions to the letter, and subscribe to the bases and principles of international law. TISHRIN concludes by saying: Observers hope that the Rabin statements will be followed by action. They also hope that they are not just a part of a maneuver prompted by the U.S. secretary of state's tour of the region, which is designed to end the stalemate. Moreover, the opportunities for peace are getting harder to foster day after day. Likewise, it is impossible to make the slightest progress without a drastic change in the Israeli position. The newspaper AL-THAWRAH also comments on the Middle East peace process and the upcoming tour of the region by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. It holds Israel responsible for the tense regional situation that prompted the U.S. secretary of state to say that he is not expecting any striking breakthroughs. AL-THAWRAH wonders: Does this mean that the U.S. stand toward Israel's obstruction of the peace talks, as demonstrated prior to the Geneva summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton, will be maintained? The paper says: The U.S. sponsorship of the peace process must be promoted so it may result in the implementation of the relevant international resolutions if the desired peace is to be achieved. Peace cannot be built on usurpation and occupation. This is what President al-Asad had in mind when he said that peace cannot be built at the expense of others' territories. What could prompt the Arabs to work for peace if such peace were to result in the abandonment of their territories in favor of Israel? The paper continues: This is the sound and objective argument constantly set forth by President al-Asad, particularly at the Geneva summit. That is why President Bill Clinton said that Syria is a key regional player that cannot be overlooked, and underscored its potential contribution to stability, equilibrium, and peace in the region. AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: Israel has wasted two and a half years of peace talks, abusing U.S. tolerance, as well as the financial, military, and political support it is receiving. This has weakened the opportunities for just and comprehensive peace. Besides, Israel has provided all Arabs with evidence that it is targeting their lives, territories, and resources. That is why they have shown greater determination to confront these challenges, and to demonstrate greater firmness in their adherence to their rights and territories, as well as a willingness to make sacrifices to vindicate them.
