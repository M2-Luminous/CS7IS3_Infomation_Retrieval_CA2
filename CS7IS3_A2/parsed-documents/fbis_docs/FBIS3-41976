This was revealed by an international military source on 23 December. If these missiles are operationally deployed in the condition of being able to be moved around, most likely it will become difficult for Japan to intercept them when they are fired at this country or for the U.S. armed forces to attack the missiles in case of contigencies. The source predicted that the Nodong-I missiles will be operationally deployed next year. According to the Defense Agency, North Korea succeeded in test-firing a Nodong-I missile into the Sea of Japan in late May. At that time, missiles were launched from a fixed launching pad on the coast facing the Sea of Japan. As such, it was thought that changing missile launching positions would be difficult. But the analysis of information carried out by Japan and the United States has revealed that the missiles can use mobile launching platforms as well. Because the missiles are so large, however, it is said that they cannot be launched from a sea vessel. The Defense Agency at present assumes the range of the Nodong-I to be about 1,000 km, and it has made public the results of its analysis which indicate that all of Japan, with the exception of only part of Hokkaido, lies within this range. Even when the Nodong-I missiles become mobile, their range will not change much, but because they will not use fixed missile bases, it is thought that it will be difficult to predict where the missiles will be launched from. Furthermore, because North Korea is proceeding to place its military facilities underground, a top Defense Agency official said, "It will become difficult for the U.S. armed forces to attack the missile facilities even if they want to."
