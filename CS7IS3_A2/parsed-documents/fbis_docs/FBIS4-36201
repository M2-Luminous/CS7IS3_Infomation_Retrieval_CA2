FBIS4-36201 "drnes109_r_94008" FBIS-NES-94-109 Daily Report 29 May 1994 India Finance Minister Outlines Disinvestment Plan Finance Minister Outlines Disinvestment Plan BK0206121794 Delhi INDIAN EXPRESS in English 29 May 94 p 1 BK0206121794 Delhi INDIAN EXPRESS English BFN [By Santanu Saikia] [Text] Finance Minister Manmohan Singh has estimated that disinvestment of shares of public sector undertakings (PSUs) in 1994-95 can mop up as much as Rs [rupees] 8000 crore, twice the amount earmarked for mobilisation in the budget estimates. Beyond the Rs 4000 crore mark, receipts from disinvestment will be used to reduce escalating Government debt, Singh said in a note to the Cabinet last week. Though scalded by a Public Accounts Committee (PAC) indictment on the manner in which shares were disinvested in 1990-91, Singh has decided to push ahead with a bold disinvestment programme this year too. He has identified 28 PSUs whose shares would be off-loaded. Besides the traditional auction mechanism, two new routes have been identified for disinvesting PSU shares. One is to ride piggyback on PSUs when they tap the stock market to expand their equity base. Disinvestments would be clubbed with a premium equity or rights issue of a PSU. The other new method would be to directly tap the Global Depository receipts (GDR) market for large-scale disinvestments as foreign markets have the necessary depth to absorb large issues of risk capital. Riding piggyback with a PSU flotation in the GDR market is an additional mechanism that may be tapped. In a marked departure from previous disinvestment programmes, Singh has proposed equal sharing of proceeds between PSUs and Government. Half the funds mopped up through disinvestment will go PSUs, to take care of their own internal requirements. The note said auctions will be held several times during the year. The public issue route will be open throughout the year, though the preferred time of entry will be when there is sufficient buoyancy in the market. Of the 237 PSUs in the country, only 37 qualify for disinvestment based on the yardstick of consistent profitability over the last three years, and large free reserves equal to or higher than the paid-up capital (which can give rise to a bonus issue subsequently). Some PSUs have not been taken up for disinvestment despite being profitable, as the free reserves are not large enough vis-a-vis the paid-up capital. After completion of all formalities, including capital restructuring and capitalisation, the following companies have been identified for disinvestment: Bharat Petroleum, Cochin Refineries, IBP [expansion unknown], Lubrizo, ONGC [Oil and Natural Gas Commission], OIL [expansion unknown], Indian Oil, HOC [expansion unknown], IPCL [Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited], VSNL [expansion unknown], MTNL [Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited], BHEL [Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited], Nyveli Lignite Corp, Andrew Yule, ITI [expansion unknown], Hind Teleprinters, BEL [Bharat Electronics Limited], BEML [expansion unknown], Shipping Corp, Air India, Dredging Corp, IRCON [Indian Railway Construction Company], NALCO [expansion unknown], HMT [Hindustan Machine Tools], SAIL [Steel Authority of India], State Trading Corporation, Mineral and Metals Trading Corporation and MSTC [expansion unknown]. PSUs like Steel Authority of India (SAIL), HMT and State Trading Corporation will have to wait in the wings until adequate capital restructuring takes place. And units like Hindustan Zinc, Hindustan Copper, Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilisers and Fertilizers & Chemicals Travancore Limited, which lack a friendly investors' perspective, will not be offloaded until the outlook improves. Sensitive PSUs -- from the national view point -- Hindustan Auronatics, Central Warehouse Corporation, Cotton Corporation of India etc -- will not qualify for disinvestment. In the negative list will also be shares where disinvestment has brought Government holdings down to the critical level of 51 per cent. They are Hindustan Petroleum Ltd and Madras Refineries. Shares of Indian Oil, Oil India, ONGC, Air India, Lubrizol, IBP and Hindustan Teleprinters will be sold only after adequate capitalisation of free reserves takes place, by way of bonus shares issued to the Government. If shares are sold by public auction, the minimum bid will continue to be at Rs 25,000 or the value of 100 shares, whichever higher. The reserve price of shares will-be fixed in consultation with the International Development Bank of India and Industrial Finance Corporation of India. Ten per cent of the bid value will have to be deposited with authorities before bidding starts.
