A list of election monitors' complaints, made available to the KAZTAG news agency on Wednesday, includes ten main points. Observers complained about the complexity of the republic's candidates registration system, the existence of a state list of contenders for parliament seats, the vagueness of the programmes of many candidates, and their poor coverage in local news media. A group of observers monitoring the work of the Central Electoral Commission recognised it as unsatisfactory, listing as inadmissible for pluralistic democratic elections such irregularities as the casting of votes by one and the same person for himself and his relatives, the delivery of ballot-boxes to the homes of a number of voters, the lack of guards at some polling stations. Foreign monitors were particularly angered by the fact that they were not given an opportunity to visit a number of military facilities where polling took place. They believe could harbour possibilities for various kinds of irregularities. ITAR-TASS and KAZTAG correspondents requested commission chairman Karatai Turysov to comment on foreign observers' complaints. He said all the complaints are now being thoroughly scrutinised and appropriate explanations will be given either later on Wednesday or early on Thursday. "Personally, I am not inclined to overdramatise the situation ," Turysov said. "when evaluating polling arrangements, one should proceed from Kazakhstan's current realities. To ignore them is to take a prejudiced position beforehand." "Take, for example, voting on the state list. This procedure was laid down by the previous self-dissolved parliament and to ignore it would be a direct breach of the current legislation. "The same can be applied to polling taking place in some military units. Appropriate regulations for the guarding of state secrets make particularly secret defence facilities off limits to foreign observers. Polling there was personally monitored by members of district electoral commissionsm," Turysov said. Incidentally, many other foreign observers, who hold more realistic positions -- those from France, Russia, Turkmenistan, and a number of other countries -- are well aware of that. French Ambassador Bertrand Fessard de Foucault told the correspondents that he viewed arrangements for and the first results of the elections as an obvious success of young Kazakhstan democracy.
