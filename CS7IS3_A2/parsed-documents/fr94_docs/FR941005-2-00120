FR941005-2-00120 FR941005-2-00083 [Docket No. 50&hyph;333] Power Authority of the State of New York; Notice of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Commission) has issued Amendment No. 217 to Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;59 issued to Power Authority of the State of New York, which revised the Technical Specifications (TSs) for operation of the FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant located in Oswego County, New York. The amendment modifies the Safety/relief Valve (SRV) performance limits. Specifically, the requested changes: (1) Modify TS 2.2.1.B, and its associated Bases, to establish a single nominal SRV setpoint of 1110 psig; (2) modify TS 4.6.E, and its associated Bases, to increase the SRV setpoint tolerance to 3%; and (3) modify TSs 3.5.D, 3.6.E and 4.5.D, and their associated Bases, to allow for two SRVs (or automatic depressurization system (ADS) valves) to be inoperable during continuous power operation. In addition, the amendment clarifies terminology, corrects typographical errors, removes a surveillance requirement which should have been deleted as part of Amendment No. 130, and deletes a duplicate TS. Specifically, the requested changes; (1) Modify TS 1.2.1, and the Bases sections for TS 3.6.E and 4.6.E, to clarify terminology; (2) modify TS 3.5.D.2, and the Bases sections for TSs 1.2 and 2.2, to correct typographical errors; (3) modify TS 4.2.B, Table 4.2&hyph;2, to correct an error made in Amendment No. 130 that failed to delete the requirement to perform logic functional testing on the ADS bellows pressure switch; (4) modify TS 4.5.D.1.b, to move the TS to 4.6.E.4, a new section, and clarify the requirements associated with SRV manual actuation testing; (5) modify Bases sections for TSs 3.6.E and 4.6.E, to move the Bases for the SRV manual actuation testing to the applicable sections; and (6) modify TS 4.6.E.4, to delete a duplicate specification pertaining to the annual report of SRV failures. The application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was published in the Federal Register on May 15, 1990 (55 FR 20228) and on May 25, 1994 (59 FR 27064). No request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice. The Commission has prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) related to the action and has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement. Based upon the EA, the Commission has concluded that the issuance of this amendment will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.
