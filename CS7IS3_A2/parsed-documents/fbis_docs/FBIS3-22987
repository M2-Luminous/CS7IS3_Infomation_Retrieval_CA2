He was introduced to us as one of the commanders of the `Red Star' brigades that operate against the Israeli occupation. He promised us to speak plainly and with figures. The following conversation with him took place. Settlers Among Our Targets [AL-HURRIYAH] Yesterday an Egged bus belonging to settlers near Hebron; before it a group of settlers near al-Birah; before that Rabbi Druckman and the settler (Ephraim Ayyubi). Why have settlers now become a target of Red Star? [Commander H.M.] Druckman is a leader of the extremist settlers, a former Knesset member, and a founder of the pro-settlement Gush Emunim. The settlers near al-Birah were among those responsible for killing the Palestinian student Rami al-Ghazzawi from al-Birah. The Egged bus was the transportation link between the settlement of Qiryat Arba' and Beersheba. They all fit into one context. Whoever wants to chase the settlers from his land must fight them. The settlers will remain among our targets because they form the nucleus of colonial occupation and the reserve for military occupation. They run rampant as if they were masters of the land and we, their slaves, while the occupation army stands silent. They have mistreated our people, slain our sons, terrified our women and children, and attacked our property. They must leave this land at any cost. We have heard the whole world, with Yasir 'Arafat in its forefront, denounce the killing of the Israeli settler Hayyim Mizrahi and condemn the Fatah youths who carried out the heroic operation against the settler Mizrahi. This frightens no one, so much as it proves to us that we are on the right path. We don't think the occupation needs a pretext for repressing the people and throwing our sons into prison. We are in a state of war with the occupation. We don't think that laying down our arms will provide us with safety. Safety will be provided by the departure of the occupation and the settlers from our land. Big Collaborators, Small Collaborators [AL-HURRIYAH] Compared with others in the field of operations to liquidate collaborators, you have the smallest number. What is the reason? [Commander H.M.] The Red Star forces believe that every collaborator must meet his just desserts. They certainly are not lenient with collaborators, who harm many fighters and cause a large number of them to be killed by the soldiers of the occupation. Nevertheless, we in Red Star want to exercise care in dealing with collaborators and distinguish between "big heads" and "little heads." We think that punishing the big one is more useful than punishing the little one. Punishing big ones can serve as a lesson to the little ones. The little ones can be deterred by warning and by putting them under house arrest and surveillance. The big ones have passed the point of no return and must receive their punishment. We make a decision about a collaborator only after gathering a sufficient amount of information, documents, and even pictures that prove his guilt. [passage omitted] [AL-HURRIYAH] The media has carried sensational accounts of the way in which you carried out the resolution to execute [alleged collaborator] Ahmad 'Awdah. How was it done? [Commander H.M.] We wanted to use the same weapon with which 'Awdah used to threaten the members of our people. He always used to carry his pistol at his side. We commissioned two of our comrades, who watched him until the right moment came. They grabbed the pistol from him and opened fire on him. So we also won over the gun in the service of our work against the Israeli occupiers. Unfair, Unfounded Charges [AL-HURRIYAH] One force recently published a letter saying that you laid claim to operations that their fighters carried out, such as the operation against Rabbi Druckman, or the one against the settlers' car in al-Birah, or even the one against the customs bureau in Jerusalem. [Commander H.M.] First, I would remind you that we could have used the same method that this group used in distributing letters and issuing communiques about the double claims to certain military operations against the Israeli occupation and settlers' livestock. But we preferred to remain silent, knowing well that this kind of information war is not in the interest of the intifadah or of those who wish to oppose the occupation. Our interest, besides escalating our operations, is to work to mobilize forces and join ranks. Nevertheless, I can make a few quick observations. This group charges that we claimed responsibility for the operation that set fire to a customs office in the center of Jerusalem, whereas a unit belonging to that group carried it out. Unfortunately, the information is wrong. If it indicates anything, it indicates the truth of our position, our information, and our statements, and the falseness of the others' information and statements. On 23 October 1992, we announced our responsibility for setting fire to the customs warehouses, not a customs office, in the 'Atrot district in the heart of an industrial area in one of Jerusalem's suburbs, not in the center of Jerusalem proper, as the statement of this group says. Perhaps the person who drafted this statement, claiming to belong to the field of armed action, has no connection to armed action. I think my comrades in arms in the strike forces and armed groups are well aware and will agree with me that the operation against the Israeli customs warehouses was carried out only by Red Star's Martyr Ahmad al-Kilani group. As for the Burqin operation near Nablus, which, according to this communique, targeted an Israeli military vehicle, I wish the author of the communique would show me a statement issued by Red Star about the operation. We did not claim responsibility for the operation because we never carried it out. Regarding the operation against Rabbi Druckman, it was followed by the operation against settlers near al-Birah and the number 51 Egged bus operation near Hebron. The force that issued the communique claimed responsibility for the first two operations, but not for the bus. Military observers commented that the bus operation was implemented in the same manner as the Druckman and al-Birah operations. We do not want testimony from military observers. Although, thank God, we lost none of our comrades in all these operations to capture or martyrdom, we are always concerned that no one claim our struggles and sacrifices for himself. Two vivid examples come to mind. They provide sufficient proof. On 29 March 1984, DFLP [Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine] forces carried out a Land Day operation in the heart of Jerusalem. Although some heroic members of the group were captured or killed, one of the other groups claimed the operation for itself. Later it was forced to retract the claim because of irrefutable facts. That is one example. Another example is the operation that targeted the settler Hayyim Mizrahi. The other group claimed responsibility for it by notarized communiques, but we discovered afterward that those who had carried it out were a group of Fatah youths who rejected their leaders' decision to halt the intifadah. I think these two examples are sufficient, without citing operations by the heroes of Islamic Jihad's Sword of Islam group for which others claimed responsibility despite the death of martyrs who everyone knew belonged to Islamic Jihad.
