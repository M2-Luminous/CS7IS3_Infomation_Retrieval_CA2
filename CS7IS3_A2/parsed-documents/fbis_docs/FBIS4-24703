During the first four months this year, the value of industrial sales reached 115.9 billion yuan, an increase of 19.2 percent over the same period last year. The accumulated total volume of retail sales of consumer goods was 51.9 billion yuan, up 32.5 percent over the corresponding period last year. Under the stable situation of production and circulation, some problems that had arisen in economic operation have been mitigated. First, the margin of increase in investment in fixed assets has continued to be narrowed. Second, the bottleneck constraint has been lessened, as the rail freight volume and generated energy of the whole province have exceeded industrial growth in the corresponding period last year. Third, the financial situation has been basically normal. Fourth, the momentum of commodity price increases has been curtailed.
