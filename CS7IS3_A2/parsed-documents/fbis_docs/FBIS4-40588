First, he noted, what is involved here are steps to violate the nuclear weapons nonproliferation regime in a direct proximity to our borders, on the Korean Peninsula, where the situation is tense at times as it is. Therefore, the possibility of a nuclear state appearing in a zone of tension directly affects our security and interests. The second circumstance, in his words, is the fact that, apart from the DPRK, there is a "whole number of states that are on the threshold of adopting similar decisions aimed at acquiring nuclear weapons in one way or another." "If one state," the minister continued, "is allowed to embark on this road and follow it through from start to finish, in other words, if one begins by violating the monitoring regime, then leaves the treaty and acquires nuclear weapons, there is no way other states could be kept away from this." But the "most unpleasant" thing, he stressed, is that the potential possessors of nuclear weapons are in conflict zones, moreover, the overwhelming majority of them are situated in a direct proximity to the Russian or CIS borders. Therefore, Kozyrev said, "what is important for us is not only the Korean issue but the precedent itself, and we cannot allow it to happen." The international community has various means at its disposal with which to convince the DPRK to refrain from further hasty steps. First and foremost there are diplomatic contacts, which are now being exploited to the full, including those between Moscow and Pyongyang. The minister went on to recall Russia's proposal to convene an international conference on security and the nonnuclear status of the Korean Peninsula. "One of the most extreme methods for exerting influence in such cases is to impose international sanctions in accordance with a decision by the Security Council," Andrey Kozyrev said. "It is quite obvious that if the DPRK goes as far as wrecking the nonproliferation regime and providing itself with nuclear weapons, then the international community, we included, will have no other option than to use the extreme method, that is, to impose sanctions." Nevertheless, we believe that their introduction should be only gradual, the minister continued. "We should begin from the milder sanctions of a warning nature," Andrey Kozyrev said. "Considering the present circumstances, the Security Council should work in two directions: Preparing an international conference and, at the same time, defining the possible range of sanctions that may be applied if the DPRK fails to reconsider its policy."
