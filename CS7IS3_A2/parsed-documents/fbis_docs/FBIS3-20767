Other participants in the talks were Luigi Solari, Italian ambassador to Ljubljana; Minister Plenipotentiary Pietro Ercole; Marko Kosin, Slovene ambassador to Rome; and two department heads in the Slovene Foreign Ministry, Stefan Cigoj and Franc Miksa. They discussed the long-term foreign policy of both countries as a preliminary to Italy's more active support of Slovenia's inclusion in the European integration process, especially the Partnership for Peace and the European Union. It was also necessary to remove Italian suspicions that Slovenia leans too closely to central Europe, namely, to the Germanic world. Peterle mollified them, emphasizing the priority Slovenia places on its relations with Italy. The minority and the property claims issues were also on the agenda. It was agreed that a protocol on diplomatic and accelerated economic cooperation would be prepared shortly.
