The general slump in the country's industrial production and the impoverishment of enterprises that were unable to make prompt payments to gas producers could not but affect the gas industry. As of 1 November 1993, consumers owed the "Gazprom" Russian joint-stock company 1.5 trillion rubles. Aside from that, specialists attribute the decline in gas production in 1993 to the depletion of raw material reserves in a number of Russia's large fields that have been under development for a long time. This is what caused a decline in gas production, for example, in the Medvezhye gas field, Orenburg oil and gas condensate field, and other traditional gas-producing areas at the final stage of development. According to the preliminary data of gas industry specialists, Russian gas and oil enterprises produced a total of 617.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas (22.7 billion cubic meters less than in 1992). At the same time, gas enterprises that are part of the "Gazprom" Russian joint-stock company -- the largest gas producer in Russia -- produced 577.7 billion cubic meters, or 18.8 billion less than in 1992. Gas production declined in 1993 primarily owing to a slump in western Siberia, Russia's main gas producing region, where "Gazprom" enterprises produced an estimated 535.5 billion cubic meters, or 16.3 billion cubic meters less compared with 1992. According to those same sources, Russia increased natural gas exports to European countries in 1993 by 1.5 billion cubic meters and will raise this figure to 100.6 billion cubic meters. According to forecast estimates, gas enterprises will produce 634 billion cubic meters of natural gas in 1994, of which 116 billion cubic meters will be exported to West European countries.
