Wang Zhongyu said: Much of the current taxation system reform contents are entirely new. Some enterprises are unfamiliar with the specific contents and basic guidelines of the reform. Therefore, the first thing for them to do is earnestly study the fundamental guidelines of the taxation system reform and have a good grasp of its specific contents. Meanwhile, it is also necessary for the broad masses of staff and workers to understand the following points: -- The current taxation system reform will not increase enterprises' overall tax burdens. The reform has a direct impact on the interests of the vast number of enterprises, and their staff and workers. The program to reform the taxation system embodies the principle -- stressed repeatedly by leading comrades of the State Council -- of not increasing enterprises' overall tax burdens. According to a general survey of the Ministry of Finance, the average burden of turnover tax for industrial enterprises will remain basically unchanged before and after the reform. According to preliminary calculations of 282 industrial products across China, tax on 73, or 26 percent, of them will increase, while 209, or 74 percent, will decline. This shows the majority of industries and enterprises will not experience a tax hike as a result of the current taxation reform. Enterprises and products, however, vary in a thousand ways; and there used to be numerous tax categories and tax rates as well as diverse tax reductions, tax exemptions, and other preferential policies applicable to different enterprises and products. When a new and more standardized taxation system is introduced, we certainly cannot expect changes in individual enterprise's tax burdens to be uniform. But, the impact of tax increases in certain links can be eased through mutual readjustment. Take the circulation sector for example: According to the Ministry of Finance's general survey estimations, the tax burdens of wholesale enterprises will increase 0.44 percent, whereas retail enterprises' tax burdens will drop 2.5 percent. The increase in wholesale enterprises' tax burdens will be offset by the reduction in the tax burdens of retail enterprises and therefore, the reform will not trigger major fluctuations in the final retail prices directly borne by the consumer. Moreover, the reform will help further integrate production, wholesaling, and retailing operations. Macroeconomically speaking, because their turnover tax will not rise, retail enterprises should have no reason to increase their prices on account of the reform. All industrial and commercial enterprises should focus their attention on internal operations, take full advantage of the policies and measures for reducing enterprise's burdens that are already in force, improve management, and lower costs; on no account should they increase consumers' burdens by raising prices on their own under the pretext of taxation reform. -- To facilitate implementation of the tax reform program, the state has adopted policies aimed at reducing enterprises' tax burdens, including merging enterprise income taxes, reducing tax rates, and cutting the nominal income tax rate of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises from 55 to 33 percent. Regulatory tax for state-owned enterprises have been abolished and they are exempted from contributions to funds collected for construction of key energy and transport projects, and the state budget regulating fund (two funds in short), which alone account for 25 percent of enterprises' after-tax profits. Enterprises can now keep them for their own use instead of submitting them to the state treasury. Instead of submitting them to the state, exclusively state-owned enterprises can keep their after-tax profits for their own use for the time being. Two interim tax rates -- at 27 and 18 percent, respectively -- will apply to enterprises operating under thin profit margins in the next two years. All these and other measures are aimed reducing the tax burdens of enterprises. Enterprises must take full advantage of these policies to build up their capacity for sustained growth and enhance their competitiveness in the market. -- It is necessary to distinguish new loans from old ones and reduce enterprises' burdens to enhance their loan service capability. Today, many enterprises have worries about servicing their debt in the wake of taxation reform. Implementation of the measures for reducing enterprises' burdens should help increase their debt service capability. In consideration of the current status of enterprises, the state has decided to make a distinction between new and old loans, and introduce a new set of rules for new loans (rules for old loans will remain unchanged). Efficiently run enterprises may enhance their actual debt service capability by such measures as increasing depreciation deductions or incorporating interest on long-term loans into the production cost. As for enterprises with heavy debt burdens accumulated over the years, the state is formulating interim measures to solve the unreasonable debt burdens of these enterprises caused by external factors. Wang Zhongyu also outlined measures for ensuring smooth implementation of the new tax system: First, it is necessary to effect a changeover from the contract responsibility system to a uniform tax system. Today, 80 percent of our industrial enterprises practice the contract system of managerial responsibility -- a form of management created by the vast number of enterprises and workers in the course of implementing reforms -- that has been instrumental in mobilizing the initiative of enterprises and workers, and in developing the productive forces. The introduction of the new tax system will fundamentally change the foundation which the contract responsibility system depends on for existence, because value-added tax [VAT] -- which will become the biggest tax category when the tax reform and tax-sharing system are put into force -- will be shared by central and local authorities, and collected by the State Administration of Taxation under a unified plan. Therefore, it would be unrealistic to practice the contract responsibility system on a large scale. Moreover, after the two sets of rules [Rules for the Implementation of Interim Regulations on VAT; Rules for the Implementation of Interim Regulations on Business Tax] go into effect, the cost structure will undergo changes and lead to a sizable drop in profits on the books. Many enterprises will find that there are no profit quotas or any profit at all, that serve as a basis for a contract system of managerial responsibility. All this shows that a nonstandard relationship of distribution cannot meet the needs of a market economy. In the face of these circumstances, we must further broaden our perspective of reform; instead of being absorbed in readjusting the distribution relationship between the state and enterprises as the only solution, we must actively explore new ways to invigorate enterprises. We must work conscientiously and implement, on our own initiative, the transition from the contract responsibility system to a uniform tax system. Second, we should adopt flexible temporary measures in light of different conditions. Although regional preferential tax policies do not fully conform to the principle of equitable taxation, the abolition of regional preferential tax policies will affect the investment climate and impede further efforts to reform and open up because coastal regions are the windows on our country's reform and opening up. Bearing this prospect in mind, the state has adopted temporary measures. For instance, we may adopt temporary measures on refunding taxes within two years toward taxpayers who enjoy preferential state policies on taxation in the special economic zones and coastal areas. After the unified imposition of VAT on both domestically- and foreign-funded enterprises, we may adopt the method of returning the actual increases in taxes incurred by partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises at the end of each year or in annual installments, with a view to ensuring the stability and continuity of foreign-related tax policies. Additionally, the State Council will take temporary measures toward certain special enterprises which originally enjoyed tax reduction and exemption policies. These measures will facilitate the smooth transition from the old taxation system to a new one. Third, we should improve publicity efforts regarding our tax laws and regulations, and swiftly formulate and promulgate policies concerning the convergence of the old and new taxation systems, in an effort to give enterprises an idea of how things stand and banish unnecessary misunderstandings. Implementation of a new taxation system is an overall reform of the old system, as well as an important step toward the market economy. However, it entails the solution of many specific problems. For instance, the State Administration of Taxation has made specific provisions regarding next year's tax deductions for enterprises' stocks of raw and semifinished materials and finished products on which taxes have been levied this year. It has given full consideration to the actual conditions in enterprises. Enterprises' tax burdens will not be overly heavy or light. We have yet to formulate specific measures regarding the particular problems of special businesses. Wang Zhongyu also urged enterprises to adapt to the new situation quickly and compete fairly in the market. He pointed out: We should change the concept of state-owned enterprises that they are units covered by state budgets and directly subordinate to competent government departments, in favor of the new notion that they are independent "taxpayers" possessing the property rights of a legal person. Like other enterprises, state-owned enterprises should operate independently, assume responsibility for their own profits and losses, pay taxes according to law, and compete fairly in the market. We should change the state's traditional practice of assuming too much responsibility for state-owned enterprises in favor of the objective law of market competition based on the survival of the fittest, as well as the new concept that chronically deficit-ridden enterprises that cannot repay debts on schedule should be declared bankrupt according to law. This will heighten enterprises' sense of urgency and crisis in seeking survival and development during market competition, as well as change enterprises' notion of only demanding tax reductions and profit incentives from the state during the course of reform. Furthermore, we should earnestly implement the "two sets of rules," improve our work of evaluating assets and funds, and lay the foundation for enterprises' fair competition in the market. We should accelerate the readjustment of enterprises' product mix and organizational structure, transform state-owned enterprises' operating mechanisms, and actively but prudently promote a modern enterprise system.
