In the opinion of Foreign Economic Relations Minister Oleg Davydov, the "revolutionary breakthrough" in his sphere could cause more headaches than tangible progress today. Consistency and gradualness in the liberalization of Russia's foreign trade was defined in the Russian Federation Government's March memorandum on economic policy submitted to the IMF. To wit, as of 1 July it was planned to abolish quotas except for seven important items: oil, gas, electricity, diesel fuel, copper, aluminum, and nickel -- for these it was planned to retain quotas at least until the end of 1994. This memorandum was approved by the government. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations followed the memorandum, Minister O. Davydov said. In his opinion we were obviously getting ahead of ourselves with the edict. Because from its more than terse text it could be understood that we have already carried out a virtually 100 percent liberalization of exports. But is that the case today? A mechanism of currency control over exports, that is over the movement and receipt of profits, has not yet been created. And since that is so, arguments about the leakage of capital out of Russia will be justified. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, the Russian Federation State Customs Committee, and the banks must work out this mechanism by the end of the year. The application of quotas and licensing affect the export of energy carriers to the greatest extent. Quotas for gas can be repealed painlessly -- we have one monopolist, "Gazprom," in this field -- and the sale of gas is determined by the throughput capability of the gas pipeline and by demand. As for oil, Oleg Davydov believes that for the exporter the main thing has always been to be on schedule in pumping it through the oil pipeline. And whereas previously quotas were established in the government following the proposal of the Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, now the same quota allocation system will merely be moved to a greater extent into the pumping system. In general, the state does not have the right to abandon the tool of licensing, the minister asserts. After all, there are licenses for military equipment, dual-application technology, and so forth. So, without giving a detailed explanation of where they remain and where they do not, one cannot speak of repealing them. Transforming the authorization system for issuing licenses into an application system -- that is, easing it -- is another matter, but here the mechanism must be retained -- that is the position of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. The fact that exports must be expanded if there is no domestic demand is not doubted. That would be greatly promoted by a reduction of export duties, which are an anachronism. According to the above-mentioned memorandum, we undertook to reduce them by 38 percent in September. According to Davydov, this will provide a considerable incentive: The advantage to the producer will increase, many goods will become competitive, and our budget will grow more effectively from export profits. Another anachronism of ours is the institution of special exports, created by the specific nature of our development. But now, with the repeal of quotas and licenses, special exports cannot be abolished, at least until the end of the year. Otherwise, it will be impossible to control export and correspondingly the receipt of profits from export. The drafters of the president's edict had the correct strategic aim -- the liberalization of foreign trade -- but in this case they clearly leapfrogged natural and previously designated stages. That is the gist of the foreign economic relations ministers' comments. Nonetheless, the edict will be implemented by the usual means of supplementary documents. Of course, what has been said does not do away with some questions. The edict was not prepared without the government's participation, and before it was sent for the president to sign Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin signed the document. So the very fact that it has been criticized by a minister is quite out of the ordinary. Let us also add that in the opinion of some independent experts the edict's criticism by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations can be explained -- the department is defending its own interests connected with the possibility of giving or failing to give permission for the export of raw materials.
