The miners drop the "for" or "against" ballot sheets into the ballot boxes when they are collecting their wages. Preliminary data indicate that most of them support the strike. In other concerns (such as in Bytom, Gliwice, and Rybnik) negotiations are being held on wage issues and the heads of plant "Solidarity" ["S"] sections condition the organization of a similar referendum on their results. The strike readiness has so far been limited to placing banners around the plants. In this voivodship "S" has as many as 250,000 members; it also has 1,260 plant committees. The activists of other trade unions, such as "Solidarity '80" (approximately 35,000 members) and "Kontra" (30,000 members) have already announced strike readiness. Activists of the regional "S" are holding talks in the plants; they explain the core of the protest. It boils down to the following demands: Increasing the value of the real wages, introducing an efficient program of combating unemployment, and curbing the degradation of the Silesia-Dabrowa region. The Silesian "S" has put forward some more detailed demands: Fair distribution of the GDP, the statement that all Saturdays are constitutionally free, and a 40-hour workweek. Demand No. 9 mentions changes in the tax laws that would eliminate the excessive tax burdens that have been imposed on employees. In demand No. 10 the miners want the Treasury to "compensate the losses incurred by enterprises as a result of the blockade of payments for exported commodities and services"; in the 11th demand they suggest that legal acts be prepared which would make it possible for trade unions to take a stand on employees' affairs in commercial law partnerships. In the last one the miners demand that the demands of the branches, which have been submitted and agreed on, be implemented. The Silesian "S" is also asking the parliament to adopt this year's budget in a shape that would take into account the implementation of the demands put forward by the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union "S," especially the demands that aim to protect the poorest. Continuing is the protest in the Mining and Steel Work Plant in Bukowno; 78 miners are underground in the "Pomorzany" mine; on Tuesday [15 February] 46 miners went on a hunger strike. The protest began two weeks ago. In the meantime, union activists are holding talks on wages with the directors. In the Katowice Steel Works, which is surrounded by banners, the people are not thinking about a referendum yet; they are waiting for the next moves of the region. "The atmosphere is tense, they say in the Plant Committee of the steel works; however, it is not a matter of today only--the wages are low and this is the problem." The mines of the Bytom Coal Partnership are currently negotiating new wages with the directors, so they do not expect that a referendum will be held for the time being. Unless the negotiations fail to yield any results. The same is happening in the mines of the Gliwice and Rybnik partnerships; here the referendum may be carried out early next week. In the Jasrzebie partnership, where the strike has just been finished, "S" says: "We are working; one needs a rest after a strike; then we will think what should be done next."
