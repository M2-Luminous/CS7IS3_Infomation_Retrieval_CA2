Bloody confrontations in the streets of the West Bank and Gaza, says the paper, emphasize that the Israeli occupation is heading toward an end and that Israeli army foot patrols cannot roam the streets of Palestinian villages and cities forever. The paper says in its editorial today that if the Gaza-Jericho Agreement was considered a positive step toward disengaging the Israeli occupation forces and the Palestinian masses in the West Bank and Gaza, hopes have, or almost have, been dashed, thanks to the Hebron massacre, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's refusal to evacuate or disarm the settlers, and the Security Council's failure to clearly and unequivocally condemn the carnage. It would appear that correct beginnings do not lead to correct results in Israel's political and negotiatory lexicon, the paper says. It explains: The world considered the Madrid conference for Middle East peace to be the beginning of the end of the bitter conflict in the region within a framework of a just and lasting peace. But the horrible Hebron massacre threw all hopes into uncertainty. The paper believes peace is in Israel's interest. It says Israel, in return for Arab recognition, must work for mutual peace and security and show good intentions by offering realistic concessions commensurate with the importance of ending the Middle East conflict.
