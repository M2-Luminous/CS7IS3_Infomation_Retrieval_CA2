Among the evidence gathered, in late January we received indication of a possible shipment of 2,000 AK-47 rifles, which could be part of a larger shipment. In other words, this case is over four-months old. Upon receiving this information, the Secretariat of National Defense established the hypothesis that these arms could be smuggled to any state with high incidence of drug trafficking, or other crime problems. The Secretariat of National Defense alerted other Federal agencies, so they could take appropriate action to confirm the veracity of this report. The information was received at the official level, and it was handled in a confidential manner. Currently there is no evidence of an illegal shipment of weapons from abroad. The Secretariat of Government and the Attorney General's Office also conducted an investigation into this case, with negative results. All information on gun running is investigated in great detail, and in several cases -- like in this case -- investigations turn out negative.
