Even though by the second half of 1949 I was already acting as "underground messenger" for the director of Xinhua, I was still not officially within the organization. At the time, my principal task was youth work, where I was one of the leaders of the renowned leftist youth group, the After-school Social Club. The date of the official establishment of Xinhua was May 1, 1947, which means 1997 will be its 50th anniversary. While I was one of the earliest cadres at Xinhua, I do not deserve to be called one of the founders of the branch. The only founder still alive is the former head of the Foreign' Affairs Department, Tan Gan. Xinhua was the first public organization of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that was set up abroad. During the anti-Japanese war there was an Eighth Route Army administrative office in Hong Kong headed by Liao Chengzhi. But this organisation still used a business name. Xinhua was the first to use the name of the Communist Party. The decision to set up the branch was made by the (former premier) Zhou Eniai, the then secretary of the party's South China Bureau. After the war, Zhou led the party's negotiating team from Chongqing to Nanjing for talks with the Kuomintang. He decided to set up the branch in November 1946, just before leaving Nanjing to return to Yanan. When he left Nanjing, Zhou was already thinking that a significant portion of the undercover work in "white areas" (controlled by the KMT) in the struggle between the CCP and the KMT after the war would be shifted to Hong Kong. Hong Kong would become an important rear base for work in the KMT-controlled areas. A significant portion of the core leaders would also be shifted to Hong Kong. To meet with changes in work at the time, it was necessary to set up a public organization. After Zhou returned to Yanan, a significant portion of the work of the South China Bureau would be handed to the South China sub-bureau. Its headquarters would be set up in Hong Kong, headed by Fang Fang. When Zhou left Nanjing he was already thinking that the majority of democratic figures, as well as a considerable number of specialist personnel within the party, should remain outside of Yanan and other areas of conflict in order to preserve their power. He was also considering how to organize manpower and prepare skilled personnel for the upcoming struggle for political power. A significant majority of specialists within the party -- in particular those involved in international and cultural affairs, were sent to Hong Kong. A great portion of the outstanding figures of the democratic parties were also in Hong Kong at the time. Zhou Enlai decided that, apart from leaders of the Communist Party committee in Shanghai, most of the other party members in Shanghai, including Qiao Guanhua, Zhang Hanfu, and Pan Hannian, would move to Hong Kong. Qiao Guanhua would be the first director of Xinhua. At the time of its establishment, there were 15 staffs split into three groups. The first was the five members of the Hong Kong administrative office of the East River Column (a party organization in eastern Guangdong). The second group of five was in charge of the underground radio station run by the South China Bureau. The third was the five in the editorial office of the former CHENG PAO (a party paper in Hong Kong which folded after the party's Shanghai newspaper moved to the territory). At the time, there were two party organizations in Hong Kong -- the party and the city work committees. Responsibilities were divided between the two. The party committee handled above-ground work such as propaganda, united-front activities and policy research, while the city committee handled work among the masses. Party committee members were half-open about their identities, but city committee members were very secretive. Qiao Guanhua's official title was director of Xinhua, but his unofficial title was secretary of the party committee. After obtaining a doctorate in Germany, Qiao worked in Hong Kong during the war against Japan and then went to Chongqing to act as Zhou Enlai's political secretary. After liberation (1949), he remained in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and eventually became minister. Even though for a time when it was part of the underground party committee, Xinhua, it is most accurate to say, has always been a top-level post of the Chinese Communist Party. No matter what time or under what circumstances this has always been its identity and the most accurate description of its character and position. A "top-level post of the party" can be summed up briefly. First, it is one set up and controlled by the party. Second, it represents and holds responsibility for the party's work which falls within the scope of Hong Kong. Third, "top-level" means it is the party's top organization in the Hong Kong region. This is not to say Xinhua's internal identity has never changed. When Qiao Guanhua founded the branch, Xinhua was essentially the same as the party committee and he was the committee secretary. After liberation, there was a period of time when things were quite chaotic. The party committee was dissolved and its work transferred to the South China subbureau in Guangzhou, whose secretary was Ye Jianying, the second secretary Zhang Yunyi and the third secretary Fang Fang. The official title of Xinhua's second director, Huang Zuomei, was the representative of the South China subbureau in Hong Kong. In the beginning, Zhang Tiesheng had no public rank or title. Only when the Hong Kong government began issuing personal identity cards in 1950 did he take an official title -- editor-in-chief of Xinhua. I accompanied Huang and Zhang to collect their identity cards. Many people say that the editor-in-chief of Xinhua at the time was Li Chong, which is not correct. I think the only two people who know this now are Tan Gan and myself. After Zhang Tiesheng was transferred, Huang Zuomei was promoted to special representative. In 1952-53 the party committee for Hong Kong was reestablished in Guangzhou under the leadership of the South China sub-bureau and called the Hong Kong and Macau work committee of the CCP. Its first secretary was Qu Mengjue, then the party secretary of Guangdong province, and the second secretary was Wang Kuang. Many people do not understand why Liao Chengzhi sent Wang Kuang to take over as the director of Xinhua after the cultural revolution. They believe Wang only handled propaganda work. In fact, he had been handling Hong Kong work since the early 1950s. When Mao Zedong came in on an inspection tour of Guangdong province in 1956 and checked on the Hong Kong work, he made critical remarks to the effect that it had always been done in Hong Kong and there was no reason to move it to Guangzhou. He ordered the Hong Kong and Macao work committee transferred back to Hong Kong and sent Liang Weilin as third director of Xinhua. Liang had been one of the leaders of the East River Column. After it withdrew from the north, he was a politburo member of central Guangdong, becoming the party secretary in 1949. Before coming to Hong Kong he was the director of the Guangdong education bureau. He had worked for many years in Hong Kong. His public title was director of Xinhua, but his real position was secretary of the Hong Kong and Macao work committee of the CCP. The deputy secretary was Qi Feng. Only in 1990 was Hong Kong and Macao work separated. In the past, Macao work came under Hong Kong's leadership. The Macao branch of the New China News Agency was known internally as the Macao sub-committee and was under the leadership of Xinhua. Its secretary was a member of the Hong Kong and Macao work committee. As the time approached for the return of sovereignty of Macao and its work took on unique features, the work was split into two new committees, the Hong Kong work committee and the Macao work committee of the CCP.
