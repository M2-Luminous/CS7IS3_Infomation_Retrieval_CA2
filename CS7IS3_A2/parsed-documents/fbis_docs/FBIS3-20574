It will also have to straighten out the interrelationship between the internal and external grain systems under the market mechanism to make them more in keeping with the market operating mechanism, thereby improving the operating efficiency of the internal and external systems. The grain market stabilization system involves the interrelated roles and coordination of numerous stabilization factors. The application of a single factor will positively not attain the goal of market stabilization. These stabilization factors include: a floor price, a ceiling price, cushioning reserves, a stabilization fund, a futures market, exchange rates, and grain imports and exports. Setting of the Floor Price The level at which the floor price is set affects the transfer of benefits among the state treasury, the peasants, consumers, and dealers. If the floor price is set too low, though government expenditures may be reduced, and though grain dealers and consumers may also benefit somewhat, the peasants' interests will not be protected. If set too high, no benefit will accrue to grain dealers, consumers, and the industrial sector, and government expenditures will also increase. We believe the standard for setting the floor price should be 95 percent of the average market price for the previous five years, this amount serving as the floor price for the coming year. Setting of the Ceiling Price On the basis of the experience of developed market economy countries, stabilization of grain market fluctuations within 15 to 20 percent is deemed a very great success. How to set China's ceiling price will depend on transportation and marketing system expenses and profits following grain market deregulation. Inasmuch as China's treasury is short of funds today, setting the ceiling price at between 15 and 20 percent of the floor price will be rather difficult. Our view is a widening to between 20 and 25 percent. In addition, grain import and export prices must be taken into consideration in setting the ceiling and floor prices of grain. The floor price should not be lower than the grain export price, and the ceiling price should not be higher than the grain import price. Cushioning Reserves Cushioning reserves are an important tool in government grain market stabilization. In bumper harvest years when grain prices fall, in order to prevent a further slide in grain prices, the government should buy grain from the peasants at the previously formulated floor price to produce an upturn in the market grain price that protects the peasants interests. In lean years when grain prices rise above the ceiling price, the cushioning reserves may be used to buy grain to be dumped on the market to drive down market grain prices thereby protecting the consumers' interests. The cushioning reserve entails the use of a loading and unloading mechanism to maintain a floor price and a ceiling price that stabilizes market grain prices. The practice of developing countries shows this to be a stabilization method for which an extremely high price must be paid. During consecutive bumper harvest years followed by consecutive lean harvest years, in particular, it becomes extremely difficult to hold down to the lowest level the quantity of grain in storage and costs. Therefore, use of the cushioning reserve to stabilize markets must be applied flexibly in combination with the grain import-export mechanism. If very ample storage facilities are available, grain may be imported when the international price is relatively low rather than when a shortage occurs. When the world market price rises, grain may be exported. This can reduce the effect internally of world grain market price fluctuations. In addition, the profits earned by importing at low prices and exporting at high prices can be used to pay storage costs. A cushioning reserve does not necessarily entail losses. If sufficient difference is allowed between the floor price and the ceiling price, and management is effective, it is possible to pay for its entire cost. Stabilization Fund A stabilization fund is an important means that government can use to stabilize grain market prices. It provides financial support for stabilization of the system. The two main means of using a stabilization fund to stabilize grain markets that all countries employ are as follows: First is to apply it in combination with the cushioning reserve, and have it serve as financial support for the cushioning reserve. Its main function is to ensure that government has the funds to purchase the peasants' grain at the floor price. Its other functions are to provide peasants loans, to import grain, and for other government-approved purposes. Second is the use alone of the stabilization fund to stabilize the market. In a bumper harvest year when grain prices fall below the floor price, the stabilization fund is used to subsidize the peasants for the price difference. In a lean harvest year when grain prices exceed the ceiling price, grain producers contribute to the stabilization fund. The main source of money for the stabilization fund is state disbursement of public funds. A smaller amount comes from grain producer payments, and from the profits of grain dealers. Following deregulation of China's grain markets, the peasants' "three links" [the linking of parity price sales of fertilizer and diesel fuel to peasant fulfillment of grain production quotas] subsidy, the agricultural tax, and the six subsidies to grain enterprises may be lumped together in the grain stabilization fund for payment to the State Grain Reserve for use in purchasing cushioning reserve grain and for grain imports and exports. Founding of Futures Markets Investors futures trading plays an important role in the stabilization of market grain prices. During a bumper harvest year when supply is greater than demand and market prices fall, futures buyers can make large purchases of futures contracts, thereby increasing grain market demand. This produces a balancing trend between market grain supply and demand, which restrains a drop in the grain price. During lean harvest years when supply is less than demand and grain prices rise, futures contract sellers can dump large quantities of futures to cause an increase in market grain supply that eases the grain shortage and restraints a rise in grain prices. Therefore, by buying when grain prices fall and selling when grain prices rise, futures traders produce a trend toward balance in market supply and demand for grain to attain the goal of stabilizing grain market prices.
