The meeting was very positive. I explained what is happening in Yemen and assured him that we adhere to Yemen's unity. I conveyed a verbal message from his excellency's brother President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. Events in Yemen are a confrontation of an attempt at rebellion by a group or faction from the leadership of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] that failed to realize that it should have adhered to constitutional legitimacy. It tried to defy this legitimacy and violate law and order. It triggered fighting, which is about to end in a day or even sooner, God willing. Then things will return to normal. I believe that the news coming out of Aden is false. The fighting now is going on around Aden, which is almost besieged. We pay no attention to what is being said and will let the results on the ground speak for themselves. [Correspondent] Is your activity through diplomatic channels proof that the [words indistinct]? [Basindwah] Naturally we give special importance to all our brothers, particularly President Husni Mubarak, the leader of the biggest Arab country. We have an obligation to inform them of what is happening in our country. But our eagerness to keep them informed does not mean that we are not sure of our ability to settle the issue within hours or in less than a day or two. Are we required to hide things from our brothers? If this is the case, then it is a different story. Telling our brothers what is going on does not mean that we are uncertain of our ability to settle the issue or that we think the fighting will go on long. This is not true. [Correspondent] Do you suspect that some neighboring countries support the south? [Basindwah] We do not suspect the impartiality of the Arab countries or that they are eager not to interfere in Yemeni affairs. Such accusations against any neighboring and fraternal states are rejected. [Correspondent] Does the Yemeni Government still refuse any kind of mediation, be it Arab or otherwise? [Basindwah] Of course we agree to an end to the bloodshed, providing that those who have defied constitutional legitimacy and law and order abide by the unity of Yemen and its Constitution and subject the troops that remain under their control to the authority of the legitimate leadership that represents constitutional legitimacy in Yemen. We will allow no organization to run militias or to control part of the Yemeni Armed Forces. [Correspondent] Do you believe that war is the best way to maintain Yemen's unity? [Basindwah] We have never believed that war is the best way to safeguard Yemen's unity. But this war has been imposed upon us. The war was not triggered by us, as a legitimate authority in Yemen, but by those who have violated law and order and constitutional legitimacy. Our consolation in confronting those outlaws who imposed a fight on us is God's saying: "Fighting is prescribed for you, ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing that is good for you, and that ye love a thing that is bad for you. But God knoweth and ye know not." [Koranic verse] [Correspondent] [words indistinct] non-Yemeni elements involved in the fighting. Is this true? [Basindwah] These are sheer lies and fabrication. The YSP leadership previously claimed that it captured a large group from the al-Jihad Organization in Abyan. When we ordered Aden Governor Salih Munassar to hand over these Egyptian elements from the al-Jihad Organization to the Egyptian consul in Aden, he refused to hand any over, perhaps because he had none in the first place. I tell the brothers in the YSP leadership to hand over to the Egyptian authorities any Egyptian group from the al-Jihad Organization that they may have. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] [Basindwah] This is not true. You may come and see the positions for yourselves. This is an attempt to turn the Arab states against us. These are lies and fabrication. We do not need to use Iraqis, Sudanese, or others. We are absolutely not short of men. [Correspondent] To save the homeland could you.... [Basindwah, interrupting] This is nonsense. Things have already been settled and are now in the final phase. [Correspondent] Is President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih willing to negotiate with the YSP leadership? [Basindwah] I believe that the elements in the YSP leadership who are responsible for triggering the rebellion and the war must give themselves up. They will be guaranteed a fair trial. Thank you.
