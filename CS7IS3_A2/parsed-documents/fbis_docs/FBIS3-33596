The United States is threatening to impose trade sanctions on Brazil if measures designed to protect industrial property are not approved by 28 February. The Brazilian Government is seeking to avert U.S. retaliatory measures by proposing amendments to the draft patent law, which has been sitting in the Senate for eight months. Alvares is scheduled to talk tomorrow with Senator Beni Veras (Brazilian Social Democracy Party -- Ceara State), who was confirmed yesterday as rapporteur of the draft law at the Senate Economic Affairs Committee, to persuade him about the need to introduce changes to the draft approved by the Chamber of Deputies in June 1993.
