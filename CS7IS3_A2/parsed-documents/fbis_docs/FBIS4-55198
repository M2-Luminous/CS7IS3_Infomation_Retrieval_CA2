It states that shortcomings in legislation pertaining to Slovak Radio, particularly the lack of clarity regarding its financing and economic management; relations with the state and the term "public corporation"; violations of the Law on the State Budget; the suspension of financing of Slovak Radio in 1993; as well as internal problems are driving Slovak Radio toward collapse in terms of economy, personnel, and programming. Despite the limitation of Slovak Radio broadcasts from three to two stations, the institution is short of 8 million korunas a month to meet the obligations that Law No. 255 of 1991 imposes on Slovak Radio. Owing to economic pressures, Slovak Radio abolished in 1993 125 permanent editorial posts and other creative workers. The other employees are working with feelings of hopelessness and apathy because their pay for the work that they do is inadequate. "As these problems are so bad as to be a threat to media freedom in Slovak Radio, we are asking the National Council of the Slovak Republic and the Government of the Slovak Republic to take effective measures to establish the conditions for calm, good, and competent work for the benefit of the listener."
