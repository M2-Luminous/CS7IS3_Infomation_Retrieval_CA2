The 5 April session was closed at noon on the same day following the conflict of views among some Assembly members concerning the use of some words in the agenda. These members argued that it was inappropriate to use those words. Finally, the session withdrew some of the items from its agenda, and the meeting was closed. Some public opinions have criticized the 5 April session as futile. At the upcoming 25 April session, it is expected that there will be five items on the agenda. The first item is the election of new people's representatives; the second, the discussion and adoption of bills and proposed laws concerning the Supreme Council of Judges; the third, the discussion and adoption of the 1994-95 socio-economic plan; the fourth, the setting up of a special commission to provide advice and to improve the National Assembly's internal regulations; and the fifth, the discussion and adoption of a draft on the structure of the National Assembly's secretariat. However, the same sources have affirmed that the agenda could be altered by the time the session is convened because some other important issues are being considered for inclusion in the agenda by the National Assembly. A high-ranking official in the National Assembly has disclosed that the Khmer Rouge issue may be also be put on the agenda of this session so that the entire National Assembly can discuss and decide whether to outlaw the Khmer Rouge or not. It is expected that apart from the election of new people's representatives, the Khmer Rouge issue could be an important item for this session. However, sources at the National Assembly office have not been absolutely clear about the inclusion of the Khmer Rouge issue into the agenda. This session will elect 19 new people's representatives, including 13 from FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and six from the Cambodian People's Party. These new people's representatives will replace the 19 who are carrying out public functions that are incompatible with the role of people's representatives. This issue was deadlocked at the 5 April session over a question of wording. It was remembered at that session that the National Assembly's Standing Committee used the words "invalidity of people's representative status." These words were criticized by some Assembly members as inappropriate for outgoing Assembly members. At this coming session, the wording is "election of new people's representatives." A National Assembly official expresses his optimism that the election of new people's representatives at this session could be done and not deadlocked as in the previous meeting; the only thing that is not yet known for certain is how the Assembly will do this and through which method, whether to do this individually or collectively.
