He said the soldiers tried to take the weapons Tuesday in Krivoglavci, northwest of Sarajevo, and withdrew after receiving orders from their command post in Lukavica which had been contacted by the UNPROFOR. The weapons were placed under UN control following a February accord between Bosnian Serbs and Moslems on an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from around the capital Sarajevo. The agreement was prompted by a NATO ultimatum to Serb and Moslem units to remove artillery pieces to sites outside a 20-kilometre (12-mile) radius or face air strikes. Annink said that following the recent NATO air raids against Serbian position in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, Serb troops have placed mines around three of the weapons collection sites thus blocking the UN personnel guarding the sites. He added that the UNPROFOR is also unaware of the whereabouts of a UN military observer and his Serb interpreter who disappeared two days ago after leaving the Moslem enclave of Zepa. He said attempts to get information about the pair from Bosnian Serb authorities have been unsuccessful. Annink said that 58 other UN military observers have been blocked in Serb-held territory since the NATO raids Sunday and Monday. He said some of the observers are considered hostages while others have been allowed limited freedom of movement. They include observers based in Lukavica, near Sarajevo.
