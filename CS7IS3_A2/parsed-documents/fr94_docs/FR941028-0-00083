FR941028-0-00083 FR941028-0-00009 In paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of final §773.25, ``responsibility'' has replaced the word ``authority'' contained in the proposed rule. The reasoning provided with respect to the changes made to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of the final rule is applicable here. Again, the regulatory authority will be making decisions ``with respect to the ownership or control relationships of the permit, ``rather than with respect to the ownership or control of the permittee,'' as provided in the proposed rule. This reflects that regulatory authority's primary responsibility for the permit which it has issued. Paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of final §773.25 provides that the State regulatory authority that issued a State violation notice has responsibility for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships of the violation. The State regulatory authority issuing the violation is in the best position to be aware, in the first instance, of operative facts which identify those owners or controllers who have the ``authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which the relevant surface coal mining operation is conducted'' and who can thus cause the abatement of the violation. See 30 CFR 773.5(b). As in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of final §773.25, ``responsibility'' has replaced the word ``authority'' contained in the proposed rule. The reasoning provided with respect to these changes in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of the final rule is applicable here. Again, the regulatory authority will be making decisions ``with respect to the ownership or control relationships of the violation,'' rather than ``with respect to the ownership or control of any person cited in such notice [of violation],'' as provided in the proposed rule. Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of the final §773.25 provides that the regulatory authority that issued a violation notice, whether State or Federal, would have responsibility for making decisions concerning the status of the violation covered by the notice. As in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of the final rule, ``responsibility'' has replaced the word ``authority'' previously contained in the proposed rule. The reasoning provided with respect to the similar change in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this final rule is applicable here. As in the proposed rule, the ``status'' of the violation means whether the violation remains outstanding, has been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). This approach is consistent with the provisions of section 510(c) of SMCRA which require that a regulatory authority considering a permit application look to the ``agency that has jurisdiction over such violation'' to determine whether a violation ``has been or is in the process of being corrected.'' Paragraph (b)(2) of final §773.25 provides that OSM has responsibility for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships of a Federal violation notice. As in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of final §773.25, ``responsibility'' has replaced the word ``authority'' contained in the proposed rule. The reasoning provided with respect to this change in paragraph (b)(1)(i) is applicable here. Paragraph (b)(2) of final §773.25 is essentially a Federal counterpart to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) and the same basic rationale applies here, as well. This provision differs from (b)(1)(iii), however, in that OSM's authority to decide the ownership and control relationships of a Federal violation notice is not initial responsibility as the State's responsibility is in (b)(1)(iii). Instead, OSM's responsibility is final.This difference recognizes that State regulatory authorities are subject to oversight by OSM. OSM is not subject to similar oversight by the States. Under the allocation principles set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of final §773.25, a regulatory authority deciding whether a permit application should be granted or whether a permit has been improvidently issued determines for itself the ownership or control relationships of the application or permit, but it defers to the regulatory authority that issued a violation notice for a determination of the ownership or control relationships of the violation. The application is then denied or the permit subject to treatment under the regulations governing improvident issuance if any owner or controller of the applicant or permittee is also an owner or controller of a violator, as determined by the respective regulatory authorities. Paragraph (b)(3)(i) of final §773.25 provides that with respect to information shown on AVS, the responsibility of State regulatory authorities to make decisions concerning ownership or control links will be subject to the plenary authority of OSM. This represents a change from the comparable provision of the proposed rule which provided that the authority of regulatory authorities to make ownership or control decisions with respect to applicants, permittees, and persons cited in violation notices and decisions with respect to the status of violations would be subject to OSM's review as an element of State program oversight under parts 733, 842, and 843. The rationale for this change is simply that OSM is ultimately responsible for the maintenance and content of the AVS with respect to ownership or control information. OSM believes that the quality of ownership or control information is the core of AVS. OSM must closely monitor such information to maintain the accuracy of such information and the integrity of AVS. The need to protect the integrity of the AVS dictates that OSM have the ability to review the underlying basis supporting any ownership or control link shown on the system and to change information with respect to any ownership or control link or all such links, if necessary. Accordingly, the final rule provides that OSM's authority will be plenary with respect to ownership or control information shown on AVS. Thus, once ownership or control information is entered into AVS, OSM will assume control of such data. If OSM reviews such information and concludes that it is incorrect, OSM will act to correct such ownership or control information and incorporate such corrected information into AVS. OSM intends to coordinate any such changes with the regulatory authority responsible for initial entry of the data in question.
