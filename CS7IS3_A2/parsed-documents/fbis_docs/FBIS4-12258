[Al-Ghuwayl] The accusations are based on four pieces of evidence against the suspects: 1. The fact that 'Abd-al-Basit al-Miqrahi [one of the suspects] was in Malta on 7 December. He bought things from some shop and the shop owner testified to the purchase. 2. Al-Amin Fuhaymah's [second suspect] private diary. 3. The timers, the story of which came to light with the fall of East Germany. It was discovered that the timers were also sold to East Germany. 4. The story of the suitcase shipped from Malta. But this piece of evidence was automatically dropped. Even an FBI report sent from Frankfurt to its headquarters in the United States recommended that this piece of evidence be dropped because shipping an unaccompanied suitcase from a country to another cannot be done without sending a cable with it and taking specific administrative measures. The cable is not there and no measures were taken; it would be difficult to fabricate this because a long time passed before the indictment was issued. If some "suitcases" passed, they must have entered from Frankfurt airport without going through the detection machine. This casts much doubt on those who carried out this operation. The suitcases were American-made. There is also a stunning thing that we will reveal soon; it will deal a crushing blow to the accusations against the Libyans. [Rumayh] What is that? [Al-Ghuwayl] On 30 December 1988, CIA agents visited Mr. Polier [name as published], owner of the factory producing the timers used in the bombing crime. They sought to wrest a confession from him that he sold the timers only to Libya although the piece of the timer had not yet been discovered in the plane's wreckage. More surprisingly, this timer piece, over which Libya was accused, was not found by the Scottish police but by American FBI agents in Scotland! This indicates that the accusation against Libya was deliberate and prearranged. More seriously, the CIA asked the aforementioned person to say that he personally went to Malta on 20 December -- a few days before the incident -- to install the timers on the explosives on behalf of the Libyans. Under pressure, he wrote them something to that effect. However, circumstances did not serve them; at that specific time the same person was already booked on another flight to a different airport. They, therefore, did not use the piece of paper he wrote for them. Regarding the testimony of the Maltese vendor who claimed that things were bought from him, it is invalid. His testimony against the suspects said that the purchase was made on a rainy day and that there was a football match between Italy and Germany on that day. We checked the weather bulletin but found that it was not raining that day. We also checked the dates of matches but did not find any match on that day. The match to which the witness referred was played on 23 November 1988, several months before that date. There remains the story of Fuhaymah's diary. These are the papers taken from his diary. There is nothing in them. All that happened is that the accusers of al-Amin Fuhaymah joined some lines together and read them as they wanted. This is the paper, please read it! "'Abd-al-Basit coming from Zurich with Salvo. Take the tanks." What is this? Various points on various topics and impressions. They put them together and made accusations out of them according to their whims. [Rumayh] From your own point of view, how could this problem be solved? [Al-Ghuwayl] This is a media effort. I believe that even among the Arabs there are those who believe that Libya is involved. The fact is that whoever carefully reads the accusations and the answers to them and whoever is versed in the legal precedents, even those in the United States, on the acceptance of holding trials in foreign countries without insisting on demanding an extradition -- whoever carefully reads this will discover that all these accusations are fabricated. We are now in the process of preparing booklets to explain these matters from all the angles. We will distribute these booklets to the public, intellectuals, decisionmaking centers, and even the Arab leaders themselves. [Rumayh] Time is in favor of which side? [Al-Ghuwayl] So far it is in their favor. Nevertheless, certain things happened recently that refuted many of the false accusations. Following the downfall of East Germany and during the trial of intelligence officers, it was proved that the "timers" used in the bombings were also delivered to East Germany. It is not true that they were only delivered to Libya. [Rumayh] Are the two suspects leading a normal life? [Al-Ghuwayl] They are not leading a normal life. As is known, they are confined to their houses. According to the Montreal treaty, the authorities guarantee their presence so that they can be brought in at any time. We have not asked for changing this treatment so that the option of their trial in Libya will also remain open.
