A very important event has taken place in his first public act: the Jewish-Palestine community has greeted him, which is a sign of new times. Peres praised Colombian democracy and said things are being corrected in Colombia through elections and that it is a privilege for him to arrive just when Colombia is voting. He also said Jerusalem will continue to be Israel's capital, but that Jerusalem will not be divided as Berlin was after World War II. Peres said he believes more in deeds than words regarding Palestinian leader Arafat's unfortunate remarks to the effect there would be a jihad or sacred war to liberate Palestine. Here is Shim'on Peres: [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Do you believe that results will allow your [as heard] country to continue to make great economic strides? [Peres, in English with passage-by-passage translation into Spanish] All of Latin America is undergoing great changes and is making important changes to the world outlook. Colombia, as one of the four great countries in Latin America, will play an important role. It is a great pleasure for me to have the opportunity to improve relations between Colombia and Israel.
