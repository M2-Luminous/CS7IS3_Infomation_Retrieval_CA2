The provincial leaders sincerely talked with well- known specialists, scholars, and artists of the province's theoretical, press and publication, and artistic circles. They jointly bid farewell to the outgoing year and welcomed the arrival of the new year. Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, first extended earlier new year greetings to the participants. They also pointed out in his speech: The propaganda, ideological, and cultural fronts across the province should firmly grasp the fundamental guiding principle of the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, submit themselves to and serve the overall situation of building an economically powerful province, go deep to the reality and the grass roots, strive to cultivate a large number of specialists of various categories, and enliven the province's undertakings theory, press, publications, culture, and artistic undertakings. The specialists, scholars, and artists talked freely at the forum. In line with their actual conditions, all departments reviewed the fruitful achievements in carrying out the propaganda and ideological work and building the spiritual civilization made over the past year. Simultaneously, they set forth many good opinions and suggestions on further achieving the work of the propaganda and cultural departments in the new year. After hearing their opinions, Cheng Weigao set several demands and expectations on the specialists, scholars, and artists participating in the forum. First, they should further strengthen the study of the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and ceaselessly upgrade their ideological and political level. Comrades on the propaganda, ideological, and cultural fronts should pay particular attention to and conscientiously study the third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and comprehensively and deeply understand the basic guidelines of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's series of important statements. Simultaneously, they should study the speeches made by the central leading comrades at the national propaganda and ideological work conference, persistently arm their brains with the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and upgrade their political and ideological level. Only then will their research and creative findings accurately embody the line, principles, and policies of the party, be more instructive, and be permeated with the significance of the times; and really ensure that the people are armed with scientific theories, guided with accurate media, portrayed with lofty spirits, and mobilized with outstanding works. Second, they should carry out a good style of study characterized by linking theory with practice and further enhance the awareness of serving the economic construction, reform, opening up, and the socialist market economy. Relying on deepening reform is the key to achieving the propaganda, ideological, and cultural work. Comrades should attach importance to going deep to reality and positively dedicate themselves to the great practice in which the masses engage themselves in the development of socialist modernization in an effort to find a new situation, study new problems, sum up new experiences, and answer new questions. We should create excellent, healthy, solemn, elegant works which the broad masses of the people are fond of, that conform to the spirits of the times, and that are conducive to mobilizing the masses to engage in reform, opening up, and socialist modernization so as to enrich the people's cultural life, inspire their fighting will, mobilize their enthusiasm, and provide powerful spiritual motivation for building an economically powerful province. Third, they should enthusiastically cultivate skilled persons and have increasingly more people become worthy and capable persons. In a sense, promoting and cultivating a large number of young skilled persons in a rapid manner and having them make achievements and contributions soon has more far-reaching significance than direct achievements of veteran comrades. We can believe that if we show more concern for and make more efforts to cultivate the younger generation, the propaganda and cultural workers contingents will have a well-balanced lineup, become more powerful, and have grand momentum. Fourth, they should provide more constructive opinions and suggest ways and means to build an economically powerful province. The specialists, scholars, and artists present at the forum are our comrades as well as our friends. I hope that you will provide more opinions, criticisms, and suggestions on the work of the provincial party committee and the provincial government, the propaganda and ideological work, and the spiritual civilization. So long as you provide more good opinions and think out more good methods we will be able to pool the wisdom of the masses, choose and follow what is good, make more democratic and scientific policy decisions, and ensure that predetermined progress is made. Cheng Weigao also stressed: Party committees and governments at various levels should strengthen leadership over the propaganda, ideological, and cultural work. According to the guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work conference, we should conscientiously persist in the principle of "taking a two-handed approach and being sure that both hands are tough;" focus our efforts on achieving work in the theoretical, media, ideological and educational, and main melody spheres; provide more assistance; come up with more topics; set forth more demands; and comprehensively achieve the propaganda and ideological work. As for the specialists, scholars, and artists on the propaganda and cultural fronts, we should politically show more concern for them, provide them with more assistance in their work, and take more care of their livelihood so as to have them bring their functions into play in the course of building an economically powerful province. Han Licheng, standing committee member of the provincial party committee and director of the propaganda department, chaired the forum. He urged that the all departments and bureaus under the provincial-level propaganda front to conscientiously study and implement the guidelines of the speeches made by Comrade Jiang Zemin and Comrade Li Peng at the national propaganda and ideological work conference as well as the guidelines of Comrade Cheng Weigao's speech made today, grasp strong items, create first-grade achievements, and elevate the province's propaganda and ideological work to a new height. Simultaneously, party committees at various levels and leaders of all departments should pay attention to caring for, respecting, cherishing, and treasuring the specialists on the propaganda front; make friends with experts; establish close contacts with them; show concern for their thinking, work, and livelihood; conscientiously listen to their opinions and suggestions; sincerely help them solve their working and living problems; and create a good, relaxed, and favorable environment for bringing their wisdom and intelligence into full play.
