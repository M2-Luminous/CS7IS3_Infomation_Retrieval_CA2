FR940418-2-00123 FR940418-2-00072 II. Discussion The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act and particularly with Section 17A of the Act. 22 Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act 23 requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to assure the safeguarding of funds in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible. 22 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). 23 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(F) (1988). The Commission believes that the effective functioning of the OCC valued securities program and OCC's various financial safeguards and risk monitoring systems, 24 taken as a whole, suggest that an increase in the valuation rate for securities deposited as clearing margin should not detract from OCC's ability to safeguard securities and funds for which it is responsible. Increasing the valuation rate also should help reduce OCC's reliance on letters of credit as margin collateral. 25 24 As discussed above, numerous financial safeguards and risk reduction systems already employed by OCC will continue to be used by OCC under this proposal. Among others, these include: (1) The valued securities program eligibility standards for stock and corporate debt; (2) The valued securities program concentration ratio, which limits the amount of stock of any one issuer that can be held in an account to 10% of the margin requirement for the account; (3) OCC's ability to monitor adequately the value of margin deposits on a daily basis; (4) The Theoretical Intermarket Margining System (``TIMS''), which employs option price theory to identify and measure market risk and to calculate margin requirements; (5) The Concentration Monitoring System, which enables OCC to analyze and address risks resulting from concentrated, undiversified options portfolios; and (6) The Risk Management System, which generally allows OCC to evaluate the risks associated with the entire stock, options, and futures portfolios held by its clearing members. 25 The financial reliability of these credit agreements depends on the creditworthiness of their issuers, and a clearing agency holding letters of credit as clearing margin may be exposed to risk in event of an issuer default or insolvency. Also, payment on letters of credit can be subject to delay, depending on the terms of the letter of credit and the timing of the default. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30883 (July 1, 1992), 57 FR 30521 [File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;92&hyph;05] (order approving limitations on letter of credit clearing fund contributions). The Commission also finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing of the amendment. Because the comment letters the Commission received to OCC's proposal as originally filed were in favor of increasing the valuation rate from 50% to 70% for equity and corporate debt issues deposited for clearing margin, the Commission does not foresee receiving any adverse comment letters with regard to the March 9, 1994, amendment which amended the filing to increase the valuation rate from 50% to 60%. III. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of OCC. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;92&hyph;13 and should be submitted by May 9, 1994. IV. Conclusion For the reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that the amended proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act, particularly with those of section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 26 that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;92&hyph;13) be, and hereby is, approved. 26 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 27 27 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
