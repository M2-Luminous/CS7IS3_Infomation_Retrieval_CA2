Reacting to Wednesday's budget, COSATU said in a statement the emphasis on fiscal discipline was one-sided. "Fiscal discipline had been repeatedly raised as a virtue in itself, without the assurances that this would not be done at the expense of economic development or social justice," the statement said. COSATU welcomed "without reservation" the five per cent transition levy saying it was "the first truly progressive taxation measure" which contributed to the aim of the Reconstruction and Development Programme. On military spending, COSATU said it was difficult to accept that defence spending should increase from R9.3 billion [rand] to R10.6 billion in a reconstruction and development budget. "While we understand that certain costs have been incurred by the process of integration, a democratic South Africa which is at peace with the world cannot justify spending such huge sums on the military, including R1.5 billion on fighter aircraft. "We are further alarmed to see that vast sums are being spent on para-military expenditure for the police. In a period when the emphasis should be shifting to community policing it is difficult to understand why half a billion rand has been allocated to buying armoured vehicles for the police." COSATU added it supported the call for an urgent defence review, involving all sectors of society, to be completed before next year's budget.
