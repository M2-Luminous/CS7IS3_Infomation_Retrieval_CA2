The congressional report also observed that the ROK is concerned with the possibility of being estranged from active diplomacy and of suffering a blow therefrom. Thus, the ROK is opposed to comprehensive negotiations between the United States and North Korea unless the North Korean side responds to North-South dialogue. The U.S. Congressional report also noted that differences have been revealed in the method of dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue between the United States and the ROK, and such differences worked as a stumbling block in the United States' formulation of its policy toward the North Korean nuclear issue. The report said that unlike the assurance of the governments of the ROK and the United States on the satisfactory cooperative system maintained between the two countries, they failed to attain practical cooperation. The ROK asked the United States to "resolutely but tenderly deal with" North Korea so that it does not get angry, thus making an inconsistent and contradictory demand. As a result, the United States suffered a blow in understanding the true intention of the ROK side. THE NEW YORK TIMES wrote that the ROK is attempting to cautiously approach the North Korean nuclear issue on the precondition that a war against North Korea must be avoided while the United States regards it necessary to approach the North Korean nuclear issue firmly and in a decisive manner based on firm unity between the ROK and the United States. The WALL STREET JOURNAL on 7 March also pointed out that because of the inconsistent, double-dealing, hardline and moderate nature of countermeasures by the ROK government and of anti-U.S. sentiment, confusion has been caused to the U.S. policy on the North Korean nuclear issue. It was learned on 11 March that the attitude of the ROK Government, which is running about in confusion, was seriously discussed during a closed-door session of the hearing in the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee on 2 March. Gordon Sullivan, U.S. Army chief of staff; Barry R. McCaffrey, commander of the U.S. Southern Command; Charles Larson, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet; Gary Luck, commander of U.S. Forces Korea; and the vice chief of naval operations, attended the hearing. After a public session, the senators held a closed-door meeting and raised the issue on the new assessment of relations between the two countries from the standpoint of ROK-U.S. military cooperation. General Luck stated in the hearing that the United States is fully ready to deploy Patriot missiles for the U.S. Forces in the ROK at any time but that the decision for the deployment was still pending because the ROK Government was worried that the deployment of Patriot missiles might provoke North Korea. U.S. Senator Richard Lugar who was in the ROK with Senator Sam Nunn in mid-January said on his return from the trip that the ROK people's view of North Korea has changed capaciously compared with that in the past. He added, "We noted that the ROK might have altered its military objective in such a way as to take into consideration a broader political situation than the problem of North Korea." He called attention to the fact that the United States has made cautious efforts to reestablish its cooperative security relations with the ROK. The United States, particularly the U.S. Congress, has had doubt about the feasibility of the appeasement policy toward North Korea. Some said that North Korea may already have a nuclear bomb, and the plan for the deployment of Patriot missiles and offensive Apache helicopters in the ROK was materialized. A U.S. national intelligence assistance team was recently deployed to the ROK, and a plan was announced that an aircraft carrier would be deployed on the sea near the ROK. These moves show the U.S. mood that it cannot accede indefinitely to the ROK insistence that the ROK and the United States endeavor for peaceful settlement through dialogue to the end rather than resorting to a hasty stick. Some Washington military critics criticized the ROK position, saying that the United States has had its self-respect hurt much in its tug-of-war with North Korea over the nuclear issue and that the ineffective policies put forth by the ROK policymakers elated North Korea so much that they led the North Korean nuclear issue to the war of pride between the United States and North Korea. Some U.S. circles came to think that while the United States and North Korea were dealing with the critical issue with the tough stance of not hesitating to use sanctions and taking military countermeasures, the ROK took an indecisive attitude without concrete logic between the United States and North Korea. This may be one of the reasons why in some circles in the United States, such as the U.S. Congress, ROK-U.S. military cooperation became an issue for discussion.
