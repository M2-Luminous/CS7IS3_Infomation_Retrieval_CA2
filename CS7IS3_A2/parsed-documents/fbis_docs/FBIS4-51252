In an open letter to China's National People's Congress [NPC] seen by KYODO NEWS SERVICE Thursday [26 May], seven dissidents said the movement cannot be forgotten because "we firmly believe that the movement had an inestimable effect on pushing history forward." Wang was seen leaving Beijing on Tuesday with what is believed to have been an official or police escort, a friend of his said. The letter openly calls on the National People's Congress, "the nation's most powerful organ," to act on three demands concerning the government's evaluation of the 1989 political protests. The first demand called for reevaluation of the protests as a predominantly student-led, mass patriotic movement and asks that the movement's principles of "peace, reason and nonviolence" be recognized by the government. "We believe that the government's determination of the event as `turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion' is unfair and should be reappraised at an early date," it said. The second demand calls for the freeing of "all those arrested in connection with the `June 4' incident." Finally the letter calls for "comfort and compensation to the bereaved families who lost family members because of `June 4"' and the promise to aid those released from jail who have problems reentering society. Five years ago on June 3-4, 1989, the People's Liberation Army, under government orders, marched on the citizens of Beijing who had come out in support of student protests calling for greater democracy and an end to official corruption. The government has yet to officially release the numbers of soldiers and citizens killed, or their names, during the period of military intervention. Estimates range from the hundreds to tens of thousands as tanks, supported by ground troops, rolled over and shot at unarmed citizens as they moved towards Tiananmen Square in the city center. The letter was signed by four former student leaders who were once on the list of "21 most-wanted students" and three others, including Li Hai, a signatory of the "peace charter" group of labor dissidents. "Like the government, we hope for a stable social environment. To solve the `June 4' problem and untie the `knot' in the hearts of the people is not only beneficial to appeasing social contradictions...but will also encourage social stability," it said.
