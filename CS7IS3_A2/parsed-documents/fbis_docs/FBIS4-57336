Perez Balladares on Monday attended a news conference held by Solidarity Party members and headed by party president Samuel Lewis Galindo during which the party publicly announced its decision to support the proposed national consensus in view of the wise steps being taken by Dr. Perez Balladares. [Begin recording] [Lewis] We met with the party board of directors and with our candidates -- pardon me -- with our legislators and agreed to support Dr. Perez Balladares' endeavor to form a government that represents the entire nation. We are offering him this political support today, and we hope he can complete his cabinet in a way that he will achieve what the Panamanians want. Panamanians want unity. They want to leave behind rancor, hate, and revenge and realize that this country belongs to everyone. Only by working together can we meet the challenges of the future. Therefore, Dr. Perez Balladares, I am very pleased to offer you our support. [Perez Balladares] Thank you very much. [end recording] For his part, Dr. Perez Balladares said the Solidarity Party's decision exemplifies the country's political forces because they are joining a nonpartisan effort that is nationally oriented, striving to achieve in the next five years all the national objectives shared by Panamanians. [Begin Perez Balladares recording] For us it obviously signifies extraordinary support to have this support -- pardon the redundancy -- from the Solidarity Party because it also means we will have a majority in the Legislative Assembly. With that legislative majority, without denying the participation of other forces that will also have their views, we can enact many of the laws needed to spell out this new relationship for progress, peace, cooperation, and unity among all Panamanians. It is a significant step by the Solidarity Party. We applaud it and hope it serves as an example for other political parties so we can join forces for the sake of the fatherland, and for the good of the humble and the poverty-stricken. From now until 1999, we are under the same tent, which is the fatherland. [end recording] The president-elect then met privately with Gabriel Lewis Galindo, future foreign minister, and with Apostolic Nuncio Osvaldo Padilla. Afterward, in the office of Magistrate President Eduardo Valdes Escoffery, Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares, Tomas Altamirano Duque, and Felipe Virzi, the president and first and second vice presidents, respectively, received their credentials as members of the United People alliance slate which won the elections.
