These sources pointed out that the Egyptian workers in Libya are faced with two options: Either to accept transforming their work contracts to local contracts and thus lose housing and transportation allowances or to return to Egypt. The Foreign Ministry has formed a committee of all concerned agencies to request the Security Council to speed up efforts to pay compensation to the countries that are harmed by the continuing embargo imposed on the Libyan Jamahiriyah.
