He said the deepening of economic reforms is the prime concern of the authorities. He spoke on Monday at a closed session of the cabinet attended by the heads of local administrations. The presidential press secretary Iman Rysaliyev told INTERFAX that the president pointed to the need for strengthening the akimat -- community of heads of local administrations. He also stressed that the current decline in production should not be linked to a crisis in government structures. He said that despite the difficulties in economic restructuring certain achievements have been gained primarily in monetary policy. Last month inflation dropped to a 5-percent level and prices stabilized. The main task is to reorganize the economy so that it would operate to 90 percent on local raw materials. The president also spoke for stopping all political rhetoric concerning gold and gold mines. He thinks the government should take steps in the nearest future so that foreign companies, in particular from Canada and the United States, would finally begin gold mining in Kyrgyzstan.
