K. Zykov and V. N. Skorobogatykh, DIEKS [unexpanded acronym]-Scientific Production Association, Central Scientific Research Institute of Machine Building Technology; UDC 621.186.7] [Text] A description is provided of the principal requirements contained in the Regulations on the System of Technical Diagnosis of Thermal Power Steam and Hot-Water Boilers. Tens of thousands of small steam and hot-water boilers, supplying communal and industrial needs for steam and hot water are currently in operation in Russia. The constituents of this thermomechanical equipment are heterogeneous both in design and technological features and with respect to product service life, safety and reliability factors, and other indices. More than 80% of the small boiler units produced before the beginning of the 1970s are operating at the present time beyond the limits of the design operating life. The quality of operation remains a significant problem for this equipment. Under these conditions, operational reliability is determined entirely by the timely and effective implementation of measures for the carrying out of technical diagnosis and by subsequent repair and initial preparation operations. However, until the present time a unified methodological and engineering approach to the tasks of diagnosis and to the problem of rational prolongation of reliable operating life has not been worked out. Finally, instructional materials on the many modifications of small boilers, regulating the necessary scope and periods of the monitoring of the state of the metal during the period of the design service life, are lacking. These problems have been eliminated by the Regulations on the System of Technical Diagnosis of Industrial Power Steam and Hot-Water Boilers, developed by a collective of authors (Russian Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight; the Scientific Production Association, Central Scientific Research, I. I. Polzunov Planning and Design Institute on Boilers and Turbines; VNIIAM [unexpanded acronym - All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Nuclear Machine Building]; the Scientific Production Association, Central Scientific Research Institute of Machine Building Technology, boiler-building plants, and other enterprises). The Regulations cover steam boilers with a pressure greater than 0.07 MPa to 4.0 MPa and hot-water boilers with a water-heating temperature greater than 115ï¿½C. The principle of ensuring safety during the assessment of the technical status of boilers in relation to potentially dangerous elements of construction or its components that are most stressed, operating in the most severe and difficult conditions, is the basis of the Regulations. The selection of potentially dangerous components is made on the basis of information on the design features of the boilers, the conditions of their operation, and statistical data on their failure rate. The frequency, methods, and scope of the monitoring of the technical status of the boilers, as well as the norms of the evaluation of the limiting condition with respect various diagnostic parameters, are established by the Regulations on this basis. The estimation algorithm for the technical status of the boilers, the structure of which is designed for the period of design service life as well as beyond its limit, is the foundation in the Regulations for carrying out the diagnostic operations. This structure includes the content and sequence of the necessary stages of the operations to establish the possibility and conditions of safe operation. The content of the stages of the operations to assess the technical status of boilers is set forth in the corresponding sections of the Regulations: analysis of the the design features and of the technology of the manufature and conditions of the boilers (sec. 4); actual examination of boilers (sec. 5), which includes the use of a complex of nondestructive monitoring methods; the investigation of the condition and properties of the metal (sec. 6), and, finally, check strength calculation and estimation of residual life (sec. 7). The norms for the assessment of the technical status on the basis of the results of the technical diagnosis as applied to the geometrical dimensions and to the mechanical properties and defects of the basic metal and of welded, forged, and riveted, joints, are presented in sec. 8. The requirements for the formal presentation of the results of the technical diagnosis and the prognosis of the possibility and conditions of the further operation of the boilers are set forth in the concluding sec. 9 of the general part of the Regulations. The analysis of the actual status of long-operating boiler equipment is presented in the Regulations. The boilers are divided in groups A and B, the first of which represents equipment with operating periods within the limits of 20 to 40 years, the second of which, longer than 40 years. Critical standards on the status of the construction elements, the properties and structure of the metal, and the results of hydrolic testing. The procedures in case of a deviation from limiting conditions and designations of the following scopes of diagnosis and repair, as well as the conditions of further operation, are regulated. Practical aspects of the technical diagnosis of various types of boilers are also considered in the Regulations; the program of technical diagnosis of the most common types of boilers of domestic manufacture, the MZK, E1/9, PKN, PTZM, PTVM, DKV, DKVR, etc., within the limits of the design period and after its expiration, are presented. In keeping with the approach adopted in the main text of the Regulations, potentially dangerous components of the design of boilers on the drawings are considered, and the methods and scopes of criterional evaluations of the technical diagnosis results indicated. Recommendations are given for the formal presentation of the results of the diagnosis and the preparation of the conclusions regarding the possibility, periods, and conditions of the further operation of boilers. Overall the Regulations have been devised to provide assistance to the operating personnel of industrial boiler, installation, repair, and diagnostic enterprises and organizations in the ensurance of the reliable and prolonged operation of boiler equipment on the basis of the effective solution of the problems of technical diagnosis.
