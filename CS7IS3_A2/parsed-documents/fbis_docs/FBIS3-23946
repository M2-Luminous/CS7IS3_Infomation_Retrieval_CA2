He has become head of the Russian presidential group of experts and is, in effect, one of Boris Yeltsin's main economic advisers. Aleksandr Livshits recently taught at Moscow's Machine Tool and Instrument Building Institute -- he was head of the Economic Theory Department. He wrote the textbook "An Introduction to the Market Economy" [Vvedeniye v Rynochnuyu Ekonomiku] (1990). He has spent the last two years working at the presidential administration's Analysis Center. He was responsible for formulating the economic section of Boris Yeltsin's draft message to the Federal Assembly. In an exclusive interview with TRUD Aleksandr Livshits said the following: [Livshits] We will not only analyze objectively the course of economic reform, but will also forecast the results of proposed decisions and point to any possible adverse results. The group of experts' tasks include proposing specific measures to prevent events taking an undesirable turn. [Golovachev] Aleksandr Yakovlevich, the president's message says that the state should repay its debts (which currently run into many trillions) and at the same time prevent a rise in inflation. How can it perform these incompatible tasks? [Livshits] First, the debts must not be repaid straightaway, but gradually. But it is absolutely essential that they be repaid. The state debt is a hallowed concept: It must be repaid, particularly as regards wages and other payments. Second, there are noninflationary means of swelling state funds, which I think the government will announce in the near future. Specifically, by expanding the consumer market and reforming the state sector. [Golovachev] Many specialists consider that the government and Yegor Gaydar in particular, made a major miscalculation in abandoning state enterprises to the will of fate for two years while the state -- their owner -- dodged managing them, putting its trust in the "unseen hand of the market." [Livshits] Of course this was a miscalculation. State property ended up a kind of no-man's-land, more often than not the director's patch. The market is still weak and the owner (the state) is not managing his enterprises. And now look at the result -- disorganization, nonpayment, a very serious situation.... But we do have experience of managing state enterprises, and considerable experience at that. We now have to rectify the situation. Let me say that management means, in particular, creating favorable conditions for attracting mixed (private and state) capital for structural restructuring and investments, it means rescue and rehabilitation packages, bankruptcies, support for promising enterprises, well-considered cadre and pricing policy, and so on. [Golovachev] The president's message to the Federal Assembly made fairly tough assessments of the activity of Viktor Chernomyrdin's government. "The government was unable to impose the requisite order" (with state enterprises). "The downside of the reform was attributable to mistakes by the bodies of state power responsible for reform. The government took poor account of the consequences of some decisions, postponed the adoption of others, was slow to make overdue corrections to reform.... The pause in reformation became protracted." "In two years of reform the government has simply been unable to elaborate an effective structural policy. This inaction will cost the Russian economy dear." And so on. The following question arises: Has the government exhausted its potential? What is your view? [Livshits] We will be able to answer this question in the near future. Let us see how skillfully the government performs its new tasks. I personally am confident that the government still has tremendous potential. [Golovachev] What do you see as the main problem today? [Livshits] The main point is to ensure that the price of market transformations is not too great for society. So far we have, regrettably, failed in that. That is why the president's message raised the following important task: "Without reducing the pace of reform, market transformations must be rendered less burdensome for society." [Golovachev] One last question. Being totally sincere, do you believe in success, in other words that it is possible to start getting out of the hole without reducing the standard of living further? [Livshits] I am convinced of that although this task is a very difficult one today. But it is reassuring that mutual understanding with the State Duma and its Committee for Economic Policy is growing stronger. The day before yesterday we held a press conference with Sergey Glazyev, head of this committee. I would like to hope that we will attend future briefings as a trio -- with a government leader as well. We have no other option. If we do not secure the preconditions for economic stabilization this year by joint effort, the country may find itself beset by tremendous upheaval. I believe that we will not permit this, common sense will prevail.
