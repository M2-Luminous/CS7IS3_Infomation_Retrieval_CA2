Major Gabor Nagy, deputy military attache at the Hungarian Embassy in Bucharest, and (Jozsef Gotz), vice president of the Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania [UDMR] in charge of cultural and religious affairs, participated in a religious service held at the Reformed Church of Sighetul Marmatiei. Wreaths were laid today at commemorative plaques in Cluj-Napoca in honor of two of the prominent figures of the revolutionary events of 1848, Sandor Petofi and Nicolae Balcescu. Andras Kelemen, secretary of the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a delegation from the Hungarian Embassy in Bucharest, and several UDMR leaders participated in a festive meeting and a gala show at the Targu Mures Palace of Culture tonight. A religious celebration and wreath-laying ceremony took place at the Monument of the Martyr Szecklers in Targu Mures this afternoon. The wreaths carried the emblem of the Hungarian state as well as sashes with the colors of the Hungarian national flag. Gyorgy Tokay, UDMR deputy from Arad, addressed a ceremony held at the Monument of the 13 Generals at the Arad Citadel. He emphasized the worldwide historical significance of the freedom won by the Hungarians in the wake of the 1848 revolution. Wreaths were laid on behalf of UDMR-Arad branch, the Hungarian Embassy to Bucharest, the Town Hall of Arad Municipality, the Democratic Organization of Bulgarians from Arad, the German Forum, and various Hungarian journalistic, cultural, and youth organizations from Arad. The series of UDMR actions pegged to the 1848-1849 revolution concluded in Covasna County this afternoon. Wreaths were laid at the monument in the center of Sfantu Gheorghe Municipality, after which a commemorative show took place at the Little Stadium. In this connection, Mr. Adrian Vlad Casunean, prefect of Covasna County, told the press that in his opinion today's actions are anomalies of a revanchist nature. Both in Targu Secuiesc and Baraolt the demonstrators carried the Hungarian flag; in Baraolt, the Romanian flag was covered with a black ribbon in several instances. The Covasna prefect said that he will ask the town halls and the police to take legal steps against the UDMR organizers and he also emphasized that Law 60/1991 on organizing and holding public meetings should be amended in order to avoid the repeat of such antinational actions in the future.
