The British newspaper says: Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, who has been quiet for a year, will return very soon to his military strategy and deal a lightening strike against Western forces inside and outside Iraq. The newspaper says: The Iraqi president's patience is coming to an end as a result of the embargo imposed by the United Nations since his invasion of Kuwait and the exacerbating economic situation. This, the paper adds, will prompt him to carry out a new bloody adventure. THE GUARDIAN adds that it has been expected recently that this adventure will be in the form of a military strike or threat against the State of Kuwait or Kurdistan and that this strike will take place next week. THE GUARDIAN bases its expectations on reports that Iraq is beefing up its Armed Forces and deploying them in the North and the South. As a result of this, the paper adds, Iraqis are storing food supplies and drawing large amounts of money from banks. [passage omitted]
