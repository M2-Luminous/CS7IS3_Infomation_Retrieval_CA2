Addressing a convention of the Union for the Liberation of Abkhazia, in Tbilisi, Kakubava described political moves for the return of Abkhazia as a criminal waste of time. He said that although he was no fascist, he knew that ethnic Georgians would return to Abkhazia with the help of those same means that were used to oust them from their home place. But, Kakubava said, no refugee would dare return as long as the Abkhaz authorities dictated terms in Sukhumi. Kakubava accused Eduard Shevardnadze of losing Abkhazia. He said he represented the best part of the Georgian nation and would work for the triumph of the Georgian spirit throughout Georgia. Kakubava urged the 300 delegates to the convention to refrain from moves that could aggravate the domestic situation and foment confrontation with the government. The leader of Georgia's Popular Front Nodar Natadze rejected the idea of taking military action against Abkhazia. In his view, moves must be made to create an operational committee for the temporarily occupied areas which would instruct the government on strategies for Abkhazia. Speaking on behalf of Shevardnadze's Georgian Citizens' Union, Georgiy Baramidze called, but failed to evoke support, for a political settlement. The convention is going on. Eduard Shevardnadze will be expected to take part in the proceedings.
