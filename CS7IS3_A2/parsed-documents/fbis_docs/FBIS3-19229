Speaking to journalists at the end of the Commission's annual six-week session, Dutch diplomat Pieter van Wulfften Palthe demanded reforms to enable the Commission to encourage "democratisation in the world" rather than "look towards the past." A working group would try to reform the Commission during 1994 to make it more "relevant to the outside world" and cut down on "long reports and speeches," he told a press conference. The Commission should also deal "in a much stronger way" with states that refused to cooperate with human rights rapporteurs and the UN system generally, such as Iraq, Iran, Cuba, and Sudan. "The one thing international law lacks is sanctions," said Palthe. "It is the same with the Commission on Human Rights (...) Unfortunately there are no sanctions mechanisms," he commented. He singled out Sudan, which had denounced as "blasphemy against Islam" a critical report by special UN human rights rapporteur Gaspar Biro. "The Sudanese attacks against Mr. Biro are quite unacceptable. I'm glad the Commission condemned this unwarranted attack," he said. The group's 53 member states had acknowledged the changes in South Africa but had not shown enough recognition of the Middle East peace process, he said. The disputed Indonesian territory of East Timor had been less controversial this year because of Jakarta's cooperation, but India and Pakistan had "abused the Commission's time" by their long debates on the "highly political" question of Kashmir. "The Commission is not a place for bilateral disputes," he commented. Palthe said he would be appointing someone within the next few weeks to take up the newly created post of special rapporteur on violence against women, who would then be confirmed by UN headquarters in New York this June.
