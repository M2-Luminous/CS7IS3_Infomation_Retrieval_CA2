[Dienstbierova] Shortly after 0900, the U.S. guests were received by Jiri Payne and Vladimir Suman, chairmen of the parliament Foreign Affairs and Defense and Security Committees. The U.S. Government member and Madeleine Albright stated at the very beginning the aim of this mission. Together with Gen. John Shalikashvili, they want to listen to our questions, to get to know the views of the Czech representatives, and to discuss them. The United States wants us to know that the security of the Central European region is of direct interest, not only of U.S. interest but also of the alliance's. The security of the Czech Republic and of the whole area of countries between Russia and the West will directly influence U.S. security, Albright went on to say. There should be no doubt about U.S. interests in Europe as a whole. The U.S. ambassadress to the United Nations recalled that President Clinton committed himself to keeping U.S. forces in Europe. As far as the Partnership for Peace is concerned, Albright thinks that the U.S. President understands this plan as an important initiative. She went on to say that there were evolutionary and dynamic aspects to this plan. It is a concept that would enable every country to pick up the ball and run with it. Partnership for Peace is a pledged responsibility and also represents shared values, Albright stated in the Czech Parliament a few minutes ago. At this moment, the closed meeting with Gen. Shalikashvili is also coming to an end.
