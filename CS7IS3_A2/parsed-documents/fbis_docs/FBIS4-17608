The State Duma press office said Rybkin had informed the Israeli prime minister of Russia's sincere intention to achieve a political settlement in the Middle East. "Our country was among those who backed the creation of the independent Israeli state, and today we will be consistent in the development of cooperation," he was quoted as saying. Rabin pointed out Russia's interest in and responsibility for the settlement as a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process. He hoped that the first part of P.L.O.-Israeli agreements concerning Palestinian self-rule would be accomplished within two or three weeks. "We want peace in the Middle East, and I think Russia's interests correspond to ours," Rabin pointed out. The Israeli prime minister said he highly praised Russia's efforts intended for the settlement of the Middle East conflict. The chairman of the State Duma committee for international affairs, Vladimir Lukin, said Rabin informed Rybkin of the creation of a Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho pointing out possible economic and financial difficulties. Rabin said he was concerned over the future of Israeli nationals staying within the autonomy. He added that the Israeli leadership would ensure the region's external defense, while its internal autonomy would be quite sufficient. In the course of the meeting, the two sides expressed their dissatisfaction with the volume of Russian-Israeli trade, amounting to as little as $170 Mn at the moment, Lukin said. The meeting also touched on expansion of bilateral ties in various fields taking into account that about 800,000 former Soviet and Russian citizens are residing in Israel. During the meeting, Rybkin said he feared increasing nationalist and pro-Fascist tendencies in Russian society. In an answer to Rabin's questions, Rybkin referred to the fact that "such tendencies have always been in Russia" and that "one twentieth of society in any village or city preached exotic views of similar kind." At the same time, Rybkin said the State Duma was preparing hearings of the issue. After the meeting, the Israeli prime minister told journalists that he had invited Rybkin to visit Jerusalem on behalf of the chairman of the Israeli parliament. For his part, Rybkin invited a delegation from the Israeli parliament to Moscow, Rabin said.
