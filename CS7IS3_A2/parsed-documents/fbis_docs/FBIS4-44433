An academic treatment of the old and new contradictions among the people is of direct concern to the stability and development of Chinese society. There are 10 major contradictions. 1. The CPC vs the non-CPC. The CPC is the ruling party, while the democratic parties (those bourgeois and petty-bourgeois political parties that have accepted the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and joined the revolutionary united front) are parties that participate in government and political affairs. If we see China as a large ship, then the captain is the CPC, with the rowers being the democratic parties, the people of all nationalities. If we take China as a solar system, then the CPC is the sun, with the democratic parties and the association of industry and commerce being the nine planets. But while "long-term coexistence" has been no problem, "mutual oversight" still needs reinforced. Mutual oversight is both a major function and a general guarantee of long-term coexistence. A few places are still subject to "treating each other as guests with mutual respect, while not speaking to each other face to face, but living in peace with each other." When speaking is necessary, some talk of health and tell jokes, with the words not to involve justice. Even when "justice is involved," it is mostly a repetition of adages and stereotypes. Some grass-roots people are "blind to the united front." We absolutely must not tolerate words or deeds of discrimination against the democratic parties. Meanwhile, the democratic parties must not stubbornly blame society for not knowing about them. Democratic figures should examine their consciences, asking themselves how many political views they have espoused that have thoughtfully contributed to strengthening the leadership of the party, and how many deeds they have done that have "knowledgeably" benefited the people. If things are to be done right, there must be no fear, but of course prevention, of overstepping of the bounds. In the history of the democratic parties, there have been almost no incidents of overstepping the bounds. In order to help, there must be no fear, but of course prevention, of adding to the confusion. 2. City dwellers vs peasants. As to the supply, demand, and prices of farm and sideline products in some places, there is a phenomenon of "city dwellers laughing when peasants jump, and peasants laughing when city dwellers jump." This is a case of contradiction between urban and rural areas, and the difference between industry and agriculture. Cheap grain prices harm agriculture, while high grain prices harm industry. All need to submit to the law of value for things to work out. Some areas are now experiencing a contradiction between takeover of arable land and expansion of cultivated area. Cultivated land is peasants' livelihood. On existing technological terms, higher per-unit yields are limited. So higher gross output means mainly dependence on expansion of cultivated area. Takeover of arable land means less gross output, lower peasant income, higher farm product prices, and thus increased spending by city dwellers. China is a country of large territory, little arable land, and many people. While we have exact plans for the hundreds of millions of jin of grain that we would like to produce by the year 2000, our population expansion means that we may not even have as much by then as we do now. The sharp drop in cultivated area will make it hard to avoid a day when we may have to tighten our belts. 3. Educational circles vs the business world. The educated are the holders of advanced knowledge, and the developers of advanced productive forces. The entrepreneurial stratum is just rising in China, with businessmen being the organizers and managers of our socialist economy. The relations between these two strata concern the fate of our nation. The educated are diving into the sea of business, while businessmen climb the shores of academia, showing the exchange between the two strata. Scholars are acquiring a stronger awareness of serving businessmen, while business support for education is growing. This shows the mutual appeal of these two strata. But business support for education is like flower arranging, not necessarily tree planting. Educational circles need to plant taller trees to attract more breezes. Educational circles and the business world need to form an alliance. And we need to raise this educational-business alliance to the level of our worker-peasant one. 4. Military vs civilian. The people supporting the army and the army cherishing the people, working together as one family, has been a glorious Chinese tradition for decades. With the little amount we can afford to spend on education, how could our military spending not experience difficulties. While our force has been cut, our military spending still needs to be higher. We need crack troops with good equipment. While mess standards are not high for college students, they are even lower for soldiers. Just as schools running enterprises is not a permanent solution, military-run tertiary industries are also an expedient measure. The crux of the matter is that both need to be done moderately, with all observing market laws. From an economic perspective, the poor compete to enlist in the army. This economic standing can then be conveniently converted to social standing. So the military and civilians are undergoing a mutual conversion, as well as being dependent on each other. 5. Rich vs poor. China's gap between rich and poor has begun to widen. The wealthy calculate their incomes in hundreds of millions, while the poor have annual incomes in the hundreds. While most of the wealthy get rich properly, some do so improperly. Poverty involves objective as well as subjective factors. The poor should not be jealous of the rich, just as the rich should not discriminate against the poor. The poor should trace the root cause of their poverty, and the rich ought to help the poor. The rich also have a problem of being very wealthy materially and spiritually, but poor educationally, which is in urgent need of solution. The order of "simple labor earning lots of money, while complicated work earns little," needs corrected quickly. The labor-remuneration "price relations" for various lines of work need to be rational. 6. Authorities vs subordinates. While authorities and subordinates are unanimous on goals and basic interests, they are still subject to contradictions. As China's political democracy advances, with increased freedom of speech, overt conflicts between upper and lower levels increase, while covert contradictions decrease. One of the foci of these conflicts is the phenomenon of corruption by some. In addition to the exchange of power for money, there is more public discussion about job and political corruption. As anti-corruption intensifies, people will reach a better consensus on the features, subjects, natures, and degrees of corruption, by which time an order of high unity among upper and lower levels will appear. 7. The old vs the young. Someone has discovered the fact that the difference in the study of problems is far smaller among various political parties than among differing age groups. This shows that there is certainly a generation gap between the old and the young. While this is the inevitable result of faster Science and technology, economic, social, and perceptual development, the gap is not unbridgeable. The relations between the old and the young are actually ones of tradition vs change. It needs pointed out that there is no change in the world divorced from tradition, as well as no unchanging tradition. While Confucianism has been discussed for millenia, there is actually noone who has not transformed it. While the generation gap seems to be a qualitative issue, it is actually mainly a quantitative one. As to rate of change, it is inevitable that the young will run ahead a little faster. The future of our country is in the hands of our young people, just as the future of our young people can be said to be old age. As all are subject to physiological and psychological ageing, the old and the young need to cooperate and supplement each other. 8. Theists vs atheists. Since the primitive beginnings of religion, theism has a million-year history. In the future, once classes and political parties have withered away, theism, as well as the need to propagandize atheism, will continue to exist. Laterally, religion in China affects dozens of nationalities and hundreds of millions of people. In addition, it also has an international relationship. As religion is culture, as well as social norms, it is reasonable that some areas have a low crime rate among believers. Atheists ought to respect the beliefs of theists. While all categories of cadres at all levels should have a little general knowledge about religion, some now lack this, often making fools of themselves and bringing on disaster. While those who secure rights in religious circles by force or trickery should be dealt with severely, theists also need to be understanding, forgiving, and tolerant about the lack of religious knowledge among some atheists. As understanding and tolerance are key items in many religious creeds, the more one is understanding, the more one is respected. Some publishing houses now turn pale at the mere mention of the word "religion," fearing that not dealing with it accurately will cause trouble, so delete all references to religious knowledge, which is actually adverse to its spread. 9. Coastal vs interior. China is made up of several dragons with their heads along the coast and their tails inland. Our coastal zones were opened up first and have developed a little faster, while our inland areas have a poor base and have developed a little slower. But the heads and tails have a common fate. When the heads are lifted, the tails raise up. The heads and tails are tied together by production relations. How high either the heads or the tails can be lifted depends on the role of the productive forces and overall national might. A dragon can do without neither a head or a tail, with the tail having a tail function, the waist a waist function, and the head, tail, and waist needing mutual attention. While it cannot be said that local protectionism should not be allowed to exist at all, with patriotism including love of one's native place, overdoing it shifts one's troubles onto others. Local conditions need concern for the overall situation. The more the center devolves authority to localities, the more conscious inter-local cooperation is needed, and the more all localities need to subordinate themselves to the center. China is a whole piece that cannot be divided. "The peacocks flying off to the southeast," with population flowing to the coast, has both pros and cons, but is more pro than con. The crux of the matter is that it needs to be controlled, with control of the flow rate, volume, and direction, to keep them orderly. As the relations between the coastal and interior areas are ones of urban vs rural and advanced vs backward, they need dealt with cautiously. 10. Mainland Chinese vs Taiwanese. Mainland China and Taiwan are two places in one country. Both sides have the same roots, which will sooner or later mature and intertwine their branches. As Taiwan has more money and the mainland has a large market, cooperation benefits both. Cooperation is invincible. As neighboring countries throughout the world make "treaties" and form "communities," how can we as one country remain divided into this side and that side? How can we go around in circles about our intercourse? It is time to "shake hands for the third time" and "greet each other with a smile." As the common people on both sides have long since claimed each other as kin, those at the higher level need to make faster, more, and all-out contacts. All of these ten relationships are derivatives of the major contradiction between our peoples' ever-growing material and cultural needs and our backward productive forces. The goal of dividing them up for purposes of discussion is to resolve this major contradiction.
