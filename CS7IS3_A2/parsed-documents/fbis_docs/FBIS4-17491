Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, observer for our program and for the INTERFAX agency, who discussed matters earlier with Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, now talks about where things have got to this time. [passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Kozyrev] There will be no air strikes whatsoever as long as the basic reasonable demands for safeguarding security in the zones long declared by the United Nations -- six towns in all -- are met. Neither the Bosnian Serbs nor the Serbs of Yugoslavia have raised objections to this. [Voskoboynikov] There is frequent talk of lack of agreement among Russia, the USA, and the European Union [EU] and at the United Nations on how a settlement of the Bosnian crisis is to be reached. Can it now be said that, following yesterday's NATO decision, the positions of all parties regarding the way to an agreement have somehow suddenly come closer? [Kozyrev] No, I do not believe it should be put like that. The fact is that it has become quite clear of late; there are two directions for action. The first is the military one -- how to stop the Serb fighters and what will most effectively stop them, and what is the limit beyond which they may not be allowed to go. But there is a second direction too -- the working-out of a joint position by Russia, the EU, the United Nations, and the USA. In other words, you see, it has to be clear that the military option will lead to military disaster; whereas the peaceful option which also exists, is no less clear and is just as precisely coordinated by the international community. The situation to date has been that we and the EU have taken approaches to this matter that have been very close, in fact almost identical. The USA, on the other hand, has up to now been, as it were, out on its own. What we have managed to do during this time is get the USA, too, to declare that it is joining in the practical work. [end recording] [Voskoboynikov] It would appear that Kozyrev is to meet U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Geneva on 26 April, but before that Kozyrev's deputy, Vitaliy Churkin, is to have talks in London with his British opposite number and the U.S. special representative [Charles] Redman. On the following day, also in London, multilateral international consultations on Bosnia are to be held.
