The weakening of regional cooperation in Central Europe could threaten this goal, Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan said today. Czechs, Poles, Slovaks, and Hungarians have created the Visegrad group to be able to "coordinate their final liberation from the sphere of influence of the former Soviet Union," Kukan told a WEU meeting. He said Slovakia considered cooperation between the Visegrad countries very important. Through good neighborly relations and cooperation with its neighbors Slovakia seeks to contribute to stability in Europe as well as to its own security, he said. However, Bratislava is expecting a similarly accommodating approach from its neighbors, Kukan stressed. He admitted that individual Visegrad countries attached different weight to their mutual cooperation but expressed the conviction that all of them understood the inevitability of close cooperation. Kukan appealed to Western countries' representatives to speed up Central Europe's integration into its security structures. Cooperation with NATO and WEU and the clear prospects of Slovakia's membership in these organizations is necessary for the success of economic and democratic reforms in the country. "The prosperity and security are inseparably connected," he said, adding that the consequences of the forced division of Europe would disappear at the time when individual areas on the continent would have similar security guarantees. NATO and its European pillar -- WEU are the basis of European security. That is why Slovakia is seeking to join these organizations. "I would like to emphasize that this orientation is based on the political consensus of all political entities in the country and on the public support," Kukan said. He pointed out that Slovakia had proposed that international peace-keeping and humanitarian forces could train on its territory. Kukan rejected the view of some deputies that serious problems existed between Slovakia and Hungary. He also stressed that the division of the former Czechoslovakia did not mean that the Slovak population was against European integration. "We are expecting to join the European Union at the turn of the century, maybe already as soon as in 2000," Kukan said.
