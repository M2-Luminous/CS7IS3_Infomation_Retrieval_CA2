Co-Defence Minister Tea Chamrat said government troops captured the Khmer Rouge base at Anse, which straddles the Thai border in remote Preah Vihear province, Thursday. There were no immediate casualty figures. Its capture comes after the government said it had full control over the radical faction's base at Anlong Veng some 80 kilometers (50 miles) to the west which it seized earlier this month. Anlong Veng was the Khmer Rouge's headquarters for guerrilla operations in north and central Cambodia. Tea Chamrat said the Khmer Rouge had now pulled back east to Krapeang Kul, an isolated area where the Cambodian, Lao and Thai borders meet. The Khmer Rouge had been bringing rocket launchers and artillery pieces forward from Anse to pound government positions in Choam Khsan, some 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of the border. Government officers said the Khmer Rouge were attacking Choam Khsan as a diversionary tactic to draw Cambodia's troops away from Anlong Veng. Western aid officials said that some 3,000 villagers had fled to the Preah Vihear provincial capital, Tbeng Meanchey, to escape guerrilla artillery and rocket attacks. But provincial Governor Mean Sarin said the villagers should now be able to return home. "I am very optimistic that after capturing Anse all the displaced villagers can come back from Theng Meanchey to Choam Khsan and they will have no more fears," he said. The guerrillas captured Anse last August in an attack which United Nations peacekeepers said was partially launched from Thai territory. UN personnel, stationed at the border at the time, were detained by guerrillas during the attack but were later released unharmed. Mean Sarin said that government troops would now try to recapture the nearby historic hill-top temples of Preah Vihear. The guerrillas seized the temples in a pre-dawn raid July 7 which government and military officials said was also launched from Thai territory. "We have the ability and the means to capture the very famous temple back from the Khmer Rouge," he said. Tea Chamrat said he did not know if the recent government victories would force the guerrilla faction to the negotiating table. "We cannot guess whether they will come and talk. But if they don't want to talk, we can only stop them from disturbing us," he said.
