Hata, 58, said he is ready to disband his cabinet if it is necessary to bring the Social Democratic Party (SDP), a former member of the ruling coalition, back to the fold. The coalition and the SDP are currently holding rounds of realliance talks. "I would like to leave (everything), including the issue of my resignation, to the decision of the talks," he said at a news conference. Today, we are in an extremely difficult situation," Hata said. "It is tremendously important to form a powerful government in order to get through this difficulty." Hata met the press shortly after the long-overdue fiscal 1994 budget cleared the Diet and the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) filed a no-confidence motion against the Hata government. The premier said he will relay his intention to SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama when they meet later Thursday to weigh the option of forming a new coalition government with the SDP's participation. The SDP, the largest contingent in the last government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, walked out of the ruling coalition in late April, forcing Hosokawa's successor, Hata, to form Japan's first minority administration since 1955. The coalition is prepared to accept in principle the terms for the SDP's return. One last hurdle is the SDP's demand that the Hata cabinet resign en masse before the formation of a new administration. On the LDP's submission of a no-confidence motion, Hata countered he has exerted strong leadership to deal with numerous tasks for the sake of Japanese livelihoods since assuming office two month ago. Hata renewed his opposition to the idea of holding the next general election under the current multiseat electoral system, which is soon to be replaced by a new system combining single-seat constituencies with proportional representation. ``Now is not the time to contest an election under the present multiseat system,'' because a government panel will shortly finish its task of redrawing a new electoral map for the House of Representatives, he said. Although the Diet legislated in January a package of electoral reform bills for the lower house, the additional passage of a yet-unformed redistricting bill is required to allow the next election to be lawfully contested under the new system. But he also said he has no intention of waiving his right to dissolve the lower house as head of government. ``The last resort for the premier when facing off with parliament is to exercise the right to dissolve (the lower house),'' Hata said. ''And I cannot deny this.''
