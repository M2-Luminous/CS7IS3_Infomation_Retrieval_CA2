A modern state works with society in taking steps toward development. To encourage modernization, a modern state withdraws from activities in which its contribution is possibly inconvenient because it discourages the private sector's activities in its own areas, or because it diverts resources to activities with a lower level of priority. A modern state clearly understands increasing its direct participation in certain economic activities means, given the shortage of resources, a reduction of its participation in other activities; therefore, what should or should not be done in the area of economics should depend on society's real needs, thus precluding, depending on the case, the false dilemmas that result from misconstrued principles, as if such dilemmas could be placed ahead of society. A modern state does not relinquish economic leadership, instead, it exercises it for the community's benefit, strictly within its sphere of action. (Comments on Monterrey Governor Jorge Trevino's fourth annual report, Monterrey, 15 March 1989). Only in an efficient state which attentively attends to those areas in which its actions are strategic and have priority will it be possible to make the actions of all the sectors converge to achieve the nation's goals. (Meeting with Mexican Employers Confederation, Mexico City, second half of 1989). The Mexican state will not neglect its relations with other countries, its sectors and social groups, or its citizens. The state will efficiently fulfill its basic duties: guarantee the de jure state and the people's security; reconcile the interests of all groups; promote conditions for growth, which will foster significant progress in Mexicans' well-being. The state's modernization hinges on whether this mandate is observed. Likewise, the state must direct social development by channeling the initiatives of contending sectors. In economics, it is the state's duty to promote, encourage, guard, and coordinate national activities within the framework of the Constitution of the republic and its laws, ensuring the unrestricted exercise of established freedoms and the dignity of the human being. It is the fulfillment of these goals that will determine the exact magnitude of the Mexican state. There is no other way; there cannot be any other way of gaging this. (Meeting with the League of Revolutionary Economists, Monterrey, N.L., 23 August 1989). In Mexico, the crisis has also taught us lessons on certain domestic economic matters. We have learned sources of employment are lasting only when they are economically productive. We have learned it is very risky not to maintain a balance between the value of that which we produce and the value of that which we spend. We have learned it was possible for the state to be generous only to have inflation devour that which a misconstrued lavishness attempted to grant. We have learned high inflation undermines a government's popular support. We have learned a company, in which the state owns a majority or minority of shares, is still, after all, a company. We have learned profitability and gains are not ethically execrable values but, rather, they can combine individual initiative and the well-being of all. We have learned, in short, the mixed economy system, such as it is established in our Constitution, is still preferable to ultraliberalism and excessive statism. (National Economists Congress, Mexico City, 25 October 1989). Democracy Society's general development can be conceived only in democracy. Growth with stability is a requirement for firm progress toward the democratic ideal, which, according to the national project, is understood not only as a form of government or a legal structure but as an improvement of the people's living conditions at all levels, political, economic, social, and cultural. We should always remember economic improvement can only be justified as a national goal inasmuch as it results in better living conditions for all Mexicans. (Meeting with the National College of Economists in Toluca on 16 June 1989). In a democracy, the state's leadership is society's leadership exercised through the agencies society selects to ensure the fulfillment of the people's will and the efficient management of public affairs. There are no power vacuums. The absence of state leadership, or anarchy, is antidemocratic because it creates the conditions to override the people's will through decisions of authoritarian minorities. For this reason, the government in planning to expand political democracy and improve the mechanisms for agreement and social participation in the daily exercise of authority. We advocate neither uncompromising liberalism nor the statism that outrages the people's sovereignty, extremes that belong to an antidemocracy. (Meeting with the Employers' Confederation of the Mexican republic, Mexico City, second semester 1989). Similarly, there is a general demand for more democracy. Society eagerly desires new forms of consultation, agreement, and negotiation in the political field. Social organizations are demanding imaginative ways for rapprochement and cooperation among government branches, the country's various regions, and organizations. There is a pressing demand for a redefinition of relations between the people and the state. (Meeting with the PRI, Mexico City, 10 July 1989). Poverty To break the grip of poverty, to eradicate it presupposes fighting it at the source, at the root, where it is deeper, at the root, where dissatisfaction is born and social discouragement is created. For Mexicans, justice is the challenge to meet. It is to mount a frontal attack against poverty, without hesitation. The elimination of extreme poverty, inequalities, backwardness, and hardships multiplied by the crisis can wait no longer. We must resume our growth while recovering our ability to feel indignation over and take action against extreme poverty. (Installation of the Popular Consultation Forum on Extreme Poverty, National Palace, 21 February 1989). We Mexicans are not indifferent to extreme poverty, which reveals our insufficiencies and urges us to remedy our shortcomings. Our economy's difficulties have been most severe on the less fortunate classes. (Party analysis of the 1989 to 1994 National Development Plan, Mexico City, 10 July 1989). Poverty has been deep-cutting in Mexico. Meso-American cultures were far from opulent. The colonial system aggravated the situation of large segments of the population. Political independence had to be constructed within a framework of social disparity. The construction of a liberal state, fully sovereign and convinced of its progressive creed, was not sufficient to alleviate secular penury. No Mexican historic stage conceals lost paradises for which we should long or better times to which we wish to return. (International Workshop on the Fight Against Extreme Poverty, San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, 3 August 1990). Regional development There can be no regional development if decentralization and policies of municipal strengthening do not take place along with it. Up to a short time ago, regional development was conceived as a nearly exclusive action of the public sector, with little or no participation from the social and private sectors. Regional policy appears to be a cause and effect of the government sector, as if the private and social sectors and, consequently, society in general do not play direct roles in any developmental process. For this reason, it is intended that such sectors can participate in the new regional development policy. This does not mean, however, the Mexican state will relinquish the leadership stipulated by the Constitution. It is naive to try to attain a genuine regional development only through the application of fiscal resources available to federal and state governments and municipal administrations. We will make the migration process stop to the extent that we succeed in creating a new economic outlook in the country. (Popular Consultation Forum on Decentralization for Regional Development, Zacatecas, 22 February 1989). Modernization Modernizing the country means adapting its structures to the demands of the present to progress toward national goals. Either we make the necessary changes in the process for our own good or we will be run over by the changes that would occur anyway, only without our participation. Modernizing the country is the modernization of all. The state must modernize itself as should corporations, labor and employers organizations, professional associations, and academic institutions, women and young people alike. To stimulate modernization, the modern state desists from activities in which its participation is not advisable either because it inhibits the actions of particulars in fields peculiar to them or diverts resources to nonessential activities. In today's world, modernization implies competitiveness. It is to be aware of and accept the challenges of the international economy, to take advantage of the conveniences it offers, and overcome the disadvantages. Under present circumstances, autocracy means not taking advantage of the many things a rich international coexistence can offer. (Commentary to Jorge Trevino's fourth report, Monterrey, 15 March 1989). Businessmen's success depends on the ability to organize production and marketing, particularly on the willingness to assume risks. For his own good, the modern businessman should not base his success on preferential and discriminatory methods, through conversations with the government. (Opening of the 2d National Congress of Consultation Enterprises, Mexico City, 15 April 1989). Economic modernization cannot be conceived without a modernization of the public sector, a modernization that can raise the public sector's ability to meet education, health, and housing needs, as well as needs of other areas. Economic modernization entails a timely and adequate supply of the goods and services the remainder of society requires. (Meeting of the National College of Economists, Toluca, 16 June 1989). Inflation Constant price increases alter the economy and is a formidable punishment to the lower income groups. We Mexicans believe this situation is intolerable. Inflation distorts all economic indicators and in turn makes the decisionmaking process more difficult, encourages inadequate distribution of resources, and at the same time concentrates functional and family national income. In addition, rising inflation rates repress financial awareness, which must be used to revitalize productive investments, and cause it to be diverted to more speculative activities. This trend blocks economic growth sooner or later. (Meeting with the National Public Administration Institute, A.C., Mexico City, 19 February 1990) Public Enterprise In Mexico's revolutionary history, public enterprises have been agents of social consensus and political stability. On many occasions they have also been representatives of the government's performance. Nevertheless, current times are demanding we hone public enterprises with the tuning fork of international competition, productivity, and efficiency. Breaking up public enterprises is not the same as accepting inefficient public service; neither should it be taken as the state's withdrawal from its role as economic rector. Today's world does not tolerate such simplistic dualisms. (Program presentation on Modernizing State Enterprises, Mexico City, 14 March 1990) Training of Economists (During past decades)...certain radical critics began by noting that in the professional training of economists, the defense of the status quo prevailed and the study of all theories was avoided, deeming the attributes and theoretical differences as academic ways of evading a compromise with the most just causes. The best part of that radical criticism revealed, with intelligence, the social and political implications of our activity. In several ways the criticism found a refuge in the ideological dispute to conceal its ineptitude. The existing concrete world began to evaporate; the economic reality became more distant and inaccessible; the phenomena and operations of the world economy and even of the national economy divorced themselves from rigid theoretical postures. What, in the beginning, was the defense of praiseworthy principles became a Byzantine dissertation and ended up an ideological axiom. The school gave way to revelation, which in turn gave way to dogma. Simultaneously, in many countries other processes were being implemented; meanwhile, our professionals faced all types of confusions when entering the real world. Others, those who were graduated in private or specialized institutions abroad, took the most influential positions not only in the private sector but the public sector as well. In Mexico -- and I am sure the same goes for other countries of the continent -- economists who graduated from public schools have seen their ability to exert an influence or guide the most important decisions affecting production, growth, development, determining a country's social welfare and justice. (Forum on the Training of Economists in Latin America, Mexico City, 26 March 1990).
