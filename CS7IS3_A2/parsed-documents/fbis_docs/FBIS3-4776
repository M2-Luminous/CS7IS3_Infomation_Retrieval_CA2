Three kinds of economic construction by the armed forces are: national defense enterprises; enterprises based on the economic accounting mechanism that produce or repair equipment and weapons, primarily for national defense, and use surplus capacity for economic production; and the specialized economic units, businesses that are based on the different sectors and trades. Another force are the regular units participating in production. A management system at all levels--from the Ministry of National Defense down to the basic level--has been formed. After the enterprises were reorganized in accordance with Decree 388, a total of 299 enterprises have been strengthened and reorganized, and have gradually entered into operation. Therefore, during the past 3 years the economic construction activities of the armed forces have continually attained new results. Thanks to that, the cadres and the national defense production and economic capabilities have been maintained and developed. They have contributed more and more to developing the national economy. However, a number of units have not yet attained high economic effectiveness. Profit margins, amounts paid into the budget, and labor productivity are low; and their marketing is still weak, which greatly affects their ability to compete and their reputation on the market. The amounts turned over to the state and the army do not yet correspond to the existing potential. The reasons for that include factors of organization and management. Enterprises reorganization has allowed us to see more clearly the structure and a worrisome situation. Of the total of 299 enterprises, with regard to their principal activity 68 are in the construction sector, 163 are industrial enterprises, 20 are agricultural, forestry, or fishing enterprises, and 48 are transportation, service, or commercial enterprises. Half are scattered out in localities nationwide. About two-thirds have fewer than 200 workers, and nearly half have less than 1 billion dong of capital. That shows their dispersion and small scale, and the heavily fragmented nature of their production and business. That has restricted in-depth investment to renovate the enterprises' equipment and technology, so it is difficult for them to improve quality and their competitiveness has been restricted. In order to have new equipment and technology by means of cooperation with foreign countries, small enterprises are in a weak position, are not up to the task with regard to capital, experience, management, and the means to engage in international trade, so they may have to suffer business losses. The activities of the units and enterprises demonstrate that many enterprises and corporations with one level of management operate stably and have a developing scale of production will be regulated with regard to organization and management, and do not need to ally with other enterprises in a new organization. But there are many with two levels of management which, after re-registering for business, have only administrative relationships with the lower echelon. On the other hand, there are corporations in which the lower-level enterprises still must cooperate with one another because of their products and technology, and can assist one another with regard to technology and capability to mobilize the sources of funds. But there are also many general corporations with two or three levels of management the role of which has become vague. On the other hand, some operate in the economic collective style. That situation is posing the requirement of studying specific organization and management matters. Many new problems are being posed in the payment of taxes. Nearly all units have paid commercial income, agricultural, and export-import taxes to local tax offices. Many units want to pay taxes to a single place: the Ministry of National Defense. Because of Circular 08, some problems have arisen, so the payment of income taxes, land taxes, etc., is not uniform. With regard to paying profits directly to the upper echelon, many units think there is an inequality with the other state enterprises. With regard to depreciation and the payment of capital depreciation taxes, many units think that the present depreciation rate is rigid and, in general, is still too low. In the production-commercial units of the National Defense Industry and Economy General Department, the collection of depreciation taxes is not calculated accurately and fully. If calculated correctly, five to seven percent of the original value of fixed assets should be paid, but now only 1.45 percent is paid. Some units recommended that they be allowed to select a depreciation rate appropriate for the fixed assets borrowed by the unit, or use internal capital to purchase them. The form of fixed assets supplied from the budget should be readjusted or the depreciation rate should be based appropriately on each sector. In assigning capital, difficulties are still being experienced in settlement and processing. Many difficulties are also encountered in determining how much capital to assign because assets are not uniform and come from many different sources. New problems have arisen in implementing the system of reporting accounting statistics and applying the system of national accounts. Many units have not grasped the contents and the necessary knowledge to apply that system. In 1993 the state issued a decision to apply the system of national accounts nationwide. More than a year has passed but there has been no specific guidance on implementing it. One problem receiving much attention is that there are still many problems in establishing and implementing the mechanism of the party leading, the directors managing, and the workers and staff serving as the masters in the military enterprises. Some party committees and chapters have been slow in renovating the activity contents and guidelines, and have not yet tied in party work with specialized work, and are still confused about the new mechanism. Much progress has been made in the army's economic construction organization and management. But a new requirement that has been posed is continuing to renovate, overcome difficulties, stabilize organization, and develop the leadership role in production and business. The army enterprises are also state enterprises, but they have special characteristics with regard to their responsibilities, organization, and management. The labor structure includes many components, which causes the payment of salaries according to labor to be difficult to implement. The type of structure and the nature of fixed assets and capital brought into production have many different characteristics, so the renovation process also differs. It is difficult to force them into the same mold, but it is also necessary to observe the spirit of the state regulations. Therefore, it is necessary to study and apply the policy of renovating the state's economic management organization and mechanism, gradually separate state management from the management of production and business, resolve the relationship between the management of property ownership and the management of property use, form stock companies, and organize the forms of cooperation, alliance, and federation. At the same time, we must guarantee that the armed forces have a system of enterprises that is capable of meeting the most important needs in the process of building a conventional army that is combat-ready and plays a worthy role in strengthening the national defense potential and the national economy. Renovating the organization and management of national defense production activities and building the military economy are urgent concerns, but also have a basic, long-range significance in guaranteeing the absolute, all-round leadership of the party and the army. It must be carried out carefully and in correct accordance with the law, and there must be certain solutions and an appropriate course.
