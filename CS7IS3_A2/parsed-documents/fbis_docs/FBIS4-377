The United Nations is evacuating its staff to Bujumbura and Nairobi. For its part, Kigali has started a real race against time to try and contain the situation, which is slowly returning to normal in the Rwandan capital. However, the peace accord signed between the government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] on 4 August appears to be in doubt. From Kigali, Thomas Kamilindi reports. [Begin Kamilindi recording] The cease-fire seems to have been enforced in the capital since 8 April. But for how long? It's difficult to tell. Hostilities seem to have resumed in Mutara in the northeast of the country and in the northern Ruhengeri region between RPF and government troops beyond the demilitarized area [word indistinct] government positions. According to a communique from the RPF, a column of at least 20,000 men are moving to within 100 km of the capital. But a spokesman of the Kigali Army staff headquarters says it is a whimsical deception. The government has strongly urged the RPF to stop its war mentality and to favor dialogue in order to establish a broad-based transitional government within six weeks, as demanded by Resolution 909 of the UN Security Council.
