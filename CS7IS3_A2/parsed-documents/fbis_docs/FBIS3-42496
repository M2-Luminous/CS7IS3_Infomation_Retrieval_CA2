Improvement of the transportation system is one such problem. Transportation has always had enormous military importance at all times and in all countries. In the history of war there are many examples of failures of strategic operations, when military campaigns and whole wars were lost because of the disruption of operations or poor development of lines of communications. And in Russia, with its great expanses, transportation lines and railroads in particular have always played a special role. Now, under new conditions, the Russian Armed Forces are confronted by new tasks: To improve the methods of building up forces in specific strategic and operational sectors with limited manpower; to have mobile forces ready to go to any point in the country on short notice; to assimilate methods of strategic and operational deployment and regrouping which are adequate to present-day conditions. It is impossible to assure accomplishment of these tasks without full allowance for the transportation factor. This must also be taken into account when creating troop groupings in strategic sectors, in supporting their communications both with military district materiel-suppliers and with one another. There is a broad spectrum of questions here: accomplishment of military transport movements, freight delivery, technical support and restoration of lines of communications. And all of this under the real and difficult conditions of transition to the market. For now, I believe, these problems are not being given due attention. The reason? It is because military strategy and the concepts of types of transportation have been developing recently as if independent of one another. But not a single operational plan is conceivable without allowance for the transportation factor; in every strategic sector the transportation system has its own parameters and at times they are very limited ones. Also, one cannot ignore the fact that in the last few years the military sphere has been quite "dynamic," while transportation systems have been rather inert in their development. The service lives of the basic structures, roads, landing strips, ports, and canals reach 70 to 100 years, those of pipelines 25 to 30 years or more, and for locomotives, rail cars and ships, 15 to 30 years. For this reason, the development of the transportation system must be laid out for the future with allowance both for economic indices and for defense requirements. For a start, let us try to compare the extent to which the actual state of affairs in transportation corresponds to the current requirements of the Armed Forces. In brief, there are few grounds for optimism here. The Russian lag in terms of roads has already become notorious. For example, in the U.S. the length of the transportation net is six times longer and its density 14 times greater than it is in Russia. This makes it possible to have a 3- to 4-fold margin of through-put capacity of transportation lines for creation of the necessary reserves and conduct of planned repair tasks without disrupting the rhythm of shipments. It is also possible to rationally distribute the volume of shipments among the types of transportation. Even when we had a more stable economy, this was something we could only dream of, all the more so now in the reform period. Railroad lines and highways are in unsatisfactory technical condition over significant stretches, and require reconstruction. Volumes of road work have decreased recently by 20 to 25 percent. Wear of the basic stock in transportation is approaching 40 percent. In the last twenty years there have been reductions in the volume of deliveries of freight cars for railroad transport, and this has led to intense aging of the rail-car inventory. In track facilities, 300 thousand tonnes of the total mass of metal frameworks of bridges require replacement. The situation is no better in other branches of the transportation system. For instance, the seagoing fleet, which in the years of the USSR was the sixth-largest in the world, has markedly diminished. The share of it which went to Russia turned out to be out of balance, and the age of the Russian vessels proved to be much greater than that of those which went to the other independent states. More than third of the wharf facilities of Russian ports require repair and reconstruction. According to predictions of experts, most of the second-generation aircraft inventory must be written off by the year 2000 due to exhaustion of service life. But because of a lack of resources, the program for renewal of the aircraft inventory is being delayed. The air disaster at Irkutsk once again confirms the fact that this problem has to be resolved, otherwise the number of accidents and disasters will grow. There are also problems with pipeline transportation. The time has come to renovate a large number of pipes and compression equipment in a number of main sectors, since the questions of safety of further operations will greatly depend on this. Now other factors also affect the rhythm of shipments. These include problems with energy resources, the change in transportation economic ties, and legal questions. Difficulties arise with respect to unhindered passage of cargoes over territories of adjacent states without abridgement of the interests of Russian shippers and consignees. In these cases, the need often arises to divert the shipments in other directions, or to switch to other types of transportation. Or it is simply necessary to change the shipment deadlines. This is one thing when the cargo is civilian, but quite another when it is military, and often poses a potential danger during transport. Even this cursory listing of the problems of the country's transportation system suffices for one to understand that under these conditions, it is quite problematic for the Armed Forces to meet the requirements of military doctrine with respect to the transportation factor. In what way can we raise the mobility of units and formations? The choice has been made, and as I see it, it has been made correctly in the prevailing situation. In the doctrine, a course has been set toward priority development of military transport aviation. But this is clearly insufficient to raise troop mobility. Military Transport Aviation can accomplish only a comparatively small part of the deployment of the Armed Forces or the regroupings they carry out. So we must consider the transportation system of Russia as a whole for this purpose: Rail, water and air transport and oil pipelines in combination, in specific strategic sectors, taking into account the transportation support of the particular theater of military operations. Each type of transportation must have its own reserves, and troop mobility must be achieved first of all through these reserves. But as I see it, in normal mode Military Transport Aviation must ensure against "bottlenecks" in the transportation system and perform the most urgent movements of troops and cargoes. But in general, defense transportation needs at this stage must become the subject of special scientific research. Alas, there are no specific developments on this topic. And not only the immediate future is vague. Military doctrine still does not influence the strategic development of transportation in Russia either. At present a special targeted state program, "Transport Rossii" [Russian Transportation] is being developed, in which the questions of its stability, profitability, controllability, manning and much else must be considered. It would be good if the questions of transportation support of the Armed Forces were also fully reflected in it. In particular, in the near future we must take a serious look at questions of preparation of new points for unloading and loading troops and temporary transfer areas, development of military requirements on new transportation resources, and also on the means of control, and the transportability of new types of armaments and military equipment. We need the appropriate approaches to the development of new high-speed roads. This is only one example. At present, the possibility of construction of a high-speed Moscow-Brest-Warsaw-Berlin-Paris rail line is being examined. It will allow our country to join the Unified High-Speed Net with a track gauge of 1.435 mm. But this in turn will greatly complicate the technical support and restoration of this line on the territory of Russia from the standpoint of defense requirements. And even now many such problems are arising. The tone is now set by the economy in transportation strategy. The basic volume of railroad construction in the foreseeable future will go to the Asiatic part of the country, in connection with the economic conquest of new regions. The construction of the Berkakit-Yakutsk railroad line will be a kind of beachhead for the future creation of a supporting system of railroads in the eastern part of the country with possible extension subsequently to Magadan and on to Chukotka, Kamchatka, and the U.S. transportation system. The Surgut-Urengoy-Igarka-Norilsk line under construction is intended to provide all-weather communications with the Norilsk mining and metallurgical combine. Talk that the Russian economy will grow Siberia has already become a cliche, but what will grow the combat capacity and mobility of the Armed Forces? And finally, under present conditions the problem of "transportation and conversion" is a very important one. In my view it requires the closest attention from the standpoint of all structures and priority financing, because this is precisely the case in which, by switching defense enterprises to peacetime channels, one can both effectively influence the development of the Russian economy and help raise the combat capacity of the Army and Navy. The production of transport planes, dry-cargo ships, tankers, road-building machinery and so forth indisputably will most effectively raise military potential, whose level is set by the military doctrine of Russia. I think that this direction in conversion of military industry must become one of the highest priorities.
