This was stated by Richard Duque, spokesman of the French Foreign Affairs Ministry. In a statement published yesterday, Richard Duque pointed out that right now, material conditions for a fair and democratic election have not been met, adding that the review of voters register and the distribution of the voting cards have encountered a preoccupying delay. He added that France has decided, in conformity with the 11 July Ouagadougou Accords, to send security and military observers to Togo in the coming days to join the Burkinabe military observers. French experts who are assisting in the electoral preparations have already started their work together with experts from other countries. However, Richard Duque said, France has stated that it will have to withdraw all of its observer team staff and its electoral assistance if conditions for a fair, democratic, and multiparty election are not met when the electoral campaign opens.
