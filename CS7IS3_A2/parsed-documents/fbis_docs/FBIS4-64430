"The game of markets is a game of risks," he says. "The Italians, the French, the Germans, even the Scandinavians, have decided Lebanon is worth the risk. The British seem to have calculated differently. They must have faith in Lebanon's resurrection if they are to compete." It is a little over a year since Rafiq al-Hariri, the billionaire businessman turned politician who is Lebanon's prime minister, launched his blueprint for reconstruction after one of the most destructive civil wars this century ended the country's reputation as the Middle East's international market place and financial centre. over 10 years, $12 billion of public money is to be pumped into rebuilding Lebanon's shattered infrastructure, from telecommunications, railways and the once famous port of Beirut to restoring the capital's centre. The French and Italians have been leading the race to win a share of the spoils -- already, contracts worth more than $2.5 billion have been awarded or put out to tender -- but British businesses have been noticeably more hesitant. "The British seem to be more obsessed than their European counterparts with Lebanon's recent past," said one Western diplomat. "Businessmen who come here regard themselves as pioneers, telephoning home as soon as they leave the airport." The work ahead is certainly daunting. Beirut's commercial centre, the old front line, is an eerie wasteland of rubble, laced with mines and inhabited by Syrian labourers and squatters. Security remains dicey, as recent bombings aimed at Christians show. Sir George Young, Britain's housing minister, returned at the weekend from his second mission to Lebanon in less than a year, optimistic that there are great opportunities for British companies, particularly in Beirut, where rebuilding of the city centre, the key element of the reconstruction programmee, should begin this year. "Britain's strength lies in putting together the total package," he said. "Lebanon has a fairly developed building industry of its own. British companies can assist in project management and financing, in partnership with Beirut-based businesses." There are signs of increased interest, following the renewal of UK export insurance guarantees to Lebanon this year, despite some criticism that, at 50 million pounds, the cover is too low when huge infrastructure projects are at stake. "We are certainly seeing far more companies coming to look," said Jim McCredie, of KPMG Peat Marwick, project managers to the development and reconstruction council and one of only two British consultancy firms to have won contracts. "But so far, none has returned with a contract." Rolls-Royce and John Brown Engineering have both prequalified for the tender to build two 450-megawatt power stations, as have Taylor Woodrow and Tilbury Douglas for the $100 million contract to construct an olympic-sized sports complex in Beirut. Barclays has been among several banks discussing the possibility of acting as depositors for British contracts and Robert Fleming is considering opening a Beirut office. "There are many opportunities for developing capital markets and finance-raising in the region," said John Drysdale, a Robert Fleming director, "and it is rare to find an area where the American investment banks are not competing." (U.S. companies are barred from doing business in Lebanon.) Lebanese officials say that when British companies have bid, they have pitched their prices too high. Trafalga House, one of 16 bidders for the contract to expand Beirut's airport, the largest project so far put out to tender under the reconstruction programme is unlikely to win against a joint German-Lebanese bid almost $200 million cheaper, for example. "The Lebanese are renowned for their business acumen and they want to get their dollars' worth," Mr McCredie said. Even among Lebanon loyalists, however, there are concerns about the financing of the reconstruction programmee. So far, the development and reconstruction council has managed to raise $1.5 billion in grants, soft loans and commercial loans. Of this, in spite of Mr al-Hariri's excellent Gulf credentials (he is a citizen of Saudi Arabia, where he made his fortune in the 1960's and 1970's), only $350 million has come from Arab funds. Italy is the foremost foreign donor, having signed protocols worth $450 million, while the "EC and the European Investment Bank have committed $25 million and the World Bank $175 million." According to Mr Barudi, who used to be an economist with the United Nations economic commission in New York, the government aims to raise 36 percent of the nominal capital, less than $4 billion, in loans and aid. The rest will be financed by internal borrowing and government revenue. However, in an economy that last year registered a GDP of about $6 billion (exact statistics are not available, another problem potential investors face) such sums may be difficult to deliver. The reconstruction plan envisages a budget surplus by 1996 and a doubling of Lebanon's GDP by 2002, an aim described by one Lebanese economist as "a nice idea but unlikely." The development and reconstruction council and the government are relying on a flow of private investment -- projected at $21 billion -- and foreign aid as business confidence in Lebanon grows. It is looking at tax exemptions for foreign companies wishing to invest, and tax on big corporations has been cut to 10 percent. Despite the difficulties, Western economists say Lebanon's political and economic prospects have not looked as good since early in the 1960's. Since Mr al-Hariri was appointed, the Lebanese pound has gained more than 40 percent and a combination of conservative economic policy and a stable political climate has lured back nearly $2 billion of Lebanese savings that had fled overseas, lifting bank deposits by more than a fifth. Last year, capital inflows helped the economy to grow by 7 percent and inflation fell below 10 percent for the first time in a decade. Oversubscription of the $650 million share issue in Solidere, the private-sector company set up to manage the reconstruction of Beirut's city centre, has been hailed as proof of investors' confidence in Lebanon's renewal. But even if Mr al-Hariris ambitious reconstruction plans succeed, Lebanon is unlikely to regain its pre-war reputation. Then, Beirut's open port and liberal atmosphere made it an ideal centre for doing business in the repressive but affluent Middle East. Banks, in particular, thrived under Lebanon's Swiss-style secrecy laws. Now Lebanon is planning for a new era in which Beirut must vie for business with Cairo, Dubai and Bahrain. Peace, if it comes, will also mean competition with what a Lebanese columnist has called the combined genius of the Israelis and the Palestinians. Mr Barudi admits: "Lebanon will not be able to play again the idle role it had in the 1950's and 1960's as the Middle East's financial centre, but we are up to the challenge."
