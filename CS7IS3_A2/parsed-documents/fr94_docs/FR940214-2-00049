FR940214-2-00049 FR940214-2-00034 [Docket No. AB&hyph;43 (Sub-No. 165X)] Illinois Central Railroad Company; Abandonment Exemption; in Perry and Randolph Counties, IL Illinois Central Railroad Company (IC) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR Part 1152 Subpart F_Exempt Abandonments to abandon its Sparta District line between milepost 576.28 (V.S. 30435+31) and milepost 579.30 (V.S. 30594+96) near Willisville, IL, a distance of approximately 3.0 miles, in Perry and Randolph Counties, IL. 1 1 IC states that it plans to consummate this abandonment on March 12, 1994. However, because the notice must be filed with the Commission at least 50 days before the abandonment/discontinuance is to be consummated, consummation cannot take place here before March 15, 1994. See 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(2). IC states that, in a related Notice of Exemption filed January 21, 1994, Missouri Pacific Railroad Company seeks discontinuance of trackage rights and lease termination regarding the Sparta District line in Docket No. AB&hyph;3 (Sub-No. 114X). IC has certified that: (1) no local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) there is no overhead traffic on the line; (c) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or a state or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental report); 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report); 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication); and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen , 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on March 13, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues, 2 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), 3 and trail use/rail banking requests under 49 CFR 1152.29 4 must be filed by February 21, 1994. Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be filed by March 3, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 2 A stay will be issued routinely by the Commission in those proceedings where an informed decision on environmental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis in its independent investigation) cannot be made before the effective date of the notice of exemption. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines , 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay on environmental concerns is encouraged to file its request as soon as possible in order to permit this Commission to review and act on the request before the effective date of this exemption. 3 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist., 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). 4 The Commission will accept late-filed trail use statements as long as it retains jurisdiction to do so. A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Myles L. Tobin, 455 North Cityfront Plaza Dr., 20th Fl., Chicago, IL 60611. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. IC has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environmental and historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by February 16, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA, at (202) 927&hyph;6248. Comments on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public. Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where appropriate, in a subsequent decision. Decided: February 3, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr., Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;3366 Filed 2&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
