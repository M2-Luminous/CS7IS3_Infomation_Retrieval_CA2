FBIS4-41696 "drsov124_a_94029" FBIS-SOV-94-124 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Deputy Foreign Minister Opposes Turkish Moves on Black Sea Deputy Foreign Minister Opposes Turkish Moves on Black Sea LD2706202094 Moscow Radio Moscow World Service in English 1710 GMT 27 Jun 94 LD2706202094 Moscow Radio Moscow World Service English BFN [Text] Turkey is going to introduce a new procedure regulating seafaring in the Black Sea straits as of 1 July. Authoritative international expert sources say these regulations run counter to the principle of seafaring. They are also reported to contradict the stipulations of the Convention on Straits adopted in the Swiss town of Montreux in 1936. Turkey's decision aroused concern among the parties to the convention and particularly in the Black Sea countries, for which the straits are the only water connection with the Mediterranean Sea. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Albert Chernyshev explains Russia's stand on the issue of the Black Sea straits in an interview given to the Radio Moscow correspondent Mikhail Barushev. Turkey on more than one occasion has declared the regulations it is introducing do not run counter to the Montreux Convention, but rather are aimed at increasing security of the seafaring in the straits. We can hardly accept this point of view, says Albert Chernyshev. It goes without saying that security of the seafaring in this area is extremely important. We are also aware of the necessity to upgrade the seafaring regulations in the straits. And still we are harboring serious objections and firstly because the decision to introduce new seafaring regulations in the Black Sea straits has been taken by Turkey unilaterally. At the same time, stresses the high-ranking Russian diplomat, these straits dispose of an international status based on the principles of free seafaring. Rules should be improved, but not unilaterally. The interests of all parties concerned and particularly those of the Black Sea region should also be taken into account. We have consulted all the parties to the Montreux Convention, and we have learned that all of them are generally sharing the Russian stand, went on to say Albert Chernyshev. More, we have expounded our viewpoint at the recent session of the committee for a secure international navigation, that was held in London. The participants at the session claimed the new Turkish regulations ran counter to the principle of free seafaring. They also adopted recommendations for Turkey to be accepted [as heard] in order to comply with a regime appropriate to international laws. We are going to raise the issue of regulations in the Black Sea straits when foreign ministers of the Black Sea countries forming an economic zone meet in Tbilisi late this week. We shall consistently uphold the principle of free seafaring in the Black Sea straits, concluded the Russian deputy foreign minister, Albert Chernyshev.
