FR941103-2-00080 FR941103-2-00038 Public Information Collection Requirement Submitted to Office of Management and Budget for Review October 27, 1994. The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirement to OMB for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). Copies of this submission may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857&hyph;3800. For further information on this submission contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 418&hyph;0214. Persons wishing to comment on this information collection should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10214 NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395&hyph;3561. OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0050 Title: Application for Ship Radio Inspection or Survey Form Number: FCC Form 801 Action: Revision of a currently approved collection Respondents: Businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses) Frequency of Response: Annually and once every five years Estimated Annual Burden: 4,000 responses; .25 hours average burden per response; 1,000 hours total annual burden Needs and Uses: The FCC rules require the periodic inspection of the radio installations aboard United States vessels that are required to carry radio installations for safety purposes. The FCC Form 801 is used to apply for these required inspections. It is also used to advise the FCC local office staff to plan necessary travel and allocate resources to accomplish the task. The information is provided by ship radio station licensees to request an inspection of the radio installation aboard their vessels by FCC field office personnel. The information enables FCC personnel to identify the particular vessel to be inspected, determine the vessel's location, the date and time it will be available for inspection, and the particular regulatory requirements applicable to that particular vessel. If the information were not collected, FCC personnel would be unable to perform the required inspection due to lack of information about the vessel including ports of call, sailing schedule, and ports where the inspection could be performed. The form is being revised to provide for new payment options available to applicants (payments by credit card, electronic funds transfer, and by Western Union) and to make the form compatible with the new FCC Form 159, Fee Remittance Advice. We are also removing four questions requesting information which is no longer needed in advance of the inspection. The instructions for completing the form have been revised to conform to the revised format mandated by the new FCC Form 159. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary.
