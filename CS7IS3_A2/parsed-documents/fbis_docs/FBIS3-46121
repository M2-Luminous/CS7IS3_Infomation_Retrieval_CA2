Gu Jinchi, Wen Shizhen, and Guo Tingbiao attended and addressed the conference. Monetary departments in the province made great efforts to carry out rectification and reform last year. Their year-end amount of savings deposits totaled 161.6 billion yuan, an increase of 26.1 billion yuan over the figure calculated at the beginning of the year; and their year-end amount of loans totaled 200.7 billion yuan, an increase of 34.7 billion yuan. Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, pointed out at the conference: Whether the economy is promoted is the major criterion to judge whether good results are achieved in monetary reform. Therefore, monetary departments in the province should seize the opportunity, boldly emancipate their mind, exert active efforts to achieve progress, and make a new step in improving their operating mechanism and ease the shortage of funds. Wen Shizhen and Guo Tingbiao said in their speeches: Shortage of funds remains to be a conspicuous problem in economic reform in the new year. Therefore, it is hoped that monetary departments will resolve four issues in the period prior to and after the Spring Festival. First, they should ensure the regular expenses on staff members and workers. Second, they should make sure that no IOU is issued to peasants during the purchases of farm and sideline products. Third, they should ensure the commodity supplies during the festival. Fourth, they should supply funds on a priority basis for the purchases of raw materials and fuels needed in industrial production.
