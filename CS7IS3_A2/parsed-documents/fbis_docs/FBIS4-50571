The city's power equipment manufacturing industry has provided equipment for the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power stations, the country's only two nuclear power stations. Recently, the industry signed technical agreements to assist the second-phase construction of Qinshan and part of the contract for exporting a 300,000-kw nuclear power plant to Pakistan. So far, the city has invested nearly 200 million yuan in its nuclear power equipment manufacturing industry, for construction of capital projects covering 93,000 square meters. Since 1988, Shanghai has also earmarked more than 13 million yuan from its treasury to support crucial nuclear power research projects. Sixty-two of the research projects have passed appraisals. Meanwhile, the central government has commissioned Shanghai to tackle 11 key research projects related to the construction of a 600,000-kw nuclear power station, and has allocated more than 12 million yuan to upgrade Shanghai's nuclear power equipment production capacity. During the 1996-2000 period, Shanghai will be able to build one to 1.5 sets of nuclear power equipment a year.
