The letter says: Excellency, The people of the RSK welcome your report to the Security Council of 16 March 1994, because you proposed extending the mandate of the UN peacekeeping forces in the RSK and the Republic of Croatia until 31 March 1995. This decision, with the involvement of the United States and the Russian Federation, will prevent further bloodshed and destruction. However, I expect great problems on the road to achieving a final peace, because the expectations intimated in your letter to the Security Council of 28 January 1994 have not been fulfilled. At that time you expressed your intention of carrying out a detailed assessment of the role and functioning of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] before the Security Council considered extending its mandate. This assessment -- although it was made with the assistance of command centers under Yasushi Akashi, Thorvald Stoltenberg, Mrs. Sadako Ogata, and all the UNPROFOR Officials, at least according to your report -- does not make a single mention of the suffering of the Serbian nation in Croatia, or does it condemn this UN member for its state terror against Serbs, which began in 1990. You are well aware that the Republic of Croatia was the first to begin ethnic cleansing and that, according to your report of 15 May 1993, UNPROFOR had registered, up until 18 March 1993, 251,000 exiled Serbs in the Republic of Serbia and Yugoslavia alone. Despite this, in your latest report -- in Section III, point five, paragraph "d" -- you request that refugees be returned only to areas under UN control. In other words, the Serbs driven out of Croatian towns -- and at that time, on 15 May 1993, you said that they were greater in number than the Croatians who used to live in the RSK before 1991 -- do not concern you. In point six, you accuse us of having a different view on the UNPROFOR mandate, while we are only asking that the facts on the expulsion of Serbs from Croatia be registered in the normative documents of the United Nations, and only then will the UN Security Council be in a position to make just and unbiased decisions. Your Excellency, We have lost so much time and the UN has failed to identify the causes of the Serbian-Croatian war. Attention was focused on 25 percent of the territory of former Croatia which is now part of the republic of Serb Krajina, while 75 percent of the territory -- under the control of Croatian authorities -- has been totally omitted from your assessments. It is precisely the territory of the Republic of Croatia which has seen the most cases of ethnic cleansing, destruction, and killing of the Serbian people. The information center of the Serbian Council, a non-governmental and non profit-making organization, with its headquarters in 7 Safarik Street, Belgrade, tel. 3221 108, has discovered the existence of 87 mass graves. There, and in other as yet unidentified places of execution, lie over 14,000 Serbian civilians killed by members of the Croatian MUP [Interior Ministry police]. Do not be astonished to find that peace is so difficult to bring about along the Krajina-Croatia borders. All you are considering is part of the problem, the one linked with the RSK territory, or, as indicated in UN documents, UN Protection Areas. Without an appropriate analysis and without making an official record of the fate of the Serbs expelled from Croatia, you are searching for a solution in vain, especially given that Croatia began its state terror, the expulsion of Serbs, back in 1990. Croatia is the only culprit for the Serbian-Croatian war, and the only one responsible for the creation of two ethnic states -- the Srpska republic and the Republic of Croatia.
