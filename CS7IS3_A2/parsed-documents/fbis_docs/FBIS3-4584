Twenty-one economic research institutes surveyed put at average minus 56 the business confidence index for major manufacturers in the BOJ report, with predictions ranging from minus 51 to minus 60. The index stood at minus 56 in the previous BOJ report, published in December. The quarterly report, based on a survey taken in February, will be issued at 2 PM Tuesday. In the KYODO poll, nine of the surveyed institutes projected an improvement in the figure, while eight expected a decline. Some of the forecasters who are relatively optimistic reasoned that the economy, already crawling at bottom, could not deteriorate further. Others cited signs of recovery in durable goods sales, firmer showing of stock prices, and the yen's downslide in early February when the BOJ survey is thought to have been taken. But even optimists are cautious because the signals of recovery that appeared in recent economic statistics may be affected by corporate efforts to make financial results better than they are before the book closing at the end of March. An official with Okasan Economic Research Institute said, "maybe, the brightness is only for the January-March period. We want to wait for April figures before making any diagnosis on the economy." Pessimists, meanwhile, attributed their forecasts to continuously depressed sales and political instability. The research section of the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), regarded as one of the country's most reliable forecasting institutions, said, "the economy remains in poor shape with effects from higher share prices and a weaker yen limited." The KYODO survey also found that 18 surveyed institutes predicted the confidence index for major nonmanufacturers at average minus 47, unchanged from the figure in the previous report. Their forecasts ranged from minus 42 to minus 50, with eight seeing better results and six worse.
