According to the president, 527 nuclear tests have been conducted at Semipalantinsk since 1949, and there are about half a million nuclear exposure victims. Even now, many cases of diseases or deaths caused by nuclear exposure are reported continuously, and psychological damage such as fear among pregnant women has continued. However, the facts about the scale and frequency of nuclear tests have been veiled in secrecy. There are many unsolved questions, including the future effects of plutonium which has been stored in the earth. The president severely criticized nuclear tests in the area of Semipalantinsk as "criminal acts committed by the [former] Soviet Union." On the other hand, he expressed the hope that Japan, which experienced atomic bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, will cooperate with his country in the work to aid nuclear test victims. The environmental destruction of the Aral Sea began in the 1960's. Currently, three-quarters of the lake have dried up, and many residents have been left in the desert. Moreover, because a huge amount of salt has emerged on the surface in this area, there is a possibility that this will greatly affect the earth as a whole. The president, who has proposed an international conference on the Aral Sea issue, called for Japan's positive participation. Touching on his idea of creating a Eurasian union, the president pointed out: "More than 300 mutual agreements have been adopted since the inauguration of the CIS. No practical results have been achieved, however." In stating his criticism, the president added, "Some CIS members have rejected some of these agreements and have interpreted the concepts of agreements according to their own interests." He stated that in following the good example of the European Union (EU), a new union should be formed composed of only those states which are determined to abide by all the mutual agreements, while the system of admitting quasimembers should be abolished.
