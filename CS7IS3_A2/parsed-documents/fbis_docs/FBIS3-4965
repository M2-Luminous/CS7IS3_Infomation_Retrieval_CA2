This interview was the first exclusive interview with a foreign news media after he took up the post of vice premier. During the interview, Zhu expressed great expectations for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to China scheduled for 19 March. He cited concrete figures when discussing the focal issues of anti-inflation measures, future problems in the Chinese economy, and relations with Japan, giving an in-depth account of PRC's policy thinking as the highest responsible official for China's economic reform. Impression of His Visit to Japan [Zhu] "I feel that friendship and cooperation between China and Japan and between the Chinese and Japanese people have struck roots in the hearts of people here and have become a trend sweeping across Japan. I feel that this kind of thinking will not change, no matter how the Japanese political situation develops and what happens in the rest of the world." Prime Minister Hosokawa's Visit to China [Zhu] "We and Prime Minister Hosokawa have decided through discussion that the prime minister will visit China in mid- and late March. We have long since made active preparations to welcome Prime Minister Hosokawa. President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng are looking forward to holding fruitful talks with him in Beijing." [Announcer] Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Political Bureau, was promoted from his position as mayor of Shanghai three years ago for his outstanding economic abilities. He has since been in charge of the economic reforms advocated by Deng Xiaoping. Discussing the problems and prospects of economic reforms, for which he is the key leader, Zhu said, the Chinese economy will be able to continue its rapid growth. He expressed confidence in dealing with the crucial anti-inflation measures. He said: [Zhu] "Inflation was caused by excessive increase in investment, which was not healthy, and by reform of our price structure. The latter was an extremely important factor. Last year, we lifted control of the prices of grain and most of the capital goods. This could not but cause price increases. However, this kind of reform is essential to instituting a market economy. With the adoption of price-stabilizing measures, I believe this year's inflation rate can be kept below 10 percent. Asia, and China in particular, is witnessing the fastest economic growth in the world today. I believe that strengthening economic cooperation with China and with other parts of Asia will not only contribute to economic prosperity in the region, but will also help Japan in its economic readjustment and accelerate its economic revitalization. I feel this is something worth considering." [Announcer] Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who has been in Japan since 23 February, extended his stay by one day, and is scheduled to return home the day after tomorrow [4 March].
