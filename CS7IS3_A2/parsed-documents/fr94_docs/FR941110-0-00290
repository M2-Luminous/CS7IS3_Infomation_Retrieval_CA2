FR941110-0-00290 FR941110-0-00018 Plantago princeps var. longibracteata was historically known from Hanalei, the Wahiawa Mountains, and Hanapepe Falls on Kauai, and from Kaala and the Koolauloa Mountains on Oahu (HHP 1992i19, 1992i21, 1992i23, 1992i24, 1992i26). Currently, 2 populations are known from Kauai at Waioli Valley and Waialeale on State land; they are estimated to contain between 130 and more than 1,000 individuals (HHP 1992i25, 1992i27). On Oahu, two populations approximately 3.5 km (2.2 mi) apart are known from the Poamoho area on private and State land; the number of individuals is not known (HHP 1992i20, 1992i22). Historically, Plantago princeps var. princeps was known from Nuuanu Pali and Kalihi in the Koolau Mountains of Oahu (HHP 1992i28 to 1992i30). Three current populations of this taxon are known from Mount Tantalus in the Koolau Mountains and from North Palawai and Ekahanui gulches in the Waianae Mountains of Oahu. Between 16 and 20 individuals are known from the Waianae Mountains. The number of individuals at the Koolau site is not known, as it was last observed in 1948 (HHP 1992i3, 1992i28 to 1992i31; HPCC 1990f; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Plantago princeps is typically found on steep slopes, rock walls, or at bases of waterfalls from 480 to about 1,100 m (1,580 to 3,600 ft) in elevation (Wagner et al . 1990). Associated plant species include 'a'ali'i, kopiko, 'ohi'a, uluhe, and Dubautia plantaginea (HHP 1992i28; HPCC 1990e to 1990i, 1990k, 1991g to 1991i). The primary threats to Plantago princeps are habitat degradation by ungulates (pigs and goats) and competition with various alien plant species. Sesbania tomentosa ('ohai) was first described by W.J. Hooker and G.A.W. Arnott in 1836 from collections from Oahu (Degener 1937); it was named for its silvery hairs. In 1920, Joseph F. Rock described an arborescent form of the species ( S. tomentosa f. arborea ) based on a Molokai specimen. Degener and Sherff (Sherff 1949) published a new variety, var. molokaiensis , based on plants from West Molokai. Nearly 30 years later, Otto and Isa Degener elevated that variety to the specific level (Degener and Degener 1978). At that time, the Degeners also described two new species, S. hawaiiensis and S. hobdyi . In the currently accepted classification by Geesink and others (1990), S. arborea, S. hawaiiensis, S. hobdyi , and S. molokaiensis are synonymized with S. tomentosa . However, they note that the arborescent form of the species found on the island of Molokai probably merits formal taxonomic recognition. Sesbania tomentosa , a member of the pea family (Fabaceae), is typically a sprawling shrub with branches up to 14 m (45 ft) long but may also be a small tree up to 6 m (20 ft) in height. Each compound leaf is comprised of 18 to 38 oblong to elliptic leaflets, each 15 to 38 mm (0.6 to 1.5 in) long and 5 to 18 mm (0.2 to 0.7 in) wide, and is usually sparsely to densely covered with silky hairs. The flowers, in clusters of two to nine, are salmon tinged with yellow, orange-red, or scarlet, or rarely pure yellow. The petals are between 23 and 45 mm (0.9 and 1.8 in) long, the upper pair sometimes of a lighter color than the other petals. The calyx is about 7 to 12 mm (0.3 to 0.5 in) long. Fruits are slightly flattened pods 7 to 23 cm (2.8 to 9 in) long and about 5 mm (0.2 in) wide that contain about 6 to 27 olive to pale or dark brown, oblong seeds. Sesbania tomentosa is the only endemic Hawaiian species in the genus, differing from the naturalized S. sesban by the color of the flowers, the longer petals and calyx, and the number of seeds per pod (Geesink et al . 1990).
