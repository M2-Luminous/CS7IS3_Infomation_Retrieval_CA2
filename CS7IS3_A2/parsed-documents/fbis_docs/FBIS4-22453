In the morning Mr. Camdessus went to Tsentrobank to see Viktor Gerashchenko: They resumed discussion of the basic provisions of the statement from the Russian Government and Central Bank concerning economic policy for 1994. The director also visited the State Duma, where behind closed doors he discussed with speaker Ivan Rybkin the legislative support for the economic transformations in Russia. Even yesterday during the day, in the judgments of participants in the negotiations, the positions of the parties were fairly far from compromise. And it was not until near 2200 during the course of discussion that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Michel Camdessus seemed to see a light at the end of the tunnel. The negotiations continued all day in various Moscow offices. But fears that differences regarding the conditions for granting Moscow the second part of the systemic credit of $1.5 billion would not be surmounted remained right up until evening. The only hope was for the meeting between Mr. Camdessus and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who had returned from Sochi. These negotiations began much later than planned. Tied up in traffic on the Moscow streets, Camdessus did not arrive at the meeting until 2000, and it lasted almost until midnight. Judging from preliminary information--not in vain. As KOMMERSANT-DAILY learned, the parties managed to remove a number of fundamental obstacles and establish in a joint statement the intention of the IMF to grant Russia the second part of the credit for a systemic transformation in the near future. But the word "impasse" did not leave the lips of the Russian participants in the negotiations during all the subsequent days. The fact is that the IMF had doubts about the feasibility of the draft of the Russian budget for this year and also the possibility that the State Duma would approve it in this form. It was the 10 percent deficit which, in the opinion of IMF experts, might be increased even more after emotional discussion in parliament, that became the most disputed issue. The IMF had doubts, in particular, about a number of revenue items totalling 20 trillion rubles [R]. Because of these doubts the Fund even on Friday was inclined to put off granting the systemic credit. And although IMF experts admitted that Russia had met one of the main conditions--reducing inflation (to 16-18 percent per month)--Mr. Camdessus again recommended that the Ministry of Finance "reduce inflation and streamline production." Such admonitions are not new. Nor is Camdessus' statement to the effect that the path to raising the standard of living of the Russians lies not through preserving the present model of production but through its growth. And to do this it is necessary to reduce and then stop issuing money to cover the budget deficit. Any financial support for an enterprise, in the opinion of the IMF chief, should depend on its capabilities of making production either produce income or operate with minimum losses. Even if we keep in mind that Camdessus was only engaging in standard rhetoric, we can still assume that this time the IMF was taking a stricter approach to Russia than, for example, it did last spring. Then, as we know, the government also submitted for the Fund's consideration a program which, in the assessment of Russian experts, was not very different from this one but (this time in the opinion of experts of the IMF itself) fully met the requirements for including Moscow in the program for structural transformation. And in July Russia received the first half of the credit that is the subject of so many disputes in Moscow now. Nor is it out of place to recall the very practice of granting this kind of credit. Kazakhstan was the first to receive it. Now the republic has already been promised an even larger injection--through the standby credit line--and the IMF requirements for this credit are even stricter. And it would be difficult to assume that the course of the reforms in that same Kazakhstan are ahead of the Russian ones. Therefore granting credit to Russia would point to the idea of the existence of a double standard in the IMF. [First Box, page 3] The basic scenario for economic and social development of Russia for 1994 (according to information from the Ministry of Economics of Russia): --The budget deficit is projected in the range of 10 percent of GNP. The rate of inflation by the end of the year will decrease to 7-9 percent per month. The average annual exchange rate for the ruble is expected to be about R3,000 for $1. --The decline of industrial production will slow to 10-12 percent of the 1993 level. The reduction of GNP will be about 8 percent. --Preferential credit for industry and agriculture will be limited. The system for granting tax and customs benefits, subsidies, and preferences will be revived. Preferential credit will be granted only for carrying out highly effective investment and conversion plans on a competitive basis. --It is planned to reform state enterprises, to make changes in the practice of privatization, to provide for a selective structural-investment policy, and to implement a program for reconstruction of inefficient enterprises with the removal (bankruptcy) of the least promising ones. --The growth of consumer prices is projected to be within the range of 4.7-5.2-fold. [end box] [Second Box, page 3] Commentary From a formal standpoint the initially strict position of the IMF executive director is quite logical. So-called credit for purposes of systemic transportation is granted by the Fund as support for countries that are trying to increase the effectiveness of their economies according to principles of a free market and private property. Historically, this support goes back to the times of the postwar partition of the world among competing military blocs and the struggle between the liberal West and the communist system created in the USSR. Therefore international financial organizations are traditionally uneasy about the practice whereby national governments of recipient countries use methods that recall the economic policy of communist parties. In particular, all kinds of state support for inefficient productions (especially those that are state-owned) which leads to growth of the expenditure part of the budget and the lack of a clear anti-inflation policy are regarded as a violation of the fundamental principles of the activity of the IMF. A key role in evaluating the intentions of one government or another is played by the so-called Memorandum of Intentions and an analysis of the financial policy of this government, based primarily on an analysis of its budget practice. In other words the national government must prove to the IMF its resolve to undertake market reforms. All this is fairly difficult for representatives of Russia at the present time. First of all, until the next special memorandum concerning economic policy or at least an agreement between the government and the Central Bank for the forthcoming year is signed, the situation with the Russian budget is unclear to the IMF. During the process of preparing its draft, in just one week its revenue part increased by almost one-third (from R90 trillion to R120 trillion). The planned budget deficit is approaching 10 percent of GNP, and from statements from the government it is impossible to draw the conclusion that its goal is consistent reduction of it. The prospects for discussion of the budget in the State Duma make Fund specialists suspicious that after this the expenditure part will increase even more. Nevertheless it seems that the main problem in the current stage of relations between the IMF and the Russian Government is not so much what is to be done next as how it is to be done. It has always been clear to the Fund leadership and international experts that any budget projections, any joint statements in Russia are either not fulfilled or are successfully evaded. But in the past the Russian Government has always demonstrated its desire to "persuade" international financial circles of its firm adherence to strict financial economy. And this is what is required of it now: Swallowing the "national pride of the great Russians," it is necessary to demonstrate this aspiration anew. And the IMF will close its eyes again because international financiers are most afraid of accusations that it is because of their intractability that the West lost Yeltsin.
