The conference approved a program of actions "Ukraine's path toward economic revival, a civil society and civilized state," a declaration about the aims and principles of the bloc's activity and an appeal to Ukraine's citizens. At the basis of these documents lies the assertion of the indisputability of immediate economic reforms in Ukraine and of normalizing economic relations with Russia and other CIS countries. At the next conference which is planned for the end of February in Dnepropetrovsk, there will be a gathering of parliamentary candidates who have been nominated and supported by the bloc. At a news conference after the end of the assembly, people's deputy and co-founder of the bloc Volodymyr Hrynyov, stressed: Democratic and centrist forces do not have the right to lose the upcoming elections; young and energetic political leaders from the regions where, in his opinion, the state's new economic policy will be formed, should be elected to the new parliament.
