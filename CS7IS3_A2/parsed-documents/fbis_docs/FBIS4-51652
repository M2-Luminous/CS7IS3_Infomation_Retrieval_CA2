It is expected that in China, where the demand for energy supply is increasing, atomic power plants will increasingly be built in coastal areas. But there is concern about the possibility that if accidents occur there, neighboring nations including Japan, will be affected. To prevent such a possibility, a clause on the promotion of government-level exchanges on safety regulations and of information in emergency cases will be included in the agreement. The agreement will be concluded on 3 May between the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy placed under Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and China's Nuclear Safety Administration [NSA], which manages licensing systems for building atomic power plants and safety regulations for power plant operation. The two governments are expected to launch periodical exchanges in accordance with the agreement. During the exchanges, the Japanese government plans to present concrete safety measures designed to prevent nuclear accidents in addition to a report analyzing causes of past nuclear accidents in Japan, with recommended after-accident action. Thanks to the agreement, information on the details of nuclear accidents -- which is usually closed to the public because of "state secrets" -- is expected to be open to the public. Changing its energy supply policies last year, China decided to promote the construction of nuclear power stations -- which were placed in secondary importance compared to thermal-power and water-power generation -- in locations centered around coastal areas where the economy is developing remarkably. This is because China urgently requires replenishment of a shortage of electric power which is said to be 20-30 percent below total needs. New power plants are scheduled to be built on the premises of the Qinshan nuclear power plant (in Zhejiang Province) and the Dayawan nuclear power plant (in Guangdong Province).
