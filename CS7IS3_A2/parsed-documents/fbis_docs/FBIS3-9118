[Zizka] On the one hand, the Polish economy is showing signs of considerable recovery, while, on the other, many people are dissatisfied with their standard of living, and Solidarity is organizing strikes. In your opinion, could such actions destabilize the situation in Poland? [Pawlak] It is important for the future to ensure that stability and development do not apply only to the economic sphere, which is just one element of the whole social system. The positive results of the reforms should be manifested in an overwhelming part of societal life. In its practical activity, our government would like to abide by the principle of intensifying the entire context of the reforms. We want to strive to overcome dissatisfaction, but, first and foremost, we want to take part in creating the conditions for the active involvement of a larger part of society in the transformation process. It is also apparent after a few years of implementing the reforms that they have to be carried out by evolutionary means--without shocks and without leaps and bounds. Considerable losses are incurred by hasty changes in both the economic and the social spheres. The third principle we would like to abide by is the rationalization of our activity and the better utilization of our potential. As far as the protests are concerned, they were organized in those economic branches in which real wages rose last year, although average real wages in Poland as a whole declined a little. The motive here is not so much economic as political. The locations of the protests are not congruent with the locations of problems and poverty. Those whom Solidarity is mobilizing in protests--miners and railroad workers--have, in short, above-average incomes. I think that, during the course of discussions and negotiations, we will succeed in improving the current atmosphere. However, the trade unionists must also understand that the government has to negotiate with all of the trade union organizations and is doing so. Solidarity withdrew from these talks. I think, however, that we will return to the negotiating table. [Zizka] Problems are also cropping up in relations within the ruling coalition--between the Union of the Democratic Left (SLD) and the Polish People's Party (PSL). An example of this is the affair surrounding former Finance Minister Borowsky, who left the government. In your opinion, how will these relations unfold? [Pawlak] I do not think these are coalition problems. This was the decision of Mr. Borowsky, who submitted his resignation. In every step like this, it is necessary to reckon with the possible consequences. There are no problems in the coalition, however. The best example is the approval of the state budget, for which the vast majority of deputies expressed their support. That is, I think it is an exaggeration to interpret the facts in this way. [Zizka] This means that there is no threat to the coalition? [Pawlak] The example of the budget proves that there are no disputes within the coalition in specific issues. [Zizka] And what about ratifying the treaty with the Vatican--the concordat? [Pawlak] We have not reached a coalition agreement on the concordat. This is not an issue that should provoke a coalition crisis. Within our PSL Club and in harmony with the freedom of belief and religious affiliation, we do not insist on a common point of view binding for all. [Zizka] Another issue that causes disputes, mainly between the SLD and President Walesa, is the drafting of a new Constitution. Marshall of the Sejm Oleksy said that it will be necessary to seek a certain compromise. What is your opinion? [Pawlak] If you want to familiarize yourself with the crux of the disputes, it would be better to turn to President Walesa, Marshall Oleksy, and SLD Chairman Kwasniewski. The government is not interested in examining the points at issue in this matter; we are interested in cooperation in resolving specific issues. [Zizka] How would the PSL react to the candidacy of Mr. Kwasniewski for the post of president? [Pawlak] If Mr. Kwasniewski becomes a candidate for the presidency, we will hold talks and discuss it. [Zizka] The government coalition was criticized for its personnel policy in individual regions, where it tried to make numerous changes in posts in a number of provinces. [Pawlak] When Bill Clinton became President of the United States, there was a thorough and rapid change of personnel throughout the administration. No one took exception to this. In Poland, there was definitely a quite considerable reevaluation throughout the political system. I am convinced, however, that this process has been completed and that no more significant changes should be made in the personnel sphere. [Zizka] A protectionist policy, first and foremost in the agricultural sphere, was expected from the PSL before the elections. From this point of view, what is the situation now? [Pawlak] It is impossible, of course, to claim that the PSL's activity is associated exclusively with protectionism. On the other hand, however, it is necessary to realize that this is normal in the activities of much richer and more developed countries, that they are seeking an international position for their own economy, and that they are looking after their own interests. Poland is also bound to look after its overall interests in economic cooperation with other countries. This also proceeds from the fact that the balance of trade worsened considerably last year and that Poland had a trade deficit of more than $2 billion. Most of this was due to trade with Western countries. For this reason, at a meeting in Prague at the beginning of this year, our side proposed a Partnership for Development. The maxim is not to talk about assistance and asymmetry but, rather, about partnership cooperation that is advantageous for everyone. This involves a partnership where it is irrelevant how great the differences are in economic potential. I think that this idea could be appropriate, first and foremost, for developing cooperation in our region. We should try to develop the institutions that simplify economic cooperation and the financial and transportation infrastructures. However, the opportunities for immediate contacts are also important, beginning with a meeting at the highest level, followed by meetings between businessmen and ending up with contacts among a large number of people--for instance, within the framework of tourism. We are interested in laying the real foundations of cooperation, not, however, by means of a bureaucracy. We favor the "G-4" formula and not one associated with the establishment of numerous institutions whose activity does not always bear practical fruit. We agreed on this at the meeting in Prague. The countries of Central Europe and the Baltic region should be open to each other, which is also important for creating joint enterprises and infrastructures. [Zizka] Talks are also under way on agricultural products within the framework of the negotiations on the Central European Free Trade Zone (CEFTA). What will Poland's position be? [Pawlak] Agricultural products are a major problem. This is the point of view of not only Poland but also all of the countries. Agriculture was the most complicated issue in the GATT talks. Agricultural products are also regarded as sensitive in our contacts with the European Union [EU]. This ensues from the specific nature of these products. Negotiations within this category will also not be simple. I think, however, that our countries are linked to such an extent by their common geographical location and by the problems associated with the changes and transformations that we are obliged to try to improve our common potential. We have to seek a solution on the markets of third countries in areas where we want to defend our potential, our jobs. I think this is possible. Our potential should be utilized not only in mutual cooperation within the region, but also in relation to third countries. [Zizka] In connection with what you said about the state of Poland's exports, officials from the Polish National Bank maintain that foreign currency reserves are increasing alongside their decline. According to them, this means that exports are higher than it seems from the statistics; however, a considerable proportion of them are unregistered and take place without the knowledge of the banks. [Pawlak] I do not think we should be proud of this. [Zizka] A number of Czech politicians do not want to talk about "cooperation within the Visegrad Group." They would prefer the expression "CEFTA states." What do you think about this? [Pawlak] I agree with this view. It is all very well to come up with great ideas, but there comes a difficult point at which it is necessary to put them into practice. The Visegrad Group was based, first and foremost, on the idea of political cooperation. CEFTA is an expression of very specific economic cooperation--the liberalization of mutual trade. This course of action is very practical, especially today, when it is necessary to turn political ideas into specific acts. This involves ensuring that our economies become a dynamic element of the pan-European system. [Zizka] In Prague, at the beginning of this year, you discussed mainly economic issues, while President Walesa dealt more with political and security issues. What is Poland's priority here? For example, entry into the European Union or admission into NATO? [Pawlak] First of all, it is essential that there is interest on both sides, which is not always the case. I think that our experiences with NATO illustrate this well. It is the same with the European Union. Discussions on whether we should apply for membership now are, in my opinion, premature. To responsibly proclaim such an intention, certain parameters have to be complied with economically. It seems to me that we should not bargain in the sphere of political ideas but cooperate in such a way that our countries do not lag behind in mutual relations--for instance, compared with bilateral contacts with the European Union. On the contrary, there is nothing preventing more dynamic cooperation in our region. Incidentally, this would facilitate our entry into the European Union. At the moment, this is a rather distant prospect, and the whole process requires a certain amount of time. It is illogical to make an idealistic announcement about an idea that cannot be put into action for a long time. [Zizka] Foreign Minister Olechowski, however, said in Brussels that Poland will apply to join the European Union in the near future. It is known that the head of the diplomatic corps was nominated to the government by the president. To what extent, therefore, is he the representative of the president, and to what extent is he the representative of the government? [Pawlak] I discussed this with Mr. Olechowski, who said that he had spoken in Brussels about the prospects for such a request. He definitely did not speak about it as a fait accompli. This is a subject for discussion in Poland. We will give it consideration in the government and parliament. The process of incorporation into the EU's structures depends not on proclaimed declarations but on the overall state of the economy. It is necessary to stick to reality. [Zizka] Is a situation in which not only representatives of the coalition but also of the president sit in the government compatible with effective work by the government? [Pawlak] In Poland we have so many problems and so much work that there are a great many areas toward which we should be directing our energy. It is worse if someone deals with something else. So far, however, such problems have not cropped up in the government. Plurality is always better than a unilateral orientation. There are often more ideas in a pluralist system. Perhaps it is also more complicated to come to conclusions. In short, we have more ideas and objectives to think about and choose from. If we concentrate on our work, there is no time for other issues.
