FR941128-1-00025 FR941128-1-00005 During the public comment period for supplement B, EPA received requests to consider several additional new modeling techniques and suggestions for enhanced technical guidance. 3 However, because there was not sufficient time for the public to review the new techniques and technical guidance before promulgation of supplement B, the new models and enhanced technical guidance could not be included in the supplement B rulemaking. Thus, in this subsequent regulatory proposal, EPA is proposing to revise the Guideline and is seeking public comment on the four items described below. Once promulgated, these four items will be included in supplement C to the Guideline. A copy of supplement C (draft) is available for public review (Docket Item III&hyph;B&hyph;1). 3 The official public hearing for EPA's proposal to adopt supplement B was the Fifth Conference on Air Quality Modeling, March 1991 (56 FR 7694). Full transcripts filed in Docket No. A&hyph;88&hyph;04; IV&hyph;F&hyph;1 (see ADDRESSES). See also ``Summary of Public Comments and EPA Responses on the Fifth Conference on Air Quality Modeling: March 1991'', February 1993. (Docket No. A&hyph;88&hyph;04; V&hyph;C&hyph;1) Proposed Action Appendix W of 40 CFR part 51 will be appropriately amended to effect the following revisions, proposed as supplement C to the Guideline. EPA solicits comment on each of the following revisions. 1. Enhancements 4 to the Industrial Source Complex Model (ISC2) 4 For clarification, these enhancements are discussed separately. EPA intends to integrate these enhancements into one model for actual use. A. Area Source Algorithm Today's action proposes to replace the area source algorithm in the Industrial Source Complex model (ISC2) with a new one based on a double integration of the Gaussian plume kernel for area sources. (1) Short-term algorithm: ISCST2. A previous EPA study 5 indicated that the currently implemented ISCST2 area source algorithm, based on a finite line segment approximation, estimates concentration distributions with limited accuracy, especially for receptors located close to the area source. An independent but later evaluation confirmed these findings. 6,7 These studies suggested that the integrated line source algorithm for modeling impacts from area sources provides a better treatment of near-source geometry than that currently recommended in ISCST2, and a reasonable far-field behavior. Based on these performance evaluations and limited field data, the integrated line source algorithm is a candidate to substitute for the current ISCST2 area source algorithm. Responding to public comments received at the time supplement B was proposed, steps were taken to develop and test this algorithm. In the new algorithm, 8 the ground-level concentration at a receptor downwind of all or a portion of the area source is given by a double integral in the upwind and crosswind directions. The integral in the lateral direction is solved analytically. The integral in the longitudinal direction (i.e., the summation of the contributions from the line sources in the upwind direction) is approximated with a Romberg integration technique. 9 The new algorithm, essentially equivalent to PAL 10 and the convergent mode of the FDM 11 integrated line source algorithm, has been shown to perform very well in terms of efficiency and of the reasonableness of the results. 12 5 Environmental Protection Agency, 1989.

(NTIS No. PB 93&hyph;226751) Existing field studies of impacts within and nearby area sources being scarce and limited in scope, EPA compared model predictions to measured results using a wind tunnel simulation at the Fluid Modeling Facility, Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory. 13 Both qualitative physical and quantitative statistical analyses were performed. The analysis results12 show that the new algorithm predicts the concentration distribution with relatively good accuracy (i.e., # ~Â¢ 10%), especially for the ground-level receptors located near the downwind edge of the area source, a situation of concern to regulatory modeling applications. For receptors near ground level and within or near the area # source, the normalized modeled concentrations generally matched the wind tunnel measured concentrations to within # 20%. EPA considers this to be an acceptable correspondence. 13 Snyder, W.H., 1991. DATA REPORT: Wind Tunnel Simulation of Dispersion from Superfund Area Sources. Part: Neutral Flow.
