Li Chuanfang said that to further improve transportation facilities and meet the need of economic development, Shenzhen has thoroughly begun preparation for building a subway system. Because the subway system is a huge project which needs a large amount of funds and technology, Shenzhen City Government welcomes domestic and overseas consortia in bidding for the projects of the subway. A reporter asked whether the Sino-British row over Hong Kong's constitutional affairs will affect British firms' bids for those projects. Li Chuanfang said that Shenzhen City Government will give equal treatment to domestic and overseas consortia which are interested in bidding for those as well as other construction projects. She said that as far as she understands, economic and political issues cannot be lumped together for discussion, and that so long as the consortia meet the bidding requirements, they may win the tenders.
