The meeting was also attended by World Federation of Hungarians President Sandor Csoori. According to the government spokesman's office, Boross stressed his desire to follow the late prime minister Jozsef Antall's political concept regarding native Hungarians in the Carpathian basin. In keeping with the government's August 1992 declaration, he proclaimed his continued support for all endeavors of cross-border Hungarians, formulated by their legitimate representatives in accordance with European integration ideas. Leaders of Hungarian organizations beyond the border confirmed this as the minimum which they expect from Hungary's government and which they regard as a basis for future relations with Hungary. The sides stressed the role of such links in strengthening Central European stability. Ethnic Hungarian leaders said they continue negotiations in an effort to attain recognition as a national community, enforce their regional and community self-governing rights on the principle of subsidiarity, and create partnership relations with the majority nations of their countries. To this end, they wish to use democratic means in expressing their political identity. Boross said the principles professed by legitimate Hungarian organizations are in full harmony with the basic ideas of European integration and the Maastricht Agreement. As several models similar to the plans for settling positions of the concerned communities have proven viable in Europe, the government of the Republic of Hungary supports the just endeavors of cross-border Hungarians by all possible, lawful means at their disposal. Participants of the meeting assessed previous efforts aimed at bringing about a European stability agreement. They stated that such an accord can only fulfill its mission in stabilizing Central and Eastern Europe if the governments and the legitimate representatives of the national communities reach an understanding on the legal status of the given community. The Hungarian Government believes this can also furnish adequate conditions for talks on the conclusion of bilateral agreements designed to ensure the region's long term stability. The sides noted major, positive steps in bilateral ties between both the governments and ethnic Hungarian organizations, and between Hungary and the governments of Croatia, Slovenia, and Ukraine.
