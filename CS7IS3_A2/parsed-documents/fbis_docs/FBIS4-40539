In spite of the financial and material difficulties, Ukraine has a ready-for-combat army. It does not threaten anyone, however," Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk told servicemen of the First Ukrainian Aeromobile Division stationed in the Bolgrad District. Touching upon "Crimean issues," Kravchuk emphasized that they should be solved only within the framework of Ukraine's Constitution. "Member states of the European Union and other countries support this position. Russian officialdom, including President Yeltsin, is of the same opinion. According to the acting Ukrainian Constitution and the trilateral agreement, Ukraine is a sovereign state and no one is entitled to break its integrity," Kravchuk said. "We will not hamper the autonomous republic's drive for more independence. The official Kiev is ready to consider (Crimea's proposals to this effect). However, it should not be a matter of territory. The territory of our sovereign state is untouchable and no one should surpass the red line. We shall defend our integrity in accordance with the Constitution and shall not permit anyone to neglect our laws," Kravchuk emphasized.
