That is why she has announced a nationwide government holiday on 5 February to show support for the armed efforts of the freedom fighters in Kashmir. By showing full government support, she has shown Pakistani Government's moral, political, diplomatic, and native unity with Kashmir. She has thus stimulated the whole nation against India so that India can be embarrassed, disgraced, and humiliated in front of the whole world. The prime minister of Pakistan had shown unprecedented softness, leniency, pragmatism, and goodwill about Kashmir during Rajiv Gandhi's government. This ended during V.P. Singh's time when Mr. Mohan Singh was appointed the governor. Benazir herself had ended this approach in the Pakistan memory tent during the golden jubilee celebration of the Lahore Resolution. This was her most famous government-sponsored rally. Benazir Bhutto had decided the PPP policy and political action related to Kashmir on the advice of ISI and high military officers. She has thus made the anti-India politics of fundamentalists and religious fanatics ineffective among the people. The young prime minister using her quick wit has become the leader of the hot-blooded people who want to raise Pakistan's flag on Delhi. The United States and India still consider her more liberal than Nawaz Sharif. However, the intensity of her attitude towards Kashmir and India will make her more acceptable to the United States as compared to Mohammed Nawaz Sharif. The prime minister's belief is based on her late father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's declaration that if necessary Pakistan will fight with India for a thousand years. Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, to counter the great internal pressure over Kashmir, has decided to follow the policy of going with the people. The protest strike of 5 February actually declares her government's intention to make Kashmir an international issue at any cost and will use its all resources to this end. Benazir Bhutto's appeal asking people to observe a strike for Kashmir has been so strong and effective that even her chief opponent Mian Nawaz Mohammed Sharif has announced his unconditional support for her. He has announced his decision to cooperate with the government to help make the government's strike plans against India successful. This will be the second most important strike after the Indira-Abdullah pact in which the whole government machinery will be joined by the joint opposition groups. After the 5 February strike and using it as a referendum, the government will find it easier to present a bill to nullify the Shimla pact in the Parliament. No internal or foreign efforts can be made to ask for Kashmir's total separation from India, its joining Pakistan, or becoming independent as long as the Shimla pact is there. That is why Benazir Bhutto has decided to follow her new policy. *
