It was the "International Day of the Rights and Interests of Consumers" yesterday. Shenzhen's Industrial and Commercial Bureau, Consumers' Committee, and some production enterprises took to the streets and shopping arcades to publicize protection for the rights and interests of consumers and ways to identify fake and shoddy commodities. The Tianhong Shopping Plaza was crowded with people. Suddenly someone called out that "Chief Justice Bao [a strict and impartial official from the Song Dynasty called Bao Zheng] had come." People turned round and actually saw a dark-faced "Chief Justice Bao" escorted by "Zhang Long" and "Zhao Hu." It turned out that Shenzhen's New Century Drinking Water Science and Technology Company Limited had adopted an original approach and had invited some actors to play the parts of "Chief Justice Bao" and his subordinates to act for the people and to strictly enforce the law. The shoppers rushed headlong toward "Chief Justice Bao" and complained to him about fake and shoddy commodities. According to the latest Shenzhen Consumer's Committee statistics, 60 percent of the complaints were about fake and shoddy commodities. Nearly all high-grade and brand-name commodities in Shenzhen, no matter whether they were imported or made in China, including watches, electrical appliances, garments, foodstuffs, wines, cigarettes, leather shoes, leather bags, and even "mouse detectors [shu biao qi 7857 2871 0892]," which most people are not quite familiar with, had counterfeit equivalents. "Chief Justice Bao" was invited to protect the interests of the consumers and the publicity effects were quite good. This shows the deep hatred of the consumers toward fake and shoddy commodities. It is learned that Shenzhen City will inspect all imported foodstuffs with fixed packaging beginning 1 April and anti-counterfeit signs will be stuck on qualified commodities before they can be sold. In Shenzhen, 97 activities have been conducted citywide to crack down on fake and shoddy commodities beginning late December last year. Over 5,650 shops and stalls have been inspected, 522 cases of producing and selling fake and shoddy commodities have been handled and the people involved punished, the operation of 326 shops and plants has been suspended for reorganization, 28 illegal plants have been banned, and more than 23,000 counterfeit items, under 23 categories and amounting to over 530,000 yuan, have been seized.
