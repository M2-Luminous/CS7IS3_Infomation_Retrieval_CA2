Imbued with a profound sense of responsibility, officers of this special unit have played an active role in the first national flight safety month this year. At present, over 10,000 airplanes fly daily on 845 civil aviation routes nationwide. To ensure smooth and safe flights for airplanes, the Air Force aviation control unit has developed a comprehensive system of air traffic control rules and regulations, such as basic flight rules and flight control regulations, which are compatible with China's national conditions. The Air Force has allocated 40 percent of its radars operating daily to serve the needs of civil aviation. Moreover, the Air Force has vacated nearly 400 military aviation training (?fields) and has revised 27 military routes for civil aviation purposes. As a result, no air accidents due to inadequate aviation control have been reported for several decades.
