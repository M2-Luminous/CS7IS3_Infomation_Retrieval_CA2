Novak: "Chernobyl Threatens With New Punishments"] [Text] I remember warnings voiced in 1986, following the accident on the fourth block of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Scientists predicted that its consequences will be felt long after the catastrophe. However, these opinions were withheld from the press by censors, and any forecasts that did not match the official standpoint were deemed as a provocation and panicking. Further events proved that official declarations were a pack of lies that caused suffering to many innocent people. This is why today, everything that concerns the Chernobyl accident is not being rejected without looking into it with maximum attention. This is not being done for the sake of scaring anybody, but for the sake of protecting the health and lives of the living and future generations. These opinions belong to Volodymyr Yavorivskyy, Ukrainian Supreme Soviet Chernobyl Committee chairman and were expressed at a news conference devoted to the revelation by Russian Doctor of Geology V. Kopeykin. The latter spent seven years conducting tests at the contaminated zone around Chernobyl. Speaking at the news conference, Professor Kopeykin, in particular pointed out that enhanced activity of certain radionuclides have been observed since the accident. In his opinion, previous forecasts regarding the dissolution of the radioactive fallout were erroneous. Thus, it was believed that plutonium would be discovered there within 10 to 14 years after the accident, but it appeared in 1987, in subterranean waters in the vicinity of the "red forest" where nuclear waste was buried. By the way, even then, official sources did not reveal the whole truth, and there were claims that only 3 percent of the plutonium had been emitted into the environment. According to V. Kopeykin, the content of the hazardous component was no less than 30 percent. Professor Kopeykin believes that those forecasts did not take into account the laws of the geochemical migration of radionuclides. According to his calculations, the area contaminated with plutonium is about 100 square kilometers. Other hazardous elements, including americium-241 and icyrium-241 [as published], whose period of disintegration reaches hundreds of years, were found in the area too. These elements are particularly dangerous to the human liver. The mentioned radionuclides were discovered not only in subterranean waters, but also in cuts of pines, birches, and apple-trees growing in the zone. It is surprising that the scientist's research has received no attention from the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. The Academy disregarded the official invitation and did not send its representatives to the news conference. Concluding the conference, Volodymyr Yavorivskyy emphasized that problems connected with overcoming the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident must be resolved jointly by Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and the entire European community.
