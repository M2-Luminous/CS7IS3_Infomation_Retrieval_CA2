ACTION: Notice of proposed rule (NPRM); extension of comment period. SUMMARY: This document announces an extension of the comment period on Notice 92&hyph;18, entitled, ``Rules of Practice for Federally Assisted Airport Proceedings,'' Docket No. 27783 (59 FR 29880, June 9, 1994). The notice provided a comment period extending until August 8, 1994. The comment period for the notice is extended until September 15, 1994. The extension responds to requests by the Airports Council International_North America (ACI&hyph;NA), the American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE), and the Air Transport Association of America (ATA). The extension will permit interested parties additional time to develop comments and will provide commenters the opportunity to consider the effects of any legislation adopted by Congress that may affect the proposed policy and rules. DATES: The comment period is being extended from August 8, 1994, to September 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be mailed, in triplicate, to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket (AGC&hyph;10), Docket No. 27783, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591. All comments must be marked: ``Docket No. 27783.'' Comments on this Notice may be examined in room 915G on weekdays, except on Federal holidays, between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Barry Molar, Airports Law Branch (AGC&hyph;610), Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591, telephone (202) 267&hyph;3473. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 9, 1994, the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) and the FAA issued two related notices on the subject of Federal policy on airport rates and charges. A notice of proposed policy entitled ``Proposed Policy Regarding Airport Rates and Charges,'' listed and explained the principles that the OST and the FAA believe define Federal policy on the rates and fees that an airport proprietor can charge to aeronautical users of the airport. (59 FR 29874). Notice 94&hyph;18, a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Rules of Practice for Federally Assisted Airports,'' proposed detailed procedures for the filing, investigation, and adjudication of complaints against airports for alleged violation of Federal requirements involving rates and charges and other airport-related requirements. By letters filed in both dockets, ACI&hyph;NA, AAAE, and ATA request an extension of the comment period for both notices. The commenters request an extension because they believe that additional time is needed to coordinate with members of each organization and formulate a position, and because legislation now under consideration by Congress could require DOT/FAA to make changes in one or both notices. The commenters request an extension of 4 weeks from the date a conference report is issued on the pending legislation or from the date of enactment of new legislation. In order to provide persons interested in the notices the opportunity to consider their positions in light of congressional action, and to provide additional time to prepare comments, the OST and the FAA find that it would be in the public interest to extend the comment period for a reasonable time. Accordingly, the comment periods for the notice of proposed policy and the notice of proposed rulemaking are both extended from August 8 to September 15, 1994. In the event that legislation is enacted that requires that a final policy statement and final rule be issued by a certain date, the OST and the FAA may issue a subsequent notice shortening the comment period if necessary to meet the statutory deadline for a final rule. Notice of any further change in the comment period would be published in the Federal Register . Issued in Washington, DC, on August 3, 1994. Mark L. Gerchick, Chief Counsel, Federal Aviation Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19555 Filed 8&hyph;5&hyph;94; 4:26 pm] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
