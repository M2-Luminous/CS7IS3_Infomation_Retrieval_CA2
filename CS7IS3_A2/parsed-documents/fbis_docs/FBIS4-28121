Doi urged the lower house's Steering Committee Chairman Keiwa Okuda to draw up a concrete plan based on a personal plan that she has put together through study meetings she has held since she assumed the Diet post in August 1993. It is very unusual for lower house speakers to refer to the steering committee their own ideas for reforming the Diet. In her personal scheme, Doi advocates promoting the Ethics Council to become a new standing committee on "political ethics" by which the Diet can promptly deal with scandals involving politicians and clarify structural cause of corruption. To effectively deal with scandals, the new committee should be entitled to summon people to a session to testify under oath, according to her plan. In Doi's plan the press would be allowed to take pictures of witnesses testifying before the Diet. At present, the Diet prohibits the press from taking any pictures while testimony is under way to protect the rights of witnesses. Also, Doi recommends setting up a new Diet Information Center to provide easy public access to the minutes of both plenary and committee sessions. In the future, Doi said, the Information Center should establish a data base that can provide people with past remarks by government officials in the Diet on various subjects.
