Yesterday, the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court announced its decision to reject Xi Yang's appeal and uphold the original verdict of the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court at the first hearing, namely, a 12-year prison sentence with two-year deprivation of political rights. The court charged Xi Yang with ignoring the law of the land, stealing and prying into state financial and economic secrets, and publishing the stolen information abroad in the press. His act constituted the crime of stealing and prying into state secrets and was an especially serious case at that. Tian Ye, in the capacity of a state functionary, violated the state security ordinance and stole, pried into, and illegally provided state secrets. His act constituted the crime of stealing, prying into, and illegally providing state secrets, and was an especially serious case also. The truth of the crime committed by Xi Yang and Tian Ye is clear and the evidence conclusive and sufficient. What criteria were used to measure the penalty? Was the penalty too heavy or not? The "Supplementary Stipulations on Punishing the Crime of Disclosing State Secrets" made by the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee contain the following clauses: "He who steals, pries into, buys, and illegally provides state secrets for institutions, organizations, and personnel outside Chinese borders," "in an extra serious case, shall receive a prison sentence of 10 years or above, life imprisonment, or the death penalty and deprivation of political rights." The lightest penalty is a 10-year jail sentence and the heaviest is the death penalty. Because the two people adopted a positive attitude in pleading guilty and showed signs of repentance, they were handled leniently. Some people set the "Criminal Procedural Law of the People's Republic of China" against the "Supplementary Stipulations on Punishing the Crime of Disclosing State Secrets" of the NPC Standing Committee, criticizing China for "inconsistency" in the choice of legal provisions for prosecuting Xi Yang. This is sheer nonsense. Quoting the "Supplementary Stipulations" was to establish a basis for the measurement of penalties and quoting the criminal procedural law was to classify the criminal prosecution as a case involving state security and theft of state secrets, which required a nonpublic hearing. Since it involved state secrets, the court was duty-bound to protect state secrets from being divulged in the course of the trial, so a nonpublic hearing was required. No country would, while taking legal action against theft of state secrets, exhibit the secrets to be protected, still less publish to the outside in great detail the confidential figures of the losses caused to the state after the defendant has denied any losses to the state. If China had done so, it is certain that foreign hostile forces would have been able to find out more about China's capabilities in meeting contingencies, various plans for handling crises, and resources and means that can be employed. The big slippage and fluctuation of renminbi last June and July was not good for the national economy, the people's livelihood, or the overall situation in the country. The Chinese Government treated it as a major matter and handled it accordingly. If all the operational measures for stabilizing renminbi were divulged, the contingency measures were bound to lose their effect, giving speculators something to take advantage of. It would cause further slippage of the renminbi rate and undermine the stability of China's political situation. Xi Yang grew up in mainland China and once served in the army. He was at one time a reporter with a newspaper publisher in Beijing. Someone like him who received long periods of education in citizen ethics and the legal system naturally knows the state security law and the serious consequences of violating it. His obtaining secrets through Tian Ye by illegal means points to his awareness that he was stealing state secrets, which he candidly confessed afterward. Some people believe that "one country, two systems" means using Hong Kong's legal standards to handle the issue of guilt and innocence in the mainland. If the executive personnel of a newspaper published in Hong Kong wish to obtain some confidential information, they can instruct reporters to "run the risk to overcome the obstacle" and get hold of it. Even if it is a state secret or confidential document, they can also take as they like without being restricted by the law of the mainland system. What is the "risk?" And what is the "obstacle?" They regard the criminal act banned by the mainland law as a "risk" and refer to the act of obtaining the secrets that the Chinese authorities have time and again requested functionaries at all levels not to divulge as "overcoming the obstacle." This means some people are openly despising and challenging the laws of the Chinese mainland. This dangerous argument finally led Xi Yang into a dangerous situation and landed him in the misfortune of imprisonment. Xi Yang's case is in essence a criminal case of violation of the mainland China's law. It is a question of abiding by the law or violating the law, not an issue of freedom of press. Hong Kong has its own security laws. If, when the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar plummeted to the level of one U.S. dollar to 9.6 Hong Kong dollars in September 1983, someone had colluded with some official in the financial department and got hold of the relevant confidential documents, facts about the abortive effort to salvage the market by flight from the U.S. dollar and the proposal for pegging the exchange rate, both the official and the reporter who had pried out the secrets through the official would have violated the law and faced prosecution. Each year, thousands of Hong Kong reporters go to the mainland to gather news. There are many reports that criticize China and cases of fabricating stories to vilify the Chinese Government have also happened. But no reporter involved has ever been subjected to criminal investigation by China. Therefore, the freedom of Hong Kong reporters in conducting journalistic reporting is protected. However, Xi Yang ventured into the forbidden zone of the criminal law and colluded with a civil servant to steal and pry into secrets. This act of violating the criminal code is naturally punished according to law. Therefore, it does not make sense to equate a criminal act with news gathering. The implication of Xi Yang's case is this: No matter who you are, you must not test the law in your own person, but must respect and observe the laws and regulations of the mainland. While in the mainland, one must abide by the mainland's law; while in Malaysia, one must abide by Malaysia's law; while in Taiwan, one must abide by Taiwan's law. This is an easy point to see for anyone with some common sense. One aspect of "one country, two systems" is that the mainland should enforce mainland laws and Hong Kong should enforce Hong Kong laws. After 1997, even the People's Liberation Army forces stationed in Hong Kong must observe the law of the Special Administrative Region. Why do some people advocate that Hong Kong people do not have to observe mainland laws when they are in the mainland? This idea that one does not have to observe the law is detrimental to the implementation of "one country, two systems."
