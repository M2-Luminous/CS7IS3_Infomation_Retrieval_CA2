FR941007-1-00013 FR941007-1-00001 In this section, the Department builds on the crosscutting analysis presented above to outline an approach for analysis of three types of energy-related emissions_sulfur oxides (SO X ), nitrous oxides (NO X ), and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). The focus on these three emission categories reflects a similar focus in recent U.S. legislation and international agreements, most notably the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Department recognizes that there are other types of emissions, such as particulates, carbon monoxide, air toxins, volatile organic compounds, solid wastes, and water discharges associated with energy use. Moreover, consideration of the entire fuel cycle may reveal additional environmental externalities at the extraction or transportation stages of the cycle. The Department welcomes comment and evidence regarding the importance of other types of externalities that may arise through these and other emissions pathways that are not discussed below. Comments that are structured so as to address the same generic- and externality- specific issues raised in this notice, while also identifying other issues unique to particular pollutants or media, would be particularly helpful. Each of the discussions of the individual pollutants addresses a common set of issues as well as points specific to that emissions category. The common issues are: Issue 10: The local, regional, national, and global externalities associated with each type of emission. Issue 11: The impact of a change in appliance efficiency standards on emissions, taking account of both direct impacts and the indirect effects arising from existing regulatory structures. Issue 12: Evidence regarding the impact of change in emissions on the level of environmental damage to external parties. Alternatively, if damage cannot be estimated directly, evidence regarding cost-based measures available as surrogates. Issue 13: The impact and relevance of a change in appliance efficiency standards on the emission control obligations of external parties. Finally, it is important to note that the relationship between price and marginal cost discussed as a crosscutting issue will be relevant to the determination of whether an application of an incremental externality value is appropriate in those cases where an environmental or energy security externality is identified. a. Sulfur Dioxide Sulfur dioxide emissions are implicated in environmental effects at the local, regional, and global level. At the local level, sulfur dioxide is one of the criteria pollutants for which ambient air quality standards are established under the Clean Air Act. At the regional level, sulfur dioxide is a precursor of acid rain, an issue addressed in Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. At the global level, the 1992 Supplementary Scientific Assessment of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identifies sulfate aerosols as a potentially significant offset to greenhouse warming that may be caused by increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Based on its present information, the Department believes that attention in this rulemaking should focus on externalities related to the acid precipitation pathway, and therefore on the regional effects. On the local level, there is already widespread attainment with ambient air quality standards for sulfur dioxide. On the global level, the effect of sulfur dioxide emissions as an offset to greenhouse warming remains speculative, and its value may be undercut by its extremely short duration relative to warming from greenhouse gases. The acid precipitation issue is addressed in Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Beginning in the year 2000, its provisions implement a national cap on utility sulfur dioxide emissions of 8.9 million tons together with a system of tradable allowances for allocating the burden of emissions reduction in a cost-effective manner. The cap reflects a reduction of roughly 50 percent from 1980 emission levels. The Department expects that the national emissions cap will be binding and, concomitantly, that allowance prices will be positive. The Department notes that allowance transactions at positive prices are being recorded in increasing number, and there are no known projections that suggest a non-binding cap. Under a binding cap, reductions in SO 2 emissions at one location due to reductions in electricity demand would free up emissions allowances, the use of which could increase allowable emissions at other locations, unless allowances were ``banked''. With no change in overall emissions, the Department has no basis for assuming that alternative appliance standards would cause any change in environmental damage levels. However, a net national environmental externality benefit could occur if the pattern of emissions changes across alternative standards is one that systematically reallocates emissions from locations where they inflict low marginal damage to locations where they inflict high marginal damage. Based on its current information, the Department would assume that emissions reallocation from reduced electricity demand is environmentally neutral. If the Department were to determine that emissions reallocation was not environmentally neutral, the development of damage estimates would become an issue. In this case, the Department would rely heavily on the current criteria document for sulfur dioxide, and on the report of the recent National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP), a 10-year, $500 Million assessment effort. The Department welcomes comment on these and other potential sources of damage information.
