Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch, made the remarks Friday [25 March] in response to reporters' questions about the amendment to the New Territories Land (Exemption) Bill, which was proposed by a legislator and supported by the Hong Kong Government. Since the law amendment is an important matter straddling the 1997 handover, Zhu said, consultations between China and Britain are necessary according to the Sino-British Joint Declaration. As for the traditional interests and rights of the New Territories inhabitants, Zhu said the Basic Law of the future special administrative regions has specific stipulations. Article 40 of the Basic Law says that "the lawful traditional rights and interests of the indigenous inhabitants of the `New Territories' shall be protected by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region." Article 122 says that "in the case of old schedule lots, village lots, small houses and similar rural holdings, where the property was on 30 June 1984 held by, or, in the case of small houses granted after that date, where the property is granted to, a lessee descended through the male line from a person who was in 1898 a resident of an established village in Hong Kong, the previous rent shall remain unchanged so long as the property is held by that lessee or by one of his lawful successors in the male line." Zhu pointed out that the Legislative Council, an advisory body of the Hong Kong British authorities, has no right to make law amendment. He criticized some people for trying to cause divisions and confrontation among the Hong Kong people and sabotage social stability in the territory by taking advantage of the amendment.
