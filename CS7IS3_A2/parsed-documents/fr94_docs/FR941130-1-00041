FR941130-1-00041 FR941130-1-00011 In order to become accredited under OSHA's NRTL program to perform MSHA testing and evaluation, a laboratory would have to submit an application to OSHA which provides sufficient information and detail demonstrating that it meets the requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.7. As part of its application, the laboratory also would identify the scope of the NRTL-related activity for which it seeks recognition. This would include identifying those specific testing and evaluation methods set forth in MSHA product approval regulations that the laboratory would use to test and evaluate the product being submitted for MSHA approval. Based on pre-rulemaking discussions between MSHA and OSHA, the Assistant Secretary for OSHA would consider MSHA testing and evaluation requirements set out in 30 CFR parts 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29, 33, and 35, or other testing and evaluation requirements which MSHA determines under 30 CFR 6.20 are equivalent to the requirements in those approval parts, to be ``alternative test standards'' as defined in 29 CFR 1910.7(d), which provide an ``adequate level of safety'' for products to be used in gassy underground mines. However, unless otherwise specifically indicated by OSHA, the MSHA testing and evaluation requirements considered as ``alternative test standards'' shall not be used to test and evaluate products for use in workplaces other than gassy underground mines subject to MSHA jurisdiction under the Mine Act. Under OSHA's Appendix A to ยง1910.7, an on-site assessment of the testing facilities of the applicant laboratory, as well as its administrative and technical practices, would then be conducted by OSHA. The assessment team selected to evaluate the capabilities of the laboratory desiring to test to MSHA approval requirements would be a joint OSHA/MSHA group, including MSHA personnel skilled in the details of MSHA testing and evaluation requirements. Although under its regulation OSHA has the authority to contract with outside personnel to perform the on-site assessment, OSHA has agreed that this critical responsibility would not be contracted out to private sector personnel for evaluating applicant laboratories seeking recognition to perform MSHA testing and evaluation. The subagreement to the Interagency Agreement between MSHA and OSHA would specifically eliminate this option for the MSHA program. It is the Assistant Secretary for OSHA who has the authority to grant recognition to an NRTL or to expand, renew, or revoke such recognition. However, MSHA staff would participate in all aspects of the process for determining whether an application for recognition of an NRTL to perform testing and evaluation for MSHA product approval should be approved. This would include preparation of written reports of on-site assessment, review of any public comments received regarding the laboratory's application for accreditation, and participation in any special review or informal hearing ordered by the Assistant Secretary for OSHA to address public objection to an applicant's request for recognition by OSHA. MSHA personnel also would participate fully in any action to expand, renew, or revoke recognition of an NRTL to perform the testing and evaluation necessary under MSHA's product approval regulations. In this manner, MSHA would be assured that the applicant laboratory is capable and has complete understanding of the testing and evaluation requirements, procedures, and protocol specified in MSHA's product approval regulations. All these areas of MSHA participation in the OSHA process to accredit an NRTL to perform MSHA testing and evaluation would be delineated in the subagreement between the agencies. As required under this paragraph (a) of the proposed rule, once an NRTL has been recognized by OSHA to perform testing and evaluation for MSHA approval of a particular product, the manufacturer seeking approval of that product must submit to MSHA, as part of its application, the NRTL testing and evaluation results along with a statement of product compliance with the applicable MSHA approval requirements. It is at this point that the MSHA review process would begin. MSHA would initiate an administrative review of the application package upon receipt to ensure that the applicant had included all of the necessary information to process the application. This information would include, among other things, a complete description of the product, product drawings and specifications, the NRTL product testing and evaluation results, the NRTL statement of product compliance with the applicable MSHA approval requirements, and payment of the nonrefundable MSHA application fee. If the manufacturer has submitted an incomplete application package without all the information required, MSHA immediately would notify the applicant of the deficiency by mail. MSHA would then hold the deficient application for a reasonable period of time, without further processing, while awaiting a response from the manufacturer. If the applicant fails to respond to the MSHA request for additional information to complete the application package within a reasonable time, MSHA would cancel the application and the applicant would forfeit the application fee. Applications submitted without the required application fee would be considered invalid.
