He is Yuriy Tikk, a Defence Ministry adviser, government spokesman Ain Saarna told reporters on Friday. His area of responsibility is law enforcement in the town which was closed to foreigners until recently. Paldiski is the country's only place which held no local elections and Tikk will represent the central government until local self-management is introduced there. Various estimates put the number of town residents from 6,000 to 7,000 with 1,200 of them belonging to the Russian naval base there. There are about 200 ethnic Estonians who are eligible to stand in local elections. The envoy is given two weeks in which to draft proposals for solving the town's problems. Simultaneously, the Interior Ministry is instructed to register all town dwellers by the end of March and the Justice Ministry given two weeks to put forward proposals on the legal basis of local self-government. Colonel Raul Luks who was appointed by President Lennart Meri as military administrator of Paldiski has been at work since January 1. He is responsible for any decision making linked to Russian pullout from the town. A trainload of machinery and equipment needed for dismantling nuclear reactors crossed the Estonian-Russian border en route to Paldiski on Friday, the spokesman said.
