But I fully agree that we are at a decisive stage, while finances and the economy have found themselves in a sense on the top of a mountain," said Russia's Acting Finance Minister Sergei Dubinin in an interview with Vladimir Gurevich, MOSCOW NEWS Deputy Editor-in-Chief. If we are atop a mountain pass we can only go down in any case. The question is what will go down, whether we will secure a reduction of inflation or roll down the mountain side ourselves. Expectations of a mounting inflation and then of a financial collapse resulting from the actions of the present government are quite widespread today. These may be deceptive expectations. In any case no steps towards a catastrophe have been taken so far. As for inflation in the near future, it will certainly go down to about 15% in February compared to 21-22% in January. But everybody is talking about major injections of money on account of the last years' government debts. Everybody also says that debts should be repaid and begin to count how much the treasury owes them. Meanwhile all obligations for expenditure under the budget drawn up last summer and submitted to the then Supreme Soviet were fulfilled by the government. There would have been no debts if expenditures had not been indexed in the fourth quarter. Besides that some people are fond of counting debts only one way. The agrarians, for instance, borrowed heavily in 1992 but returned very little in 1993, and there was no big fuss, although the sums were very large. The government is now repaying some of its debts. A decision has been made to pay in the first quarter 3.8 trillion rubles on account of contracts concluded last year. This is a comparatively safe level with respect to inflation. We will not induce the collapse of the financial system. It should also be pointed out that the entire situation is a stern warning to the government itself when it undertakes further obligations. There is a case in point now that the discussion of this year's draft budget is under way. The draft was drawn up with great difficulty but has been made sufficiently strict, as it should be. The planned budgetary deficit of 54 trillion rubles, plus the repayment of about 60 trillion rubles of 1993 debts makes it possible to keep the finances within permissible limits. It is envisioned that 19 trillion of this deficit will be covered by external borrowing, 4.5 trillion by state bonds and the rest by credits from the Central Bank. Boris Fyodorov makes a much more pessimistic appraisal. He believes that in reality the deficit of this year will exceed critical limits and reach 100 trillion rubles. This will happen if the proverbial "financial blanket" is torn to pieces during and after the draft's discussion. But today I hold a more optimistic view. It is realistic to expect, under the draft budget, the reduction of inflation by the end of the year to 10% a month and maybe even lower. More serious results could be expected, but I am not sure this is realistic in the present situation. By the way you are, along with the First Deputy Minister Andrei Vavilov, conducting another round of negotiations with IMF which usually links its credits to the realization of "more ambitious" results. We expect representatives of the fund and the G-7 countries to also be realistic. No one hopes, of course, that they will pull us out of the crisis, but the situation would have been much more grave without their assistance. What and who else do you count on? On just yourself? The question is not very correct, but aren't you pressed by the word "acting" preceding your title? I find even some advantages in it, for nobody expects something special from me, but if I manage to do more... I count on the Finance Ministry's team which is a strong one largely thanks to Fyodorov. And I certainly count on the premier who supports our draft budget. This is important since, in my view, he is fully in control of the situation in the Cabinet. Finally, I count on cooperation with the Central Bank, without which it is difficult to think about financial stability. It was somewhat unexpected but we met with the Central Bank's call for even a "stronger" policy than the Finance Ministry itself planned. How do you explain this? Is Mr. Gerashchenko satisfied with Fyodorov's departure and ready to offer his assistance? I explain this by the fact that the Central Bank has looked beyond the edge of the abyss, has assessed the consequences of the possible financial injection of which we spoke. Everyone will have to answer for a collapse. The situation is very tense: one or two steps can lead us to conditions in which nobody will be able to do anything and a financial collapse will become inevitable. According to forecasts, this may happen in the autumn. This has an inertia of its own. The rise in prices occurs over two months, we inject money today and have a flare-up of inflation in two months. To start an uncontrolled hyperinflation would require, I think, six to seven months. Then we would have 40% monthly inflation by autumn, 50% by the end of the year, and things would finally get out of control in the first quarter of the new year. I consider the prevention of hyperinflation my main task, although it is in fact only a minimum task, and I shall consider myself successful if inflation falls from its present level. What do you consider the main threat? It is the fact that our society is built on a corporative or, more simply, a sectoral basis. Various "corporations" are drawn into the escalation of demands. If this is not firmly resisted, in time the pressure will grow so that resistance will be almost useless. Are you a supporter of high duties on imported goods? I am ready to agree to demands for sky-high duties on the import of agricultural products based on the argument that every country in the world protects its own farmers by high taxes on agricultural imports. But then we must tell our consumers that this means a sharp rise in food prices. Second, we should look honestly at what will happen to our agricultural sector if it's protected from competition. Will this raise its efficiency or will it remain the same? It was protected before, why didn't it develop greater efficiency then? The logic of producers is clear: the tax on imports should be raised and taxes on production should be lowered. An increasingly popular idea of late is that most taxes should be lowered or cancelled altogether and the budget should be formed from two sources: the tax on the extraction of raw materials and the tax on land. These taxes are easier to collect, incomes will be more stable, and manufacturing industries, freed from the tax pressure, will begin to develop. But what will raw-materials' industries, crushed by this tax, begin to do? They will further raise prices of their goods which will reach manufacturers and affect them as badly as taxes do. Do you think that the present tax system works well? Even though tax contribution to the budget has diminished? It was about 16% of the gross national product in the first quarter of the last year, then went down to 9% and rose somewhat by the end of the year. Still I must say that the existing system works quite well. During two years we introduced a complicated tax, the VAT, which is functioning. But the tax arrears are immense. Let me specify. The arrears of taxes, which have been accurately calculated, total 4.5 trillion rubles. The defaulters have been identified, but they don't pay. Because they have nothing to pay with. But besides, arrears there are sums which are concealed from taxation, which are, according to estimates, immeasurably higher. They are great indeed, but I would not say that their share is unprecedented. In the United States with its immensely developed tax laws, great experience and "tax abiding" traditions, only 80% of tax that should theoretically be collected is actually collected, and 20% is concealed. We collect about 60%, which, incidentally, greatly impressed foreign financial experts who expected a much lower figure. But if you think that 40% of concealed taxes makes me happy you are badly mistaken. Have you agreed to make very complicated and difficult decisions? It seems to me that such decisions would have to be taken anyway. It is, of course, possible not to take them and let all proportions in the economy be formed in a purely market way, but they will actually develop under the powerful impact of various interests. It should be pointed out that interests within economy complexes, within industries are also contradictory. Can the present government be successful? It seems to me that the current government situation closely corresponds to the situation in society where none of the major political blocs has a stable majority. Any political homogeneous government would now serve as an object of political passions. But then any government formed by various forces as a coalition one would be much too amorphous and unable to do anything. Today we have a government of technocrats, managers of production who are prepared to obey the premier who is politically neutral enough. The president as well, did not align himself with a specific party during the elections. As a result, we have a government which can act more successfully in this situation than we could have expected.
