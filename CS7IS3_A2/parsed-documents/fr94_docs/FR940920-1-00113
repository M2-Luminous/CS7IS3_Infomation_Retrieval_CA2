FR940920-1-00113 FR940920-1-00010 A verbatim transcript of the hearing and written statements will be available for public inspection and copying during normal working hours at the EPA's Air Docket in Washington, DC (see ADDRESSES section of this preamble). B. Docket The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to or otherwise considered by the EPA in the development of this proposed rulemaking. The principal purposes of the docket are: (1) To allow interested parties to identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participate in the rulemaking process, and (2) to serve as the record in case of judicial review (except for interagency review materials) [Section 307(d)(7)(A)]. C. Office of Management and Budget Review 1. Paperwork Reduction Act. This rule does not contain any information collection requirements subject to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. 2. Executive Order 12866 review. Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant'' regulatory action as one that is likely to lead to a rule that may: 1. Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; 2. Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 3. Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, users fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or 4. Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, the EPA does not consider this action to be significant because it does not involve any of the above mentioned items. D. Regulatory Flexibility Act Compliance Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq , I hereby certify that this proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have an economic impact on small entities because no additional costs will be incurred.
