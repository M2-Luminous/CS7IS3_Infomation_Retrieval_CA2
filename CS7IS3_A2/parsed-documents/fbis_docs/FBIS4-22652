A key event was the withdrawal by 31 August 1993 of Russian troops from Lithuanian territory, which finally eliminated the main irritant in the relations between the Russian Federation and the Lithuanian Republic. A new stage ensued. However, the negotiating process did not get any easier. Shortly after, a number of important agreements were signed during the visit of the head of the Russian Government to Vilnius on 18 November 1993. This event became the practical implementation of the agreement achieved in the course of the meeting of the presidents of Russia and Lithuania in Moscow on 4 November 1993. The emphasis in the work of the Russian delegation shifted to the preparation of agreements to ensure the normal vital activity of Kaliningrad Oblast and the problems associated with this. But the Lithuanian side was in no hurry to activate the dialogue at the level of official delegations. As a result, despite our repeated appeals and proposals, the Lithuanian partners, beginning with November of last year, stubbornly remained silent. A long break occurred in the work of the delegations, the end to which did not occur until 21-22 March of this year, when our delegations met in Moscow. It is already apparent from this how unconvincing the statements of the Lithuanian representatives sound about readiness for negotiations on any subject and the need to intensify the process of the Russian-Lithuanian negotiations. On our part, we always were for energetic work on problems on the widest possible front. It is sufficient to refer to the fact that we have already submitted two dozen drafts of various kinds of agreements. On the whole, the March round of negotiations, in our assessment, proceeded in a sufficiently businesslike way. The Lithuanian delegation arrived in Moscow with a new membership. While in the past, a majority of its members consisted of representatives of the political opposition that had an interest in discussions of a general nature, now they have been replaced by specialists and practical workers. Despite the differences that remained between us as before in approaches to individual problems, this made it possible to work on specific questions for a great part of the time. A draft of an agreement was initialed on entry points on the Russian-Lithuanian border. In the end, a list of 12 draft agreements was coordinated that will be worked on in priority order by our delegations and corresponding working groups. On this list are drafts of agreements on cooperation in the sphere of nuclear energy, pension guarantees, principles of work activity of citizens of the Russian Federation in Lithuania and Lithuanians in Russia, and others. An agreement was reached on conducting a meeting in April in Vilnius of experts of both sides on questions of civilian motor vehicle and railroad transit, including additional work on a draft temporary agreement on mutual travel of citizens, and afterwards on a meeting of experts of the customs services of Russia and Lithuania this month in Moscow. We would like to count on a positive outcome of these negotiations, keeping in mind that at the end of April and the beginning of May our delegations could conclude work on yet another group of drafts that regulate questions of civilian traffic to and from Kaliningrad Oblast. But if this is not done, then the position will prevail that results in the dissatisfaction of both sides. There still remain for us inconveniences and difficulties of visas, customs, and other areas in the sphere of transit, especially motor vehicle, through Lithuanian territory. But the Lithuanian side, in its turn, cites our failure to put into effect an agreement signed on trade and economic relations. At the same time, it seems to have practically forgotten the provisions of the Russian-Lithuanian declaration of 30 August 1993, and also the package of agreements at a working meeting of the Russian and Lithuanian presidents in Moscow on 4 November of the same year. After all, at that time there was talk not only about the need to come to an agreement in the sphere of transport and about Russian military pensioners, but also about accelerating work to conclude agreements about guaranteeing the normal vital activity of Kaliningrad Oblast. But, after all, it is precisely the latter that do not exist to this day. Russia still has not been answered on these questions with reciprocity. Therefore, under the situation that has developed, it would be pointless to count on the immediate enactment of an agreement on trade and economic relations in which Lithuania would receive most favorable treatment in trade with Russia It is especially necessary to talk about Russian military transit to Kaliningrad Oblast and from it through Lithuanian territory. For the time being, it exists on the basis of our verbal agreements. The Lithuanian side also proceeds on the basis of provisions of the agreement on the transit of troops and military freight of the Russian Federation being pulled out of the FRG(!) On the one hand, Lithuania seems not to deny the reasonableness of the endeavors of Russia to maintain unobstructed communications with part of its own territory, which Kaliningrad Oblast is. On the other hand, the Lithuanian side does not conceal its desire to come to an agreement about the organization of Russian military transportation exactly on the basis of a bilateral agreement (we have already turned over our draft of such an agreement). Judging by everything, the matter is moving now to the adoption by the Lithuanian authorities of some kind of unilateral decisions that establish the rules for the shipment of military and dangerous freight of any foreign states over the territory of the Lithuanian Republic. But about what kinds of more or less significant foreign military shipments, other than Russian, can there be a realistic discussion? An attempt is also being made now to neutralize the need for a bilateral agreement on this question in Lithuania with the help of the expression of "concern" regarding the alleged excessive presence of military troops in Kaliningrad Oblast--a kind of threat to the security of Lithuania. In addition, it is true, at least official Vilnius admits that it does not sense "any kinds of aggressive efforts of Russia, and any kind of real threat on its part." From our standpoint, even given the presence of some kinds of general rules, our countries, nevertheless, should establish in a treaty procedure the conditions for Russian servicemen and freight to transit through Lithuanian territory. We are also conducting negotiations on the delimitation of borders between the Russian Federation and the Lithuanian Republic. Although statements have been made repeatedly in Vilnius about Lithuania's lack of any kind of territorial claims on Russia, the position of the Lithuanian side on the demarcation of the territorial sea, which, from our standpoint, contradicts the UN convention of 1982 on maritime law, is beginning to create certain difficulties in the negotiations. Finally, I would like to touch on one more subject that is continuously present in Russian-Lithuanian negotiations. These are problems that directly affect the life of ethnic Russians in the Lithuanian Republic (the Lithuanian delegation, on its part, comes out with various kinds of claims against us). In Lithuania, as is known, it was possible to avoid serious complications on national questions and on questions of citizenship. However, this does not entirely mean that there are no difficulties at all in this sphere. They simply have another character than, for example, in Latvia and Estonia. It must be noted that the Lithuanian side, despite our proposals, has already been refusing over the course of a long time to examine the draft of an agreement on cooperation for the purposes of ensuring the rights of ethnic, linguistic, cultural, and religious minorities. At the same time, references are made to pertinent legislative acts in effect in Lithuania that meet generally acceptable international norms. From our standpoint, the presence of any kind of national decrees does not at all rule out the possibility of a bilateral agreement between the Russian Federation and the Lithuanian Republic. Moreover, if our approaches to guaranteeing the rights of minorities are really close or coincide, this fact would only facilitate the achievement of an agreement on this score. In conclusion, I would like to note that on the whole we look with optimism to the prospects of Russian-Lithuanian negotiations. I am convinced that, despite all of the difficulties and problems, our countries have real opportunities for the development of mutually beneficial good neighbor relations. Without forgoing Russia's interests, our delegation is ready to go halfway to meet the necessary agreements for expanding and strengthening the treaty and legal bases of Russian-Lithuanian relations.
