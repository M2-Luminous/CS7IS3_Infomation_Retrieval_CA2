Related Rulemaking Actions On May 21, 1970, the FAA published Amendment 91&hyph;78 to part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (35 FR 7782), which provided for the establishment of Terminal Control Areas (TCA's). On June 21, 1988, the FAA published the Mode C final rule (53 FR 23356). The Mode C rule requires, in part, that aircraft operating within 30 miles of a Class B airspace area (formerly known as TCA) primary airport (the Mode C veil) to be equipped with an operable Mode C transponder. On December 17, 1991, the FAA published the airspace reclassification final rule (56 FR 65638). Specifically applicable to this NPRM is the reclassification of TCA airspace into Class B airspace, effective September 16, 1993. Nevertheless, the FAA did not modify any of the Mode C veils under the airspace reclassification final rule. Background As a result of regulatory proceedings initiated under Notice 88&hyph;2 (53 FR 4306, February 12, 1988), no person may operate an aircraft in the Mode C veil unless that aircraft is equipped with an operable Mode C transponder. However, aircraft otherwise authorized or directed by ATC; aircraft not originally certificated with an engine-driven electrical system or not subsequently certified with such a system installed; balloons; and gliders are excluded from the Mode C requirement in the veil. In response to over 65,000 comments received to Notice 88&hyph;2, the FAA stated that it would consider a means of providing access to outlying airports within the Mode C veil for those aircraft not equipped with an operable Mode C transponder; and that access would be allowed only to the extent that operations without an operable Mode C transponder would be consistent with maintaining adequate safety. SFAR No. 62 was proposed (55 FR 21722; May 25, 1990) to permit the operation of aircraft to and from designated airports within the Mode C veil without an operable Mode C transponder. When SFAR No. 62 was adopted (55 FR 50302; December 5, 1990), the FAA designated 306 airports, within 24 Mode C veils, at which the Mode C requirement would be suspended. SFAR No. 62 allowed for the operation of aircraft not equipped with an operable Mode C transponder in the airspace at or below the altitude specified for the airport and within 2-nautical miles of the center of the airport or along the most direct and expeditious routing (or on a routing directed by ATC) between that airport and the outer boundary of the Mode C veil, consistent with established traffic patterns, noise abatement procedures, and safety. Prior to the adoption of SFAR No. 62, any requests to deviate from the Mode C transponder requirements were handled by ATC facilities on a case-by-case basis. If approved, the ATC authorization specified all restrictions or conditions necessary to ensure that the operation could be conducted safely, without any impact on other operations. Although there were circumstances that were applicable to many operators (such as operations to and from a specified outlying airport or operations conducted in areas of no radar coverage), ATC authorizations had to be requested and granted on an individual basis. This aspect of the ATC authorization process proved to be inefficient and time consuming for both operators and ATC staff. The promulgation of SFAR No. 62 proved to be beneficial for the affected aircraft and ATC, in that it provided access to outlying airports with a minimum of ATC involvement without degrading the safety benefits of the Mode C rule. The 3-year duration of SFAR No. 62 was expected to allow for the completion or ATC radar system upgrades at each Class B airspace area primary airport. An operational evaluation was to be completed to determine the extent of the improved radar coverage within each Mode C veil achieved as a result of the radar system upgrades. It was anticipated that if extensions to the suspension of the Mode C transponder requirement for operations at certain airports were required, each extension would be addressed on a site-by-site basis. During the period that SFAR No. 62 was in effect, no known violations or derogations of safety were known to have occurred and no complaints were received by the FAA. Consequently, the FAA still believes, as stated in the original promulgation of SFAR No. 62, that the operation of an aircraft not equipped with a Mode C transponder within the Mode C veil can be accommodated safely, provided the operations are conducted outside ATC radar coverage, and are consistent with the restrictions delineated in the expired SFAR No. 62. The Proposal In support of the FAA's General Aviation Action Plan, which in part promotes increased access to airspace and eliminating unneeded equipment requirements for General Aviation (GA) aircraft, this notice proposes to reinstate and amend the former SFAR No. 62. This proposal will permit the operation of aircraft, without an operable Mode C transponder, in the airspace at or below the specified altitude and within a 2-nautical mile radius, or, if directed by ATC, within a 5-nautical mile radius, of an airport listed in section 2 of the SFAR; and in the airspace at or below the specified altitude along the most direct and expeditious routing, or on routing directed by ATC, between an airport listed in section 2 of this SFAR and the outer boundary of the Mode C veil overlying that airport, consistent with established traffic patterns, noise abatement procedures and safety. This proposed SFAR and the amended altitude designations for each airport would not supersede the provisions of ยง91.119, minimum safe altitudes. Routings to and from each airport are intentionally unspecified to permit the pilot to avoid operating near obstructions. As of the date of this notice, only 10 of the 24 Mode C veils have commissioned the new radar systems. This notice proposes to reinstate, without change, the exclusions previously afforded to airports associated with the 14 Mode C veils that have not commissioned the new radar systems. The FAA has conducted operational evaluations of the 10 sites that have commissioned the new radar systems to determine the extent of attained radar coverage improvement. Of the 10 sites evaluated, 6 experienced no increase in radar coverage at the altitudes and routing previously approved under SFAR No. 62. The FAA proposes to reinstate the exclusions formerly provided for by SFAR No. 62 at these 6 sites without change. Four sites have experienced improvement in radar coverage, and this notice proposes the following changes to the altitudes at which operations by aircraft not equipped with an operable Mode C transponder can be accommodated at those sites:
