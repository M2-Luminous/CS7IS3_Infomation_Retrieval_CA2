FR941220-0-00077 FR941220-0-00013 The Commission believes that the criteria articulated in IAS 22 are sufficiently clear so that companies and their auditors can be expected to apply the guidance in a consistent manner to similar transactions. Although different from the criteria in U.S. GAAP, the criteria in IAS No. 22 provide a rational and effective basis for distinguishing the substantively unique transactions for which the special accounting treatment is appropriate. The criteria in IAS No. 22 appear sufficiently rigorous to restrict the use of uniting of interests accounting to a relatively small class of similar transactions. The Commission believes that financial statements of foreign private issuers that distinguish business combinations on the basis specified by IAS No. 22 will provide information that is sufficiently informative and useful to investors without a reconciliation of that departure to U.S. GAAP. In evaluating the concerns expressed about the effects on comparability of the proposed use of IAS 22, the level of comparability under current U.S. accounting principles needs to be examined. Although the two accounting methods of ``purchase'' and ``pooling'' prescribed by U.S. GAAP produce very significant financial reporting differences, many transactions that are accounted for in the U.S. as poolings of interests are difficult to distinguish economically or structurally from transactions accounted for as purchases. Because the criteria qualifying a transaction for pooling under U.S. GAAP are restrictive, a registrant is rarely if ever compelled to account for a transaction as a pooling if it does not want to do so. The registrant may elect to avoid pooling accounting through essentially nonsubstantive modifications of merger terms or other insignificant actions. Under IAS 22, it is even more difficult to qualify a business combination as a uniting of interests, or pooling. Many transactions that would quality for pooling under U.S. GAAP would be accounted for as purchases under IAS 22. As under the U.S. rule, issuers could elect to avoid pooling accounting by the essentially subjective designation of an acquirer. On balance, it would appear that using the provisions of IAS 22 to determine whether a combination is accounted for as a purchase or pooling will not materially affect the comparability of financial statements. A substantial degree of comparability will be retained under the rules adopted today because they provide that the effects of differences in amounts determined upon application of either the purchase or pooling methods of accounting would continue to be quantified. For example, if the acquisition method is applicable to a business combination under IAS 22, differences between the amounts assigned in the issuer's primary financial statements to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities and those amounts as would be determined using the purchase method applied in accordance with U.S. GAAP must be identified and quantified in the reconciliation. If a determination has been made pursuant to the criteria in IAS 22 that the uniting of interest method is appropriate, then differences between the accounting used in the primary financial statements and the accounting that would be required for a pooling of interests under U.S. GAAP must be included in the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP. In response to comments, language in the amendment has been modified to more clearly describe the continuing requirement to reconcile the amounts that would be reported under U.S. GAAP for the particular method of accounting that was determined to be applicable using the criteria contained in IAS 22. As suggested by many commenters, the new provisions will not be available with respect to business combinations that are promoter transactions, leveraged buyouts, mergers of entities under common control, or reverse acquisitions. The final rule indicates that those types of transactions would continue to be required to be reconciled in full to U.S. GAAP. The rule also states that other business combinations that are not addressed by IAS 22 are not eligible for relief from reconciliation. III. Accounting for Goodwill and Negative Goodwill The amendments also eliminate the requirement that foreign private issuers quantify the effects of differences arising from the period of amortization of both goodwill and negative goodwill, as proposed. Under IAS 22, goodwill and negative goodwill is amortized over a period not exceeding five years unless a longer period, not exceeding twenty years, can be justified. Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 17, ``Accounting for Intangibles'' (AFB 17''), requires the amortization of goodwill or negative goodwill over its useful life, except that the period cannot exceed forty years. Some commenters raised concerns about the proposed rule because the resulting amount would not be comparable to U.S. GAAP. However, if the primary financial statements reflect an amortization period that complies with IAS 22, a reconciliation of differences in goodwill amortization periods does not necessarily improve the comparability of financial statements in a material fashion. U.S. companies presently exercise substantial judgment in selecting an amortization period for goodwill, and significant differences among similarly situated companies can be seen among companies reporting to the Commission. The accounting differences between IAS 22 and APB 17 are not so opaque as to result in the loss of material information to investors. If the useful life of goodwill or amortization period of negative goodwill exceeds five years, justification of the longer period is required by paragraph 72 of IAS 22 to be furnished in a note to the primary financial statements. Registrants will continue to be required under both Item 17 and 18 of Form 20&hyph;F to describe the accounting differences, even where relief from quantification of differences is granted by this rule.
