Speaking to reporters after the agreement was signed, Yasushi Akashi, the U.N. envoy to the former Yugoslavia, said the cease-fire includes an exchange of prisoners and information on those still listed as missing. The agreement was inked by top representatives of the Bosnia's Muslim-Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serbs. Akashi described the agreement as a "first step" toward the full-scale cease-fire in Bosnia. Under the agreement, the parties will resume negotiations in near future to seek a full-scale cease-fire. Akashi had been pressing for a four-month cease-fire, the Bosnian Serbs had demanded a one-year halt of hostilities and the Muslim-Croat Federation had wanted a month-long agreement.
