Last year 35 civilian conflicts and armed disputes took place, leaving eight dead and causing direct economic losses of 140,000 yuan, a decrease of respectively 66 percent, 62 percent, and 79 percent as compared with the previous year. In preventing civilian conflicts and armed disputes, all levels of the departments were firm in implementing the central and provincial arrangements, were quick to act, and were efficient in their measures. Early last year, the provincial government signed agreements with the relevant prefectural, city, and provincial departments on preventing and mediating civilian conflicts and armed disputes. They organized personnel to mediate and resolve 29 cases of civilian conflicts. Ganzhou, Jian, and Jingdezhen authorities conducted a no-armed-dispute campaign this year, and they were successful.
