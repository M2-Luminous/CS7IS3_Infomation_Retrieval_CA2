FR940124-0-00004 FR940124-0-00001 However, the statute is inconsistent with the regulations in that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) vets the Director of the DEQ with the responsibility for processing petitions and determining awards, whereas Chapter V of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure assigns this responsibility to the Council. Since 43 CFR 4.1291 requires that petitions be filed with and processed by the administrative review entity that decided the underlying case, the Secretary finds that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) is inconsistent with the Federal regulations to the extent that it assigns this responsibility to the Director of the DEQ, who has no formal administrative review function, rather than the Council. Therefore, the Secretary is not approving the phrases ``by the director'' and ``as the court or the director deems proper'' in the first sentence of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f). Nothing in these actions shall be construed as eliminating the ``deems proper'' standard of review or as vesting the Council with the authority to review or decide petitions for the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection with judicial proceedings. The Secretary is disapproving the entire phrase ``as the court or the director deems proper'' to avoid creating a situation in which only the court would have the authority to assess awards under the Wyoming statute, as could be the case if only the clause ``or the director'' within that phrase was disapproved. The Wyoming rules also lack a counterpart to 43 CFR 4.1294(a)(2), which allows an award of costs and expenses to any person from the permitte if the person initiates an application for review of alleged discriminatory acts pursuant to 30 CFR part 830 (since recodified as 30 CFR part 865) upon a finding of discriminatory discharge or other acts of discrimination. However, nothing in SMCRA or the Federal regulations requires that State programs include a counterpart to section 703 of the Act or its implementing regulations at 30 CFR part 865. Any person who believes they have been discriminated against in violation of this section of the Act has the right to file an application for review directly with OSM in accordance with 30 CFR part 865. Any resulting hearings would be held by the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of the Interior in accordance with 43 CFR part 4 and the applicant would have the right to file a petition for an award of costs and expenses under 43 CFR 4.1294(a)(2). Therefore, the Secretary finds that Chapter V of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure, as submitted on August 18, 1982, and revised on March 9, 1993, is not inconsistent with the Federal requirements concerning the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection with administrative proceedings, as set forth in section 525(e) of SMCRA and 43 CFR part 4. Accordingly, the Secretary is approving these State rules. 2. Award of Costs and Expenses: Contested Case Requirement Wyoming has revised both W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) and Section 2.a.(3) of Chapter V of DEQ's Rules of Practice and Procedure to provide that participants in administrative proceedings may recover costs and expenses only if the proceeding is a ``contested case'' proceeding, although the regulations use this language only in connection with awards from the State, not awards from other parties. Section 525(e) of SMCRA provides for the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection with ``any administrative proceeding.'' Prior to the State's adoption of the amendment under consideration in this rulemaking, W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) contained similar language. Although neither the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act (EQA) nor the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure directly define ``contested case,'' Chapter I, Section 2.a. of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure indicates that all definitions contained in the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act, which does define this term, are incorporated by reference. However, Sections 1 and 2.a.(4) of Chapter I of the DEQ Rules define the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act as W.S. 9&hyph;4&hyph;101 through 9&hyph;4&hyph;115. These citations appear to be in error since Title 9 of the Wyoming Statutes does not pertain to administrative review of agency actions. The correct citation appears to be W.S. 16&hyph;3&hyph;101 through 16&hyph;3&hyph;115, which W.S. 16&hyph;3&hyph;101 (a) and (b)(xi) identify as the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. The Secretary encourages Wyoming to correct this citation error. W.S. 16&hyph;3&hyph;101(b)(ii) defines ``contested case'' as ''a proceeding including but not restricted to ratemaking, price fixing and licensing, in which legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are required by law to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for hearing but excludes designations under W.S. 9&hyph;2&hyph;1022(h)(i).''
