At a joint press conference with visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton, Yeltsin said the "Partnership for Peace" plan proposed by Washington and endorsed at the NATO summit was "a good formula." The practice of accepting one member at a time was "not going to do anyone good," he added. Clinton, arrived here Thursday on a three-day visit, had several meetings with Yeltsin and discussed a wide range of issues. They signed a trilateral agreement with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on dismantling the 176 nuclear missiles and more than 1,500 nuclear warheads Kiev inherited from the former Soviet Union. Washington and Moscow also signed an agreement to stop targeting their long-range nuclear missiles at each other and other nations. On Bosnian issue, Clinton and Yeltsin acknowledged they reached "no conclusive results" but said they had had "honest and good conversations" on the topic. Trying to lower the expectations of a possible NATO air attack on the Bosnian Serbs, Clinton emphasized that the new NATO initiative was mainly designed to "further the U.N. mission" rather than "pretending" to settle the conflict. With Moscow facing an ailing economy, Clinton urged Russia to care more about its ordinary citizens and create security net to cushion the hardship brought by the economic reform. Stressing that he would press forward with radical economic reform, Yeltsin said he had been upset by the slowness in acting upon the assistance package agreed upon last July in Tokyo, Japan, by the seven major industrialized nations. However, Yeltsin singled out the United States for his words of praise, saying most of the 1.6 billion U.S. dollars of aid Clinton promised in Vancouver, Canada, in March of last year, have been delivered. Clinton was quick to add that the G-7 will speed up the pace in helping Russia, saying Moscow's willingness to continue the reform "will be met positively" by the West. "Billions of dollars" of Western aid will flow to Russia in years ahead, he promised. This is Clinton's first trip to Europe since he took office a year ago. His later stops will be Minsk, Belarus, and Geneva, Switzerland, where he is to meet with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad on the Middle East peace talks. He is expected to make two more trips to Europe later this year, including participating in this year's G-7 meeting in Naples, Italy, in July. Clinton has invited Yeltsin to join him in Naples and to visit Washington this fall.
