Gen. Oleksiy Kryzhko by Senior Lt. Zhurets: "Nuclear Disarmament Has Already Started, But It Unfortunately Will Not Get By Without Flies in the Ointment"] [Text] A minimum of 200 nuclear warheads from strategic missiles will be shipped from the territory of Ukraine to Russian reprocessing plants over ten months of this year. That is the amount stipulated by the trilateral declaration signed by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States and Russia in Moscow. After the dispatch of the first sixty weapons from the strategic missiles located in Ukraine to Russia, however, the leadership of the MO [Ministry of Defense] of Ukraine had to clarify and alter the schedules already approved for the later transport of the nuclear ordnance. Why was this done, and will it have any consequences? Our correspondent posed those questions to the chief of the Center for Administrative Management of the Strategic Forces of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Lt. Gen. Oleksiy Kryzhko. O. Kryzhko: The process of withdrawing the ordnance is a very crucial matter; both for the state and for the people. And it has to be done under certain conditions that ensure nuclear security, chief among which is confidentiality. These issues, with references to well-informed sources in the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, are unfortunately being covered in great detail in the pages of the press both here and in the Russian Federation, as well as on television, right down to indicating the timetables and destinations, if there are warheads and how many, and what routes will be taken. This in no way conforms to the conditions under which this process has to take place. I believe that it is enough for the broad public to know that the process of the removal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine has begun on a nationwide scale. S. Zhurets: Is this circumspection connected with the possibility of the threat of terrorist acts? O. Kryzhko: It is connected with literally everything. I do not have in mind here only the threat of terrorism. This is a question of the normal process of ensuring nuclear security. It is necessary, after all, to prepare a railroad with all of its services, guarantee the fulfillment of measures pertaining to ensuring nuclear security, and prepare our combat services with the support personnel, the bases from which the warheads are sent, and the bases that are receiving them. It is a very broad circle of issues, in the resolution of which chance cannot be tolerated. S. Zhurets: Recent statements by the press service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on this score are saying that certain forces in Russia have a vested interest in slowing down, or even breaking off, the planned withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, so as ultimately to accuse Ukraine of slowing down the process of nuclear disarmament. I would like to know your point of view. O. Kryzhko: That is the first time I have encountered that interpretation. I have constantly felt pressure on the part of the Russian Federation, for the last year and a half, that Ukraine begin the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from its territory as quickly as possible. We saw the same strivings in the negotiations on the nuclear problem with specialists from Russia. And today, at the level of the technical fulfillment of the decisions that have been made, we all feel the same striving toward accelerating, and not slowing down, the process of withdrawal of nuclear warheads from Ukraine. S. Zhurets: Nonetheless, Ukraine is now forced to specify the routes and schedules for transporting the nuclear combat units. Doesn't that specification of the schedules affect Ukraine's fulfillment of its obligations with regard to deadlines? O. Kryzhko: No, it in no way affects it. Ukraine is fulfilling the obligations it has assumed. S. Zhurets; Does the 43rd Army have sufficient capabilities with regard to manpower and equipment so that the process of deactivating the strategic missiles and withdrawing the nuclear warheads to Russia can take place without any deviations and tensions? O. Kryzhko: As for the technical aspect, we have everything necessary, with the exception of a sufficient quantity of power resources -- fuels and electric power. We have lately begun to receive fuel from the Americans; true, a rather small amount, in accordance with agreements and signed treaties -- several tonnes of gasoline and diesel fuel. They are promising to supply us with an additional quantity of fuel at the end of March. We are seeking out every opportunity to fulfill our obligations as stipulated in the trilateral declaration. So that we do not look to all the world as people who say one thing and do another. S. Zhurets: Thank you for the interview.
