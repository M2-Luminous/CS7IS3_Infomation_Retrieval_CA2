Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae, examining the prospects for inter-Korean relations in 1994, said, "A momentous turning point will come about. The government will establish a new attitude in its reunification policy." The following is the government's reunification policy as disclosed by Vice Minister Song during an interview with MUNHWA ILBO. [Kim] What is the direction of the government's reunification policy for the new year in order to resolve the stalemate in inter-Korean relations? [Song] A momentous turning point will come about this year for the progress of inter-Korean relations. Therefore, our reunification policy will establish new features both in domestic policy and in the policy toward the North. Internally, we will develop a picture of the reunified fatherland and induce national consensus. The reunified fatherland will be a state where freedom, human rights, and welfare are embodied and where law and morality prevail. For this, the features of the reunified state should be embodied within South Korea in the first place. This is why our country's reform process must succeed. Reform is a prerequisite for reunification. In our policy toward the North, we will strive so that the nuclear issue can be resolved and inter-Korean relations can enter the stage of reconciliation and cooperation. We will do our utmost so that the working delegates' contact for the exchange of special envoys, which was suspended last year, may be resumed as soon as possible. [Kim] In connection with our policy on the North Korean nuclear issue, the most controversial point was the policy of linking the nuclear issue with economic cooperation. Will you continue to maintain this policy? [Song] Since the nuclear issue is directly connected with our nation's survival, the highest precedence should be given to resolving it. As long as the nuclear issue remains unresolved, practical progress in inter-Korean relations is improbable. It was in this perspective that we linked the nuclear issue with economic cooperation. Therefore, we will maintain this policy. I think that our policy of linking the nuclear issue with economic cooperation demonstrated to the international community our determination to resolve the nuclear issue and contributed to strengthening the international cooperation system. [Kim] One of our main concerns this year is the issue of exchanging special envoys. If the exchange of special envoys is realized, what issues will be discussed there? [Song] There are differences between the two sides over the mission of the envoys exchanged. We think the special envoy would be a messenger who would convey the will of the top leaders of each side. The North side assigns the special envoy the role of discussing the pending issues between the North and the South, such as the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, alleviation of tensions, the implementation of the North-South Agreement, the great national unity, and the North-South summit talks. To narrow this difference, we will have to have working contacts, but our position in exchanging special envoys is that the highest precedence must be given to resolving the nuclear issue. North Korea also mentioned the nuclear issue when it proposed the exchange of special envoys. The North shares our position in the sense that it put forth the issue of denuclearization at the top of the agenda. On all accounts, the main point in the agenda in the exchange of special envoys is to bring a breakthrough in resolving the nuclear issue. [Kim] North Korea-U.S. negotiations to find a solution to the North Korea nuclear issue are currently underway. What is your view? [Song] Since negotiations are underway, it is not easy to have concrete prospects at present. However, it is clear that the two nations do not want a catastrophe to result if the negotiations fail. I think that the possibility of resolving the North Korean nuclear issue is greater than ever before. [Kim] What is the part to be changed above all in the government's policy on North Korea in the event that the North Korea-U.S. negotiations are concluded successfully? [Song] The expected result in the current negotiations would be a complete return of North Korea to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and acceptance of inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. However, our position is that mutual inspections between the North and South should follow. In the event that agreement is reached on the mutual inspections and those inspections are carried out, our government will allow businessmen to visit the North and will initiate full-scale economic cooperation. We will also pay attention to joint development of resources, including nuclear energy. This will not only result in the exchange of manpower and materials between the North and the South but also will effect unprecedented changes in overall North-South relations. In addition, in the event that North Korea accepts all of the ordinary and ad hoc inspections by the IAEA and responds to the exchange of special envoys of the North and the South, the issue of suspending the 1994 Team Spirit exercise will be decided under our government's authority. The issue of turning the Armistice Agreement into a peace agreement, which is closely related to consolidation of peace on the Korean peninsula, is clearly prescribed in the basic agreement. Therefore, we will make efforts to resolve this issue with the initiative. [Kim] What were the noteworthy changes, if any, in North Korea's movement and attitude last year? [Song] In the political field, North Korea has been reinforcing Secretary Kim Chong-il's system. In view of the fact that North Korea admitted the failure of the Third Economic Plan, we estimate that the North Korean economy is in a serious situation. In the social field, the phenomenon of deviation [iltal] has persisted despite the authorities' control. Even amid the difficult economic situation, North Korea pushed ahead with the expansion of armaments. We can say that its overall internal situation is getting worse. However, it is true that North Korea is seeking a series of changes in a bid to maintain existing systems. For example, the Supreme People's Assembly held last December declared agriculture-first, trade-first, and light industry-first policy. Besides, North Korea is accelerating the overhaul of its juridical system with a view to inducing foreign investment. [Kim] You mentioned changes in North Korea. What is your view on the degree of such changes? [Song] It is true that North Korea is changing. But it is too early to consider this as an essential change. I would like to personally describe it as tactical change. However, we should also remember that when such tactical change is accumulated, this change will be linked to strategic change. One of the examples is that North Korea entered the United Nations together with South Korea. Up until its entrance to the United Nations, North Korea claimed that simultaneous entry was a policy for the perpetuation of division. Nevertheless, it choose the simultaneous entry in order to maintain its system after the international situation changed. In view of North Korea's past logic, this can be considered a great change. Likewise, North Korea will continue to seek changes according to what occurs at home and abroad for the survival of its own system. I think the direction of changes North Korea is seeking would be that of Chinese-style change. I presume that even if North Korea pursues the Chinese model, it will take its own characteristics into account and will push for a limited opening at a lower speed than that of China. [Kim] People repeatedly say that circumstances for reunification have now changed. Will you point out which are beneficial to reunification and which are not in recent relations among neighboring countries? [Song] The neighboring countries of the Korean peninsula support the principle of resolving the reunification issue by the concerned parties, North and South of Korea, as well as the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The fact that our neighboring countries want the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and durable peace are aspects beneficial to us, because the basis of our reunification policy is to advance toward reunification through the peaceful coexistence between the North and the South. Therefore, North and South of Korea should take advantage of this opportunity, and should gather wisdom so that they can ultimately advance toward reunification by consolidating durable peace and through peaceful coexistence. Regarding the effort to consolidate peace on the Korean peninsula, we are somewhat worried about the indication given by some neighboring countries increasing their military power. The movements of Japan and China belong to this category. I think we should take precautions for the possibility of such movements advancing to such a degree as to threaten stability and peace in Northeast Asia. [Kim] It is expected that Japan, which kept step with the United States, will accelerate the speed of contacting North Korea this year. People pointed out that we should also deal with this. [Song] We understand that the Japanese Government will initiate a full-scale negotiation with North Korea for the establishment of diplomatic relations only after the nuclear problem is solved. The United States, Japan, and we are keeping the step with one another under a close cooperative system. This relationship will continue in the future, too. The visits of Japanese businessmen to North Korea do not necessary mean that they are going to start economic cooperation with North Korea at once. Such visits are made in order to make an advance survey of North Korea with the purpose of preparing for compensation to be paid to North Korea by Japan after the establishment of diplomatic relations. [Kim] What are the tasks that should be pushed ahead by North and South Korea as short-range projects to prepare for reunification? [Song] The top priority task is the issue of separated families. This issue stands above any political issue. The North and South reached an agreement in 1992 on the visit of old parents to their hometown. The work of establishing a meeting site for separated families in Panmunjom and exchanging home-visiting groups and letters should be pushed ahead without any precondition. Two years have passed since the basic agreement, which the North and the South pledged before 70 million fellow countrymen, was adopted. We should make efforts so that the work of various joint committees is resumed at an early date to implement the agreement.
