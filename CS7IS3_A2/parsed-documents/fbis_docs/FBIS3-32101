When interviewed by Signal FM on 31 January, Eric Falt, the UN spokesman in Haiti, said this fuel is not humanitarian fuel but rather the mission's reserve. Asked where this fuel comes from and where it is stored, Falt said the administrative and garage service controls the storage of such products. He explained that the UN mission does not have any particular facility to be supplied with fuel. Falt (?denied) any connection between this operation and the arrival in Port-au-Prince last week of approximately 30 members of the UN mission. This is not a redeployment of the mission in Haiti, he stated.
