In an interview with this reporter, Wen Han-chang, chairman of the Sai Kung District Board, said: The main role of a district board is to extensively consult public opinion, thus enabling residents to get involved more effectively in district affairs. It is a local consultative organ whose main role is to serve as a bridge between residents and the local administrative organs of the Hong Kong Government. He pointed out that all board members being elected by voters is the development direction of a democratic political system. This is of no doubt. However, in Hong Kong, which has long been under British rule, the general public has a very poor sense of democracy and inadequate enthusiasm about participating in district affairs. Moreover, the voter turnout rate in every previous election has been low. This being the case, retaining a certain proportion of appointed seats will ensure that board members will have broader representation and the interests and opinions of residents in different trades and social strata can be balanced and taken into account. This way of doing things is still necessary. Wen Han-chang suggested: As far as the composition of district boards is concerned, the Legco model can be adopted; that is, the number of appointed seats can gradually be cut and in the end all seats will be elected by the voters. As for the composition of the 1994 district boards, the number of appointed seats could be cut from the current one-third to about one-fourth. For the following term, the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region could decide whether appointed seats will be cut further or if all seats will be elected by voters. Wen Han-chang said: Of the 19 district board chairmen, 18 have clearly expressed their demand for Hong Kong Governor Patten to retain a certain proportion of appointed seats in the composition of the 1994 district boards. Moreover, numerous members of the district boards in Hong Kong have also submitted a joint letter to the Governor to voice the above-mentioned demand, but he has paid no heed. This is indeed a perfect irony of the so-called principle of "being open, fair, and acceptable to the people of Hong Kong," which he has asserted again and again. Wen Han-chang hoped that the current extensive collection of board members' signatures of support would help urge Governor Patten to withdraw the partial electoral bill he has submitted to Legco and retain a certain proportion of appointed seats in the composition of the 1994 district boards.
