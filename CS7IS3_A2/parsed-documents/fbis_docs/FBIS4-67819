The program includes a factual account by the correspondent on the crisis around the DPRK's nonobservance of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. A studio discussion is chaired by Ilyashenko with Aleksandr Panov, deputy minister of foreign affairs and Professor Anatoliy Torkunov, rector of the Institute of International Relations. Panov says that in view of the high troop concentration on the border between the Korean states the situation is very volatile there. He goes on to call for a multilateral international conference on the problem, saying: ``We believe that we should, that it is right to use the channels in existence -- the Security Council, certainly -- but since the bilateral variant is not working, let us then go back to the idea of a multilateral conference. It should be said that no one has yet -- but we have only just put this idea forward -- no one has yet, as they say, swept it aside -- even the DPRK, although when I explained this initiative to the North Korean ambassador in Moscow he already knew about the initiative and did not react negatively to it. ``Other countries are also studying it. The United States have come out and said that in principle they believe that such a conference should be well prepared -- and we agree -- and they have already put forward a set of positions that should be reinforced during the conference. These are the unconditional and full return of the DPRK to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. All of this coincides with our policy. But we need to go further. We need to give some sort of guarantee to North Korea and ensure the nonnuclear status of the Korean peninsula and the sovereignty of the Korean states and nonintervention in their internal affairs. So, there is a complex of measures to go through before we can solve this problem.'' Asked what the treaty between Russia and the DPRK would mean in the event of a deterioration in the military situation on the Korean peninsula, Panov says: ``As the legal successor of the Soviet Union, Russia continues to fulfill the commitments of that treaty. It has not been denounced and the only thing, of course, is that the situation has changed, and therefore we have made a statement of which the DPRK has been informed: How we interpret the article that stipulates assistance and support for the DPRK in the event of an emergency situation of the kind.'' ``It was stated that assistance would be given only in the event of an unsanctioned aggression against the DPRK. We ourselves will analyze the situation on the basis of our own sources of information and how the problems are dealt with. We will assess the degree of threat, the degree of aggression and its character, and we will operate within our legislation and our Constitution, and we will certainly take into account Russia's international obligations -- for instance those under the International Atomic Energy Agency Treaty and the UN Charter. So our position here is quite clear.'' When the discussion turned to the possibility of UN sanctions against the DPRK, Panov says: ``We believe that matters should not be brought to the level of sanctions and that if it is impossible to solve this within the framework of the Security Council, then there is the option of a conference. That is to say, there is quite a way to go before we arrive at sanctions. We need to use every option.''
