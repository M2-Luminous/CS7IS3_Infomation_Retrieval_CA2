If the ministry ever does grant an export license for weapons shipments to Iran, it will only be in accord with international interests, according to international agreements, and following a tough licensing process, Mazanek said. He emphasized that no UN sanctions were currently in place against Iran as there were against Libya and Iraq, but that Iran nevertheless was considered a "sensitive" area, and consequently weapons deliveries that could be "problematic" would not be condoned. Such deliveries included not only weapons, but components for nuclear power plants. Mazanek said that so far no firm had applied for a license to export parts to Iran for Warsaw Pact-model tanks which had been delivered to Iran in the past.
