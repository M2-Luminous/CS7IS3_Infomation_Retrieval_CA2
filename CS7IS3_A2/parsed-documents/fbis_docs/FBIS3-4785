As is well known, our side proposed an exchange of top-level special envoys of the two sides last May out of an earnest desire to reach a new turning point in North-South relations and the resolution of the reunification issue, and made every effort to implement this proposal at the earliest possible date. And, finally, the two sides had three working-level contacts. However, contrary to what we did, your side constantly pursued nuclear war exercises and an international cooperation system, which negate dialogue. Moreover, at a time the fourth contact was imminent, your side made the violent remarks [pogon] that it would be ready to take military countermeasures [kunsajok taeungdo pulsahal] against the dialogue partner. In this way, your side committed an unreasonable [ondangchimothan] act that discontinued [tujol] the working-level talks. Our side duly sounded an alarm [ungdanghan kyongjongul ulligo] concerning this act by your side and repeatedly called on your side to assume an attitude befitting dialogue [taehwaui ipchang]. However, your side continued the Hwarang, Foal Eagle-93, and other adventurous nuclear war exercises and built an artificial barrier to our working-level contact. If your side had sincerely dealt with [songuirul kajigo taehada] the exchange of special envoys, our working-level contact would have already been concluded [kyolsok] long ago, special envoys would have visited Pyongyang and Seoul, and pending issues acutely raised between the North and South would have been resolved. I think it is very regrettable that our working-level contact has so far not been on the right track [orun kwedoeso] and has not been able to duly contribute to developing North-South relations. A North-South exchange of special envoys is an urgent task [cholpakhan kwaje] that cannot be delayed even for a moment. Therefore, I think it is fortunate that your side has proposed resuming the working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys. Our side consents to [tongui] your side's proposal to resume the working-level contact, acknowledging [injonghamyonso] that your side assumed the position to resume the working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys because your side accepted our demand that your side discontinue all large-scale nuclear war exercises against the dialogue partner and abandon the international cooperation system concerning the nuclear issue. Therefore, we will go to your side's area in Panmunjom at 1000 on 3 March, Thursday, according to pertinent visit procedures to hold the fourth working-level contact.
