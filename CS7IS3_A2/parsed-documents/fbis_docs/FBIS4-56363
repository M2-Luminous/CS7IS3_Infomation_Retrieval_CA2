Arias Cardenas does not see why these two political currents have to oppose each other and fears that there could be persons interested in creating frictions involved. Flanked by CR Senator Lucas Matheus, Mayor Clemente Scotto, and city councillors Simon Yegres (CR) and Davis Odreman (AD), Arias Cardenas added: "There are individuals disguised as revolutionaries who are promoting these confrontations, and I see that they are very interested in creating conflicts." "There should be respect, and agreement is vital. We should remember the sixties and the fratricidal struggles within the left in this country." Arias Cardenas insisted on the need for President Rafael Caldera to continue to take rapid action to complete the process of freeing many of the officers who rebelled on 27 November [1992] and some of those from 4 February [1992] who may still be under arrest, and also the need to seek the reintegration of many young officers into the ranks of the FAN [National Armed Forces]. "Many of those who participated in those movements on 4 February and 27 November--such as Admiral Cabrera, General Visconti, and Colonels Dominguez and Garrido--did so with the firm desire to rebel against a corrupt government that had no legitimacy. There are a large number of higher-ranking junior officers, and it is vital to listen to and hear them." [Gruber] What do you think is hindering the process? "Good will, which is extremely important. I do not know the details of what may be happening, so I found it necessary to postpone until next week my meeting with Andres Caldera, the minister secretary of the presidency. There are situations such as, for example, officers who were discharged with questionable procedures, from a legal point of view. This must be taken into account." On the possibility of being appointed director of PAMI [Mother-Child Food Program] by the government of President Rafael Caldera, Arias Cardenas said: "The fundamental basis for accepting jobs or working is to feel fulfilled by what one is doing. This government is not the same as or like the previous one, nor is it an AD government." "I would have to evaluate it very carefully in view of the opportunities for contributing, for serving, and being useful to the community. In addition, I have a responsibility toward those officers who went along with me in rebelling, believing in my military leadership, and now are unemployed." "This government is different from the previous ones, and will have its critics, its problems. I would have to evaluate it [the appointment] also with the possibility that I would be forbidden to speak with the freedom with which I am speaking now."
