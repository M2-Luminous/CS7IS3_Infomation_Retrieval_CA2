But earlier in the day, Hosokawa told reporters that he is neutral on whether he should reshuffle his six-month-old cabinet within Tuesday. Hosokawa said Monday he was considering an early cabinet reshuffle, which many political sources said may affect Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the SDP, the largest bloc in the seven-party coalition, on Monday denied there would be an early reshuffle. Speculation surfaced Monday that Hosokawa might make changes in his cabinet after Tuesday's adoption by the government of a 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994, starting April 1. The SANKEI SHIMBUN newspaper, quoting sources close to Hosokawa, reported earlier Monday that Hosokawa is resolved to reshape the cabinet as early as Tuesday.
