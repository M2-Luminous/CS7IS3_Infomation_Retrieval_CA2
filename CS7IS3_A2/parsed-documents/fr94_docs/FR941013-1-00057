FR941013-1-00057 FR941013-1-00010 Under the proposed tank standards for existing tanks in which the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in the tank is less than 76.6 kPa, use of air emission controls would be required on tanks having a design capacity equal to or greater than 75 m3 (approximately 20,000 gallons). No air emission controls would be required under the rule for an existing tank having a design capacity less than 75 m3. For tanks having a design capacity equal to or greater than 75 m3, an owner or operator would be required to install and operate air emission controls in accordance with the rule requirements. These requirements specify that, unless the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in the tank is less than certain limits specified in the rule, the owner or operator install and operate on the tank one of the following air emission control systems: (1) A cover that is connected through a closed-vent system to a control device; (2) a fixed-roof type cover with an internal floating roof that is designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of the new source performance standard (NSPS) for volatile organic liquid (VOL) storage under 40 CFR 60.112b(a)(1); (3) an external floating roof that is designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of the VOL storage NSPS under 40 CFR 60.112b(a)(2); or (4) a pressure tank that is designed to operate as a closed system. Under the proposed rule, an owner or operator would be allowed to use a fixed-roof type cover (without any additional controls) for existing tanks having a capacity less than 151 m3 (approximately 40,000 gallons) when the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in the tank is less than 27.6 kPa (approximately 4.0 psi), and for larger capacity tanks when the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in the tank is less than 5.2 kPa (approximately 0.75 psi). The proposed standards for new tanks in which the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in the tank is less than 76.6 kPa would require the use of air emission controls on tanks having a design capacity equal to or greater than 38 m3 (approximately 10,000 gallons). The same types of air emission control systems specified in the proposed rule for existing tanks (e.g., vent to control device, use floating roof, pressure tank, or use of fixed-roof type covers under certain conditions) would apply to new tanks with the exception that the maximum HAP vapor pressure limits allowed for using fixed-roof type covers without additional controls are lower for new tanks than existing tanks. An owner or operator would be allowed to use a fixed-roof type cover without additional controls for new tanks having a capacity less than 151 m3 when the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in the tank is less than 13.1 kPa (approximately 1.9 psi), and for larger capacity tanks when the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in the tank is less than 0.7 kPa (approximately 0.1 psi). The proposed maximum HAP vapor pressure limits selected for existing tanks that would be allowed to use fixed-roof type covers without additional controls are based on the waste vapor pressure limits established for tanks at hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDF) subject to air rules being developed by the EPA under authority of RCRA section 3004(n) (refer to 56 FR 33490). For today's proposed rulemaking, the EPA considered using the maximum vapor pressure limits established for tanks under the NESHAP for the synthetic organic chemical manufacturing (SOCMI) industry (40 CFR 63 subpart G). Because the sources subject to both the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP and the RCRA air rules are similar, the EPA believes it is appropriate to use the maximum vapor pressure limits established for the RCRA air rules for today's proposed rulemaking also. The EPA requests comment on the selection of the maximum HAP vapor pressure limits proposed for the air emission control requirements for tanks under the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP.
