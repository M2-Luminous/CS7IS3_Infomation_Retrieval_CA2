Of course, there was a reason for this skepticism. After all, relations between Russia, which started on the path to democracy, and a united Germany were supposed to be built on a principally new basis. But it is not that easy to establish such a basis in a short time. Especially since both countries are experiencing great difficulties in the economy, the social sphere, and domestic political life. However, daily difficulties have not overshadowed the long-term promising objectives of bilateral cooperation. In the opinion of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Germany remains, as before, a key country for Russia, and an important trade-economic and political partner. Seventeen percent of our foreign trade turnover falls to it. The regular meetings of the top leaders of Russia and the FRG indicate the scale of current Russo-German relations. It is known in Western capitals that no other state leader in Europe will maintain such close contacts with Moscow as Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl. But, of course, by far not everything is smooth in relations between Russia and Germany. First of all, the Germans are disturbed by the fact that until now Moscow has not been in a position to pay its total debt in the amount of DM87 billion, which piled up as far back as Soviet times. To regulate the situation, in 1993 the Russian Federation and the FRG signed an Intergovernment Agreement on Consolidation of the Debt of Russia and the Former USSR, in accordance with which we were granted a deferment for 10 years. Germany is making considerable efforts to include Russia in the system of world economic relations, to a considerable degree assisting the development of Russia's relations with the European Union. There is talk in particular about the formulation of a treaty on cooperation and partnership on conditions that are acceptable to Russia. The Germans are also supporting Russia's officially becoming the eighth member of the G-7, first and foremost in the political sphere. Moscow and Bonn support multilateral contacts on military policy. Joint military-naval exercises of large units of the Russian and FRG navies will be held this year. Troop exercises on the tactical subunit level are also being planned for the future. A center for training and retraining our servicemen who are returning from Germany for civilian specialties was opened recently in the Russian capital with the financial assistance of the FRG. Russia and Germany are activating cooperation in international affairs that has attained significant maturity, first and foremost in UN and CSCE policy. The FRG has declared its readiness to support Russia's application to join the Council of Europe. Bonn, which has many times shown itself a supporter of creating strategic partnership relations between Russia and NATO, supports the inclusion of Russia in the new structures of collective security of Europe. Bonn has welcomed the efforts of Russian diplomacy to lift the crisis situation around Sarajevo, and it supported Boris Yeltsin's proposal on convening a meeting of the leaders of Russia and the leading European states and the United States to consider questions of a Bosnian settlement. Leading circles in the FRG pay appropriate attention to the appeals of representatives of the Russian leadership to use the FRG's influence on the question of observing the rights of the Russian-speaking population in Estonia and Latvia in the spirit of the decisions of international human rights organizations. They believe that the problem of ethnic Russians in these countries should not become a "bone of contention" in interstate relations, and they appraise pertinent anti-Russian statements of individual Baltic leaders as unacceptable and out of place.
