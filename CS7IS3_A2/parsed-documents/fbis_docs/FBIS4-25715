Based on the demand for using society's fixed asset investment, on the investment scope of various investment sources, and on the economic and social benefits and the markets of different projects, investments will generally be allocated to competitive, infrastructure, and public welfare construction projects. Financial investment activities for the construction and operation of competitive projects should be carried out in the market and decided by the enterprises themselves, while investment in infrastructure and public welfare construction projects should be made mainly by the state and the autonomous region. Regional budgetary appropriations should be invested primarily in the construction of agriculture, animal husbandry, transportation, energy, posts and telecommunications, and other infrastructure facilities, as well as in education, science and technology, urban, and other public welfare facilities. The report says: The regional budgetary investment in fixed assets this year has increased 50 million yuan compared to 1993. This is the maximum amount that the region can afford to make in view of Tibet's financial straits. Priority should be given to key projects already under construction, as well as agriculture, animal husbandry, energy, transportation, posts and telecommunications, and other infrastructure facilities. Particular attention must be paid to ensuring adherence to the construction schedule for and the quality of the renovation of the (Yanghuchalong) power station; the revamping of the Qinghai-Tibet, Sichuan-Tibet, and China-Nepal highways; the repair of the (Fangda) airport; and the comprehensive agricultural development project for the Yarlung Zangbo, Lhasa, and Nyang Qu River Valleys. We should deepen the enterprise reform and continue to implement the regulations for changing the operating mechanisms of state-owned industrial enterprises and the regional procedures for implementing these regulations, seeing to it that enterprises can exercise their autonomy in a true sense. We should optimize the organizational structure of enterprises through amalgamation, separation, shifts to other lines of production, and the establishment of enterprise groups. We should expedite the exploitation and utilization of resources to transform our advantage in resources into economic advantage. We should continue to pay close attention to the development of animal, forestry, and mineral products while increasing the variety, expanding the scale, and increasing the value added to products through intensive processing.
