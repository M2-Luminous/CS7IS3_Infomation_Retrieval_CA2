Yuri Vashin, a section chief of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, in his speech at a meeting of representatives of Russian public circles said the New Year address of respected Comrade Kim Il-song, president of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, gives scientific and philosophical conclusions to all questions and clarifies the principled stand of Korea. Noting that the "10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country" put forward by respected Comrade Kim Il-song clarifies the idea of achieving Korea's reunification, the greatest national desire of the Korean people, in a peaceful way on the basis of the confederacy formula, he said there is no other alternative but this. Vasim Rozanov, chief secretary of the Graduates Federation of Moscow State University of International Affairs said he fully supports the policy of peaceful reunification of the country and all principles of external policy set forth by Comrade Kim Il-song in his New Year address. Victor Platov, vice-chairman of the Central Council of the Russian Association of Friendship and Cultural Cooperation with the DPRK, charged that the United States has not yet withdrawn its nuclear weapons from South Korea.
