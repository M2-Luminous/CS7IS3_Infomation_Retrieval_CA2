ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule sets forth the basic policies and procedures that govern the disposition of HUD-held multifamily project mortgages. 1 In general, the Department will sell both current mortgages and delinquent mortgages. HUD will not sell delinquent mortgages, however, if foreclosure is unavoidable, and the project securing the mortgage is occupied by low-income tenants who are not receiving housing assistance but would do so under section 203 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 if HUD foreclosed upon the mortgage. In addition, mortgages on subsidized properties will only be sold with Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance or equivalent tenant protections; mortgages for unsubsidized projects may be sold without FHA insurance. 1 This rule, and the policies contained in this rule are intended to satisfy HUD's obligations under the settlement agreement in Walker v. Kemp, No. C 87 2628 (N.D. Cal.) with regard to the Exhibit B mortgages. DATES: Comments are due June 13, 1994.

Introduction The Department of Housing and Urban Development's inventory of project mortgages is large and growing. The Office of Management and Budget acknowledged this development by designating multifamily property and loan disposition as a High Risk Area. To reduce losses to the FHA fund, to decrease its inventory of project mortgages, to improve the servicing of these mortgages, and to improve the rental services provided by properties securing its insured and HUD-held mortgages, HUD is proposing to resume the sale of multifamily project mortgages. HUD's inventory of mortgages has grown significantly since mortgage sales stopped in FY 1985. As of August 1993, HUD held over 2,400 project mortgages in inventory. (In comparison, HUD's inventory of mortgages totaled 2300 at the end of FY 1991, 1600 at the end of FY 1989, and 1400 at the end of FY 1987.) In August of 1993, approximately 1,100 HUD-held multifamily residential mortgages with unpaid principal balances (UPBs) of $1.5 billion were current and 1,200 with UPBs of $5.6 billion were delinquent. Approximately 874 current mortgages (80 percent of current mortgages) and 310 delinquent mortgages (25 percent of delinquent mortgages) were subsidized. Current mortgages included nearly 400 mortgages assigned under Section 221(g)(4) of the National Housing Act that were current at the time of assignment. Delinquent mortgages included nearly 300 formerly coinsured mortgages. In addition, the HUD-held inventory included 44 nursing home mortgages with UPBs of about $170 million and 10 hospital mortgages with UPBs of about $110 million. In the FY 1992 FHA Audit Report, HUD increased its loss reserves to $11.9 billion for its $43.6 billion of multifamily insurance in force. One of the aims of HUD's mortgage sales program is to reduce these projected losses by increasing the number of mortgages returned to current status and increasing returns to the Federal Government through mortgage sales. B. General Policy In general, the Department will only sell subsidized mortgages with FHA mortgage insurance or equivalent tenant protections. The Department may sell unsubsidized mortgages with or without mortgage insurance. In addition, the Department will sell both current mortgages and delinquent mortgages. The Department will not sell delinquent mortgages that it believes cannot be worked out if the projects securing the mortgages are occupied by low-income tenants who are not receiving rental assistance but who would be eligible to receive rental assistance under section 203 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 (HCDA of 1978) if the mortgages were foreclosed upon by HUD. The Department will sell delinquent mortgages on such projects that it believes can be worked out. While the Department would not expect it to be needed, purchasers of such mortgages would retain the option of foreclosure because the ability to foreclose facilitates work-out activity.
