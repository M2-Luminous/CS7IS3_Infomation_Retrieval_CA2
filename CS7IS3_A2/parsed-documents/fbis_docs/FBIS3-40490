The following are ideas to be used for enhancing the drive for further research and development. Also, at the same time, surveys and studies in order to properly grasp the deep geological environment, the technical development of the highest level and validity for design and construction work of artificial barriers and disposal sites, the near field performance evaluation, and further advancement on the reliability of the multiple barrier system are considered especially important items. Importance of Grasping the Concept of Reciprocal Relationship with Natural Phenomena Survey Studies of Geological Environment Conditions. With respect to geological environment condition survey studies, viewing from the point of underground waste disposal, further focus on geological environment condition is important in obtaining a long term safety security. It is necessary to develop and improve survey, measuring techniques and related instruments in order that highly reliable and substantial data of the deep underground geological structure, the distribution of rocks and strata, rock-bed materials, hydro-geology characteristics and the earth chemical characteristics of underground water can be accumulated. On the other hand, historical records of activities created by natural phenomena such as volcanic activities, earthquakes, fault activities, upheavals and erosions, weather fluctuations, and changes in ocean surface should be made and together, it is important to evaluate the possibility of the influence these effects might have on the multiple barrier system. At this point, not only is the evaluation of individual natural phenomenon important but it should include into consideration the reciprocal relationship of each phenomenon in order to obtain a collective picture. Also, with natural phenomena such as volcanic activities which are thought to be area dependent, there exists the importance and necessity of appropriately evaluating the phenomena of the area by further developing evaluating methods and techniques. Furthermore, in addition to effects from natural phenomena, large scale human originated activities such as forestry conservation work and resource development can influence geological environment that should preferably be investigated. Tests for Assumed Severest Conditions Research Development for Waste Disposal Techniques. With respect to research and development for waste disposal techniques concerning artificial barriers, upon clarifying the required businesses, it is necessary to perform research and development with strong emphasis on developing a highly reliable artificial barrier. In regards to overpack, a long term durability research and development should be continued for carbon steel and at the same time, it is desirable that materials other than carbon steel such as titanium should be investigated. Also, it is necessary to advance investigations of design and production including the soundness of welding of the overpack. As for the buffer, using clay (bentonite) as the main product should be of central concern, but other new material should be investigated widely on its individual characteristics and methods. In regards to operational methods, security in performance is of utmost importance and therefore, research and development for large scale testing is necessary. For the technical development of the waste disposal site design, construction and operation, it would be important to plan improvements on the basis of various elements in technology such that an overall combined technique composed of analytical, inspection and application be included. Furthermore, it is desirable that investigation on long term stability of caves and drifts be tested under assumed severe conditions for safety. The Expansion of Radioactive Material Data Base Performance Evaluation Study. In the area of performance evaluation, presently, the most demanding ones are concerned with near field and the improvement in trust of the multiple barrier system. For the purpose, analytical models, technical skills on improvements and developments accompanied with reasonable confirmation, and the securing of confidence in the analytical data are thought to be especially important. Also, by efficiently utilizing the research institution for performance evaluation run by Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC), a plan for a complete basic data and the expansion of data base that includes necessary data for analysis such as thermodynamics of radioactive material will be necessary. On the other hand, in order to grasp scientifically the long term phenomena, it is useful to understand natural phenomena. Therefore, the continued enforcement of natural analog study should be made together with the observation of kinetics pertaining to earth chemical reaction. Further Raising the Level of Deep Underground Studies Mutual Subjects and Ways for Future Progress. In order to advance future research and development, the products yielded from the past shown in the ``Technical Reports'' should be further realized. The geological environmental conditions should be gasped even more in fineness, attainment of high level technology needs to be planned, and precision improvements in analytical skills are going to be needed. It will be pertinent that consideration in obtaining high level results that are trustworthy from all research areas is absolutely a requirement. In order to satisfy this, it is important to advance research institutions, substantiate facilities and proceed in educating human resources. Especially, the deep underground study institution is the necessary base for the mutual research of survey studies of geological environment conditions, research and development of waste disposal techniques and for performance evaluation studies. Also, in combination, it is a useful research institute for educational contributions to our country's collective research on geology, hydrologic, earth chemistry, rock engineering etc. that relates to deep underground. In the case of PNC, it is now in progress of planning and establishing a research and development of underground waste disposal techniques that is in agreement with our country's geological surroundings. However, since the research and development will be long term, it will come under the number two overall collection planned by PNC prior to year 2000, and through federal evaluation, the progress of the research and development will be ascertained, and it would be necessary to further evaluate and examine future study policies. Furthermore, in the future, in order to collectively and efficiently advance research and development, PNC, which is acting as the kernel and the propelling force, will be central for others such as Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute, Geological Survey of Japan, and the federal testing and research system. Also cooperation from universities and active contributions from related civilian technical power together with international cooperation is going to be necessary for efficient advancement.
