The topic was "The Building Materials Industry: Foundations of Success". The gathering was organised by Ekonomska Politika and the Kondor Holding Company of Belgrade. It was attended by some 15 directors of the most renowned firms in that field, as well as representatives of the Federal, Republic of Serbia and City of Belgrade administrations. Two reasons determined the title of the round table. First, participating in it were only good firms, i.e. those which not only survived in times of trial in spite of the blockade, but succeeded in achieving more or less good business results. The second, possibly more important reason, was to some extent symbolic. Namely, the building materials industry has been among industries which have their own raw materials base, depend on imports of energy only, i.e. crude oil and natural gas. That means that after the lifting of sanctions imposed by the United Nations they could become one of the foundations of, and give momentum to economic recovery of the country. Therefore, the voice of businessmen from that industry appears to be relevant in considering both present economic conditions and those which will occur when Yugoslavia reenters into the international community. The first participant in the discussion, Mr. Jovan Bogicevic, assistant federal minister of the construction industry, in charge of that industry, spoke exactly in that sense. Mr. Bogicevic pointed out the great significance of that industry in our country. Its share of the social product before the economic crisis, i.e. 1981, amounted to some 11 per cent, which is characteristic of developed countries, although Yugoslavia does not belong among them, while the construction industry's share in developing countries amounts to 5-6 per cent. Unfortunately, Mr. Bogicevic stressed, that share started falling after 1981. so that it amounts to some 5 per cent now. Overcapacity has been a special problem. Most facilities had been built having in mind the market of the former Yugoslavia. In view of their capacity even that market had been too small. Today, when Yugoslavia has been halved, that overcapacity is even more visible. However, another circumstance prevents that disproportion to fully tell. Shortages of natural gas and heavy heating oil result in underutilization of those capacities so that some products have been in short supply on the market. That refers in the first place to cement, which for that reason has been more expensive in Yugoslavia than in many other countries, including some neighboring ones. Brick, roofing tile, ceramic tile and similar products manufacturing are in a rather different position although they also have been working only a few months a year due to energy shortages. Their problem has been the lack of demand so that they have large stocks of products. Economic recession caused the fall of investment activities, especially of private housing construction that used to absorb some 80 per cent of their output, so that those factories practically remained without their market. Because of that several participants in the discussion warned that in such a case the orientation to stimulating demand was better than stimulating production, as, e.g. giving credits to individuals who would build houses would almost automatically stimulate production as well. Mr. Karolj Kasas, director of the firm Potisje in Kanjiza, spoke in particular of the significance of a stable dinar, as a stable currency enabled long term thinking and planning. "However, Mr. Kasas emphasized, a stable dinar will be useful in the best meaning of the word if manufacturers will be able to get credits for new programs, for the reconstruction of production lines and construction of new facilities". [quotation marks as published] Mr. Sreten Ilic, director of the firm Vunizol of Surdulica, which manufactures thermoinsulating materials, pointed in particular to a, in his opinion, paradox. On the one hand it has been mentioned that the easiest way of reviving the economy was through the construction industry as many other industries were linked to it. On the other hand when concrete talks are initiated, the answer is that there is no money. Mr. Ilic therefore requested the federal and Serbian governments to precisely say what they have in mind doing, to say whether they have investment programs, whether those are public works or something else. Directors participating in the round table however did not blame external sanctions and blockades as the essential limiting factor of development. In fact, much more was said about internal obstacles in the form of excise duties, personal income taxes, etc. The unanimous judgment was that such high taxes could not be easily borne even by a much stronger economy, situated in better economic and political conditions. Prices of construction materials industry products and their sales have been heavily burdened by transport costs. A very illustrative example in that respect was presented by Mr. Tomislav Vasovic (1st May of Cacak). That firm has been buying stone, ground and assorted, at YUD20.00 [Yugoslav dinars] per ton while transport from the quarry to Cacak, some 100 km away, costs another YUD30.00 perton. The general conclusion was that with such prices of transport it was very difficult to be competitive on the world market, as it will be on the domestic market as soon as borders open. Mr. Milan Milatovic, director of the firm Mermer of Danilovgrad, spoke from his angle about bureaucratic obstacles which prevented development of the raw material base. That factory was lucky that after Yugoslavia's disintegration it remained practically the only manufacturer of stone on the territory of the new state. Thus there has been no problem with sales, the problem being how to satisfy all needs. But, Mr. Milatovic sald, while in neighboring Italy only two papers were needed to open a new site, in Yugoslavia one had to pay YUD100,000.00 to get those papers. Mr. Ranko Zizic, director of the Kondor Holding Company, spoke in particular about results achieved in substituting products manufactured in some ex-Yugoslav republics or abroad. That firm has been specializing in hydro and thermo insulation programs, building construction chemistry, flooring and ceramics. Regardless of the relatively large number of factories in that field however, Mr. Zizic stressed, there have been many products whose manufacture has not been mastered, although there is no reason why they should not be produced in our country. Raw materials for many of them exist on the spot and they had been purchased here by many, transported, e.g., to Slovenia, where some additives had been added, they were packaged again and then returned to be sold on this market. Initial results achieved in that field have been significant but not sufficient. There has been much space and many products which could be manufactured by local factories, of course on the same footing as regards prices and quality with those found on the world market. Finally, several participants in the discussion stressed the necessity to preserve existing factories in order to prevent that after sanction are lifted (and judging by vistis of foreign partners some have been forecasting that that need not be so far away) we would be forced to import products for which we have not only raw materials but also know how and most advanced technology.
