Oelofse] [Text] Bisho March 25 SAPA -- Former Ciskei ruler Brig Oupa Gqozo said on Friday [25 March] he could not have allowed a few unruly elements to create a Bophuthatswana-style debacle that would have stripped the Ciskeian people's dignity in the eyes of the world. In an African Democratic Movement [ADM] statement, he explained the reasoning behind his resignation earlier this week after threats of violence and unrest in the homeland. Brig Gqozo said as leader of the ADM he would now be able to devote all his energy to winning seats in the election. "For me and my fellow candidates, it will be business as usual," he said.
