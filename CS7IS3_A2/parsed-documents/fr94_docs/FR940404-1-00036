FR940404-1-00036 FR940404-1-00014 Proposed Action The EPA in this action is proposing to approve the following elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP: The 1990 base year CO emissions inventory and the oxygenated fuels program. The remaining elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP to be submitted to the EPA by November 15, 1993, will be acted upon in separate FR actions. The EPA has reviewed these revisions to the El Paso CO SIP and is proposing to approve them as submitted. Request for Public Comments The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of today's proposal. As indicated at the outset of this notice, the EPA will consider any comments received by May 4, 1994. Miscellaneous Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and Subchapter I, part D, of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds ( Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A., 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S. Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. section 7410(a)(2). Executive Order 12866 This action has been classified as a table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived table 2 and table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2221) from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waver for table 2 and table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
