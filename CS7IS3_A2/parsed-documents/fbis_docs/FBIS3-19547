The amendment to the law was adopted by the Stortinget [Norwegian Parliament] in spring 1990 following rapid consideration. However, a formal error in its processing by the government meant that the ban first took effect last Friday [11 March]. The acting press spokesman for the Norwegian Department of Foreign Affairs (UD), Arthur Baste Knutsen, told us that the fact that the law has only just come into force had no practical meaning. "Since the summer the law was adopted, there have not been any cases where this legal provision has come into play," Baste Knutsen said. Slip in Minutes The statutory provision, which has not been in application for three and one-half years after all, is contained in the law governing the monitoring of exports of strategic products, services, and technology. The Lovdata [legal data] organization discovered the formal error, which appears to have been made when the new provision was meant to be approved by the king at the cabinet meeting held on 22 June 1990. The law was indeed approved that day, and the intention was to implement it straight away. However, this latter provision was omitted from the minutes of the cabinet meeting, probably by error. Consequently, the entry into force of the law was not announced in the NORWEGIAN LAW NEWS, Lovdata revealed in a letter to the Department of Foreign Affairs. Arms Intermediaries The background to the amendment of the law was an actual case that came to light in the winter of 1990 when a Norwegian company acted as an intermediary selling arms from one country to another. The Justice Department discovered that the law in force at the time failed to give the Norwegian officials any authority to intervene against such activities -- because it was not a question of selling arms, but rather merely acting as an intermediary for arms sales. Kjell Magne Bondevik, the foreign minister at the time, reacted quickly to close this loophole in a law dating from 1987 governing the monitoring of exports of strategic products, services, and technology. Under the provisions of this law, Norwegian citizens must have a special approval to sell arms, while simple mediation was not affected. The UD issued a proposal for an amendment to the law on 6 April 1990. The proposal was adopted by the cabinet that same day, and the matter was passed on to the Stortinget. The Norwegian parliament also reacted swiftly. The Committee on Foreign Affairs, led by [Prime Minister] Gro Harlem Brundtland, issued a unanimously adopted recommendation on 3 May 1990. Odelstinget [larger division of Norwegian parliament] passed a unanimous resolution on 21 May 1990, and Lagtinget [smaller division of Norwegian parliament] confirmed this on 29 May 1990. Evidently, everyone agreed that the mediation of arms sales should be monitored. Accordingly, the amendment to the law should have been approved by the king in the cabinet. The bill states that: "This law shall take effect from a moment to be stipulated by the king." In a letter sent to the UD on 18 February 1994, Lovdata pointed out that no decision had ever been made on its entry into force. Consequently, up until now it was lawful for Norwegian citizens to act as intermediaries in arms sales between one country and another, in direct contravention of Stortinget's 1990 resolution.
