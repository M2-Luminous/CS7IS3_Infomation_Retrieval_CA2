Next week, a program will be presented that will suggest improvements in the fields of medium-size businesses, the labor market, and deregulation. The government will also set out details of the fiscal policy it considers necessary to safeguard Germany as a business location over the next few years, Rexrodt told journalists in Bonn. According to the economics minister, the program, which was agreed upon within the coalition at the beginning of the week, is not a "traditional economic policy program," as the largest-ever economic policy program currently is being enforced in eastern Germany. The 1994 perspectives of up to 1.5-percent growth, as described in the [government's] draft Annual Economic Report, do not justify a large-scale anticyclical program. There is no "purposeful optimism" in the 1994 Annual Economic Report, Rexrodt said. The improved economic situation abroad, especially in the neighboring European countries, clearly shows this. But still, everything must be done to improve the framework conditions for a long-term decline in unemployment figures in Germany. He said that one of his top priorities during this legislative period is to strengthen confidence in the government's economic and monetary policy by consistently consolidating public funds. This is an objective that will also be worked on in close cooperation with the economics and finance ministers. This Monday [17 January], he, Rexrodt, wants to contribute his share to enabling Finance Minister Theo Waigel to cut expenses by 5 billion German marks [DM], as laid down by the budget committee. In spite of the need to economize, the coalition is determined to enforce measures stimulating the economy, as proposed in his Report on Germany as a Business Location dated August 1993, Rexrodt said. Various measures to promote medium-size businesses are being planned. By way of example, the minister mentioned the plan to reactivate the program on promoting capital resources in the old laender, promoting vocational training through low-interest loans, as well as more liberal regulations for practicing various professions. Rexrodt also announced new initiatives to privatize public services, as well as deregulation. As an outstanding example, he mentioned the abolition of demarcation agreements in the German power supply industry. Yet, this initiative will only be successful if laender and municipalities stop resisting the ensuing stimulation of competition between power suppliers. Rexrodt advocated "radical rethinking" in matters concerning labor policy. This includes maintaining the gaps between wages and introducing a low-wage sector. Germany can no longer afford to exclude entire groups of the population from the labor market by laying down wages that are too high. All opportunities for additional employment must, therefore, be explored. This includes jobs in private households that must no longer be done illicitly. By fully taking into account wages paid and their tax-reducing effects, in the end, this policy will pay for itself by means of additional jobs and higher social insurance contributions, Rexrodt said. The economics minister also announced that the Federal Government will present a fiscal policy concept for the next parliamentary term by mid-1994. In addition to measures simplifying taxes, this will include a reduction of nonprofit-linked taxes, a reduction of taxes on profits, a return of trade tax under a municipal tax reform, as well as abolishing income tax on wages and salaries for subsistence-level incomes.
