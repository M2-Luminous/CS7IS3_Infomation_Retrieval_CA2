Jovanovic draws the secretary general's attention to the fact that the airspace violations took place in the area of Boka Kotorska and near Uzice and Kraljevo, and said this was an integral part of a campaign of continuous pressure on the Serb nation. "We are particularly concerned because all this is happening under the auspices of the United Nations and because nothing has been done yet to stop such provocations," the letter says. "If these violations continue they could spark off incidents with unforeseeable consequences for the security of not only the FRY but also the entire Balkan region, including the peace process aimed at ending the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina." Jovanovic appealed to Butrus-Ghali to take appropriate measures within the framework of the United Nations and NATO to prevent "such dangerous provocations" in the future.
