He praised Egypt for the immense sacrifices and assistance it offered for the revolution in Yemen and for its constant support for current Yemeni issues. Interviewed by AL-AHRAM at his residence in Aden, al-Bid stressed that Yemen cannot accept being a country of domestic or international terrorism that may harm the Egyptian people. He said if the Arab countries fail to join forces, they will find themselves in a difficult situation. Al-Bid said that the current crisis in Yemen has put to a real test his country's ability to establish a state of institutions and stability despite the stimuli of confrontation. He noted that there has been no clear, unified vision toward the unified state. The adversary forces, he added, did not give the YSP enough time; the party was pushed to a difficult position through assassination of its leading figures and statesmen, and even desecration of houses. He noted the party's sacrifices to establish a state that will take Yemen to the 21st century, not return it to the 19th century. Al-Bid considered the recently concluded Pledge and Accord document as merely a step toward rectifying the course of unity. He stressed that the crisis between him and Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is not personal, but one among all ruling organizations and bodies involved in the current dialogue.
