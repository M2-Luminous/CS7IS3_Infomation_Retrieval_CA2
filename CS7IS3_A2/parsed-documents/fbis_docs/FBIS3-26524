Before the meeting closed, Governor Bai Qingcai made an important speech focusing on six issues. First, we should take the overall situation into account in everything we do. In considering their work, all fronts and departments should have the concept of proceeding from the overall situation and should effectively integrate centrally assigned tasks with their actual conditions. If they only consider their own interests in disregard of the overall situation, they will deviate from the general orientation. Because reform will cause an adjustment in powers and interests, we should proceed from the overall situation in this year's work. [passage omitted] Second, we should change our concepts as soon as possible. Some of our concepts which have existed for many years are outdated. Without changing our concepts, we cannot seize the opportunity. The basic purpose of the party Central Committee in stressing the need to study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping is to arm ourselves with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, to improve our understanding, to emancipate our minds, and to change our concepts. Third, we must have a down-to-earth work style. Now the tasks have been set and the objective is clear. The fulfillment of these tasks and objectives requires the unity and efforts of the entire people and the devotion of party members and cadres. It will not do for leaders not to have a down-to-earth work style. Leading cadres must set a good example for others to follow. Fourth, discipline must be strengthened. To ensure the fulfillment of all reform objectives, to ensure uniformity in action, to ensure high efficiency in government work, to ensure uniformity and smoothness in government orders, and to ensure government authority in its administration, discipline must be further strengthened. Without strict discipline or uniformity in action, how can we exercise leadership over the great cause of socialist modernization? Fifth, we should step up the formation of clean administration. We should be confident that the majority of our cadres are good, but we should not overlook the seriousness of corruption. We made certain achievements in combating corruption in the previous period, and this helped stop the spread of corruption, but we should not overestimate these achievements. We should soberly understand that the combat against corruption will remain protracted. Sixth, we should really care for the masses' lives and deepen reform. Fundamentally speaking, this will benefit the masses. But benefits will differ in some aspects and some periods. When acknowledging the fact that most of the masses' lives are improving, leaders should not forget a small number of people who still have difficulties. Government institutions at all levels should do their best to help resolve their difficulties and show more concern for them. This is our unshirkable duty. Vice Governors Xu Shanlin, Wang Shuangxi, Liu Chunmao, and Jiang Xinzhen attended the meeting. [passage omitted]
