FR941025-2-00069 FR941025-2-00046 Food and Drug Administration [Docket No. 94N&hyph;0202] SmithKline Beecham Animal Health, et al.; Withdrawal of Approval of NADA's AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is withdrawing approval of three new animal drug applications (NADA's) and those portions of a fourth NADA providing for the use of nitrofurazone solution drug products. This action is being taken at the written request of the sponsors. In a final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register , FDA is amending the regulations by removing the entries which reflect approval of the NADA's. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 3, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mohammad I. Sharar, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;216), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;0749. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FDA is withdrawing approval of three NADA's and those portions of a fourth NADA (6&hyph;475) providing for the use of nitrofurazone solution drug products. The NADA's are: 1Sponsor 1NADA No. SmithKline Beecham Animal Health, 1600 Paoli Pike, West Chester, PA 19380 6&hyph;475 Veterinary Laboratories, Inc., 12340 Santa Fe Dr., Lenexa, KS 66215 121&hyph;559 Fermenta Animal Health Co., 10150 North Executive Hills Blvd., Kansas City, MO 64153 126&hyph;023 Med-Pharmex, Inc., Biomed Laboratories, 325 East Arrow Hwy., San Dimas, CA 91773 126&hyph;950 The NADA's provide for over-the-counter use of 0.2 percent nitrofurazone solution on dogs, cats, and horses for prevention or treatment of topical bacterial infections, and prescription use for female equine genital tract infections and impaired fertility due to strains of certain bacteria. One of the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for receiving approval of a new animal drug is that the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling are reasonably certain to be followed in practice (21 U.S.C. 360b (c)(2)). New information has established that the labeled directions for use of the nitrofurazone solution products have not been followed in practice. When FDA informed the products' sponsors of this situation, they requested voluntary withdrawal of approval of their applications. By so doing they have waived their right to a hearing. The withdrawals of approval are effective November 3, 1994. All manufacturing of the products must cease on this date. FDA, however, will exercise its enforcement discretion and will not take regulatory action, based on lack of approval, against the subject products if distributed from sponsor-owned facilities through December 31, 1994, and used before their expiration date. Therefore, under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Center for Veterinary Medicine (21 CFR 5.84), and in accordance with ยง514.115 Withdrawal of approval of applications (21 CFR 514.115), notice is given that approval of NADA's 121&hyph;559, 126&hyph;023, and 126&hyph;950 and those portions of NADA 6&hyph;475 providing for the use of nitrofurazone solution drug products and all supplements and amendments thereto is hereby withdrawn, effective November 3, 1994. This withdrawal of approval does not affect the nitrofurazone-containing ointment and soluble powder products covered by NADA 6&hyph;475. In a final rule published elsewhere in the issue of the Federal Register , FDA is removing and reserving ยง524.1580d which reflects the approval of the NADA's. Dated: September 21, 1994. Stephen F. Sundlof, Director, Center for Veterinary Medicine. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26377 Filed 10&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F
