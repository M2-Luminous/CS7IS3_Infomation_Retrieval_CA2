The communique, which was forwarded to TANJUG, says parts of the Nordic UN battalion are being withdrawn from the airport and control is being taken over by 150 U.S. Army soldiers who were airlifted from The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to Tuzla. "We also have information that only NATO transport aircraft have been landing at the airport, bringing in weapons and military equipment from NATO bases for the Muslims and airlifting NATO rapid intervention units," the communique says. The communique goes on to say that it is a well-known fact that the Serb side and top Russian representatives agreed that the Serbs will agree to the reopening of Tuzla airport only for peaceful and humanitarian purposes, and provided that Russian UN observers and Serb Army liaison officers are deployed there. "Despite the fact that no agreement on the reopening of Tuzla airport has been signed and that Russian observers and Serb officers are not deployed there, the NATO troops, under UN auspices, have been transporting weapons and military equipment for the Muslims, thus crudely violating the embargo on importing weapons for the warring sides in this area. That is why they are replacing UN Protection Forces troops with NATO personnel, i.e. with U.S. Army soldiers," the communique says. "These facts and other intelligence reports confirm our assessments and indicate that Tuzla airport will not be used for peace and humanitarian flights at all, but exclusively for arming the Muslims and setting up a NATO base," the communique says.
