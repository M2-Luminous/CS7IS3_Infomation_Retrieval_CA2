Taking note of the Central Electoral Commission's decision of 2 February, which practically rejects President Snegur's proposal that according to the decision of the presidium of the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova the aforementioned poll should be organized simultaneously with the 27 February general elections, but, on the other hand, considering the stringent need to stabilize the social, political, and economic situation in the country, to create favorable circumstances for the strengthening of the independence of the Republic of Moldova and the ensuring of its territorial integrity, and on the basis of Article 113 of the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova, the president of the republic decrees, I quote the first article: On 6 March 1994 the sociological poll "Consulting With the Nation" is to be held on the whole territory of the Republic of Moldova. The poll is intended for all citizens of the republic with the right to vote to answer the following question: Do you favor the Republic of Moldova to develop as an independent, unitary, and indivisible state, within its frontiers established on the day of the proclamation of its sovereignty, 23 June 1990, to promote a neutral policy, to maintain mutually advantageous cooperation relations with all the countries of the world, and to guarantee equal rights to all its citizens, according to the norms of the international right? unquote. The five articles that follow the first one regulate the way in which the poll is to be prepared. Also today the Central Electoral Commission held a news conference, during which the journalists were told that 1,024 candidates representing 16 political groupings and 19 independent candidates have registered for the 27 February ballot. The commission members also said that 44 technical groups [for ballot counting] have been set up and the voting bulletins have also been confirmed. The commission members also emphasized that although they had done everything they could to organize elections also on the left bank of the Dniester River [in the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic], as well as in the southern part of the republic [inhabited by the Gagauz ethnic minority], for the time being it is still unclear whether the elections will also take place in those regions.
