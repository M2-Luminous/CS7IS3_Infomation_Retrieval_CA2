It is the National Environmental Agency (ANPA), the establishment of which the lower house approved yesterday morning with 284 votes in favor, 24 against, and 11 abstentions just before the motion of confidence in the government. ANPA will perform controls in companies and in all environmentally hazardous situations and will also submit proposals and advice to central and local government concerning the accepted levels for pollutants, standards for the quality of the air and water, and waste treatment. The document approved by the lower house is identical to that approved by the senate last December and transforms a previous -- but very different -- government decree into law. Its creation was "long-winded and difficult" commented the former Green and later PSI [Italian Socialist Party] representative Rosa Filippini, who was also one of the most fervid supporters of the new organism. But the crucial moment for its creation was the 18 April referendum that removed the responsibility for health controls from the local health units. The first decree is dated 1 August and gives the go-ahead on the bureaucratic procedure during which the document was reviewed three times and underwent considerable modifications. From the structural point of view, the initial proposals -- based on overseas experience -- provided for a "light" central organism (no more than 200-300 employees) with a widespread presence at local level or vice versa a "heavy" central structure with a barely noticeable local structure. A compromise was decided upon: Provincial and regional authorities will be required to establish their own territorial facilities to work side by side with a large-scale national agency. The "heart" will be ENEA's [National Agency for New Technologies, Energy, and the Environment] DISP (with a staff of about 300), which represents the former and now under utilized nuclear program control body; an additional 150 people from other ENEA departments; staff from other organisms such as the Higher Institute of Health; ISPESL (Safety in the Workplace); the CNR [National Research Council], and from some ministries (primarily the environment ministry). The ANPA management will be composed of three directors appointed by the environment minister (with a three-year term in office) who will nominate the president. The director general will be appointed by the prime minister, but on the basis of proposals made by the environment minister. [passage omitted] In particular, the recently-approved law creates new controls that will supplement existing ones (which the law did not abrogate). Here are some examples. ANPA will have jurisdiction over regulations concerning industrial waste, as will the CNR and the Higher Institute of Health; work safety, together with the labor ministry; polluting emissions, which also remain the jurisdiction of the Higher Institute of Health; the issuance of the "green" European label (Ecolabel) and ecoauditing, for which there are no specific organisms. It does not amend the jurisdiction set for the CNR, the national department of technical services (which falls under the prime minister), and ENEA (which comes under the industry ministry).
