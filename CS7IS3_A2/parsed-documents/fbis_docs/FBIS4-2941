He said that the provincial government plans to introduce a competitive labor market system province-wide over the next five years to pave the way for the creation of a market economy. Now, more people have found jobs on various type of labor markets, in a change from getting job assignments from the government, he said. Zhejiang, one of the most developed areas in China, currently has 70 labor markets, 500 job placement agencies, and 7,000 labor service enterprises and workers' training centers. In 1993 700,000 urban residents in Zhejiang found jobs through labor markets and nearly 60,000 residents were employed following vocational training, he said. As a result, the urban unemployment rate went down to 2.6 percent, he added. The provincial authorities have decided to open a number of major labor markets in urban areas, and job-placement agencies in all counties and cities this year, he said. In 1994 Zhejiang will also improve the social insurance system consisting primarily of old-age pensions and unemployment insurance, he said. The premium will be shared by the state, the collectives and individuals, according to local officials. Specifically, the mutual pension insurance system will be introduced in half of prefectures and cities, while unemployment insurance will be extended to all urban workers, he said.
