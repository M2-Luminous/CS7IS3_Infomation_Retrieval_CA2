A new nontraditional object of geological prospecting wherein efficient increase of oil and gas supply does not depend on foreign investment was proposed. The authors had been able to discover and justify scientifically a unique object for prospecting for hydrocarbons within the main oil and gas producing region of Ukraine the Northern Board of the Dnieper-Donets Depression (DDD). The work was conducted in accordance with the ``Integrated Program for Studying Prospects of Oil and Gas Capacity of the Crystalline Foundation of the Northern Board of the Dnieper-Donets Depression in 1989-1995'' that was approved in 1988. A 1991 forecast estimated that resources of hydrocarbons were equal to 186 million tons. The Program was actually implemented in only three years. New methods and procedures for trap detection and preparation, forecasting etc. had been developed. New oil and gas-containing areas were discovered. A non-standard set of geophysical studies had been developed, which resulted in highly efficient geological prospecting. Ten new oil and gas fields were discovered, and gas capacity in two other zones was established. Industrial-size accumulations of hydrocarbons were detected in areas that before had been considered non-promising. According to current estimates hydrocarbon resources in these areas exceed 250 million tonnes. References 6, all Russian.
