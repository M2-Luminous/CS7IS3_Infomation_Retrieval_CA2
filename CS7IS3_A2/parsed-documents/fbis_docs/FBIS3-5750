It is the first time in almost a quarter of a century that new trading firms are trying to enter the rice import business, they said. Under the designated agent system, established in 1957 when Japan was still importing rice, the government imports the grain but consigns the actual importing to approved trading companies. Japan later halted rice imports, and since there have been no new participants in the business, although the agency accepts applications every March. [sentence as received] The number of designated trading firms has long remained at about 20, according to the sources. With the government's decision last December to partially open the rice market next year, more traders are now eager to enter the business. The sources refrained from revealing the number and names of new trading firms that applied this year, but Okura and Co., a medium-ranked trading firm, said it has applied. In order to become a designated agent, a trading firm must be a joint-stock corporation set up in Japan with capital of more than 100 million yen, and must have staff knowledgeable in rice trading, according to the agency. The agency will examine the applications and soon announce the results, the sources said.
