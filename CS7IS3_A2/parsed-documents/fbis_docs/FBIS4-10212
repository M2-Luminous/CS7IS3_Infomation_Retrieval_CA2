Hubert De Ronceray calls President Monde's allegations spectacular. [Begin De Ronceray recording, in Creole] You must be careful. You must not give much importance to certain spectacular statements. I call them spectacular statements because there are people who want to show that... [pauses] They are attributing much importance to themselves whereas what is being settled here is something very serious. It is about an imperiled country. Our contacts have shown us that many people within the parliament, both in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, take the matter very seriously. So, if there are other people who are providing entertainment, who are making somewhat noisy statements, we think it is because they want to attribute importance to themselves. But we are more than convinced that something serious will result from this resolution. [end recording]
