He added that the Somali people are not ready today to go back to the civil war and, hence, the SNA leadership is calling on the Somali people to take the following steps: 1. The peace-loving Somali people are being called upon to remain vigilant and counter these troublemakers wherever they may be. 2. The SNA warns those undermining the peace to stop meddling. Their actions will not be tolerated any longer. 3. The communities which have no peace among themselves should solve their problems as soon as possible in their settlements so as to contribute to overall peace in the country. The spokesman concluded his speech by saying that the Somali people should join together and do away with whatever happened in the past.
