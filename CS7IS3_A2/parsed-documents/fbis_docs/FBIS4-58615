Views of Some Deputies Concerning the Creation of New Foreign Exchange Commitments During a speech Mr. Nowbakht said: Paragraph B says the government is authorized to take steps by transferring existing foreign exchange commitments. We now have $8 to $10 billion in commitments to other countries. Isn't it reasonable for us to take another look at the nation's existing commitments and for those that are appropriate to be eliminated? Then we can carry out these important projects on which we are at the contract stage, such as Karun 4, on which we have advanced to the contract stage with the Japanese. It is a contract with a very suitable profit rate whose payments begin after the project goes into operation, and the amount of the payments is quite small. They must also import the technology. If we implement this project alone, it needs more than 2.4 billion, while we have set aside only a total of 2.4 billion for all four projects. He then continued: This is not a new commitment. For example, in some commitments goods have not been imported, and even though they are not imported and no problem arises, we eliminate them. Therefore, all deputies desiring to limit commitments and improve on commitments must vote for it. Engineer Nabavi's Views During a speech Engineer Nabavi discussed Nowbakht's remarks. He said: If Mr. Nowbakht had given an example of these potential commitments and purchases that were eliminated, we would have accepted what he said. These purchases go through various phases, and it is not practical to eliminate or convert these potential commitments. In the same regard he added: Someone went and got a loan from the bank. He paid the profit on the loan and all the money for his imported goods. Now the banks are not willing to give this money back if should be willing to cancel these purchases. Then there were efforts for several months to stop potential purchases, and so far there has been no result, and the likelihood of a result is quite small. Havardi made a list of things that could be stopped, but he saw that the goods have already been imported. Therefore these new finances will be added to our foreign exchange commitments. If we do not want our commitments to be more than 1.9 billion, although these projects are quite important, due to the many commitments that have been made, instead of doing more financing and buy-backs, the emphasis has been laid on usance and short-term purchases, and now the country is in a situation with heavy commitments. Now that they are being refinanced, when these new loans come due in a few years it will be at the same time our refinance payments are due, and at that time we will be faced with about $20 to $15 billion in commitments that are due. Therefore these financing arrangements are being added to our foreign exchange commitments. Mr. Mirvalad's Views Mr. Mirvalad, expert on the commission, discussed the creation of new foreign exchange commitments. He said: One of the most controversial issues discussed in our commission was this very Paragraph B, Note 29. The Plan and Budget Commission is fully aware of foreign commitments. We know that the very important projects must be implemented, and some of them have been written up as contracts. The discussed the importance of these projects. He said: We agreed on two issues, one that the nation's commitments must not increase beyond a ceiling of $1.6 billion, and the other that these projects are very important and cannot be eliminated. The commission therefore authorized the government to transfer existing foreign exchange commitments until the end of the year 1372. Engineer Jalali's Views One proposal was to delete the phrase "and implementation of the project must be done so that the annual repayments on both the capital investment and related expenses be done after the project goes into operation" from Row 3, Paragraph B of Note 29. Concerning this, Mr. Jalali said: In this paragraph we did not make any request to increase numbers in terms of foreign exchange. This is merely the deletion of a phrase that creates problems with the implementation of projects to develop sugarcane. He added: As you know, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, signed by 117 nations, removes the subsidies on agricultural goods. Therefore, if we do not have the necessary investment for agricultural projects, in the not-too-distant future we will have to put all the nation's foreign exchange revenues into the crops the country needs. Engineer Nabavi's Views Continuing, Engineer Nabavi spoke in opposition to the above proposal. He said: If we did not have the bitter experience of outstanding debts, there would be no problem for Mr. Jalali to be here defending the removal of this restriction. He added: The repayments begin after operation begins. This is the minimum restriction that must be used. Otherwise, it is like the situation we are facing. That is, payments pile up and the country does not have the ability to make them and the country's political and economic prestige is lost. That is, you want them to go and make foreign commitments without restrictions or requirements, without any thought about paying them back when they come due.

Majles Notes Engineer Bahonar's Answer to Mr. Rowghani-Zanjani's Comments The study of Note 39, especially Paragraph B, was controversial. Mr. Rowghani-Zanjani, attending the Majles as the government's representative, defended the new foreign exchange commitments given in Paragraph B, and in part of his speech, opposing the opponents, he said: "One cannot manage the country with slogans." In a guideline memo, Engineer Bahonar asked permission to answer him on this point. During a speech he said: At the beginning of my speech I said: The government's performance in the economic sector in the First Five-Year Plan was something miraculous, and I believe in it. I said that these commitments are not significant numbers at all compared to our gross national product. I said the gentlemen are not taking one point into consideration, which is that the world magnifies our problems. They said we have turned the Bahai cemetery into a public park, and therefore human rights are not observed in Iran. If we owe a dollar in the country, they exaggerate it 1,000 times. Mr. Rowghani-Zanjani said: "One cannot manage the country with slogans, we went and built bridges, roads and other things." We know all these things much better than he does. We have spoken and given speeches. We also have his belief, and in practice we have shown how steadfast we are and that we follow the government of Mr Hashemi and we support him. However, if we object to the performance of one or two organizations, this can't be called sloganeering (shouts of approval from the deputies).
