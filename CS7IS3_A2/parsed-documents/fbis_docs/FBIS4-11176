I want you to clip and save the three articles that will appear in this space because they could serve as reference material in the future. Well, if pity and votes favor him (as they most probably will), Dr. Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon will become president of Mexico. Those who ponder this possibility also wonder: What team of men will Zedillo choose to govern this country? The team selected by the candidate will be very important because the profile, personality, and level that the government will attain depends on its members and their characteristics and will determine the solutions they will seek for the numerous problems afflicting our country. It is for the purpose of satisfying this curiosity that this country lawyer of yours will reveal in the following three articles the names of those who will make up the government team. They are divided into three groups. We also divided our work into three installments in keeping with the belief that there are -- or will be -- three types of collaborators in the Zedillo administration: 1. Salinists who are fond of (and friends with) Zedillo. 2. Colosists who are close to Zedillo. 3. Zedillists by origin, from the north [los zedillistas de origen, de hueso colorado]. Let us begin our work with the chapter on the Salinists who are fond of Zedillo. But before we do that, to help you get the picture, let us have a little history on Dr. Zedillo's background and the people with whom he has worked. The former secretary of public education graduated as an economist from the Instituto Politecnico Nacional, IPN, and earned master's and doctoral degrees in economics from Yale University. He taught at IPN and the Colegio de Mexico (1978-80), as did Jaime Serra Puche, Manuel Camacho Solis, and Jose Cordoba Montayo. In terms of work experience, Zedillo played a prominent role at Banco de Mexico as head of Ficorca [expansion unknown], where he established strong ties with Miguel Mancera. Carlos Mancera Corcuera, who serves as coordinator of Zedillo's advisers, is Miguel Mancera's son. From there, Zedillo moved to the Secretariat of Programming and Budget as deputy secretary under Pedro Aspe, and in 1988 he move up to secretary when Salinas assumed the presidency. In all these posts Zedillo developed important relationships, but perhaps the most important was with "Kingmaker" [previous word in English] Jose Maria Cordoba Montoya, adviser to President Salinas, who had Colosio nominated first, then his favorite, Ernesto Zedillo. Zedillo is also a close friend of Emilio Antonio Gamboa Patron, current secretary of communications and transport, (to give you an idea of their relationship) with whom he spent the end of the year in Acapulco along with Governor (and friend) Ruben Figueroa Alcocer. Commerce Secretary Jaime Jose Serra Puche is also close to Dr. Zedillo. The two share economic outlooks and international links created by NAFTA. The recent appointment of Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza as secretary general of the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] and campaign coordinator shows that Dr. Zedillo trusts this man. Another group of Salinists fond of Zedillo has its origins at Banco de Mexico. You should know that Zedillo owes everything to Governor Miguel Mancera for granting him a scholarship and for employing him. Zedillo belongs to the Grupo Banco de Mexico, the cradle of a number of important friendships. The other group of Zedillo friends is at IPN and branches out into the Secretariat of Communications, because the links between the IPN and this secretariat are no secret. Most prominent among Zedillo's friends at Grupo Banco de Mexico (to which Miguel de la Madrid and his pupil, Carlos Salinas, also belong) is Guillermo "Memo" Ortiz Martinez, our companero at the military school and current deputy secretary of finance. Francisco Gil Diaz, the implacable right hand of Dr. Pedro Aspe at the Finance Secretariat, is also a friend of Zedillo. Two governors are among this group of Zedillo friends: Patricio Chirinos of Veracruz and Otto Granados of Aguascalientes. It is obvious that Salinists who are now in office have a good chance of keeping their jobs or moving to other offices at the same level. Tomorrow we will give you a list of the Colosists who support Zedillo, as well as an idea of their possible destination. As Hitchcock would say: "Do not miss it!"
