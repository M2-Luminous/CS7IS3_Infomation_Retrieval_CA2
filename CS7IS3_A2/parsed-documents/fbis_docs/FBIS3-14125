This visit by his highness and the accompanying delegation embodies the firm brotherly relations between the Syrian Arab Republic and Bahrain. These relations are reinforced and strengthened by fraternal ties, Arab affiliation, unity of objectives, and common fate. President Hafiz al-Asad and His Highness Shaykh 'Isa Bin-Salman Al Khalifah held cordial talks that focused on relations between the two fraternal countries and on strengthening bilateral coordination and cooperation. Talks also focused on the most important regional and international issues of common interest. The views of both sides were identical and in agreement on these issues. To reiterate this approach, ministers of both sides held several rounds of talks that focused on invigorating fields of cooperation and exchange to serve the good and interests of the fraternal peoples of both countries. This visit acquires special importance since it takes place in critical Arab circumstances that stress the importance and inevitability of such Arab visits and meetings in order to revive solidarity and coordination among the brothers, to confront what the world faces in terms of regional and international developments and changes, and to achieve common objectives. These objectives relate to the full restoration of occupied Arab territories, including occupied Syrian Golan and Arab Jerusalem, in implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 in order to realize a just, comprehensive, and durable peace in the region. In this regard, the two sides condemned the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and held the Israeli policy of settlements and intransigence fully responsible. At the conclusion of his visit and during the tours he and the accompanying delegation conducted, His Highness Shaykh 'Isa Bin-Salman Al Khalifah expressed his appreciation and admiration of what he sensed and saw as far as manifestations of development and awakening the Syrian Arab Republic has achieved under President Hafiz al-Asad, the leader of its march. His highness wished the people of the Syrian Arab Republic progress and prosperity and wished President Hafiz al-Asad continued good health. Moreover, His Highness Shaykh 'Isa Bin-Khalifah Al Khalifah extended an invitation to President Hafiz al-Asad of the Syrian Arab Republic to officially visit Bahrain, which he thankfully accepted. The date of this visit will be fixed in the near future. [Dated] Damascus, 22 March 1994
