This opinion was expressed by Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], at the beginning of the forum on safeguarding Germany as a business and investment location, which was sponsored by his ministry. For the first time in decades, taboos are being challenged, intellectual inflexibility is easing, and bureaucratic ossification in industry and trade is being tackled. The main task is to get the discrepancy between costs and output under control and to improve the conditions for excellence in the spheres of education, science, technology, and development and their translation into successful products. Apart from that, individual responsibility in the social sphere must increase and "work, which is abundant," must "lead to lasting employment." The struggle against unemployment is the government's most important goal. There are no patent prescriptions, "we must embark upon the stony path of structural renewal." Uwe Jens, economic-policy spokesman for the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Bundestag group, however argued that "show events cannot replace competent economic policy." The repeated attacks against the foundations of the social market economy by the FDP and its economics minister are only intended to conceal the years of deficiencies regarding the strengthening of the growth forces and the economy's competitive strength. Horst Koehler, the head of the Savings Banks Association, pleaded for a tax system that is more appropriate to promote hard work and the "purification" of state administration. The FRG will no longer be a net exporter of capital for an extended period of time. Hence, the confidence that was gained in 40 years has to be "carefully cultivated." The Federation of German Trade Unions [DGB] proposed a "five-path strategy." The "solid starting position" of German enterprises, for example in environmental, energy, and communications technology, as well as microelectronics or biotechnology must be further developed with the help of an "innovation impetus." In addition, the country needs an education and qualification offensive and employment initiative in terms of economic, industrial, and regional policy. Active labor market policy must replace the financing of unemployment through the financing of socially sensible work. As for wage policy, the system of independent wage talks must be preserved, and area wage agreements must be geared toward modernizing branches and regions.
