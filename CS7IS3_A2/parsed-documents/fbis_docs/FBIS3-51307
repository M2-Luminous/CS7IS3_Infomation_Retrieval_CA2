The bishop, who two weeks ago announced that he would stand for election to the constituent assembly on behalf of the left-wing Frente Grande coalition, said in an interview with NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS news agency that the fact that Menem was "obsessed" with re-election was "vox populi." He added that he personally was in favour of maintaining the current law that bars presidents from serving a second consecutive term and that the head of state should continue to serve the country for a period of six years. However he drew comfort from the fact that his contribution to the constituent assembly would at least help the cause of securing some "positive aspects" in the reform of the national charter. Later in an outspoken critique of government economic policy, the prelate said: "The social cost of economic success is very high for all to see." He concluded that "there must clearly be an alternative to the current model," and one that reached out to "all sectors of society and not just one." Responding to a question as to whether the clergy should not be allowed to play a direct role in politics, he denied that there was any conflict of interests and said he was not taking part in party politics, but rather "acting for the common good." He also categorically ruled out any future in the political world after the constituent assembly ends its assessment of the need for constitutional reform in April of this year.
