They cover the following fields and technologies: - Agriculture: improving crop quality and two technologies of breeding crops and tackling problems in low-yielding crops. - Energy and Environment: nuclear, oil extraction and coal industries. - Transportation: high-speed railway system, high-grade roadways and inland water transport. - Raw Materials and Resources: iron-smelting, refined chemical products and engineering plastics. - Information and Communication: integrated circuits, computers, software, electronics, automation and fiber-optics communication. - Manufacturing: digital-control, laser and the manufacturing of equipment used in large-scale thermal power. - Biotechnology has also been selected as a key technology in the 1990s. These were jointly selected by the State Planning Commission, the State Science and Technology Commission and the State Economic and Trade Commission. Officials from the State Planning Commission said that China will concentrate on tackling technological problems which are linked closely with the country's economic development. The technological applications expect to promote industrial adjustments, intensify economic strength and improve international competition. These key technologies have been included in State-level scientific development projects, including the State Science Research Project, the High-tech Development Project and the State Industrial Experiment Project. Local government as well as enterprises, colleges and research institutes have also been urged to supporting the application of these technologies.
