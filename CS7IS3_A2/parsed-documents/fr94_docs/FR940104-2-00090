ACTION: Notice of availability of funds. SUMMARY: The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), U.S. Department of Commerce, announces that applications are available for planning and construction grants for public telecommunications facilities under the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP), which is administered by NTIA. Applicants for grants under the PTFP must file their applications on or before March 17, 1994. NTIA anticipates making grant awards by September 30, 1994. Approximately $21.3 million is available in fiscal year 1994 for grants. The amount of a grant award will vary depending on the project of the applicant. NTIA awarded $20.8 million in funds to 105 projects for fiscal year 1993. The awards ranged from $1,898 to $968,989. Final Rules and Policy Statement for the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program were published on November 22, 1991 (56 FR 59168&hyph;59192, No. 226). These rules, codified at 15 CFR part 2301, will be in effect for 1994 applications. Prospective PTFP applicants should be aware that NTIA is in the process of establishing a new National Information Infrastructure grant program to be called the Information Infrastructure Grants Program (IIGP). The IIGP's funds may be used for the planning and construction of telecommunications networks or the purchase of telecommunications services and facilities for the provision of educational, cultural, health care, public information, public safety or other social services. The Congress appropriated $26 million dollars for the IIGP in FY 1994. Formal announcement of the IIGP will be made at a later date. The new IIGP is separate from the already-existing grant program, the PTFP, which is the subject of this Notice. The PTFP or its predecessor-agencies have been in operation since 1962; the present PTFP program has been in place since 1978. DATES: Pursuant to §2301.5(c) of the PTFP Final Rules (56 FR 59176 (1991), codified at 15 CFR part 2301), the Administrator of NTIA hereby establishes the closing date for the filing of applications for grants under the PTFP.
