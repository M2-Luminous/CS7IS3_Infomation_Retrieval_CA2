"It no longer has a majority," he says. Scalfaro says, however: "Part of our journey has already been completed." Rome--In the final hours of 1993, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has suddenly found himself all alone. Now Occhetto has also urged the government to resign, after Bossi had previously done so. "In view of the no-confidence motion introduced by Pannella," the PDS leader says, in an interview he gave to L'UNITA, "it would be entirely correct for Ciampi to take note of the fact that he no longer has a majority, and to bring to the attention of the head of state the inferences derived from that fact." It is, therefore, no surprise that the two wings of the government majority are coming unhitched and that in the space of 48 hours Carlo Azeglio Ciampi passed from the laurels of his year-end press conference to face the unexpected prospect of having to resign and accordingly face the election campaign under the leadership of a greatly weakened executive branch rather than one with full powers, as he had so profoundly desired. The first to detach himself was Bossi who, after Pannella's no-confidence motion was introduced, changed his position three times in four days. He initially favored the motion but subsequently opposed it (fearing that it would delay the date of the election), and then two days ago he again changed course. "We shall vote for the no-confidence motion," Maroni--the deputies' chairman--announced, "because in view of the measures concerning RAI [Italian Radio and Television Broadcasting Corporation] and IRI [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction], the government should be terminated as soon as possible!" Other than the reasons given publicly, the Lega is backing off in order not to become involved in the year-end "blow" decided on by Ciampi, who is thereby resuming his opposition role again. Having seen which way the wind is blowing, Occhetto also cut himself loose and in his interview sent a message--if one reads between the lines--to whoever needed to receive it. "We voted for the budget bill," he said, "because of the need for stability, but there is another requirement for stability that needs to be satisfied: that of selecting the two houses of Parliament as quickly as possible." As if to say: Dear Scalfaro, dear Ciampi, we have done our part; now let's hurry up and hold the elections. In this way, as the days pass, the political reasoning behind the no-confidence motion introduced by Marco Pannella--which was destined to sow contradictions and uneasiness in all camps--becomes ever clearer, especially for the PDS, which in anticipation of the 12 January parliamentary debate has seen a curious scenario take shape on the horizon. Since Bossi opted out two days ago, many deputies of the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and the PSI [Italian Socialist Party] have already let it be known that they will vote against the government. There was accordingly the possibility that the debate on the Pannella motion could conclude with a Ciampi propped up by the PDS and half of the DC, with the rest of Parliament taking shots at him. The motion has proved to be a big headache, and it is of no use for Occhetto to say that "it might be withdrawn." In view of the abundant fruit yielded by his "provocation," Pannella will do everything except withdraw his motion, and nothing will remain for Occhetto to do but dismiss Ciampi who, after he has resigned at the conclusion of the debate, would then have to go to the head of state, wherepon--the PDS leader says--"Scalfaro would have to go ahead and dissolve Parliament." This evening, in his year-end message, Scalfaro will announce that the elections will be speeded up, but without setting a date. Meanwhile, the head of state broadcast a message yesterday to Italians living abroad in which--among other things--he "apologized" for the fact that they will be unable to vote in the coming elections, and concluded on a hopeful note. "So many people," he said, "have helped to make it possible for us to be in better shape at the end of this difficult year! Indeed, part of our journey has already been completed."
