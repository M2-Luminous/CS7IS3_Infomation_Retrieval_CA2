No official reason was given, but this was a particularly difficult year for the aeronautical industry (LE MONDE, December 28, 1993). Overall, Airbus Industrie is said to have received some 59 order cancellations in 1993 and a total of 38 orders, yielding a negative balance of 21 aircraft. In 1992, the European aircraft manufacturer had a better year, with 136 orders for 95 cancellations. The manufacturer was particularly hard hit by order cancellations from the Irish company GPA (Guiness Peat Aviation). Last May, GPA was saved from bankruptcy by the U.S. group General Electric. In September, it announced a drastic restructuring plan. Airbus was more affected than Boeing, as its firm orders dropped from 91 aircraft (for delivery during 1993-2000) to only six to be delivered in 1997 and 1998. After this cancellation, the Toulouse-based consortium recalled that it still had orders for a total of 55 aircraft--mostly A-320s and A-321s--to be delivered to GPA by the year 2000. These mediocre results are due to poor economic conditions for airlines. Following an all-time high deficit of $4.8 billion in 1992, based on figures published by the IATA [International Air Transport Association], their losses are expected to total $2.4 billion this year. The overcapacity crisis drove airlines into a price war. In this context, they drew up drastic fleet and staff restructuring plans. Airbus Industrie is obviously not the only manufacturer to bear the brunt of these. For its part, Boeing announced a few weeks ago that it had received 226 orders during the year, but 214 airplanes were retired. Nevertheless, the European manufacturer's deliveries proceeded at a satisfactory pace. They should account for 138 aircraft in 1993, compared with 157 in 1992, which was a very good year. However, sales should be higher in 1993 than in 1992 ($7.6 billion) because of the delivery of long-haul A-340 jumbo jets. On the bright side, 1993 was marked by the introduction of the Airbus A-319 carrier at the Le Bourget Show. The A-340 was set into service in March 1993 at Lufthansa and Air France, and the first A-330 was delivered to its launching airline, Air Inter, in December.
