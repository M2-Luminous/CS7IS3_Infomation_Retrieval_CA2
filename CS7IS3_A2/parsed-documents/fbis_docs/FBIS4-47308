G. Sukhov, Institute of Control Problems, Moscow; UDC 681.3:61] [Abstract] Computer tomography problems place high demands on computing equipment. Regularization methods must be used; consequently, matrix algorithms must first be developed. Cellular methods may be advantageously used to solve large linear algebra problems on parallel computers by recursively decomposing the matrix problem and taking advantage of computer features. This paper studies the applicability of cellular methods in two-dimensional linear computer tomography. The image is represented by a square symmetric matrix of order n, which determines the resolution. A cellular-triangular SIMD computer with numerous processor modules with a small amount of local memory and a moderate amount of common memory may be used to solve the problem. The entire system can be controlled with a single program in special computer memory. Another way of solving the problem is to invoke control from a host machine, typically a PC. The first solution is suitable for tomography, the second for design work. References 5 (Russian).
