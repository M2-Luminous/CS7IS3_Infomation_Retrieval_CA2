What is Pinar del Rio doing in this regard? [Marrero] Well, as you said, what Pinar del Rio is doing, and what we did initially, is to try to be more effective in our production, especially taking into account the fact that we have lost millions in our agriculture, in our Sugar Industry Ministry [Minaz], in our production. The first measure to adopt, and which we are doing, is discussing in each workers' meeting the process being carried out jointly with the Cuban Workers Federation, the workers' parliament in the workplace, discussing the things that can be done there to reduce production costs, to be more effective in our activities. These are the main measures. [Cabrera] Excuse me, Marrero, how much did Pinar del Rio lose last year? [Marrero] Some 400 million [currency not specified] taking into account the losses in the agriculture and construction sectors, the Minaz, and even the expenses incurred by the people's government. According to the latest figures we have been assessing, the loss totals approximately 389 million [currency not specified]. We must also mention other measures, as you said, which are being adopted. But the essential ones are: how to produce more and how to produce more effectively. And at what level are we taking these measures? We are taking them at the level of the people's council. This a subject being discussed at the people's council. We can see how our president, the members of our council are participating in each of these centers, evaluating suggestions, seeing what can be done, and where are our failures, seeking to solve these problems. If we manage to reduce our loss by 50 percent this year, it will be 200 million [currency not specified], and 200 million with other measures. But this is not easy to achieve. However, we see that 50 percent is due to inefficiency in production. We are seeing this in an essential sector. We are seeing this in the agricultural area, especially that having to do with tobacco. We are getting ready for a historical harvest. The climate is good, but we can see that salary cost in the tobacco field is 50 percent of our salary costs in other places. We can better employ our labor force, we can reduce the daily movements of workers; we can better organize our battalions, and the Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC] will work more efficiently. So, there is an economic awareness which is leading people to see where they are spending each centavo, where are our resources are invested to make our production more efficient. [Cabrera] How is the government working to.... [Station announcer] Well, we have lost our communications with Pinar del Rio Province. We are going to try a new contact later through Radio Guama.
