Researchers said that questionnaires were answered by owners of 1,432 private firms. The survey said that these firms' registered capital totaled 68 billion yuan last year, twice as much as the previous figure. Registered capital per firm also increased by 80 percent to 268,000 yuan. The results show that the private firms are expanding in terms of financial strength and business scale.

By last June, private firms each with assets exceeding one million [as received] numbered 4,072, compared with only 885 in 1992. In some areas, the total value of assets in individual private firms exceeds 10 million yuan or even 100 million yuan each. The survey, headed by CASS senior researcher Zhang Houyi, also concluded that by last June, limited companies had increased by nearly four times over the same period of the previous year, and firms engaging in service trade had increased drastically.
