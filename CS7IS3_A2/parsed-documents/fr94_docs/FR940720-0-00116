FR940720-0-00116 FR940720-0-00007 The Agency has decided, however, that it is reasonable and effects Congressional intent to interpret ``consistent with this section'' to include all of section 209, including section 209(b)(1)(C). Hence, EPA believes that it should review nonroad authorization requests under the same ``consistency'' criterion that it reviews motor vehicle waiver requests. Under section 209(b)(1)(C), the Administrator shall not grant California a motor vehicle waiver if she finds that California standards and accompanying enforcement procedures are not consistent with section 202(a) of the Act. EPA has interpreted this criterion in previous motor vehicle waiver decisions. First, California's standards are not consistent with section 202(a) if there is inadequate lead time to permit the development of technology necessary to meet those requirements, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within that time frame. Second, California's accompanying enforcement procedures would be inconsistent with section 202(a) if the federal and California test procedures were inconsistent, that is, manufacturers would be unable to meet both the state and the federal test requirements with one test vehicle or engine. EPA's review of nonroad authorization requests will include the following. First, CARB must request EPA authorization of its adopted nonroad standards. Second, EPA shall not grant an authorization if (1) EPA determines that CARB's ``in the aggregate'' determination is arbitrary and capricious; (2) California does not need such standards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions; and (3) if California's nonroad standards are not consistent with section 209, i.e., that they not be inconsistent with section 209(a), section 209(e), and section 209(b), as EPA has interpreted that subsection in the context of motor vehicle waivers. J. State Adoption of California Standards and Test Procedures EPA received comments on several aspects regarding how other states may adopt California nonroad standards and test procedures. First, both EMA and EMI argued that other states that decide to adopt California standards should be subject to the same process as California. However, the Act neither requires that states obtain EPA authorization to impose California's nonroad engine standards nor authorizes the Agency to require that states do so. Under section 209(e)(2)(B), any state which has plan provisions approved under part D of Title I of the Act (generally states within ozone nonattainment areas) may adopt and enforce, ``after notice to the Administrator,'' California standards. Language requiring that other states request and receive authorization from EPA is noticeably absent. Indeed, the statutory text reads as authorizing states to adopt California standards on their own volition. In contrast, section 209(e)(2)(A) clearly states that California must receive authorization from EPA. Moreover, the language of section 209(e)(2)(B) is nearly identical to section 177 which provides that ``any state which has plan provisions approved under this part may adopt and enforce'' California motor vehicle emission standards. Under section 177 New York, Massachusetts and Maine have adopted California standards, and other states are considering following suit. These States did not ask for EPA authorization before they adopted the California standards, nor did EPA or the automobile industry suggest that they needed such authorization. 35 35 Ford Motor Co. v. EPA, 606 F.2d 1293, 1298 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Several commenters stated that section 209(e)(2)(B) required that California be subject to a two-year lead time requirement. EPA does not agree with this interpretation. Section 209(e)(2)(A) requires EPA to authorize California regulation of nonroad engines unless the Administrator makes certain findings, including that California's standards are ``not consistent with this section.'' As discussed earlier, EPA interprets that phrase as requiring that California's standards are technologically feasible in the available lead time. Since California is thus required to provide adequate lead time under section 209(e)(2)(A), it would not make sense to interpret section 209(e)(2)(B) as independently requiring at least two years of lead time. Instead, EPA interprets section 209(e)(2)(B)'s reference to two years of lead time in the same way it interprets the virtually identical provision in section 177: that an adopting state must provide two years of lead time before the California standards take effect in the adopting state and California must have adopted standards two years before commencement of the period for which the standards take effect in the adopting state, but California may adopt standards having less than two years of lead time in California. K. Rulemaking Procedure In the NPRM, EPA proposed definitions for the new engines used in the preempted categories: farm equipment, construction equipment, and locomotives. For equipment types that are used in a variety of applications, EPA also proposed a primary use test to assess whether such equipment is primarily used as farm or construction equipment. New engines used primarily in this equipment would be preempted from state regulation. EPA proposed that in determining ``primary use'', CARB would use sales data to show that an equipment type was or was not primarily used in farming or construction. When CARB requested EPA to authorize its proposed regulations, EPA would review California's determination regarding the primary use of particular equipment. In the Proposed Authorization Decision, 53 FR 45876, September 6, 1991, EPA proposed to review the decision California made regarding the primary use of nonroad equipment under an arbitrary and capricious standard of review, the standard of review that section 209(e)(2) requires that the Administrator use in reviewing California's determination that its standards ``will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable Federal standards.'' Several commenters, including EMA, EMI, PPEMA, and the Railway Engineering-Maintenance Suppliers Association, Inc. (REMSA) stated that EPA's proposed approach to determining the primary use of nonroad engines and equipment inappropriately relinquished authority to California. They pointed out that the primary use determination goes to the scope of the federal preemption accorded by section 209(e)(1), and argued that such a threshold determination should be made by EPA, not California. To the extent that California did have a role in determining primary use, they urged that EPA apply a clear and compelling evidence standard of review instead of the less strict arbitrary and capricious test in reviewing California's determinations. EPA believes these commenters are essentially correct in that the scope of federal preemption is not for California to decide and that EPA should have a greater role in making that determination than the Agency's proposal would have required. At the same time, EPA sees nothing wrong with having California make a preliminary determination as to the use of nonroad engines and equipment. California's coming forward with the evidence and analysis to support such a determination is in keeping with the role California has with regard to other aspects of the waiver and authorization requests it makes under section 209. Notably, sections 209(b) and (e) expressly place the burden of coming forward on California only with regard to the determination of the aggregate protectiveness of California's program. Nevertheless, under section 209(b) California has traditionally addressed not only the protectiveness determination but also the other two criteria set forth in section 209(b)(1)(B) and (C). This approach simply reflects the fact that California is the party interested in obtaining the waiver. Similarly, under section 209(e) EPA believes it appropriate for California to make a preliminary use determination (primary use, as discussed above) based on the available evidence and for EPA to review that determination in light of any public comments and additional evidence received. EPA agrees with the industry commenters that the arbitrary and capricious standard of review is not appropriate for review of California's primary use determination. The arbitrary and capricious standard is generally applied in two types of circumstances: (1) where the decision-maker must apply his expertise to resolve complex issues, or (2) where the decision-maker has been accorded discretion in making the decision under review. Underlying the arbitrary and capricious standard is a recognition that the reviewing authority either does not have as much expertise as the decision-maker or that the judgment of the reviewing authority should not be substituted for that of the decision-maker to whom discretion has been granted. An illustration of this approach to application of the arbitrary and capricious standard of review is Congress' specification of that standard for California's protectiveness determination under section 209. The legislative history of that section makes clear that Congress sought to give California broad leeway to design a program that in California's judgment was best suited to the unique set of circumstances faced by that state.
