They had gathered for a joint meeting in the Kirovskiy Zavod joint-stock company. It has been more than 70 years since Russia experienced this kind of economic collapse, and whereas the collapse then was caused largely by the effects of civil war and intervention, now the powers that be are wholly to blame. As speakers said at the meeting, all structures of production management--local, regional, and national--are absolutely paralyzed. Agricultural machine building, however, might be in the worst position. All work has stopped at the largest tractor plants--the Altay, Vladimir, Volgograd, Lipetsk, and Ural plants. Tractor production is at a standstill at the Kirov Plant, and this has halted operations at most other related enterprises. Hundreds of thousands of highly skilled workers have had to take an unpaid leave from work. The survival of the enterprises, speakers said, will require a precise government program for emergence from the crisis, primarily entailing changes in tax policy, the alleviation of the effects of mutual non-payments, and the creation of advantageous conditions for Russian producers of goods. "It has to begin with the payment of the state's debts to the rural community and with its economic revitalization," said Chairman Pozdnyakov of the trade-union committee of the Rostselmash joint-stock company. "Then industry will also recover." Speakers suggested that all members of labor collectives be asked to gather at their previous places of employment as a means of exerting social pressure and reinforcing the consolidation of the laboring public. An organizing committee was formed to take charge of the preparations for an all-Russian conference of industrial workers.
