"First, we would like to know what Russia's position is at the next meeting," he said while adding that, hopefully, Russia would comply to its responsibility to withdraw forces from Estonia by August 31 deadline without pegging it to other problems yet to be solved. During the last round of negotiations on March 1-2, Russia withdrew its earlier commitment to pull out its forces by August 31 and neglected to offer another date for negotiations. Following support to Estonia by the Western countries, Russia proposed another date which Estonia accepted. On answering the question on possible concessions, Reinart said the basis for negotiations were Estonia's laws. The position of retired Russian military has been an issue of debate between the two countries. The question has been dealt with in Estonia's Law on Aliens, Reinart said. Under the Law on Aliens, the retired military have no right to apply for residence in Estonia, but a following governmental decree allows granting them residence permits on individual basis. On commenting agreements initialled between Latvia and Russia, Reinart said that Latvia was in a more difficult position as they lacked respective legislation. Russia, of course, hopes that Estonia would amend some of its laws, Reinart added.
