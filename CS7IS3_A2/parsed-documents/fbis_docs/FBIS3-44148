It has also announced the establishment of the first vanguards of its national army, 6,000-strong, and the nucleus of a national police force. In this context, a "Republic of Somaliland" delegation begins a series of meetings in London today, Monday. [passage omitted] Interior Minister Musa Bihi Abdi [name as transliterated] told AL-HAYAH yesterday that Somaliland's independence has become a reality, "and we will explain to British officials the latest developments in our country. We will also seek their recognition of our independent state, as well as development and economic aid. Our people have decided on independence through conferences held by tribal chiefs and leaders in Somaliland, which enjoys security and stability. We currently have a government, the second since the announcement of the republic, a legislative council (parliament), and senate. And we have recently announced a national charter, which sets a date for a referendum on independence in July. And the parliament has recently approved the committee assigned to draw up a draft constitution for the country." [passage omitted] Bihi admitted that "undisciplined armed elements" still control the airport of Hargeysa, capital of Somaliland. However, he played down the effect of this on the central authority's role. He said: "We were faced with the same problem last year with undisciplined elements which were in control of Berbera port, which is now under our control. We are currently working to regain the airport peacefully. We are aware that the groups controlling the airport are running this vital facility well, and we are in contact with them." The Somaliland interior minister criticized the United Nations and its second operation in Somalia, UNOSOM-2. He said: "It is obstructing our efforts to consolidate our independence. This is why we have rejected and continue to reject the UN attempts to dispatch forces to our country and to impose its rules on us." He said that his country's government has invited several states and regional and international organizations to supervise and observe the impartiality of the referendum. He stressed that "the referendum will be conducted on the date set, even if the United Nations refuses to supervise it."
