Doctors Hakan Gnarpe and Stefan Sterner in Gavle have studied the occurrence of twar bacteria, which was formerly linked to the odd deaths among those involved in cross-country orienteering among the recruits. In 1990, 11 percent of the 506 recruits who were studied had antitwar antibodies in their bodies. This year antibodies were found in as many as half of those 394 who were studied. In 1991 and 1992 no comparable studies were done, which is why a clear picture of how the increase is occurring cannot be drawn. Gnarpe said that it is not a question of an epidemic within the I-14 unit alone. Twar can lead to a number of different infections from head colds to lung inflammation and heart muscle inflammation. Twar bacteria have proven to be more common in the Gavle area and in Dalarna than elsewhere.
