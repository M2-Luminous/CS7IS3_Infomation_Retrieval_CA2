Kasoulidhis added: On the basis of the official briefing by Gustave Feissel, no progress was made in Vienna. The spokesman made it clear that the Cypriot Government does not want to discuss with the United Nations or anybody else anything beyond the 21 March document, which the Cypriot side has accepted as it stands. Kasoulidhis noted: Any talk with us is out of context, since the negotiations are being held with the other side. Answering a question, the government spokesman said there is no information about the United Nations having amended the 21 March document, and added that the time limits the Security Council set for discussing the confidence-building measures have expired. Kasoulidhis stressed: What is expected following the UN secretary general's report is to determine alternative ways of promoting the UN resolutions. Our side will cooperate only through this process.
