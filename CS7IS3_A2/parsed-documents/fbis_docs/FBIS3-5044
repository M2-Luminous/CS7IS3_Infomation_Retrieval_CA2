An analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says it is the height of folly, that he, a despicable pro-American and pro-Japanese stooge, dared to let out such remarks, lost to shame. The news analyst goes on: The March First popular uprising of 1919 was an anti-Japanese resistance against the Japanese imperialists' brutal colonial rule and for the independence and sovereignty of the country. Kim Yong- sam is not entitled to talk about it, even if he had ten mouths. His "civilian" regime is a treacherous one of "the second term of the sixth republic" which has inherited the tradition of treacheries of the "first republic" of Syngman Rhee who manipulated the assassination of Kim Ku, the leading figure of the "Shanghai Provisional Government". What should not be overlooked is that the traitor Kim Yong-sam, allegedly commemorating the March First movement, insulted patriotic forerunners. He drivelled that although they rose up in resistance against the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule, the forerunners did not intend to "discipline Japan's crimes". And he said it is necessary to have a correct understanding of "new Japan" of today and "cooperate" and "compete" with it. This rigmarole of the traitor is a sermon telling the South Korean people to forget and not to call into question all the disgraces and sufferings they had undergone under the Japanese imperialist rule. It is a shameless jargon intended to conceal his pro-Japanese flunkeyist treacheries and prettify his clique's tieup with the Japanese reactionaries. A MINJU CHOSON analyst says the traitor Kim has more glaringly betrayed his true color as a pro-Japanese traitor although he tried to conceal his treacheries through his "March First address".
