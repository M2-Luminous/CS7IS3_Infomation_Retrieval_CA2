Fujimori also denied that a letter published in a local magazine is true. [Begin recording] [Fujimori] [words indistinct] Second, I am keeping the third letter under lock, in a safe, and no one else knows the combination. I therefore do not see how the letter could have left my safe. Then [words indistinct] the magazine published a letter which is not the third letter. I deny it. [Unidentified reporter] [words indistinct] [Fujimori] [words indistinct] Look, here we must use censorship to be able to handle properly the psychological aspect in the struggle against the Shining Path. The handling of this has been good. Now no one can criticize me about why the letter was published or that it was a propaganda coup for the Shining Path. All the facts contravene this statement because, thanks to the way the famous letters of Guzman were handled, massive desertions took place -- not hundreds, but thousands of Shining Path members deserted. The study we made from the psychological point of view was correct. [end recording]
