CPPCC, the broadest patriotic united front formed in the long struggle of the Chinese people, played a vital role in history. Before the eve of the founding of New China on October 1, 1949, CPPCC exercised the power of the National People's Congress and announced the birth of New China. After the convention of the first National People's Congress in 1949, CPPCC has continued to play an important role in the country's political and social life. The amended CPPCC Constitution further clarifies and strengthens the position and role of CPPCC, pointing out CPPCC is an important institution for multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Observers here noted this marks a new development after the addition of "the political consultation system will exist and develop for a long time" to the constitution of the People's Republic of China in an amendment last year. Scholars from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said the amended CPPCC Constitution stipulates the main functions of CPPCC, including the main content, form and procedures of "political consultation and democratic supervision." For instance, consultations are necessary not only before decisions are made on state policies, principles, important political, economic and social issues but also during their implementation. This shows that political consultations have become broader in scope and richer and in content. The amended constitution also adds stipulations on the rights and obligations of CPPCC organizations and members. The stipulation that CPPCC participating units and individuals have the right to expose and investigate acts violating laws and disciplines will further enable CPPCC organizations and members to exercise the right of administering state and social affairs. Wu Jianfan, a jurisprudence researcher of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that, though the CPPCC Constitution is not a law, it has a binding force since the political consultation system has been recognized by China's Constitution. Wu regarded the amended CPPCC Constitution as an important link in the development of China's democratic politics in recent years. Since China instituted reform and open policies 15 years ago, democratic politics has developed steadily. The country's two basic political systems -- the people's congress system and the multi- party cooperation and political consultation system -- have been improved and strengthened. In the people's congress system, deputies to people's congresses at the county level and lower are now directly elected; and for the national people's congress, there are more candidates than membership. China's Constitution stipulates that the tenure of office of the president, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee and premier should not exceed two terms, terminating virtual life tenure of office of the past. Other important steps taken in this direction include: in the CPPCC organizations, CPC members should not surpass 40 percent; non- communist persons have been recommended to assume posts in the government, establishment of a civil service system, and the adoption of strict examination procedures for the appointment, promotion and removal of officials. A senior jurist said that the amended CPPCC Constitution marks another milestone in the development of China's democratic politics. The amended CPPCC Constitution stipulates "participation in running and discussing state affairs" as a main function of CPPCC. The addition will not only expand the channels and scope of CPPCC participation but also has a far-reaching significance for the development in the country of socialist democratic politics with Chinese characteristics.
