Both D66 and PvdA are opposed to the system the liberals would like to implement. This was revealed during last Sunday's radio debate between the leaders of the four major parties. It was the politicians' first direct meeting in the parliamentary elections campaign. The D66 leader, Hans Van Mierlo, even stated that any government agreement which provides for a system, is out of the question. In such a system, employees would only receive a basic allowance in case of unemployment or disability. They would have to take out an additional insurance for themselves. Van Mierlo and PvdA leader Kok had serious doubts about such additional insurance. According to [VVD leader] Bolkestein, however, such a system is perfectly feasible. He referred to the situation of the self-employed. CDA leader Brinkman said that employers and employees could reach agreements on additional insurance plans during the Collective Labor Agreement negotiations. The D66 has been the strongest advocate of a "purple" coalition for some time. The possibility of such a cabinet has become greater, now that it has been suggested in CDA circles that the party should go voluntarily into opposition if the election results turn out to be as disastrous as anticipated by the polls. CDA leader Brinkman, however, rules out this possibility, for now: "It would be deplorable if we would create the impression that we are preparing ourselves to be in the opposition." For the VVD, discussing a "purple" coalition has become "normal," Bolkestein says. He argues that both winners of the next elections, most likely his own party and the D66, should be definitely included in the new cabinet. He sees either PvdA or CDA as a third potential cabinet member. Within the PvdA, a "purple" coalition is not rejected altogether. During a radio discussion, however, Kok referred to the problems which can be expected with the VVD regarding the future of social security. "I am mostly curious about the differences between the policy proposals of the D66 and VVD. There is definitely a difference between both liberal parties." The PvdA leader is known to be more favorable to a cabinet comprising the CDA, PvdA, and D66. As could be expected, the party leaders were rather gentle toward one another. The parties do not want to exclude each other. Due to the expected election results, at least three out of the four parties will be needed to form a cabinet which has a majority in the Lower Chamber.
