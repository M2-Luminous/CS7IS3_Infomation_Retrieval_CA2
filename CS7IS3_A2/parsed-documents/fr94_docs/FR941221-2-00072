FR941221-2-00072 FR941221-2-00059 Notice of Extension of Comment Period for Request for Comments on Preparation of a New 5-Year Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 1997&hyph;2002, and Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Proposed 5-Year Program SUMMARY: On November 16, 1994, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) published a notice (59 FR 59328) requesting comments on the preparation of a new OCS oil and program and intent to prepare an EIS for the same program. The comment period was due to close on January 9, 1995. To date, MMS has received requests from various sources for extension of the comment period. Several of the requests have come from coastal States that are experiencing a change in State Government administration as a result of the election of a new Governor in November. These States have requested time for the new administration to review the circumstances before having to comment. They and other requestors also have indicated that the end-of-year holidays make it more difficult to coordinate their comments. In keeping with MMS's aspiration to hear and consider comments from all interested and affected parties, MMS is extending the comment period to February 1, 1995. DATES: The MMS must receive all comments and information by February 1, 1995. ADDRESSES: Respondents should mail comments and information to: 5-Year Program Project Director, Minerals Management Service (MS&hyph;4400), 381 Elden Street, Herndon, Virginia 22070. Hand-delivered comments also may be received at 1849 C Street NW., Room 4230, Washington, DC. Respondents should label their comments and information as to subject matter. Those pertaining to program preparation should be marked ``Comments for Preparation of the New 5-Year OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program'' and those pertaining to EIS preparation marked ``Scoping Comments on the Program'' and those pertaining to EIS preparation marked ``Scoping Comments on the Proposed 5-Year OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program EIS.'' However, the MMS will review all comments received for the purpose of determining the scope of the EIS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Carol Hartgen, 5-Year Program Project Director, at (703) 787&hyph;1216; Tim Redding, Program Decision Document Project Manager, at (703) 787&hyph;1216; or Richard Wildermann, EIS Project Manager, at (703) 787&hyph;1674.
