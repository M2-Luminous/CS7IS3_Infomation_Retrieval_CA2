He Jing, one of the group leaders, SFCDRH deputy commander, and vice minister of water resources, stressed that responsibility for cities' flood control must be set for administrative leaders to discharge, and publicity must be intensified to combat indifference. To safeguard cities from floods, grass-roots cadres and people must heighten their flood control awareness and intensify this year's antiflood preparations mentally and organizationally, and with effective measures. He Jing continued: Since many Chinese cities are located by rivers and lakes, or near the sea, much has to be done in protecting these cities from floods. Whether these cities are safe from flood damage has a close bearing on China's social stability and economic development. Therefore cities' flood control is a priority project in China's flood control plan. This was why the SFCDRH organized the urban flood control inspection group to inspect certain major cities before the arrival of the high-water season. According to He Jing, the inspection group -- composed of personnel from the State Economic and Trade Commission, State Planning Commission, Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Construction, and General Staff Headquarters, as well as the SFCDRH General Office -- inspected flood control projects in Jiujiang, Nanchang, Guangzhou, Zhuhai, and Shenzhen from 1 to 10 June. The group found that these cities have taken flood control seriously, their precautionary measures have special characteristics, and they are quite successful in one way or another. But we must also be aware that the requirements which Chinese cities have set for flood control are quite low. For example, of the 472 cities with flood control assignments to carry out, only 93 of them, or 19.7 percent, have met the requirements for combating the kind of floods which occur once every 50 years; only 248 of them, or 52.5 percent, are able to combat the kind of floods that occur once every 20 years; and only 109 of them, or 23.1 percent, are able to combat the kind of floods which occur once every 10 years or less. This being the case, we must firmly intensify various non-engineering measures [fei gong cheng cuo shi 7236 1562 4453 2238 2457], heighten our awareness against floods, carry out all measures, and be well prepared against serious inundation. He Jing stressed that cities and economic development zones must attach importance to flood control projects. She urged cities in all parts of the country to achieve even greater success in flood control as well as in combating drought. She also reminded all localities to tighten inspection, attend to usually unheeded areas, and pay special attention to the safety of dams located near cities and on the upper reaches of main lines of communications during the high-water season.
