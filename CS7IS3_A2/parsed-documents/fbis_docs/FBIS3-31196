In the future, emphasis should rather be placed on improving its operation and increasing its efficiency, the draft electoral manifesto of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) says. The 200-page document, which was distributed among members of the MDF National Board in Budapest this weekend, will be discussed and finalized by the party's three-day national congress next weekend. The three chapters of the draft comprise the main issues of legislation, home affairs, foreign affairs, economy, agriculture, education, culture, health, and social welfare.
