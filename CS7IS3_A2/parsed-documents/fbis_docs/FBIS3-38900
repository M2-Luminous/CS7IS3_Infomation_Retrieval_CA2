On the day the trend was against Elisabeth Rehn, even though no other candidate could have offered better resistance! Anyone who thinks that there will be improved employment and a decreased need for local government savings because Ahtisaari is entering office is going to be disappointed, even though sufficient people have felt enough of the effects of the current crisis not to be able to vote for an incumbent minister. Rehn might have been able to strengthen her incredible campaign with a little more social liberalism alongside her concern for the activities of small businessmen; these can easily be reconciled. Unfortunately not even the economic upswing will be sufficiently visible in the employment sector. On the other hand mistaken action could widen the gulf between a public sector deficit economy and a growing market economy. Something important has happened on the political scene, even if Elisabeth Rehn did not make it all the way. The fact that she got as far as she did is confirmation of a change which will also have an effect on Ahtisaari's republic. Despite the fact that the language question was one of the marginal factors that toppled Rehn, her success showed how widespread bilingualism and the openness that also exists among monolingual citizens actually are. The Social Democratic Party's campaign for Ahtisaari was able to play on both strings of the language issue, and this had a not unimportant effect in northern and eastern Finland, despite the Center Party's support for Rehn. If Ahtisaari himself had been linguistically narrow-minded, this would have prevented him from becoming president -- something for the supporters of "Finnishness" and future presidential candidates to ponder. A large -- but not large enough -- number of women were carried along by the "Rehn phenomenon." There is always a minority above the mumbling masses which leaves its mark on the spirit of the age. It is a sign of the times that there are now more girls than boys in senior high school, more women than men in colleges. Growing numbers of women are living in one-person households and growing numbers of women are shouldering an often heavy economic and social responsibility for their own lives. Why should they not help themselves to their share of political life? More than different halves of the brain, changes to the traditionally so hierarchical management structures of companies and organizations are having their effect. With a new company culture women now have a more level playing field. Rehn has inspired women for the March elections next year and they have at the same time become a more attractive proposition for the political parties, even though this will not mean that the problems will be easier to solve. As the new president, Ahtisaari will have more to learn than did Mauno Koivisto. Koivisto had been prime minister at a time of change and he had been prime minister on another occasion. Coming from what is potentially the biggest party does have some political advantage, but it also represents a risk. Koivisto had a striking degree of personal integrity -- something that Ahtisaari should also demonstrate for his own reckoning after an election campaign that does not make this task any easier. The most important current issue is the EU [European Union] negotiations. Will the president give in to a EU offer or will he remain firm on government demands -- and to what extent? Will he be able to help the prime minister to keep the government together in the conflicting pressures that will surround an offer from the EU? How will he deal with a possible delay to membership or a no to membership from the government? Given the greater degree of parliamentary government and the changed foreign affairs arena it would be good if Martti Ahtisaari were to begain as soon as possible to create his own Foreign Affairs Council as a forum in which the party leaders can reach agreement on fundamental foreign policy questions so that they do not become a source of divisive political disagreements. The people have had their say. Martti Ahtisaari as head of state is a new element in the picture. The new presidential election system could have divided the country if there had been other finalists in the second round -- now it is back to everyday life in a united Finland!
