To initiate the plan, Taiwan may establish a holding company in Vietnam which will provide the Vietnamese agricultural sector with farm machines, technical consultation, and after-sale services. In addition, the Council of Agriculture is also studying the feasibility of sending agricultural experts to Vietnam to help out in forestation and forest conservation. The proposed loan will be offered by the ministry's International Economic Cooperation and Development Fund (IECDF) established in 1989 to provide financial aid to needy developing countries. During the past two years, IECDF has lent U.S.$30 million to Vietnam to expand a highway, U.S.$15 million to fund the development of small and medium-sized Vietnamese companies, and U.S.$10 million for the development of an industrial park to house Taiwan-invested factories. According to Vietnamese Government tallies, Taiwan remains the top foreign investor in Vietnam, channeling U.S.$1.567 billion into the country for 123 investment projects as of March 28. In 1993 alone, Taiwan investments in Vietnam totaled U.S.$388 million, the second highest among foreign investors behind Hong Kong which sent U.S.$607 million in Vietnam, the tallies showed. Most Taiwan investments focused on footwear processing, food processing, textile, wood processing, construction, and construction material industries.
