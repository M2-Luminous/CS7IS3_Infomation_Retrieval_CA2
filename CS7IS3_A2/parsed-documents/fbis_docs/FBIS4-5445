Mr. Keating is the first Australian leader to visit Hanoi. Tomorrow, he will hold talks with top Vietnamese leaders including President Le Duc Anh, the Communist Party General Secretary Doi Muoi, and the Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. Australian officials say Mr. Keating will take a low-key approach to human rights issues despite calls for a strong statement from Vietnamese Buddhist group and some Australian parliamentarians. The officials say they hope Vietnamese officials will finalize arrangement for an Australian parliamentary human rights delegation to visit Vietnam later this year, but diplomats say the visit will concentrate on expanding economic links with Vietnam. Australia is currently the third largest investor in Vietnam taking $620 million [currency not further specified], mostly for oil and telecommunications projects. Two-way trade last year was worth $366 million with Vietnam running up a $136 million surplus through crude oil sales to Australia. Australia's Prime Minister Paul Keating has spent his first afternoon in Vietnam sightseeing in Hanoi. The formal part of the visit will begin in the morning with an official welcome before beginning talks with Vietnamese leaders. Graeme Well reports Mr. Keating's main purpose in going to Vietnam is to assess the potential for economic development and what further role Australia can play. [Begin recording] [Well] Mr. Keating says Vietnam has a great opportunity to develop and he believes Australia can help make a difference in areas like aid programs, education, social policies, and commerce. Responding to a call for him to change his itinerary to acknowledge Australians who died in the Vietnam War, Mr. Keating said he does not discriminate in commemorating Australia's war dead. He repeated comments he made last year at the opening of the Vietnam Memorial in Canberra. [Keating in progress] ...[Words indistinct] same faith in Australia and the same belief in our values as every other service person did in other (?theaters) of the war. But again.... This in Hanoi and, really, in places I am visiting there is no natural opportunity as there was in Thailand. [end recording]
