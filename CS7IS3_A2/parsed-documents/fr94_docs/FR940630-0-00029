FR940630-0-00029 FR940630-0-00010 The Duke videotape, which was the primary basis for OSHA's determination that clothing made from certain types of fabrics should be prohibited whenever an employee is exposed to the hazards of electric arc, states that clothing made from 11-ounce cotton would not ignite under the conditions present during their arc tests. Clothing made from lesser weights of cotton could ignite and, once ignited, would continue to burn after the arc ceased. Clearly, from this evidence in the rulemaking record, clothing made from cotton of less than 11 ounces will not meet the performance criteria given in the standard for employees exposed to conditions comparable to those in the Duke Power Company tests. 1 Cotton of 11 ounces or more will not ignite and therefore does meet the requirement in §1910.269(l)(6)(iii) under the arc test conditions. 1 The conditions present during the Duke Power Company tests involved an 3800-ampere, 12-inch (approximate) electric arc that was approximately 12 inches from the material. The arc lasted for 10 cycles, or 0.167 seconds. On the basis of this evidence in the rulemaking record, OSHA has concluded that clothing made from 100 percent cotton or wool will be acceptable if its weight is appropriate for the flame and electric arc conditions to which an employee could be exposed. Employers must make a determination of whether or not 100 percent cotton or wool clothing worn by a worker is acceptable under the conditions to which he or she could be exposed. The factors employers must consider in making this determination are: The weight of the material; the available current involved; the duration of exposure; the distance from any possible flames or arcs that might occur; and the presence of other flammable materials (such as flammable hydraulic fluid) that could be ignited in the presence of an arc and, in turn, ignite the clothing. Later in this document, OSHA is correcting the quoted sentence in the preamble to the final rule in order to clarify the Agency's intent in this matter. (It should be noted that OSHA is not revising either the rule in paragraph (l)(6)(iii) or the note following that paragraph. The fabrics listed in that note continue to be prohibited.) Clothing made from flame-retardant or flame-resistant materials is acceptable under the rule. Employers are encouraged to ensure that their employees wear such clothing if they will be exposed to the hazard of flame or electric arc. In this regard, it should also be noted that the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has adopted a new standard, ASTM F1506&hyph;1994, for clothing to be worn for the protection of electrical workers who could be exposed to the hazard of flame or electric arc. This standard, which has not yet incorporated an arc-resistance test, requires the fabric used in clothing to pass a vertical flame test (that is, the fabric must be flame retardant or flame resistant). In fact, when OSHA revises §1910.269 or its counterpart in the Construction Standards (Subpart V of Part 1926), the Agency will be required under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) to adopt a rule that, if it differs substantially from the ASTM standard, must better effectuate the purposes of the OSH Act than that consensus standard. Employers should keep these facts in mind when adopting rules relating to the clothing worn by their electric power generation, transmission, and distribution employees. OSHA will continue to encourage ASTM Committee F18 (the committee responsible for ASTM F 1506) to expedite their research and standards development activities with regard to protective clothing worn by electrical workers. The Agency will use the latest information available from the committee and from other sources in revising §1910.269(l)(6)(iii) in the future. II. Stay of Enforcement of Certain Provisions of §1910.269 The electrical protective equipment standard and the electric power generation, transmission, and distribution standard, except §1910.269(a)(2), became effective on May 31, 1994. The Edison Electric Institute (EEI) petitioned OSHA to delay the effective date of certain requirements of these two standards until January 31, 1995, when the training requirements of §1910.269(a)(2) become effective. It said that several provisions require the purchase of equipment that is not in sufficient supply for the entire universe of affected employers. EEI also contended that other provisions require the modification of equipment or installations and that employers will need more than the 120 days given in the notice of rulemaking to make these modifications. It asserted that still other requirements entail significant departure from normal company practice and that detailed training is required to implement these requirements. The general training requirements, it noted, do not become effective until January 31, 1995. Lastly, it maintained that employers need more time to consult with OSHA to determine exactly what practices and procedures are acceptable under the new standards.
