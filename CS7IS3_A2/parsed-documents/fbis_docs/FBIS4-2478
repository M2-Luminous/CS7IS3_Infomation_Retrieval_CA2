They should conscientiously give heed to opinions and demands put forth by cadres and masses at the grass-roots level, acquire a clearer understanding of the situation in the rural areas where central and regional policies have been implemented, and clearly identify a series of major problems that have cropped up in the course of Guangxi's rural reform and development in order to work out feasible and effective measures. Furthermore, they should make pragmatic arrangements for this year's agriculture and rural work in light of the local realities and strive with one heart and one mind to push Guangxi's agriculture and rural work onto a new stage in 1994!
