At the moment this law was voted, he said, more than 60 per cent of the Albanian population have not been able to obtain the nationality document. Also, sanctioning by law the division in resident and non-resident categories is another aggravating factor for the Albanians, as it is known that a very great number of them are found today in various countries of the world. The motives for the census are political, the Albanian deputy says stressing that "The manipulation to reduce in the maximum and artificially the number of the Albanian population and the tendency to prove the absurd Slav thesis about the `non-autochthony of the Albanians in the territories on which they are residing today,' are manifested in the classification in citizens with nationality and without nationality." Albanian deputies voted for the Law on the Census under the pressure of the Macedonian state power and under the illusion created by the official propaganda about seriousness and fairness of the census, Mr. Shaqiri says. But, one day before the beginning of the census, they asked for the postponement of the schedule and change of the law because of the Albanians' reaction to unfairness in the law and preparatory procedures for the beginning of the census. "If we enrol now, the consequences will be catastrophic for us," he said adding that: "We must not give up persistence for the completion of the necessary documents, despite numerous obstacles created by the state administration, and participate in the census at a proper time." "It is not us, the Albanians, that have boycotted the census, but it is the law itself and the unilateral application of its preparatory procedures that have boycotted us," the Albanian deputy says, stressing that he, himself, although a deputy of the parliament of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, has not been able to obtain the nationality document.
