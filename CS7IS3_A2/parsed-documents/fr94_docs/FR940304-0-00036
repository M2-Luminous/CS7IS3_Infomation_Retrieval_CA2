FR940304-0-00036 FR940304-0-00015 The Committee is co-chaired by NCHS and HCFA. NCHS has primary responsibility for the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM diagnosis codes included in Volume 1_Diseases: Tabular List, and Volume 2_Diseases: Alphabetic Index. HCFA has primary responsibility for the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM procedure codes included in Volume 3_Procedures: Tabular List and Alphabetic Index. The Committee encourages participation in the development of diagnosis and procedure codes by health-related organizations, organizations in the coding field, and other members of the public. During each Federal fiscal year (FY), the Committee holds three public meetings during which coding changes are discussed. Taking into account the public comments made at each meeting and the public correspondence received after each meeting, the Committee formulates recommendations, which must be approved by the co-chair agency heads, the Administrator of HCFA and the Director of NCHS, before adoption for general use. Coding changes approved by the Committee and agency heads are published annually in the Federal Register . Only official volumes and addenda of ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM are to be considered in the assignment of diagnosis codes for Medicare patients. HCFA is not responsible for mistakes made by businesses in the replication of these official volumes and addenda, which are then sold to the public. Official addenda have become effective on May 1, 1986, and subsequently on October 1 of each year from 1986 through the present. Another addendum, containing the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection Codes, became effective for Medicare patients discharged on or after July 1, 1988. Before publication of the proposed rule on July 21, 1989, the GPO exhausted its supply of previously published addenda and announced that it had no plans to reprint more copies. However, the private sector continues to publish changes to the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM coding system annually by October 1st. The GPO also announced that it would no longer provide addenda except to subscription purchasers of the third edition. ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM, third edition, was published in March 1989; automatic addenda updates expired in 1991. The third edition incorporates all addenda that were previously published. We stated in the July 21, 1989 proposed rule that if a physician had not yet obtained ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM, second edition, and had not updated the set with the addenda, he or she should obtain the recently updated Volumes 1 and 2 (that include all the addenda) (54 FR 30560). The American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA), previously known as the American Medical Records Association (AMRA), the national professional association of medical records practitioners, and the American Hospital Association (AHA) have indicated that they intend to reprint these future addenda and make them available for sale. The price for Volumes 1 and 2 of ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM, fourth edition, is $65.00 for delivery within the United States and $81.25 for delivery outside of the United States. A purchaser must furnish an address other than a post office box because the volumes will be delivered only to a place of business or a residence. When ordering, the purchaser should enclose a check, money order, or Visa or Mastercard account name, number, and expiration date. Checks should be made out to the Superintendent of Documents. Updated volumes 1 and 2 may be purchased by writing to the following address: ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM, Fourth Edition, Volumes 1 and 2, P.O. Box 371954, Pittsburgh, PA 15250&hyph;7954. (Telephone orders may be placed through the GPO order desk at (202) 783&hyph;3238.) Section 424.32 sets forth the basic requirements for all claims. (The term ``claim'' is used when referring to the regulatory language instead of the term ``bill or request for payment''.) In ยง424.32(a), all claims (including those filed directly with Medicare by physicians, beneficiaries or other persons or entities for physician services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries) must be filed in accordance with HCFA instructions. Section 424.34 provides additional requirements for claims filed with Medicare by beneficiaries. Under ยง424.34(b)(4), the itemized bill must include a listing of services in sufficient detail to permit determination of reasonable charges. We proposed to make the following changes to the regulations text:
