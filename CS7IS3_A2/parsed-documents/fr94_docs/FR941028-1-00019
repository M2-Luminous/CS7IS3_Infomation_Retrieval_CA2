FR941028-1-00019 FR941028-1-00004 The Commission has shown some flexibility in the methods it has permitted to implement this competitive execution requirement. Historically, execution of orders in the futures industry has been conducted by open outcry on the floor of an exchange. The Commission has indicated, however, that other methods are acceptable under the Act. In this regard, in 1989, the Commission approved trading on GLOBEX, an electronic computerized trading system for trading futures and options contracts after regular hours. Under GLOBEX, trading is generally conducted on computer terminals through a competitive auction process pursuant to an algorithm, under which orders at the best prices would be executed first. Each terminal provides an equal opportunity for obtaining order execution. 30 Despite the fact that trading in GLOBEX is not conducted on the floor of the exchange, the Commission has viewed this order execution procedure as competitive and consistent with the Act and regulations. 31 30 See, e.g., CME's Proposed Amendments Relating to the Implementation of the GLOBEX System, 53 FR 25528 (July 7, 1988). 31 See also, the rules applicable to the NYMEX ACCESS System, and the CBOT's Project A, which have been approved by the Commission. Notwithstanding the fact that the Commission has afforded market participants some flexibility in this area, until recently the Commission has not permitted any procedures that provide for off-floor discussion of trades. 32 In 1991, however, the Commission amended Rule 1.39 to permit large order execution (``LOX'') procedures and the crossing of orders, procedures which contemplate some off-floor discussion prior to executing the orders in the pit. 33 In the Federal Register release approving LOX, the Commission emphasized that although off-floor discussions are permitted in LOX transactions, LOX procedures nonetheless ultimately ``allow participation by the entire pit'' when the trade is executed. 34 The Commission further noted that ``LOX transactions would be conducted only pursuant to exchange rules approved by the CFTC, and enforced through a contract market surveillance program, including measures specifically tailored to LOX procedures, designed to ensure compliance with the Commodity Exchange Act.'' 35 Accordingly, the Commission determined that LOX could be consistent with the Act. 36 32 Although prearranged trading is not expressly prohibited by the CEA, the Commission has held it to be a form of anticompetitive trading in violation of Regulation 1.38 as well as a form of fictitious sale under Section 4c(a) of the Act. See Collins, ¶22,982 at 31,903; Gimbel, ¶24,213 at 35,003. 33 See 56 FR 12336 (March 25, 1991). 34 56 FR at 12341. In contrast, the Commission has held illegal trading activities which do not provide real opportunities for the entire pit to participate in the trades. See, e.g., In re Murphy and Rudman, [1984&hyph;1986 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶22,798 (CFTC Sept. 25, 1985). 35 56 FR at 12341. 36 The principal statutory basis for Regulation 1.39 is Section 4b(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6b (as amended 1992), which addresses simultaneous buying and selling orders of different principals. The provision states that such orders can be executed ``at the market price,'' but requires that the orders be executed ``on the floor of the exchange'' and ``at public outcry across the ring.'' The Commission stated that the legislative history of this provision indicates that its purpose was to ensure that one order was not disadvantaged to the benefit of the other order or that both orders were not disadvantaged to the benefit of the broker. According to the Commission, since the statute did not prescribe the way in which this was to be accomplished, the Commission had the discretion to craft an appropriate method or methods ``to provide for the protection of customers in this area,'' including the discretion to amend Rule 1.39. 56 FR at 12338. Proposed §36.3 goes beyond LOX in that it not only allows off-floor discussion prior to execution but also allows execution without exposing the trades to the pit. In proposing a means of permitting these procedures, it is the Commission's intention to provide a way for exchanges to develop new trading procedures and standards intended to address the needs of their increasingly institutional market participants. The Commission did not attempt to describe whether there should be other limits on the procedures as it had no specific proposals to change pending methodologies before it and wanted to leave the exchanges free to develop designs consistent with the parameters set forth herein. 37 This also reflects the Commission's willingness to experiment through a pilot program with rules that relax, for certain market participants, the traditional Commission requirements for competitive trading. Specifically, the approach taken affords those participants the opportunity to execute large transactions with greater immediacy than might be available under existing contract market trading procedures. The Commission preliminarily believes that by permitting section 4(c) contract market participants to trade in this manner, the futures exchanges' ability to draw institutional participants to the more transparent exchange (as opposed to OTC) markets will be enhanced. 37 Compare, however, New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') Rule 76, which governs block trading and requires that a member who has set up a block trade and is bringing it to the floor to be crossed must first announce the proposed bid, offer, and transaction size to the floor. The member must then wait a reasonable amount of time to allow the ``crowd'' (including specialists) to trade against either side before completing the transaction. See also NYSE Rule 72, which provides priority to an agency cross transaction where both orders consist of 25,000 shares or more. At the same time, however, the Commission is concerned with maintaining essential market and appropriate customer protections. Therefore, it is proposing regulatory safeguards with which the exchanges must comply in formulating any innovative trading procedures. Proposed §36.3(b) lists those requirements which must be satisfied by a contract market seeking to establish such rules for section 4(c) contract market transactions. In this connection, the Commission requests comment as to whether additional or different requirements should apply.
