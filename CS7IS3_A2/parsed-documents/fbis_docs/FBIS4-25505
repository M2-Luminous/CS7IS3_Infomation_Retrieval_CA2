Representatives and monetary experts from both sides agreed that BOC and Portugal-funded Banco Nacional Ultramarino E.P., now the note-issuing bank in Macao, could issue notes in Macao at a certain ratio. Concrete measures will be discussed at later meetings of the working group. Han Zhaokang, representative from the Chinese team of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group, said after the fourth meeting here today that talks on the note-issuing would soon enter the essential stage. He added, the Chinese Government hopes that matters concerning note-issuing should be handled in the light of the regulations in the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and in the convergence with the Macao Basic Law. Han Zhaokang said he was convinced that when the work on note-issuing ends, "it will be a good thing for the maintenance of stability of Macao's monetary system."
