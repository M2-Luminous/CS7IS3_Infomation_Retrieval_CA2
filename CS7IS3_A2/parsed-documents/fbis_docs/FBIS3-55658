His studio guests are Zafar Maksudovich Fatkudinov, Academician at the Academy of Economy, Finances and Law, doctor of juridical sciences and a writer and Andrey Fedorovich Zavidiya, Chairman of the Galant company. Asked to explain why he wanted to take part in the program, Zavidiya says: "Well, to be brief, there is currently too much noise around the LDPR's sensational victory at the parliamentary elections. As the main organizer of these victories, I bear my share of the responsibility for all the statements which Vladimir Volfovich subsequently made and that is why I am here: to debunk a myth, dispel some rumors and conjectures." Zafar Fatkudinov explains that no single party was as skilled as the LDPR in capitalizing on people's fears, emotions and gut feelings, hence its electoral victory. Andrey Zavidiya then says, "The point is that the LDPR's program and its rules are completely out of sync with Vladimir Volfovich statements." Zavidiya shows the viewers Zhirinovskiy's "The Last Push South" and the party's program, entitled "The Liberal- Democratic Party of the Soviet Union -- Documents and Materials" and says that the party's program "is a fine program. I recall that when I paid for it, it was 26,000 -- the Zavidiya firm paid for the LDPR's program in 1991. Let me just remind you that I was, I am, and will remain a rank and file communist and that it is possible and desirable to cooperate, if not with everyone, then with the majority. I have practically no objections to this program and that is why I lent my support to the leader of the party whose program we intended to implement together. In particular, during the 1991 presidential elections we came third with him, in tandem with him and this was sensational. But the LDPR's program certainly fails to tally with Vladimir Volfovich current statements and that is why it is actually necessary to shed some light on this issue. "That is to say that the program does not plan any pushes south, or any other direction, north, west or east. But in his book he does plan such pushes, going so far as to state that it would be no tragedy at all for a country like Turkey to vanish from the face of the Earth. These statements are very poor tactics, of course, and I am aware of my own personal guilt in the sense that this man has practically come to power and I am the main agent to have facilitated this and that is why I would like to take this opportunity to say that I am duty bound to apologize to the peoples and countries visited by Vladimir Volfovich where he was rude to their peoples and leaders". Fatkudinov explains that the retaking of the Baltic states or the area of Alaska, as advocated by Zhirinovskiy, would entail rivers of blood, as was already once the case with Finland in 1940. Zhirinovskiy's adventures might lead to a nuclear holocaust, says Fatkudinov. People in the post-imperial Russia are very sensitive to the perceived suffering of their fellow countrymen elsewhere, but these issues are to be resolved by diplomacy and not tanks. No one has yet been able to recreate their own former empire and the way forward is to try and find room for refugees as was done successfully in Germany after the Second World War, says Fatkudinov, stressing that this is the only way to avoid bloodshed. Torchinskiy regrets that this was not spelled out during the election campaign and Fatkudinov agrees. The government must facilitate this expected influx of refugees and Zhirinovskiy's statements merely exacerbate the position of the Russophone population outside Russia. Asked by Torchinskiy about the LDPR's economic program, Zavidiya replies that it owes a great deal to former Prime Minister Nikolay Ryzhkov, a personal friend. Torchinskiy jokes about Zavidiya's self-proclaimed communist views and his position as Chairman of the Galant company which has 1,500 enterprises. Zavidiya goes on to say that the Galant company set up 3,500 organizing committees throughout the country and that they voted for him, rather than Zhirinovskiy who allegedly relegated his party list place from Zavidiya says that his was "a decisive" contribution to the victory. "The point is -- and we have had conversations with him on this -- that generally speaking he senses that I am a more serious rival than he is himself at the future presidential elections in 1996." Returning to the party's economic program, Zavidiya says that it revolves round the principle of mixed economy and the development of all forms of ownership. Fatkudinov derides Zhirinovskiy's reckless promises to improve the lot of all and sundry immediately. He finds particularly objectionable Zhirinovskiy's notions of fighting crime: Execute them on the spot. We've been there once, recalls Fatkudinov. Zavidiya adds that many people expected Zhirinovskiy to step down from his party chairmanship following the victory and to concentrate on being a deputy in the Duma. Torchinskiy then goes on to ask: "Many materials appear in the press to the effect that the appearance of the LDPR was provoked by the CPSU, the then CPSU leadership, of course and by the KGB." Zavidiya replies: "I categorically disagree with this, for the simple reason that I first made my acquaintance with Vladimir Volfovich during the events marking the anniversary of the October Revolution on 6 November 1990. It was also there that I met Boris Nikolayevich. I personally gave my visiting card to Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin and to Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy, during the celebrations of the October Revolution anniversary in the Kremlin. Boris Nikolayevich did not telephone me, but Vladimir Volfovich did. We met and began to cooperate. The first thing he said was: Andrey Fedorovich, how can the program, already being printed, be paid for? I said it would have to be looked at. I mean he gave me, he showed me their program, I saw that it was a normal program pure and simple and paid for it -- 26,000 rubles all in all, I paid for the whole program. I also paid 10,000 for his posters -- 10,000 for his posters and not a single kopeck more was handed over personally or otherwise. As for the election campaign in Russian, I paid for my travels with my own money." Asked about other sources of financing, Zavidiya says: "I simply have no such information, but since he turned to me for such a trifle as 26,000 and 10,000 -- well, I do not know, if there were other sources of financing, surely he would not have turned to me for such trifles, but this is just what I think." Asked about who defrayed Zhirinovskiy electoral expenses, Zavidiya says it was not his concern, for his organization worked for and voted for him and assured him that they did not share Zhirinovskiy's views. Fatkudinov concludes his contribution to the program by quoting the Criminal Code which makes propaganda of war a crime punishable by imprisonment of between three and eight years. Zavidiya doubts that many people share such extreme views. The task of electoral victory was accomplished, but between 50 to 60 percent of those who voted are his supporters, now leaving the party, says Zavidiya: "The LDPR bloc will collapse in the nearest future, you will see that". Asked for his forecast for the future, Zavidiya says that Zhirinovskiy will desperately push for presidential elections in 1994 -- his last chance. He hopes there will be no such elections. Asked whether he would take part in a live TV debate with Zhirinovskiy, Zavidiya says he would be delighted to do so, it would be his wildest dreams come true, and that he is ready for this at any time.
