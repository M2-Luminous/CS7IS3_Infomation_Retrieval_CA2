[Flores] I believe the president would like to see Cardoso elected. There are different opinions on whether this was the appropriate moment for Franco to comment on the issue, and I do not want to go into this discussion. I do not believe, however, that Franco did that to focus the country's attention on something other than the economic crisis. I believe he talked about the issue because deep inside this is what he wishes. [Monteiro] His comments, however, had a different effect in Congress. [Flores] Congress reacts to everything. Those who oppose the approval of the FSE and some items of the constitutional revision supported by the economic team will use the opportunity to oppose the plan. I earnestly believe that Cardoso's possible presidential candidacy may become a reality. Nonetheless, we cannot agree with those who use this possibility as a reason to create difficulties in the debate and approval of the constitutional revision issues. This is against the country's interests. [Monteiro] Would you vote for Fernando Henrique Cardoso? [Flores] I will not answer that question. [Monteiro] Your talks with Workers Party congressmen have been prompting rumors that you might run with Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. [Flores] No one has ever discussed that with me. I have never been asked about this possibility, directly or indirectly. From the candidacy viewpoint, this would be legally impossible because I am not affiliated with any political party. This is foolish speculation. [Monteiro] Would you vote for Lula? [Flores] One only chooses a candidate when the electoral scenario is defined. Lula probably will be a candidate, but I do not know who will be the other candidates. The problem is that the Brazilian electoral process has a few inconveniences that create a dramatic situation at the moment of casting a vote. Instead of voting for someone I believe to be the best candidate, I am forced to vote for the person who will be less harmful to the country. So far, this is the way I have been making my choices and this is bad for the political system. [Monteiro] How do you evaluate the country's current situation? [Flores] Personally, I believe that if we do not overcome the constitutional revision bottleneck, we will lose control. There is imbalance between what is asked from the government and the government's capacity to answer the requests. This imbalance has to be overcome in the constitutional revision. We cannot ask from the government more than it has to give. If we continue to ask the government for more than it has to give -- we are witnessing this in the areas of social security, health, and education -- we will end up in a very difficult situation. I don't know what will occur. I believe, however, that emergencies end up creating solutions. Therefore, if the governability crisis becomes worse, we will have emergencies and the pressure exerted by them will bring about solutions, which will be political solutions. [Monteiro] Could the solution be a military one? [Flores] Absolutely not. A military solution is impossible in today's Brazil.
