FBIS4-65328 "drweu095_e_94004" FBIS-WEU-94-095 Daily Report 17 May 1994 UNITED KINGDOM MPs: Buy Trident Missiles Now, Avoid Price Hike MPs: Buy Trident Missiles Now, Avoid Price Hike LD1705055994 London PRESS ASSOCIATION in English 0431 GMT 17 May 94 LD1705055994 London PRESS ASSOCIATION English BFN [Report by defense correspondent Charles Miller] [Text] The cost of buying Trident ballistic missiles from the United States is set to soar, MPs [Members of Parliament] warned today. They urged the Government to complete its purchase of missiles from U.S. manufacturer Lockheed "as soon as possible." Costs could rise by as much as 80 million pounds sterling this year alone because of the increasing likelihood that the U.S. will substantially cut its order, pushing up the unit price of each missile. The Commons defence committee warned: "We fear that future rises may far exceed present provision, and consider that MoD [Ministry of Defense] must be prepared to complete its missile procurement programme as soon as possible to avoid such cost penalties." Britain has purchased 44 missiles to date, and the total is likely to be around 70. But the committee stressed the purchases should be completed in much less than the four to six years suggested by MoD. In their report on the Trident programme, the MPs also disclosed that the production and assembly of nuclear warheads at the Atomic Weapons Establishment [AWE] at Aldermaston and Burghfield would virtually stop by the year 2000. This follows the cancellation last year of plans to replace the WE177 free-fall bomb and the end of Trident warhead production. The committee said a "large and costly" proportion of AWE facilities would be left idle and the two Berkshire sites would revert virtually to doing research work. The MPs agreed there was "no foreseeable need" for further British nuclear tests in the immediate future. And they urged the MoD to provide sufficient funds to ensure nuclear expertise and safety could be maintained without the need for testing.
