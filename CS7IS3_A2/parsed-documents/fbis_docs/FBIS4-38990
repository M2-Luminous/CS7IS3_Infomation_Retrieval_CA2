The Russian press also singles out the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the D-Day, the opening of the second front in Europe in the Second World War. In this connection, the ROSSIYSKIYE GAZETA newspaper notes that Russia was not invited to celebrate the D-Day jubilee. "It is understandable why Russia was not invited," the newspaper writes. "It is inconvenient for some people to stand next to those who made the main contribution to the victory over Nazi Germany and to boast of their combat feats in, let it be, the largest landing operation of the Second World War and yet an operation but not the decisive battle of the war." Writing on the same topic, the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper stresses: "An operation, unique in its scale and organisation, is a property of both military history and mankind's experience, experience of self-sacrifice in the name of victory over evil and an example of unity of people of various nationalities in the name of a common goal, about which some people forget these days." At the same time, the newspaper notes that, "according to public opinion polls conducted in France and the United States, the world started forgetting who made the main contribution to the victory over Nazism. "Some 20 per cent of respondents, on average, remember the Soviet Union. Most speak about the American victory. The French mention even Italy." The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper runs a front-page article, criticising the Finance Ministry headed by Sergey Dubinin. "The present-day Finance Ministry resembles a torpedoed ship which is still afloat and moves by inertia but already loses speed," the newspaper notes. The same newspaper carries an article devoted to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's return home. The newspaper writes in its commentary that people, beset by political passions, complain that Solzhenitsyn came to teach them how to live. "We ourselves make a lord out of him who will decide who is right and who is wrong," the newspaper says. "Solzhenitsyn who was not broken by gulag and a forced expulsion from the country, will not be anybody's confidant." The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper features an interview with Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov who opposes the salvaging of the sunken nuclear-powered Komsomolets submarine. Mikhailov, the designer of nuclear weapons of the third generation, says: "There is no need to surface the submarine. All examinations show that there is no leakage of plutonium". He claims that the submarine should be left at the sea bottom. It will sink into ooze, and nature will take care of neutralising the sub's nuclear weapons better than people. The PRAVDA newspaper carries an interview with Professor Aleksandr Livshits, head of the Russian president's expert group. According to Livshits, "provided there is clear course of the present government and no political confrontation, there is no more than one year left to the initial stages of an economic rebound in Russia". The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIA newspaper front-pages an interview with former State Security Minister Viktor Barannikov. He explains his removal from the ministerial post by the fact that "it was not to the liking of the president's team, above all, an insistent demand and readiness to take urgent and specific measures at the state level against an appalling pillage of the country's wealth. "They were incensed by facts (quoted in my reports) of direct complicity in this of high-ranking government officials as well as by glaring facts of corruption at the top echelons." Commenting on the talks on the division of the Black Sea Fleet, the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper writes: "It is in vain to hope for an early division of the Black Sea Fleet. The delay is advantageous for Ukraine, since Russia, in fact, maintains the entire fleet all alone, hence its Ukrainian part. "Besides," the newspaper continues, "some politicians are in no hurry to close the question on the Black Sea Fleet, since they `have not squeezed' as yet all political `dividends' out of this issue."
