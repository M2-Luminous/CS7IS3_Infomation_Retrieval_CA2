FR940810-0-00050 FR940810-0-00021 OSHA also proposed, in the general industry standard, to link the dates when engineering controls would be required to reach the new lower PEL with the EPA Ban and Phase-out Rule. This linkage is no longer an option since the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently vacated the ban and it is not yet clear which asbestos-containing products will no longer remain in commerce, and staged phase-outs of asbestos containing products are not required. Issue 3. Small Scale Short Duration Definition: The Court asked that OSHA clarify the exemption for ``small scale, short duration operations'' from the negative-pressure enclosure (NPE) requirements of the construction standard. The negative pressure enclosure requirements are a substantial set of requirements. They include creating a system of regulated areas with a sealed work area under negative pressure, decontamination facilities and procedures, clean room facilities and procedures and shower facilities, and other practices to reduce worker exposure and spread of contamination outside the work area. In that standard, NPEs were required for all removal, demolition and renovation work except for small scale short duration operations. The Court suggested, based on its view of the Agency's earlier intent, that OSHA limit the exemption to work operations where it is impractical to construct an enclosure because of the configuration of the work environment. In an earlier response to the remand order, published in the Federal Register (54 FR 52024, December 20, 1989), OSHA declined to amend the regulatory text on the small-scale, short duration issue, without conducting supplemental notice and comment rulemaking. The Agency explained ``that explicitly limiting the exemption to situations where negative pressure enclosures are impractical might not reduce employee risk from asbestos exposure.'' (54 FR at 52026). OSHA stated that in the supplemental rulemaking, it intended ``to discuss the effectiveness and drawbacks of negative-pressure enclosure, glove bags, and alternative control systems; and to specify more clearly under what circumstances various control systems may be used.'' (54 FR at 5207). OSHA also noted that the small-scale, short duration issue is related to the scope of the ``competent person'' requirement, which the 1986 standard lifted for operations which conformed to the exception, and thus combined consideration of both issues would be appropriate. Accordingly, in July l990, OSHA proposed related changes in both provisions ``small scale, short duration'' operations would be redefined in terms of general criteria, as well as the 1986 approach of listing specific examples. However, the underlying premise remained the same as in the 1986 standard: i.e. exemptions to the negative-pressure enclosure requirement for removal, renovation and demolition projects and limited to jobs which conformed to specified criteria. ``Competent'' persons, according to the 1990 proposal, were to be required as supervisors on all asbestos-related construction worksites, instead of as in the 1986 standard, that required competent persons only for non ``small-scale, short term jobs.'' Required training for competent persons, would vary, however, depending on the kind of asbestos- related job needing supervision. The final provisions resolving these issues, are different from the proposal. Four classes of increasingly hazardous types of construction activity are matched with increasingly stringent control requirements. Class I asbestos work means activities involving the removal of asbestos containing material (ACM) and presumed asbestos containing material (PACM) which is ``high risk.'' Class II asbestos work means activities involving the removal of ACM and PACM which is not ``high risk.'' Class III asbestos work means activities involving repair and maintenance where ACM and PACM is disturbed. Class IV asbestos work means maintenance and custodial activities during which employees contact ACM and PACM and activities to clean up waste and debris containing ACM and PACM. Each class includes work with similar exposure levels and with similar exposure risks. Each has a prescribed set of controls and work practices. Basically only Class I work, high-risk activities, require negative-pressure enclosures. The standard allows other designated proven control systems in limited circumstances and provides for yet-to-be-developed systems if certain backstop provisions are met. As indicated in its earlier responses to the Court, and its public notices of proposed rulemaking, OSHA has evaluated available control technologies and has concluded that the use of negative-pressure control enclosures should be regulated in terms of when they are required rather than when they are not. In a major departure from the language of both the 1986 standard and the proposal, OSHA is deleting the term ``small scale, short duration'' from the regulatory text. Instead, the agency is distinguishing high- from lower-risk operations through the use of the classification system described above. Work that was exempted from the negative pressure enclosure requirements in the existing standard because it was of ``small-scale, short-duration'' are considered to be Class II and Class III work in this amendment. The agency finds that the term ``small-scale, short term'' is too limiting, is confusing, and cannot be defined with sufficient precision to serve the purpose of distinguishing high risk asbestos-disturbing activity from activity of reduced risk.
