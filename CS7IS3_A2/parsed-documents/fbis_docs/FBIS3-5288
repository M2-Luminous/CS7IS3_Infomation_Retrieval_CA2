The sources said the decision will be formally announced at a two-day international conference on Cambodia to be held in Tokyo from March 10. Japan allocated 8.4 billion yen in grant assistance to Cambodia in the current fiscal year ending March 31. The fresh funds will go toward such projects as rehabilitation of Cambodia's national route 6, restoration of a power plant in Phnom Penh and improvement of water supply and drainage in the capital. Tokyo has invited representatives of 31 countries, the European Union and 12 international organizations to attend the second meeting of the International Committee on Reconstruction of Cambodia. Japan pledged in 1992 to provide between 150 and 200 million dollars to Cambodia over a three-year period covering fiscal 1992 to 1994. Foreign Ministry officials said Japan has since disbursed around 190 million dollars, making it the largest donor nation.
