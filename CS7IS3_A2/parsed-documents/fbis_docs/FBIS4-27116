NODONG SINMUN today says this is a typical expression of the arrogance of the United States, which has customed to encroach upon the sovereignty of other nations. The detection and destruction of military equipment of other countries are an unilateral exercise of armed forces against sovereign states and a gross infringement on their sovereignty, the analyst says, and continues: The program is aimed at making a forestalling attack on the DPRK and stifling it. The U.S. authorities' talk about "nuclear nonproliferation" is a sophism for strengthening its military predominance, the nuclear supremacy and justifying the military terrorism and invasion against the nations out of their favor. The acceleration of a new-type missile development by the U.S. conservative hardliners under the cloak of "nuclear nonproliferation" can never be justified in every respect. As for the nuclear proliferation, its chief culprit is none other than the United States. The United States has produced a large number of nuclear weapons and deployed them in different parts of the world. And it has helped Israel, Japan and South Korea in nuclear armament, conniving at it. "Nuclear nonproliferation" cried for by the U.S. authorities is nothing but a veil for covering up their crimes in nuclear proliferation and justifying their nuclear monopolization and the development of sophisticated weapons. The acceleration of the program for developing a latest-type missile may drive to a more dangerous phase the the Korean situation which remains acute. The United States must be held wholly responsible for the possible consequences. We are keeping tabs on the moves of the United States. The United States must promptly give up the inconsiderate program for developing new-type missile against the DPRK.
