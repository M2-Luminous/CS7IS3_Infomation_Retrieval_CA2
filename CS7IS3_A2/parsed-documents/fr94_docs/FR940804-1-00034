FR940804-1-00034 FR940804-1-00012 Interconnected populations can act as reservoirs to maintain populations that may be subject to periodic extirpation (Murphy and White 1984, Harrison et. al 1988). If a stochastic event eliminates a population of either species (due to factors discussed in this rule), few (if any) neighboring populations are available to recolonize the area. No information is available regarding the vagility of the Laguna Mountains skipper. The sedentary behavior of the quino checkerspot diminishes the probability that natural, long distance dispersal could reestablish most extirpated local populations. Periodic droughts (like those recently occurring in southwestern California) can adversely affect both of the species considered herein. Drought is known to decrease numbers of butterflies (Thorne 1963). Drought conditions may cause loss or early senescence of the larval host plant prior to completion of larval development, or lower the nutritional quality of the host plant (e.g., water content). Drought can also reduce the quantity and quality of adult nectar sources. Larval starvation and extirpation of local populations during periods of drought have been documented for Euphydryas editha (White 1974, Ehrlich et al. 1980). Habitat fragmentation can affect the genetic heterogeneity of small isolated populations like those of the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot. Small, fragmented populations are subject to a higher frequency of genetic drift and inbreeding. As a consequence, genetic variation of the population and individual heterozygosity is decreased. That can lead to inbreeding depression and lowered fitness of individuals. Low genetic diversity may decrease the ability of a species to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Genetically homogenous populations may be at a greater risk of extinction from environmental or demographic stochasticity (e.g., from fire or drought events) than are large, diverse populations that can more readily recover from such events. For example, variation in the length of diapause among butterfly offspring requires genetic heterogeneity (see Seger and Brockman 1987). If a population is variable in diapause length, it has a lower risk of losing an entire cohort to adverse environmental conditions during any given season. Individuals with prolonged diapause may survive if drought causes high mortality during the next season. A large population or metapopulation can maintain the genetic heterogeneity needed to maintain the population during these kinds of events. The quino checkerspot is somewhat adapted to unpredictable weather patterns but requires sufficient patches of suitable habitat to respond to this environmental stochasticity. The quino checkerspot's dispersal capabilities vary considerably depending upon rainfall patterns and the resulting availability of adult nectar sources and larval food plants. For example, a San Diego County population of the quino checkerspot exhibited an increase in numbers as a result of favorable weather (Murphy and White 1984). The greater number of larvae defoliated the larval food plants. This central core area was left without sufficient egg-laying sites for females, and adults went for greater dispersal distances in search of additional suitable habitat. Ideally these dispersing adults would have found marginally suitable areas, and in subsequent generations would have returned to a central core area. In this case, the mass dispersal failed to restore populations in previously occupied habitat, and the butterflies have not re-colonized the original site (Murphy and White 1984; Murphy, pers. comm. 1994). The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by these two taxa in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the Service finds that the preferred action is to list the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot as endangered. The range and habitat of these species has been substantially reduced by historical activities associated with urban and agricultural development and recreational activities. These two taxa are threatened by one or more of the following factors: Habitat alteration and destruction resulting from urban and agricultural development, grazing, overcollection, recreational activities, inadequate regulatory mechanisms, and displacement of the larval host plant by exotic species. The extremely restricted range, localized distribution, and small population size of both butterflies makes them very vulnerable to extinction by the factors listed above as well as by stochastic events such as fire and drought. For these reasons, the Service finds that the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot are in imminent danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their ranges. Threatened status would not accurately reflect the diminished status and threats to these species. Other alternatives to this action were considered but not preferred because not listing these species would not provide adequate protection and would be inconsistent with the purposes of the Act. Critical habitat is not being proposed for these taxa for the reasons discussed below. Critical Habitat Critical habitat, as defined by section 3(5)(A) of the Act, means: (i) The specific areas within the geographical area occupied by a species, at the time it is listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation of the species and (II) that may require special management considerations or protection; and (ii) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by a species at the time it is listed, upon a determination that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species. Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires that critical habitat be designated to the maximum extent prudent and determinable concurrently with the determination that a species is endangered or threatened. The Service's regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(1)) state that designation of critical habitat is not prudent when one or both of the following situations exist: (1) The species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and identification of critical habitat can be expected to increase the degree of such threat to the species; or (2) such designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial to the species. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent at this time for the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot. The quino checkerspot, mostly occurs on privately owned lands with little or no Federal involvement, although the Bureau of Land Management owns a portion of one site. The additional protection provided by the designation of critical habitat to a species is only achieved through section 7. Therefore, the designation of critical habitat would not appreciably benefit the quino checkerspot. Publication of precise maps and descriptions of critical habitat for the quino checkerspot and the Laguna Mountains skipper could result in additional habitat destruction through trampling, discing, and grading as well as collection. As discussed under Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section of this proposal, habitat for the one of the largest quino checkerspot colonies was graded in Riverside County to deliberately eliminate that population, and a number of quino checkerspot colonies have been subject to collection by lepidopterists for trading and similar purposes.
