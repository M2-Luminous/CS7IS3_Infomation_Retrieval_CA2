FR940719-1-00047 FR940719-1-00015 II. Background The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is proposing to revise the definition of return air in §75.301, and would revise §§75.310(a)(3), (a)(4) and (c), 75.311(d), 75.312(a), (b)(1), (c), (d), (g)(1), (g)(3), (g)(4) and (h), 75.313(c)(2), (c)(3), (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(2), 75.321(a), 75.323(b)(1)(ii), (c)(1), and (d)(2)(i), 75,333(a), (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4) and (e)(1), 75.334(e), 75.340(a), 75.342(a)(4), 75.344(a)(1), 75.360(a), introductory text to (b), (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(6), introductory text to (c), (c)(1), introductory text to (c)(3) and (f), 75.362(a)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1)(iii), and (d)(2), 75.364(a), (b) and (h), 75.370(a)(3), (c)(1), and (f), 75.371(b), (s), (z) and (bb), 75.372(b)(3), 75.380(d)(3), (d)(4)(ii), (d)(5), (f) and (i)(2) of its existing safety standards for ventilation of underground coal mines. MSHA is also proposing to redesignate §75.312(f) as (f)(1), and paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) as (g)(3) and (g)(4). Section 75.344(b)(2) would be redesignated as §75.344(b)(3). Existing §75.360(e) would be removed and (f) through (h) would be redesignated as (e) through (g). Existing §75.362(a)(2), (g) and (h) would be removed and (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) would be redesignated as (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(1)(iii). Existing §75.370(b)(1) through (f) would be redesignated as (c)(1) through (g). MSHA is further proposing to add new §§75.312(f)(2), (g)(2), and (g)(5), 75.320(e), 75.330(c), 75.333(h), 75.344(b)(2) and (e), 75.360(b)(8) through (b)(10), 75.362(a)(2), (d)(1)(i) and (g), 75.363, 75.370(b), 75.372(b)(19) and (b)(20), 75.380(d)(4)(iii), 75.380(f)(2) and (f)(6) and 75.382(g), (h) and (i). New introductory text would be added to §75.388(c), and new introductory text would be added to §75.389(c). These revisions are proposed in accordance with section 101 of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C. 811. On May 15, 1992, MSHA published a notice in the Federal Register revising its safety standards for ventilation of underground coal mines (57 FR 20868). To assure that mine operators could effectively plan and implement necessary changes, MSHA delayed the effective date of the final rule from August 16, 1992, to November 16, 1992 (57 FR 34683). Through discussions with the mining community, the Agency became aware of potential problems that could arise through the implementation of §§75.344(a)(1) and 75.313. MSHA therefore initially stayed these two provisions until July 1, 1993, (57 FR 53856) extended the stay until July 1, 1994 (58 FR 31908), and has extended the stay until the completion of this rulemaking (59 FR 18485). Sections 75.314, 75.315 and 75.345 are in effect during the duration of the stay. As proposed, §75.313 would revise paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(2) of stayed §75.313 and delete interim §§75.314 and 75.315. Also as proposed, §75.344(a)(1) would revise stayed §75.344(a)(1) and delete interim §75.345. Section 75.344(a)(1) was stayed to determine whether requiring all compressors to be located in a noncombustible structure or area could create a fire hazard due to overheating. Section 75.313 was stayed to further consider the effect of fan stoppages in certain mines. As written, the standard would have allowed circuits and equipment used to withdraw persons from the mine to remain energized until the persons are withdrawn. The Agency is concerned that under some conditions methane could migrate into haulageways after a fan stoppage. This could result in a hazard if all underground electrical circuits are not promptly deenergized and all mechanized equipment is not shut off. On November 16, 1992, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) issued an order staying the application of the air quality standards for oxygen and carbon dioxide at 30 CFR 75.321(a). MSHA is continuing to litigate this application of the standard. However, in conformance with the Court's order, the Agency has suspended indefinitely §75.321(a) and redesignated the first sentence of previous §75.301 to remain in effect as §75.321(c) (57 FR 55457, November 25, 1992). The result is that, with the exception of bleeder systems and worked-out areas, the Agency is continuing to apply the oxygen and carbon dioxide limits to all areas where persons work or travel as in previous §75.301. As proposed, §75.321(a) would revise suspended §75.321(a) and delete interim §75.321(c). III. Discussion of the Proposed Rule A. General Discussion Underground coal mine ventilation affects various aspects of the safety and health of miners. Proper underground coal mine ventilation is necessary to protect against mine fires and explosions due in part to the presence of explosive gases, oxygen-deficient atmospheres, and accumulations of other harmful gases and float coal dust. Ventilation is also a primary method of controlling miners' exposure to respirable dust and preventing the development of pneumoconiosis (black lung). In enacting the statutory ventilation standards of the Mine Act, Congress expressly recognized these and related dangers associated with inadequate ventilation:
