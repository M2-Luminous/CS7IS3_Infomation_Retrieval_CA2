The political and economic situation in Crimea remains serious and unpredictable after the presidential elections also. The results of socioeconomic development of 1993 have borne out the gloomiest forecasts. They have made it possible to see that a number of political leaders have for the sake of their own ambitions reduced the people to indigence and humiliation. The main political slogan with which the Communists are going into the elections is labor, the power of the people, and justice. We call on all to unite around these principles. I. Political Situation in Crimea Under the influence of the forces that still really dispose of power the creation of new political parties and their hurried registration have been artificially accelerated in the Republic. The intention of the sponsors of this campaign is to camouflage the representatives of the "power party" and get them elected to the Supreme Soviet and pilfer the votes of the electorate from parties which already have their own political character. To this end there has been the nomination in all head-to-head constituencies of numerous so-called "independent" candidates and also the mass nomination of candidates occupying the most important positions in the power structures. All this is geared to a conclusive change of sociopolitical system. Confirming its statutory and program positions as a party expressing the interests of the working class, peasantry, and intelligentsia and all working people and the positions of internationalism and patriotism, the Republic committee of the Communist Party of Crimea sees the actions of the organizers of the "new" parties as a manifest aspiration to split both the workers movement and all patriotic forces in Crimea, disconnect our society, counterpose town to country, the agricultural laborer to the plant worker, and the youth to the elderly, and to artificially embroil people of different social groups. II. Main Goals of the Communist Party of Crimea The main goal set by candidates from the Communist Party is the restoration and realization of social safeguards. The great state in which our peoples lived prior to the Belovezha conspiracy was not, of course, devoid of shortcomings. The political and economic structure was in need of serious improvement, but instead of the gradual reform and strengthening of the system of the organs of the power of the people--the soviets--and a smooth transition to the new principles of economic policy, indiscriminate processes which signified the disarticulation of the Soviet Union and the profound crisis of the national economy gained the ascendancy. The Communist Party of Crimea links, therefore, the possibility of the achievement in full of its main goal--the realization of social safeguards--with the restoration of a unified state based on common borders, customs, credit system, and monetary unit and the creation of the corresponding organs of administration. The form of state arrangement of this voluntary union of the peoples (federation, confederation) should be determined at a referendum. III. Place and role of the Republic of Crimea History no longer allows of the possibility of tarrying over the adoption of a decision, this is today a matter of life and death! The political and economic crisis in Ukraine is intensifying increasingly, and Crimea must realize its right to the independent determination of economic priorities. It is essential primarily to surmount the spiral of hyperinflation, and this is only possible within the framework of the closest alliance with Russia and the other republics. For Ukraine this should be a powerful motivating factor of the closest economic integration in an alliance with Russia and the other republics. This would be a first step toward a new, unified state, in whose restoration the Republic of Crimea is destined to perform its particular historical role. IV. Stabilization of the Living Standard of Society and Restoration of Social Safeguards In view of the urgent need for a halt to the continued fall in the living standard of the majority of the population below the poverty line and the threat of starvation, the Communists will seek persistently in the Supreme Soviet of Crimea the adoption of a law on the building of a state system of social protection of the populace on the principle of the conformity of pay, pensions, and grants to the actual subsistence minimum. The Communist deputies will demand of the executive specific measures geared to the fight against unemployment and the creation of new jobs, the introduction of government subsidies for fixing the price of bread and milk, free health care and education, higher education included, and the accessibility to each family of children's establishments, and so forth and will also oppose all attempts to further deprive the people of social safeguards. V. Ways of Accomplishing the Tasks Set in the Election Platform of the Communist Party of Crimea The economic basis throughout the period of restoration should be a multistructural economy with the retention of the leading role of public property and state regulation of production. State regulation should provide for the extrication of the national economy from the severe economic crisis, and its multistructural character is a step toward the achievement of social harmony, of which we are in such need today, on the basis of a particular concurrence of the interests of the broadest strata of society: from the worker and employee through the national entrepreneur. A fundamental change in tax and credit policy for the purpose of stimulation of the producer of any form of ownership (private included) by way of concessionary taxation and lending with a simultaneous expansion of the tax and investment field, the establishment of government subsidies to agriculture and the elimination of the "price scissors" in respect to agricultural and industrial products, and furtherance of the development of both the kolkhozes and sovkhozes and tenant and private farms are necessary. We will simultaneously conduct a merciless struggle against crime, corruption, and parasitic profiteering and oppose the introduction of the private ownership of land, which is the main wealth of Crimea and must not become a subject of speculation. The land and its resources are public property. It may be transferred, on a long-term and indefinite basis even, with transfer by inheritance, but without the right to buy and sell. We will ensure effective state supervision of the activity of enterprises of all forms of ownership and restore renewed people's control. The Communist Party is prepared to submit such a package of laws for consideration by the Supreme Soviet of Crimea. Only the restoration of common statehood and an upturn of production will enable us to stabilize the economy, restore a decent living standard of the people, and secure acceptable starting conditions for the implementation of real reforms. We have prepared and sent to the president of the Republic a "100 days" program, which is geared to the accomplishment of the priority tasks and which does not require big capital outlays. VI. Strengthening the Power of the People As a guarantee of the preservation and strengthening of the state status of Crimea and the exclusion of the establishment of an authoritarian dictatorship, we see as the main task the broadening of the sovereignty of the soviets of all levels. The chairmen of the city and rayon soviets should be elected directly by the public of the corresponding cities and rayons. Consulting the people via a referendum should be the cardinal path of a solution of all strategic questions of the Republic's socioeconomic development. Esteemed fellow citizens! On 16 and 30 January 1994 you demonstrated high political maturity and expressed by your vote total lack of confidence in the power party. But this political force remains a real obstacle in the way of the accomplishment of real social transformations in the interests of a majority of the people inasmuch as it has a majority in the Supreme Soviet and holds the key positions in the Council of Ministers of our republic. For this reason we cannot allow to hold the mandates of deputies the representatives of that same power party, beneath whatever flags they have conducted their election campaign and in whatever "democratic" clothing they have garbed themselves. Yours must be a deliberate choice!
