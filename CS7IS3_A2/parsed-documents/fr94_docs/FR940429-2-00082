FR940429-2-00082 FR940429-2-00062 The difficulty with this argument is that there is no evidentiary support for the premise. Given Commonwealth's policy concerning correctable conditions, the more likely inference is that Mr. Marshall scheduled the surgery early so that he could have his employment application reinstated as soon as possible. See T. 612. The most that can be determined based on the record is that Mr. Marshall's hernia presented an elevated risk of injury at some point in the future. Mr. Marshall was working as Chief Electrician at another company when he applied for work with Commonwealth. His job involved stooping, bending and lifting up to 80 pound weights, T. 592, but he was not aware that he had an inguinal hernia. T. 593. Because the hernia has characterized as ``early'', PX 3, no reasonable probability of substantial harm has been shown for employing Complainant Marshall at the time he applied and I therefore find that Commonwealth has violated Section 503 by failing to hire him. IV. Individual Relief In addition to seeking offers to employment 11 for those subjected to handicap discrimination, OFCCP requests back pay and retroactive seniority. Commonwealth argues that back pay is not authorized by the Act and regulations. While Section 501 authorizes back pay by incorporating that remedy from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Commonwealth notes that Section 504 incorporates the remedy from Title VI which does not have a provision relating to back pay. Because Section 503 does not provide for back pay awards, Commonwealth maintains that, as under Section 504, a back pay remedy is not available. Com. Resp., at 76&hyph;77. 11 The Assistant Secretary has held that ordering employment of a job applicant is an appropriate remedy for a Section 503 violation. Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., Case No. 84&hyph;OFC&hyph;8, Ass't Sec. Dec., Nov. 17, 1989, slip op. at 4, rev'd on other grounds sub nom Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. v. DeArment, 55 Empl. Prac. Dec. [CCH] ¶ 40,507 (D.D.C. 1991). The Supreme Court, however, has held that Section 504 authorizes a plaintiff to bring an equitable action for back pay, because, although not specially listed therein, back pay is an available remedy under Title VI. Consolidated Rail Corp. V. Darrone, 465 U.S. 624, 630&hyph;31 (1984). It is therefore apparent that the absence of any mention of back pay in Section 503 does not preclude its availability as a remedy for violations. The Assistant Secretary has so held, finding that back pay is within the directive of Section 503(b) to ``take such action thereon as the facts and circumstances warrant *␣*␣*'' Texas Industries, slip op. at 31. See also Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs v. Exide Corporation, Case No. 84&hyph;OFC&hyph;11, Acting Ass't Sec. Dec., Apr. 30, 1991, slip op. at 17. In addition, the Secretary has recently held that back pay may be ordered under the parallel contact compliance program, Executive Order No. 11,246, although there is no explicit reference to back pay in the Executive Order. United States Dep't of Labor v. Honeywell, Inc., Sec'y Dec. and Order June 2, 1993, slip op. at 26&hyph;34. Commonwealth also contends that there is no authority for awarding retroactive seniority because the Section 503 remedies are tailored for compliance with affirmative action obligations rather than for private remedies and the absence of a private right of action under Section 503 means there is no private remedy available. Com. Resp. at 80&hyph;81. I disagree. The cases cited by Commonwealth, while stating that there is no private right of action under Section 503, nowhere hold that OFCCP cannot seek a remedy on behalf of a complainant. 12 The Assistant Secretary has consistently held that retroactive seniority is an appropriate remedy for a Section 503 violation. 13 See, e.g., WMATA, slip op. at 29; PPG Industries, slip op. at 35. 12 These cases generally held that because Section 503(b) authorizes the Secretary to take action on complaints, relief is available to complainants and a private right of action would be incongruous. 13 This is consistent with federal case law which provides that in employment discrimination cases the remedy should be designed, as nearly as possible, to make the victim whole. See Albemorle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422, 418&hyph;19 (1975). The existence of a right, in this case not be subjected to handicap discrimination, implies the existence of all necessary and appropriate remedies. See Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc. 396 U.S. 229, 238&hyph;39 (1969), SEe Johnson V. Railway Express Agency, 421 U.S. 454 (1975); Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409 (1968); Mizell v. North Broward Hospital Dist., 427 F.2d 468 (5th Cir. 1970). Commonwealth nevertheless argues that retroactive seniority should not be awarded in this case because the union was not jointed as a party. Com. Resp. at 81. See EEOC v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 714 F.2d 567, 577 (5th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1204 (1984). While Safeway holds that a union must have the opportunity to participate in the proceedings where the relief ordered violates the seniority provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, 714 F.2d at 577, 579, that decision, in my view, goes beyond the requirements of applicable Supreme Court precedent.
