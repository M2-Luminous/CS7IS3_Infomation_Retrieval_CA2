A senior official of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a key member of the seven-party coalition, said Tuesday night the party must rethink the proposal but said the basic concept has not changed. A senior official of Komeito, another coalition party which backs the plan, also said the study group could not be formed at the present juncture. Shinseito, Komeito and the Japan New Party led by Hosokowa have agreed to establish a policy study group next month with the aim of ultimately merging all of the coalition parties into a single party. But Tomiichi Murayama, leader of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest force in the coalition, Tuesday expressed opposition to the plan. Murayama told reporters that if joining the study group is a condition to be selected as a joint candidate under the new electoral system for the House of Representatives or if the group is designed to create a new party, he "would not be able to agree" to let SDPJ legislators participate. Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) Chairman Keigo Ouchi said Tuesday coalition members should not rush to join the study group, which he said is based on a scheme to create a new party. "Joining the group as individuals could lead to a collapse of the political party," he said. "There is no chance that the DSP will participate in the group en masse under the current circumstances."
