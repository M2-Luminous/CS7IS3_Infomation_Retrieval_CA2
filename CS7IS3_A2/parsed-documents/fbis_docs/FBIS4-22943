Its attraction for processing of liquid radioactive waste is in its capability of deep water purification and concentrating all impurities in one flow. The article presents results of studies aimed at determining the effect of various surfactants on the efficiency of water demineralization by membrane distillation, and determining the depth of radioactive water purification from [.sup]137[/] Cs, [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]90[/]Y. It was found that membrane distillation was inefficient in purification or demineralization of water solutions containing surfactants unless surfactant molecules had been eliminated by some other means. It was also found that the use of membrane distillation made it possible to achieve a fairly high coefficient of purification of liquid radioactive waste and get a more concentrated brine. The article suggests implementation of the proposed method in a mobile unit for processing of liquid waste. Figures 3, tables 2, references 7.
