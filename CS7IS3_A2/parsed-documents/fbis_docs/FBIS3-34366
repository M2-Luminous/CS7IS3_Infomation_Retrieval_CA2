Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that four residents sustained slight injuries when soldiers fired at stone throwers in Nabulus. Another incident occurred in Rafah, where two residents were slightly injured when soldiers fired at stone throwers. [passage omitted] Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq, member of the Fatah supreme committee in the Gaza Strip, says the announcement by several Strip Fatah Hawks members of their intention to resume armed struggle is a spontaneous reaction to the killing of Salim Mu'affi, rather that a decision made by the organization. In a talk with our correspondent, 'Abd-al-Raziq said the continuing manhunt for Fatah Hawks by the security forces undermines the local population's confidence in the peace process.
