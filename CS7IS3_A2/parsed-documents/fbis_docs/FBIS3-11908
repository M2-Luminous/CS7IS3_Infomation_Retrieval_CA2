In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Rafael Hernandez, department head for the Center for American Studies, said the presentation and discussion of a draft bill by a group of congressmen headed by Representative Charles Rangel is important because this will enable Washington to measure the political cost of its policy toward Cuba. Hernandez added that whether or not the repeal is approved, this discussion shows there is political interest in ending the blockade against Cuba both within and outside the U.S. Congress . Hernandez explained that even within the U.S. Administration itself there are groups that have different ideas on the subject, and he stressed that because a group within Congress has adopted this position, greater support could be given to those arguing in favor of normalizing relations with Havana. All this makes the U.S. national outlook more complex and varied, especially on the official governmental level, he said. Writer and journalist Nicanor Leon Cotayo argued that what is taking place in Congress is symbolic of the growing U.S. awareness of the need to review the blockade policy. He recalled that Rangel's proposal is not the only one, noting that others have tried to introduce modifications on bans preventing U.S. citizens from traveling to Cuba and that there have been calls for making current limits on medicinal exports more flexible. Leon Cotayo said one cannot disregard an increasingly growing sentiment among important sectors of U.S. society regarding this issue. Leon Cotayo also mentioned the importance of the debate as a message to the White House -- a message that indicates the blockade strategy is increasingly being questioned in the United States. The Cuban writer described the congressional discussions that began the previous day as being significant in terms of the process of growing opposition to the blockade, which is felt in the heart of U.S. society. This makes one think, he concluded, that even if the lifting of the embargo is not around the corner, we see on the other hand that it is not so far away. Evelio Barrios, vice director for the Center for American Studies, said it is impossible for the U.S. Government to continue to ignore the political cost the blockade has on its international image. He said: What is most important is that this will permit the assessment of a new consensus being created within Congress on the issue, even though I do not expect any changes in the official position in the immediate future. Barrios also recalled that two UN votes favorable to Cuba opposed Washington's punitive measures, that editorials in influential U.S. newspapers have been critical of the blockade, and that several prominent people have denounced the blockade. Moreover, the United States sees the serious international problems it has caused itself by implementing the Torricelli Law and by trying to destroy Cuba's economy.
