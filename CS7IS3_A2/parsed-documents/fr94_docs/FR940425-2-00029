FR940425-2-00029 FR940425-2-00022 In addition, we find that the record does not contain substantial evidence supporting the use of oil production type curve analysis as a method to calculate effective gas permeability. First, all 34 type curve wells were analyzed with equations where current gas-oil ratios were used, as well as a single current reservoir pressure of 1,000 psia and the corresponding fluid properties at that pressure. 14 Second, the oil permeabilities used in the calculations were derived by the analysis of the historical oil production from the 34 wells. It is not clear how the oil permeabilities thus calculated can be used to calculate gas permeability before sustained production. 14 The record also does not show how current pressures in wells first produced from 1984 to 1988 would be the same. Moreover, the record does not show which of the four productive intervals was represented in each type curve well. Our review of the record further shows that in seven instances, the gas-oil ratios and historical oil production from more than one well were combined to arrive at a single permeability value. This method is not supported, however, because the record does not explain why these values properly reflect the proportion of the permeability and flow rates attributable to individual wells. Finally, although the record shows that all 34 type curve wells were selected based on the criteria that daily oil production rates were available, the only two type curve wells within the recommended area were analyzed using monthly oil production rates. In addition, Texas approved prior Spraberry proceedings in which the applicants indicated that daily production was used because monthly production did not result in enough definition in the type curve for a precise determination of permeability. Therefore, Texas should provide additional support showing the basis for its acceptance of the two type curve wells within the recommended area as useable permeability data wells. Under ยง275.202(a) of the regulations, the Commission may make a preliminary finding, before any determination becomes final, that the determination is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Based on the foregoing facts and discussion, the Commission hereby makes a preliminary finding that Texas' determination is not supported by substantial evidence in the record upon which it was made. Texas or the applicant may, within 30 days from the date of this preliminary finding, submit written comments and request an informal conference with the Commission pursuant to ยง275.202(f) of the regulations. A final Commission order will be issued within 120 days after the issuance of this preliminary finding. By direction of the Commission. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
