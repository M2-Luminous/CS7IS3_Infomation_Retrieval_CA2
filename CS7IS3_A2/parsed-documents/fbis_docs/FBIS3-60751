Hiroshi Oe, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official, said that Japan and China agreed to hold security talks annually and that talks between the two countries' defense ministries will also be held beginning early next year. Tadashi Ikeda, director general of the Asian Affairs Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, represented Japan in the one-day talks, which were arranged in a meeting between foreign ministers in May. Oe said that both sides acknowledged the importance of upcoming multilateral talks at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) forum on security, also to start next year. Both sides agreed that the United Nations Cambodian peacekeeping operation was successful and expressed willingness to cooperate in the future, Ikeda said. The Chinese side, represented by Wang Yingfang, director of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Foreign Ministry, said that China is pursuing its own approach to North Korea concerning the nuclear question on the Korean peninsula, but did not elaborate, Oe said. Wang also stressed China's willingness to cooperate in all nuclear test ban treaties, while emphasizing China's policy of refusal of first strike capability and refusal to use nuclear weapons on nonnuclear countries, he said. He also said that China refused sales of M-11 missile technology to Pakistan and was appropriately managing its control of chemical weapons. China also denied that it is planning to build or buy an aircraft carrier, Oe said.
