FR941019-2-00159 FR941019-2-00085 [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;424 and 50&hyph;425] Georgia Power Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation, Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia, Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Unit 1 and 2; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 50, Appendix E, Section IV.F.2, regarding annual exercise of the emergency plan to Georgia Power Company (GPC or the licensee), for the Vogtle Electric Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Dalton, Georgia. Environmental Assessment Identification of the Proposed Action The proposed exemption would allow a one-time schedular exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix E, Section IV.F.2 which states that each licensee at each site shall annually exercise its emergency plan. By letter dated July 21, 1994, the licensee requested a schedular exemption from the requirement for the Vogtle Power Station, based upon a request from the State of Georgia and local governments, to delay the exercise from July 27, 1994, to January 11, 1995, because of the flood disaster in Georgia. The licensee had planned to conduct a full-participation exercise involving the States of Georgia and South Carolina and local response organizations on July 27, 1994. The licensee requested that an exemption be granted because the State of Georgia requested to delay the 1994 annual exercise from July 27, 1994, to January 11, 1995. The request to move the exercise date was originated by the Georgia Emergency Management Agency (GEMA) because they would be unable to participate on July 27 as GEMA personnel were required to respond to a federally-declared flood disaster in South Georgia. This proposed delay will prevent Vogtle from meeting the annual requirement to exercise the Vogtle emergency plan as specified in Appendix E to 10 CFR 50, and therefore, GPC requested a schedular exemption. The previous emergency preparedness exercise at Vogtle was successfully conducted on August 4, 1993, and no violations, deviations or exercise weaknesses were identified. Offsite participation was limited to receiving Emergency Notification messages. A joint plume and ingestion exposure pathway exercise involving the States of Georgia and South Carolina and the four local governmental agencies was conducted on May 19, 1992. The licensee had scheduled, planned and coordinated the 1994 exercise with participating Federal, State, and local agencies for mid-July. The scope and objectives, and the final scenario documentation for the July 1994 exercise were submitted to the NRC on April 14, 1994, and May 17, 1994, respectively, which is within the time frames established for their submittal in support of a July 1994 exercise. The schedule for future exercise will not be affected by this exemption. GPC has stated it will conduct the previously scheduled 1995 exercise the week of July 19, 1995, as planned. The licensee states that concurrence for the proposed date of January 11, 1995, has been received from FEMA, NRC Region II, and the affected State and local agencies. FEMA confirmed its support for the revised exercise date on September 1, 1994.
