Now the whole truth has become apparent. The word "resignation" appeared for the first time on the front page of a daily -- as though NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG had decided to abandon him after it had insinuated, with the help of a few readers' letters a few days earlier, that people believed that he ("and his family") should be left alone. Has Thomas Klestil caused this media war through carelessness? Will he receive EVERYTHING EVERYDAY -- or will he be left without anything in the end? U.S. President Bill Clinton is also facing media reports about former mistresses. Still, the population apparently judges him by his domestic achievements and his performance as President. Polls have been showing large popular support for some time -- for good reasons: Clinton did not offer stories about his past to the media, and he did not appoint beauty queens as members of his cabinet. His political program is not shaped and influenced by a mistress -- even if only optically. On the other hand, the interviews with Edith Klestil have shown how eloquent and quick-witted the "First Lady" is. It has become clear that she might have been able to assume political tasks beyond the duties laid down in the protocol, that she might have become a mini-Hillary at the Hofburg Palace. Thus, it is all the more understandable that, as a first conclusion, she left the official villa and not her husband, who must have left her a long time ago as far as his feelings are concerned. Even though Klestil's resignation might seem obvious to some, and even though some of his friends in the Austrian People's Party might not be too unhappy about that, resignation should not be offered as an easy solution to the president -- all the more so because the idea was launched by tabloids. Moreover, a resignation by the president is not covered by the Constitution -- as though the rules of the monarchy were still valid. Naturally Austria has not plunged into a state crisis because of this affair. The president continues to be able to act politically. However, the need for the president to settle his private matters that even effects his closest aides at the office is all the greater. What is the real problem? First, a clarification is required regarding the private sphere that was sold to the population as intact during the election campaign. Klestil should try to win back his wife on her conditions or seek a divorce. In both cases, his aide Margot Loeffler would have to return to the Foreign Ministry, which could be ordered by the foreign minister, who is her official boss. Second, the office itself must be examined. Klestil has always considered his German counterpart, President Richard von Weizsaecker, as his ideal. This is probably no longer topical, even though a solution of his private problems might save some of his public authority. It would probably take months to restore it. If it is not possible to repair the presidency, the public, the Austrian People's Party, Klestil himself would have to think about resignation. The president still has a little time to prevent this and to prove that he is still capable of fulfilling his duties as president. Otherwise, there is the danger of a greater damage and of a lasting weakness: Whereas anger, bitterness, and withdrawal characterized Waldheim's term of office, the worst of all judgments is now threatening -- that of ridicule.
