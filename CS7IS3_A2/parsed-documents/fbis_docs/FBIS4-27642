FBIS4-27642 "dreas107_j_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-107 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 Indonesia * Political Positions of ABRI, NU * Political Positions of ABRI, NU 94SE0121C Jakarta KOMPAS in Indonesian 23 Apr 94 p 1 94SE0121C Jakarta KOMPAS Indonesian CSO [Text] Jakarta, KOMPAS--ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] continues to hold firmly to its principle that it will not interfere with the internal affairs of any sociopolitical organization. Therefore, the report is not true that ABRI supports persons were nominated for the chairmanship of certain sociopolitical organizations, including the Development Unity Party [PPP]. Lieutenant General R. Hartono, chief of the ABRI Sociopolitical Staff, said this to reporters Friday, 22 April, in Jakarta. He further stressed that in the PPP congress to be held in the middle of this year, ABRI will not give any special support to specific candidates promoted for the general chairmanship. "ABRI will merely encourage that the congress be conducted on the basis of norms that apply to the nation and the organization concerned," he said. When asked about reports that B.J. Habibie (minister of research and technology) supports KH [Islamic Scholar and Pilgrim] Yusuf Hasyim for the August congress of the PPP. Hartono quickly replied, "I have never heard that." He acknowledged the possibility that NU (Nahdatul Ulama [Muslim Scholars League]) members may personally channel their aspirations through the PPP in the next election. Thus, it is understandable if there are now calls for candidacies of NU people for the PPP chairmanship in the next term. What is clear, he said, is that ABRI will not choose sides. When asked his opinion on the leadership of PPP General Chairman Ismail Hasan Metareum, the three-star general commented, "All right." Continues To Have No Part in Politics On a separate occasion on Thursday, 21 April, Abdurrahman Wahid, general chairman of the NU PB [Executive Council] declared that the NU's position continues unchanged, namely that it will not take part in politics and will not be bound to any sociopolitical organization. If the recent reports that "NU people" are prepared to seek PPP leadership are true, they refer to personal positions and rights, which have no connection with the NU as an organization. Commenting on the meeting of about 50 NU politicians who gathered at TMII [Beautiful Indonesia Minipark] last week and agreed on leadership of the PPP, Gus Dur [nickname of Abdurrahman Wahid] said, "The meeting needs no response from the NU. Let it be. They were acting personally, were they not? There are NU people in personal capacities in all three sociopolitical organizations," he said. Gus Dur strongly objected when he was asked about the impression among some people that a number of NU politicians are "returning" to the PPP because of not having received any place in GOLKAR [Functional Group] or the PDI [Indonesian Democratic Party]. "Who said they (i.e., those who held the meeting at TMII) are the NU? They were all PPP, not NU. Any NU manager (KH Yusuf Hasyim) present, was there in his personal capacity. Those who want to plunge into sociopolitical organizations in an organizational way are prohibited from using the name of the NU," he declared. When asked whether he personally supports an NU member for PPP leadership, Gus Dur replied, "There is no need to give support. If they want to perform, they should do so--not only in the PPP, but in GOLKAR and the PDI, too." On a different occasion, Ali Masykur Musa, general chairman of the PB of the Indonesian Islamic Student Movement (PMII), said there would be nothing wrong and it would not violate the 1926 Policy if the NU were to return to politics. "Is not one of the points of the policy the promotion of political maturity in the Islamic community?" Ali asked. The public demand that the NU return to politics, he continued, is an expression of public political maturity and is "synchronous" with the NU.
