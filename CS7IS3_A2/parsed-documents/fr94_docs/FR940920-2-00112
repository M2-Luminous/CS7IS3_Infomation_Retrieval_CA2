FR940920-2-00112 FR940920-2-00057 [Release No. 34&hyph;34664; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;01] Self-Regulatory Organizations; NYSE Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating to New Organizational Structures for Members September 13, 1994. I. Introduction On February 22, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to amend the Exchange's Constitution and rules to allow the admission of entities with new organizational structures as members. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1994). The proposed rule change was noticed for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34390 (July 15, 1994), 59 FR 37278 (July 21, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change. II. Description of the Proposal The NYSE is amending NYSE Rule 311(f) to permit entities with new organizational structures to qualify for admission to Exchange membership. Specifically, the NYSE is amending its rules to permit the Exchange to approve as a member organization, entities that have characteristics essentially similar to corporations, partnerships, or both. For example, the amendment permits the Exchange, it its discretion, and on such terms and conditions as the Exchange may prescribe, to approve business trusts, 3 limited liability companies 4 or other organizational structures as member organizations so long as the characteristics of the entity in question are essentially similar to those of corporations or partnerships. Currently, memberships on the Exchange can be owned by individuals, partnerships, and corporations. The noncorporate or partnership entities would have to be structured in such a format that would qualify as a broker or dealer registered with the SEC pursuant to the Act, as this is a prerequisite to becoming an Exchange member organization. 5 3 The term ``business trust'' is generally used to describe a trust in which the managers are principals, and the shareholders are cestuis que trust. The essential attribute is that property is placed in the hands of trustees who manage and deal with it for use and benefit of beneficiaries. Black's Law Dictionary 180 (5th ed. 1979). 4 A limited liability company (``LLC'') has characteristics similar to both corporations and partnerships. For example, the liability of LLC members is limited to their capital contributions, but, if properly formed and managed, an LLC is treated as a partnership for tax purposes. 5 See Article I, Section 3 (i) and (j) of the NYSE's Constitution. The Exchange believes that the rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(2) of the Act 6 in that it permits registered brokers or dealers to become member organizations of the Exchange. The Exchange also believes that the rule change also is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, 7 in that it broadens the types of entities which the Exchange may approve as a member organization and therefore avoids possible unfair discrimination, and with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act, 8 in that it serves to remove possible burdens on competition resulting from organizational structure not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 6 15 U.S.C. §78f(b)(2) (1988). 7 15 U.S.C. §78f(b)(5) (1988). 8 15 U.S.C. §78f(b)(8) (1988). III. Discussion The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b). 9 Specifically, the Commission believes the amendment is consistent with Section 6(b)(2) 10 of the Act, which requires the rules of an exchange, subject to the provisions of Section 6(c) of the Act, 11 to ensure that any registered broker or dealer or natural person associated with a registered broker or dealer may become a member of the exchange and any person may become associated with a member thereof. 9 15 U.S.C. §78f(1988). 10 15 U.S.C. §78f(b)(2) (1988). 11 15 U.S.C. §78f(c) (1988). The NYSE currently allows individuals, partnerships, and corporations to become members of the Exchange. 12 The amendment would enable entities with new organizational structures similar to corporations and partnerships to become Exchange members and be included in the Exchange's definition of a member organization. As in the case of a partnership or corporation applying for membership, the new entity will be subject to all other requirements for membership approval. 12 Article I, Section 3 of the NYSE's Constitution and NYSE Rule 2 state that the term ``member organization'' includes ``member firms'' and ``member corporations.'' The term ``member firm'' is defined as a partnership. The NYSE Board of Directors has interpreted the use of the word ``includes'' in this Constitutional provision and Exchange rule as illustrative, and not restrictive. Therefore, the NYSE does not believe it necessary to amend Article I, Section 3 of its Constitution, nor NYSE Rule 2 to allow additional entities to be included in the term ``member organization.'' See letter from Bruno Lederer, Associate General Counsel, NYSE, to Sandra Sciole, Senior Counsel, Division, dated August 22, 1994. The Commission believes that the amendment to NYSE Rule 311(f) reasonably balances the Exchange's interest in having the flexibility to approve entities with new organizational structures for Exchange membership, with the regulatory interests in protecting the financial and structural integrity of a member organization. For example, although the amendment permits the Exchange to approve business trusts, limited liability companies, or other organizational structures with characteristics of corporations or partnerships as member organizations, the NYSE will review each Exchange member organization application on a case-by-case basis, and prior to approving any such organization for membership, the Exchange must be satisfied that: (1) The Exchange would legally have appropriate jurisdiction over such an entity; and (2) the permanency of the entity's capital is consistent with that required of other member organizations. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 13 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;01) is hereby approved. 13 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 14 14 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1994). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
