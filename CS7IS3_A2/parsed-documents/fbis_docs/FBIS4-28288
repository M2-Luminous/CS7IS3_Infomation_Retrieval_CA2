FBIS4-28288 "dreas111_c_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-111 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 North Korea Relatives of Prisoners in ROK Send Letters Relatives of Prisoners in ROK Send Letters SK0906112494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1036 GMT 9 Jun 94 SK0906112494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- Relatives of unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea, Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, in the northern half of Korea sent letters to South Korean organizations on June 8 calling upon them to actively cooperate in the struggle for their early repatriation to the North. The letters were addressed to the headquarters for the promotion of the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, the Human Rights Committee of the National Council of Christian Churches, the Bar Association for a Democratic Society and the Council of the Movement of Families for Democracy. Kim Pong-son and Kim Pong-suk, younger sisters of Kim In-so, in their letter said their brother, who was taken prisoner while active as a guerrilla in the area of the South side during the war, should have been returned to his hometown right after the ceasefire under the international law. They charged that the South Korean authorities kept their brother in prison for more than 30 years for the mere reason that he refused to recant his belief and, after his release from prison, are refusing to send him home with the far-fetched argument that he is not a prisoner of war. They said they, old women now in the evening of their life, earnestly request the organizations of the South side to make their utmost efforts for the repatriation of their brother to the North where his children, family and relatives are waiting for him, while he can walk on his own feet. Paek Chong-kwon, a nephew of Ham Se-hwan, in his letter said the fact that his uncle requested various organizations to cooperate in his repatriation, not yielding his will despite harsh persecutions, tells that he does not want to live in South Korea but earnestly hopes to return to his hometown where his flesh and blood live. Recalling that the South Korean Red Cross side took a negative attitude by refusing the just demand of the DPRK Red Cross society for his repatriation with the unreasonable allegation that he could not be "regarded as a prisoner of war" and he "has got citizenship", the letter says this runs counter to the spirit of the Red Cross. He expressed the belief that the organizations would make positive efforts to realize the repatriation of his uncle without fail.
