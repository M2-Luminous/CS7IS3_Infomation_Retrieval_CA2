FR940628-1-00078 FR940628-1-00014 A similar analysis was done using tilt table angle. For tilt table angle, each increment was approximately equivalent to 0.75 degrees. For vehicles with a tilt table angle between 42 and 46.4 degrees (the equivalent of the critical sliding velocity range), an increase of 11 percent (also four increments, or 3.00 degrees) in tilt table angle was predicted to decrease single vehicle accident rollovers among compact sport utility vehicles by about 15 percent, standard sport utility vehicles by about 19 percent, compact pickups by about 17 percent, minivans by about 20 percent, and standard vans by about 22 percent.

Predicted Single Vehicle Accident Rate To estimate the number of single vehicle accidents in a hypothetical future vehicle population, NHTSA assumed that the future population would have the same proportion of vans, pickups, and sport utility vehicles as the 1991 production, and that the population would have the same proportion of high and low critical sliding velocity and tilt table angle vehicles within these categories. NHTSA then distributed the numbers of serious injuries by vehicle category (as tabulated by Data Link Inc., under contract to NHTSA) among the 1991 example vehicles on the basis of relative production volume, relative single vehicle accident involvement rate, and relative rollover risk per single vehicle accident. (The Data Link reports are available in Docket 91&hyph;68, Notice 2.) Data Link reported injuries and fatalities by vehicle types: pickup truck, van, sport utility vehicle (called MPV in Data Link reports), and car. NHTSA further divided the vehicle types into subcategories of compact and standard to make average accident rate and rollover risk more meaningful. NHTSA also divided injuries and fatalities between compact and standard versions of each vehicle type. To do this, NHTSA assumed that rollover harm was proportional to the number of rollover accidents within a vehicle type. The numbers of rollover accidents among compact vehicles relative to those among their standard counterparts were estimated by multiplying their 1991 production ratios by their single vehicle accident per registered vehicle ratios and their RO/SVA ratios. The total number of injuries and fatalities was then divided proportionally.
