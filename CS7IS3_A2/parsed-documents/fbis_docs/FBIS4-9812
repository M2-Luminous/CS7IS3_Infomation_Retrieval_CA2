FBIS4-9812 "drlat064_m_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-064 Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 SOUTH AMERICA Brazil Surcharge Increased for U.S., Canadian Wheat Surcharge Increased for U.S., Canadian Wheat PY0104180694 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1802 GMT 30 Mar 94 PY0104180694 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Brasilia, 30 Mar (EFE) -- Official sources reported here today that the Brazilian Government has ordered an increase in import duties for wheat over a period of four and a half months. The sources added, however, that Argentina -- Brazil's main trade partner in the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) -- will not be affected by the increase. The wheat surcharge -- which ranges from 10 to 17 percent -- will be enforced from 15 September 1994 to 31 January 1995, the period for marketing Brazilian wheat. The measure will particularly affect U.S., Canadian, and German wheat. An Agriculture Ministry spokesman told EFE that the decision is designed to expand trade with Argentina and to promote Brazilian wheat production. Agriculture Minister Sinval Guazelli is also studying a proposal to impose a surcharge on grounds of unfair competition on any wheat purchased by Brazilian mills from countries that are subsidizing agricultural production. The proposal, which is part of a package that would go into effect until 1997, seeks to make the surcharge match the value of the subsidies granted by the producing country. In light of the process of eliminating customs duties within Mercosur, under which member countries are entitled to an 82 percent tax reduction, the import duties to be paid on Argentine wheat sold to Brazil amounts to 1.8 percent. Additionally, a bilateral agreement guarantees the annual purchase by Brazil of 2 million tonnes of Argentine wheat. Actual purchases have, however, often been higher than this minimum figure. In 1994, Argentina will export between 3 and 3.5 million tonnes of wheat to Brazil, but the Brazilian imports will total some 5.5 million tonnes. Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has described the purchase of Argentine wheat as a "strategic" decision linked to integration within Mercosur and has said that Brazilian mills have acknowledged the advantages of purchasing Argentine wheat because of the low import duties and lower freight costs involved. The Argentine Government has expressed its displeasure over the U.S. offer to sell 500,000 tonnes of wheat to Brazil at subsidized prices. According to official sources in Brasilia, a U.S. Government delegation has made the offer to Brazilian officials. Argentine-Brazilian trade, which has markedly increased since 1990, is negative for Argentina, whose deficit in 1993 amounted to $1,074,200,000. According to the Brazilian Foreign Trade Secretariat, in 1993 Brazilian sales to Argentina totaled $3.7 billion, while its imports from Argentina totaled $2,625,700,000.
