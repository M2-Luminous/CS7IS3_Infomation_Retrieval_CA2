FR940128-2-00178 FR940128-2-00116 Jayen C. Shah, M.D.; Revocation of Registration On September 23, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator (then-Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Jayen C. Shah, M.D. of 624 Benner Road, Allentown, Pennsylvania, proposing to revoke his DEA Certificates of Registration, AS2199328 (Missouri), AS2094756 (Illinois), BS3036185 (Iowa), and BS3067142 (New Jersey); and deny his pending application for registration as a practitioner in Pennsylvania, for reason that his continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. The Order to Show Cause was sent by registered mail to Dr. Shah at his registered locations in St. Louis, Missouri; East St. Louis, Illinois; Waterloo, Iowa; Woodbury, New Jersey; and his most recent address in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The copy sent to the East St. Louis address was returned to the DEA by St. Mary Hospital with the notation that Dr. Shah was not at that address. Also, the hospital apparently forwarded a copy to Dr. Shah at a Fairview Heights, Illinois address, which copy was also returned to the DEA, with a notation that Dr. Shah was not there. The Waterloo, Iowa copy of the Order to Show Cause was returned to the DEA by Emergency Practice Associates with a notation that Dr. Shah is not an employee there. The Allentown, Pennsylvania copy was returned with the notation that delivery was refused and it indicated a forwarding postal box address in Ahmedabad, India for Dr. Shah. Delivery of the Order to Show Cause was accepted at the Woodbury, New Jersey and St. Louis, Missouri addresses on September 27, and 29, 1993, respectively. Dr. Shah is no longer in practice or present at two of his registered locations. More than thirty days have passed since receipt of the Order to Show Cause and no response has been received from Dr. Shah or from any person purporting to represent him. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Acting Administrator finds that Dr. Shah has waived his opportunity for a hearing. The Acting Administrator has carefully considered the investigative file in this matter, and enters his final order under the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57. The Acting Administrator finds that in January 1989, the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation initiated an investigation of Dr. Shah based on a complaint that he was over-prescribing the controlled substances Didrex and Dilaudid. At the same time, Missouri Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs provided Illinois information that Dr. Shah had been regularly prescribing controlled substances such as Didrex, Dilaudid, Percodan, Halcion, Tylox, and Xanax to persons identified as ``professional patients''. The Acting Administrator finds that during the period October 1988 through August 1989, Dr. Shah prescribed controlled substances to eight patients not for a legitimate medical purpose and not in the usual course of professional practice. Also, on three occasions during the period October 20, 1989 through November 10, 1989, Dr. Shah prescribed the controlled substances Tylox and Percodan for use by a person other than the name indicated on the prescription. The Acting Administrator finds that in October 1989, and at other times during 1988 and 1989, Dr. Shah sold a fraudulent prescription for the controlled substance Dilaudid in exchange for $400.00 cash, and on November 29, 1989, he sold a prescription for the controlled substance Percodan in exchange for $40.00 cash. Also, on November 14, 1989, Dr. Shah proposed to a patient and her relatives that he would provide them two controlled substance prescriptions per month in exchange for signed Medicare forms and secretarial services. The Acting Administrator further finds that the United States Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, suspended Dr. Shah's clinical privileges based upon an allegation that he filed a false report in May 1990. Based on the above Air Force action, on March 17, 1993, the State of Illinois Department of Professional Regulation suspended Dr. Shah's license to practice medicine indefinitely. On March 26, 1993, Dr. Shah voluntarily surrendered his medical license to the Missouri Board of Registration for the Healing Arts and is foreclosed from reinstatement for a period of seven years. Accordingly, the Acting Administrator concludes that Dr. Shah is not authorized to administer, dispense, prescribe, or otherwise handle controlled substances under the laws of Illinois and Missouri, both States in which he is registered to practice with DEA. The Administrator may revoke or suspend a DEA Certificate of Registration under 21 U.S.C. 824(a), upon a finding that the registrant: (1) Has materially falsified any application filed pursuant to or required by this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter; (2) Has been convicted of a felony under this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter or any other law of the United States, or of any State relating to any substance defined in this subchapter as a controlled substance; (3) Has had his State license or registration suspended, revoked, or denied by competent State authority and is no longer authorized by State law to engage in the manufacturing, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances or has had the suspension, revocation, or denial of registration recommended by competent State authority; (4) Has committed such acts as would render his registration under section 823 of this title inconsistent with the public interest as determined under such section; (5) Has been excluded (or directed to be excluded) from participation in a program pursuant to Section 1320A&hyph;7(a) of Title 42. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``[i]n determining the public interest, the following factors will be considered: (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or disciplinary authority. (2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances. (3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances. (4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances. (5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.'' It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Administrator may properly rely on any one or a combination of factors, and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate. Henry J. Schwarz, Jr., M.D., Docket No. 88&hyph;42, 54 FR 16422 (1989). The Acting Administrator finds that the first, second, fourth, and fifth factors are relevant in this case. Here, the State licensing bodies of Illinois and Missouri have taken adverse action against Dr. Shah; Dr. Shah has improperly dispensed controlled substances without a legitimate medical purpose and outside the scope of usual professional practice; Dr. Shah has violated the Federal Controlled Substances Act and regulations pertaining to controlled substances; and Dr. Shah's propensity to sell controlled substances for cash or favors, and his improper conduct with the U.S. Air Force threaten the public health and safety. Furthermore, the Acting Administrator has no statutory authority to register practitioners if they are not licensed in the State in which they practice. DEA has consistently held that termination of a registrant's State authority to handle controlled substances requires that DEA revoke the registrant's DEA Certificate of Registration. Sam S. Misasi, D.O., 50 FR 11469 (1985); George P. Gotsis, M.D., 49 FR 33750 (1984); Henry Weitz, M.D., 46 FR 34858 (1981). Based on all of the foregoing, the Acting Administrator concludes that Dr. Shah's continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest and must be revoked. 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a). Accordingly, the Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders that DEA Certificates of Registration, AS2199328, AS2094756, BS3036185, and BS3067142, previously issued to Jayen C. Shah, M.D., be, and they hereby are, revoked, and that his pending application for registration, be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective on February 28, 1994. Dated: January 21, 1994. Stephen H. Greene, Acting Administrator of Drug Enforcement. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1814 Filed 1&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;09&hyph;M
