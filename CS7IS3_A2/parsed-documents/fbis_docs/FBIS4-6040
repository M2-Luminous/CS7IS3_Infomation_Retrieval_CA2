Reps. Kim Tong-kil of the United People's Party and Yi Chong-chan of the New Korea Party got together to bid farewell to Yi Ki-taek, chairman of the Democratic Party (DP), who is scheduled to visit the United States. It was at this get-together that the three opposition leaders agreed to form a working-level body to tackle problems related to formation of a unified opposition party. The agreement is described by many as "a step forward" from a similar pact reached last January, according to political analysts. Since an undercurrent for a unified opposition party has been flowing for sometime, discussions on the alliance are expected to pick up steam once the working-level body is set up, they said. The need for this grand alliance is being felt by opposition politicians as they look toward elections for heads of autonomous local governments, they added. Nevertheless, the prevailing opinion among independent observers is that the notion of rallying all opposition parties together under one flag is easier said than done since each party has its own built-in problems as well as differences in political colors and tendencies. The problems would become even more complicated if the opposition parties were to embrace all dissident groups, they said. The key to the proposed alliance is held by the DP and the United People's Party, whose positions differ considerably. The New Korea Party, which currently has only two lawmakers, poses few problems for a union, they said. Within the DP, the various factions have reportedly reached a consensus on a unified opposition party. Chairman Yi Ki-taek and leaders of the "non-mainstream" factions such as Reps. Kim Sang-hyon and Kim Won-ki are prepared to play active roles in carrying out the move. Despite their stated willingness to work for an opposition union, skeptics wonder what stance each faction leader would take when it came to nominating candidates for the local elections, for instance. The skeptics ask: Would they give up the interests of their factions willingly for the good of the whole? Another area that would pose quite a problem is inclusion of dissidents, analysts said. A merger of the three opposition parties would be much easier than a union of all "dissident personalities," some of whom espouse radical politics. In this connection, keen public attention was focused on the recent formation of "the new era plaza," a group that includes DP lawmakers like Yi Pu-yong, Che Chong-ku and Yim Chae- chong and such dissidents as Kim Kon-tae and Chang Ki-pyo. A majority of DP members are said to favor embracing dissidents in a proposed opposition alliance. But there could be many -- most of them unexpected -- problems as it would mean a union of establishment politicians with dissidents, the analysts said. As for the United People's Party, a merger with the other opposition parties would present a much more difficult problem. Party representative Kim Tong-kil has responded to the overture for an opposition alliance but Rep. Han Yong-su and others are advocating "a union in stages." In other words, they want their party to embrace small splinter parties and groups and independent lawmakers first before talking about an opposition alliance. Rep. Han Yong-su said, "We are not against a unified opposition party, but we believe we have to build our party up first by absorbing splinter groups." As these comments indicate, the proposed grand opposition alliance is still on the drawing board. It can enter the starting blocks only when all parties and groups arrive at a consensus on unity.
