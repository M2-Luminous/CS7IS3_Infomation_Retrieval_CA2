Diplomats said an EU [European Union] research ministerial council had called a meeting of a special conciliation committee created under the Maastricht Treaty to arbitrate differences between the council and the Euro-parliament. The parliament wants more money spent on research, but the diplomats quoted the French, German and British research ministers as saying there was no excuse for lavish spending in a time of economic recession. The council had originally budgeted ECU11 billion (12.4 billion dollars) for research spending between 1994 and 1998, and the Parliament had demanded ECU14 billion (15.8 billion dollars). Eventually the council settled on ECU12 billion plus a "reserve" of another billion -- 400 million dollars less than what the Parliament decided was its bottom line. The conciliation committee comprises 12 EU ministers and 12 Euro-MP's. It has 12 weeks to find a compromise. The budget aims at funding research mainly in information, communication, industrial and environmental technologies.
