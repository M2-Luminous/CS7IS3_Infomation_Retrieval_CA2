However, its members refused to register or to take part in the voting. Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy told the Duma that no measures against the "Podrobnosty" (Details) programme of the Russian TV, on which the faction insisted, were taken so far. "Therefore, the faction refuses to take part in the Duma's work until it shows who wields the power in the country," Zhirinovskiy said. Addressing Ivan Rybkin, who chaired the session, Zhirinovskiy stated: "Either you will show that there is a parliament in Russia or you will see that a part of it is already gone, that you have already lost it". Rybkin stressed, in turn, that the parliament would like to base its relations with the mass media on the existing laws. Recalling about the resolution of the Duma council, addressed to the leader of the Russian TV company Oleg Poptsov, he said that the State Duma had not received any official answer to the resolution. Rybkin said that the Duma legal department had contacted the court for informational disputes under the Russian president and its chairman Anatoliy Vengerov, who explained that the collision, caused by journalist Nikolay Svanidze's pronouncements, was within the competence of the court. Rybkin moved to settle it by legal means. He urged the Liberal-Democratic faction to take part in the work of the chamber even though the conflict with the mass media was not settled yet.
