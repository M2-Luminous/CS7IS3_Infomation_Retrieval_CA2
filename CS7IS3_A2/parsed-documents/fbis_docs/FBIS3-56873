Shakhray, the leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord parliamentary faction, also hinted at a press conference that Aleksandr Shokhin, a member of his party, was appointed economics minister to replace Yegor Gaydar who had resigned. "As far as I know the decree about this has not been signed yet, but this will, evidently, take place today", he said. Shakhray and Shokhin were both deputy premiers, but most evidently will lose the status in the new composition of the government. On Wednesday a government spokesman said that Oleg Soskovets will be the first deputy prime minister, while Aleksandr Zaveryukha, Yuriy Yarov and Anatoliy Chubais will be deputy premiers. There are to be two first deputy premiers and three deputy premiers in the new government, according to a presidential decision.
