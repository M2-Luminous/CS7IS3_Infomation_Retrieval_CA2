He reminds you of the kind of man that scorns his own life to mobilize others. The young men around him are bound to him by emotional ties, and seize with a great deal of admiration, awe, and unquestioning approval upon the words that flow from him. Many political forces see him as an intelligent and international figure, and a major variable on the Lebanese scene. He is `Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, a figure who raises many questions. We started our interview with him by talking politics, and quickly moved on to political thought, which is one perspective of the Arab Islamic movement. We tried to provoke him, to differentiate between tactics and strategy, between what is fixed and what is changeable. He concluded by saying that the originator of a thought cannot abandon his strategy. His point of view is respected, even though the history of philosophy and politics offers innumerable examples to the contrary. [Al-Jarushi] Don't you think the outcome of the Palestinian-Israeli talks, and the expected outcome of the multiparty talks, will mean the end of an era, and move the whole region into a new era necessitating a change in cultural and political discourse, as well as in methods of action? [Fadlallah] I imagine that in this region, as in any other region, there are two lines, the official line and the popular line. It is natural for action to occur at a distance from the Arab world so as not to affect the political situation seriously; thus we have this attempt to substitute the Middle East address. Official political discourse did not wait for the end of the negotiations to change. It started the process of change, with some differences in vocabulary. The current atmosphere is one of acceptance of Israel as a natural state in the region. We may read in some Arab rhetoric that Israel is the country whose friendship all or most people are seeking to obtain, and this rhetoric will change even more with the policy of the status quo. And yet popular discourse is still experiencing many complications in this regard. We do not see any Arab or Islamic circumstances that accept Israel's existence in terms of people's emotions, of any feeling of comfort or reassurance. I believe that popular Arab reality, in its inner Islamic vocabulary, still rejects peace with Israel. This is aside from methods of political pressure being applied to them in this regard. For this reason, I imagine that the coming phase will not have the capabilities enabling it to maintain the atmosphere of peace. We must watch the future; Israel, which is trying to penetrate the region economically, and the workings of security to focus its existence regionally, is at the same time trying to hamper economics and security with its anticipated intervention in inter-Arab disputes. Perhaps what Egyptian reports have revealed, about Israeli machinations behind some of the explosions, are a sign of what I mentioned. For Israel, from this aspect, has restored Arab rejection of the Jewish question and the Israeli reality from within Arab reality, instead of from outside it as used to be the case. I do not think the new phase will be a stable one at the popular level, and many names will disappear after the American-planned "peace" to renew the region in line with the new policy based on protecting Washington's interests and providing an atmosphere of what they call freedom here and there, which will bring convulsions here and there. Resistance and Options [Al-Jarushi] If we apply your argument to the situation in Lebanon, don't you think an Israeli-Syrian-Lebanese peace would result in the de-clawing of Hizballah and put an end to any military activity in the south? That would force everyone to fall into line. [Fadlallah] It is natural that the matter of peace--should it succeed--could create great complications for the resistance, but we do not think it will eliminate it. I think the resistance has other options, which we are not discussing. It would be obvious to say that Lebanon's political situation after peace will be different from what it is before peace. But Lebanon remains the land of freedom in the region. It is the country which I want to be, in the global balance, the lung through which the region's problems breathe, reducing its congestion, and for this reason it will retain the dissident political discourse which international spy agencies will explore to find the inclinations of the rejectionist movements. We always used to say that the intellectual and political freedoms in Lebanon were not for the benefit of the Lebanese themselves, but for the benefit of the international spy agencies that are in the pay of various proponents of the Arab and Islamic status quo on the Lebanese scene. [Al-Jarushi] Let's move on from politics to strategic thinking. The Islamic movement began as a cultural, civilizational undertaking, then turned into movements and parties working to establish an Islamic state, then slipped into defending closed parties and groups. Some of the action of these groups ended in violence and counter-violence. Don't you feel, for your part, that the the Islamic movement is experiencing a severe crisis? [Fadlallah] I don't want to address this topic with the expression "a severe crisis in the Islamic movement." I want to be objective in studying the reality of the Islamic movement, without all the exaggerations of politics and the media. The Islamic movement is basically, in the concept of Islamists, the belief that Islam is the foundation of philosophy, compassion, and life; that it represents a form of governance, and people may debate this proposition. We can say that Islam has lived as a question of governance for its entire history up until the 20th century. If we were to discuss the Abbasid, Umayyad, or Ottoman caliphates, the details of the nature of government would be discussed in exactly the same way as a democratic or a socialist government. What is certain is that Islam, from the prophetic era up until the fall of the Caliphate, never existed without a state. The state was, basically, the historical depth of Islam. The Islamists are not inventing something new when they bring up the idea of a state. The acceptance of party organization is the modern means for achieving a state from the political point of view, and in the framework of the democratic game, without regard to their view of democracy. Thus the thought is hardly an innovation to people. The question "Why a state?" is not asked of Islamists. We ask the others in charge of governance, "Why a state?" Why is there a Marxist party, or a nationalist party? Why shouldn't there be an acknowledged Islamic party? The Islamists are working towards integration with political reality; not all of them perhaps, but I know of more than one Islamic movement trying to open up to political reality. But there is a will to eliminate political Islam. We maintain that Islamic violence is a reaction to other violence. If freedom were given, no Muslim would so much as carry a stick to fight anyone else. So try democracy in the Arab world, and you will find the peace you seek. The Islamists are not leading a terrorist movement, but a defensive one. Whoever calls for regimes to enter into dialogue with the Islamists and others with an open mind and open heart will find only acceptance on the part of the Islamists. We are not comfortable with the shocks our Muslim lands are experiencing. It is in no one's interest, no one's but that of international spy agencies. All there is to it is that things have not been handled correctly; fix that, and you will see that reason will prevail. A Heap of Errors [Al-Jarushi] Don't you feel that in your rhetoric there is a whitewashing of the Islamic movements, as if they weren't experiencing fundamental problems? Take Algeria for example. The present regime wants to open a dialogue, but the Islamists are setting unfair conditions for accepting the principle of dialogue. [Fadlallah] I am not absolving the Islamic movement of errors. I am one of those who has gone on the record, in a loud voice, with more than one remark and question mark, in many places of the Islamic movement, including Lebanon and Iran. But I was speaking of the public line. I know there are some small movements that think violence shortens the whole movement to attain its goals. We do not think violence is the basis, but I allege that there is a blockade of the Islamic movement. You mentioned Algeria. I have no detailed information on the position of the new government, but we know the Islamists there embraced the democratic experiment and won, and there was no fraud. They question is, why were the elections nullified? Why was the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] banned? This means there is a will to nullify the will of the Algerian people, or, more precisely, a majority of it. As to dialogue, it is the right of the Islamists, who have been stabbed in the back more than once, to take action to protect themselves and to get the details about the nature of this dialogue--is it merely a formal token, or a serious dialogue? Will it create a problem in FIS's ranks? I do not have precise information about the nature of the offer they were made, or their reasons for turning it down, particularly because at the time the offer was made, the government's iron fist policy clearly grew more severe. I am not one of those who absolves the Islamic movement of errors. They are living in a heap of errors, but they are not the only ones making mistakes. We must study the circumstances of these errors. Are they voluntary, or the result of objective circumstances? For Dialogue in Algeria [Al-Jarushi] With the importance of the details, there is a general line that, yes, the elections were annulled in Algeria, and it is an unacceptable position, but is the response to that to spark a civil war, kidnap and kill foreigners, and assassinate intellectuals and journalists? [Fadlallah] Actually, I have reservations about much of the information provided these days. The official information is not unbiased. Nor do I imagine that it was the Islamists who started the violence. When the war machine went into action--and we have experienced the same thing in Lebanon--it went crazy. We absolutely cannot condone any group of intellectuals being confronted, even should we disagree with them, especially media people, artists, or whomever. But the question is that you, as an intellectual or media person or artist, might some way or another enter into this whirlpool unintentionally. We know that some names, such as Kasdi Merbah, and others, have come up, and there are other voices accusing the regime of assassinating them. That may not be an accurate judgement, but when you feel there is a plan to distort the enemy, you become more careful. We are for dialogue in Algeria, and in every other country, but it is only natural for any side to think about the basis upon which that dialogue would rest. It is your right to know how to enter the field, to ensure for yourself the solidity of the ground on which you are standing. [Al-Jarushi] Excuse me, with your keenness for objectivity, but I have begun to fear justifying rhetoric which could open dangerous dead-ends to youth. The issue of violence in Algeria goes beyond the limited individual problem. It has become a process destructive to Algerian society. [Fadlallah] We do sense that. I am not in a position to justify young men running off in that direction, but I have the occasion for objective study that attempts to judge one aspect, through the biased media. This is why I have raised questions, but not made judgements. I recommend the study of the Algeria problem, because it will not stay confined to Algeria. There are problems on the way for more than one country in the region. What is needed is to create a condition of convulsion that can foil many global ambitions. My understanding of the issue in Algeria, apart from the persons who are taking action there, leads me to believe that this country is experiencing a French-American struggle. What the Americans want is to eliminate French influence from Arab and non-Arab Africa. And so, if you want to get to the bottom of the problem in Algeria, don't think of FIS or Ait Ahmed or Ben Bella or Nahnah, or even the Algerian regime itself, think of global interests, and the American-French struggle on Algerian soil. This matter may not seem as clear as possible at the present time, but the near future will disclose the outcome of this process. I am speaking in the context of our experience in Lebanon, which is still taking its course as part of an American plan to expel the Palestinians politically, economically, and culturally. The terms of the Lebanon question are still in this area. The present plan is to create a state of madness in most of the countries of the Third World, so that the madness will act to destroy all values, and the people will lose their self-confidence. This was the case in Liberia and Zaire, and it happened in Lebanon, and now it is happening in Algeria. God help other countries. Algeria's problem is that it has oil, even if it is not that much; the thing is to extend their control over all the world's oil, so that America can prevent Europe and Japan from waging economic war on the American economy. Circumstances Are Responsible [Al-Jarushi] I want to go back to the issue of a state, because I see it as the major difficulty at this time. Now, after the Iranian experiment, which had great luster at the outset, then turned rather ordinary, then the Sudanese experiment, we are now experiencing the tragedy of Afghanistan. Don't you think the expression "the Islamic state," without a profound theory behind it, has become a virtual trap for Islamists? [Fadlallah] We must understand the facts, which are that when we think of an Islamic state, or a national or democratic state, that does not mean it will come into being with a magic wand. A firm infrastructure is needed. We note, for example, that Iran, when setting out to build an Islamic state, had to contend with a crazy war for eight years that damaged the whole economic infrastructure. The result was that Iran emerged from the war without any economic power, which made the state take action to rebuild instead of speaking of details of a media plan. I do not think Iran is unique in that regard. We know that democratic countries are unable to find a solution to the economic problem--does that mean democracy is a mistake, or that circumstances did not help the enterprise to succeed? Then we come to Sudan, whose experiment is still fragile, and is still undergoing an insane and destructive war it inherited from all the regimes that preceded it. Thus we do not consider the Iranian and Sudanese experiences to be the Islamic ideal, nor do we think the extent of their experiences represents the extent attainable by any country--even a non-Muslim country--by focusing their plans on their circumstances. Judging them would be wrong and unfair. I say there is no objective study of the Iranian experiment. In comparison, have other countries in the Arab world succeeded in economic development? [Al-Jarushi] They have not succeeded, and thus there has been a great deal of talk for years about the failure of the regional or national state. [Fadlallah] We are not saying that the state has failed, because there are domestic and foreign circumstances that have forbidden or prevented the achievement of their goals. The line has not failed, but circumstances have been an impediment. We live in a complex world, from the economic, political, and security standpoints--any movement, including democracy, has a hard time succeeding. Tactical Retreat [Al-Jarushi] The communists maintained their links to Moscow for more than 60 years, and they are looking for excuses for socialist experiments. They did not exert the effort necessary to criticize these experiments or work on their evolution until the structure collapsed and the whole thing came apart. [Fadlallah] We work daily to criticize the Islamic experiment, and loudly. Islamists are not like communists, because they have no cult of personality. Plus, I believe that the government the Soviet Union had was neither communist nor socialist. [Al-Jarushi] What are some of your criticisms of the Iranian experiment? [Fadlallah] I don't recall that many, but I have criticisms related to political lines, and I have debated some of the slogans they use domestically. [Al-Jarushi] If we take the political areas, we notice that the connection of the three experiments we have discussed previously to individual and collective freedoms, and basic human rights, stirs up many reservations and fears. [Fadlallah] I imagine human rights in Iran are more advanced than in most countries of the Arab world and the Third World (?!). When you criticize Iran now you must begin with its newspapers. Iranian newspapers now criticize all the power bases, and the Friday preachers, who are supported by the government, criticize the government in their sermons. There are freedoms, but there is no room for a communist party, because they consider it to be a party that contradicts the basis of the state. Even so, I say that there is political and media freedom not exercised by individuals in an absolute fashion. There might be defects, and the security agency may engage in--as it is in all countries of the world--some wrongful practices, but human rights are not as bad as the Western media say. [Al-Jarushi] Your call for a humanitarian state before an Islamic state--does it apply only to Lebanon? [Fadlallah] This is no abandonment of the Islamic state, but I said if it is not possible to establish an Islamic state in Lebanon--and I believe that in the foreseeable future there is no likelihood of establishing an Islamic state, because of sectarian and international complications--we must establish a humanitarian state for each of us to promote his ideas in a wide arena undivided by sectarian boundaries. This is not an abandonment of the idea; it is a movement to create an atmosphere in which ideas may flourish, without psychological and political complications. [Al-Jarushi] Is it a tactical or strategic retreat? [Fadlallah] It may be said that it is a tactical retreat. The originator of a thought cannot abandon his strategy.
