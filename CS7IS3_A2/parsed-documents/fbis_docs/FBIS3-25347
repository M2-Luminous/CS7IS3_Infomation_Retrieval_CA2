Nonetheless, last Thursday, UN Envoy Jacques Booh Booh had reached a consensus between all the parties concerned to proceed Monday with the establishment of these transitional institutions, even if the two wings of the Liberal Party [PL] could not agree on who would represent them within these institutions. Originally, the transitional institutions should have become operational on 31 December 1993. Empty Seats On Sunday, the former single party, the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND] did not turn up at the meeting planned by MINUAR (the UN Mission in Rwanda -- LA LIBRE BELGIQUE editor's note), nor was the Hutu branch of the PL, led by Justin Mugenzi, who has brought off a spectacular reconciliation with both President Habyarimana and the MRND in recent months. Consequently, the meeting had to be postponed and, as a result, the institutions could not be set up on Monday, as planned. "We do not understand this blockage," said MINUAR spokesman Gueye. Gueye added that the MRND "had nevertheless wanted to present a code of conduct for the parties at the meeting, stating that they undertake to vote in favor of a general amnesty, and ensure the neutrality of the administration" during the transitional period leading up to the elections scheduled to be held around 20 months from now.
