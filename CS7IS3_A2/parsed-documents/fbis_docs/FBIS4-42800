The foreign minister will then proceed to Istanbul where he will participate in the spring conference of NATO foreign ministers on 9-10 June. In a statement made shortly before leaving for Tehran, the foreign minister described these upcoming visits as very interesting. Concerning his visit to Iran, Mr. Papoulias stressed that it is in the mutual interest of both countries to maintain and develop their existing good relations. He added that Iran is a strategic area, a regional power with influence in the area and that Greek foreign policy is interested in this broader region. The foreign minister also noted that he will met with Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin on the sidelines of the NATO foreign ministers conference in Istanbul. Responding to a journalist's question on whether there has been any Turkish reaction to the Patriarchate's demand for greater security and what his comment is on this demand, the foreign minister said: The demand is certainly justified after the recent terrorist attacks against the Patriarchate. You know that the Greek Government has reacted strongly in all directions. We also protested to the European Union about this situation. I think this issue will be one of the main topics of discussion with Mr. Cetin. Mr. Papoulias concluded: We certainly have every reason to demand this reinforced safety of the Patriarchate.
