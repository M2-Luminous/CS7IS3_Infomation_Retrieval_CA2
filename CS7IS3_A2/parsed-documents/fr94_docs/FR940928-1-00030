FR940928-1-00030 FR940928-1-00011 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 638 [Docket No. 940973&hyph;4273; I.D. 082394A] RIN 0648&hyph;AF85 Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: NMFS issues this proposed rule to implement Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic (FMP). Amendment 2 would prohibit the taking of wild live rock in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off the southern Atlantic states (South Atlantic) from the North Carolina/Virginia boundary to the Dade/Broward County line in Florida and in the EEZ of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf), except off Florida north of Monroe County; phase out wild live rock harvests in the South Atlantic EEZ south of the Dade/Broward County line by 1996; phase out wild live rock harvests in the Gulf EEZ off Florida north of Monroe County by 1997; establish restrictions on live rock harvesting and possession and require permits and reporting during the phase-out periods; and allow and facilitate live rock aquaculture. In addition, NMFS proposes changes to the regulations to correct and conform them to current standards. DATES: Written comments must be received on or before November 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Requests for copies of Amendment 2, which includes a regulatory impact review (RIR)/initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) and a final supplemental environmental impact statement (FSEIS), should be sent to the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, 5401 W. Kennedy Boulevard, Suite 331, Tampa, FL 33609&hyph;2486, FAX 813&hyph;225&hyph;7015, or to the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council, Southpark Building, One Southpark Circle, Suite 306, Charleston, SC 29407&hyph;4699, FAX 803&hyph;769&hyph;4520. Comments on the proposed rule, Amendment 2, the RIR/IRFA, and the FSEIS must be sent to the Southeast Regional Office, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Drive N., St. Petersburg, FL 33702. Comments regarding the collection-of-information requirements contained in this proposed rule should be sent to Edward E. Burgess, Southeast Regional Office, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Drive N., St. Petersburg, FL 33702, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Washington, DC 20503 (Attention: NOAA Desk Officer). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Georgia Cranmore, 813&hyph;570&hyph;5305. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Gulf Council) and the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (South Atlantic Council) and is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR part 638 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Live rock consists of living marine organisms, or an assemblage thereof, attached to a hard substrate, including dead coral or rock (excluding individual mollusk shells). Live rock is collected by scuba divers and sold to the marine aquarium industry, which markets it as the basis for minireef aquaria. Live rock is a nonrenewable resource providing essential fishery habitat in the South Atlantic and Gulf. In the recent public review process during the development of Amendment 2, the Gulf and South Atlantic Councils received testimony concerning serious damage to reefs, ledges, and other hard bottom habitats from live rock harvesting activities. At the request of the Gulf Council, NMFS published an emergency interim rule on May 16, 1994 (59 FR 25344), effective May 16 through August 14, 1994, and extended the rule, with modifications, through November 12, 1994 (59 FR 42533, August 18, 1994). At the request of the South Atlantic Council, NMFS published an emergency interim rule on June 27, 1994 (59 FR 32938), effective through September 26, 1994, and extended the rule through December 25, 1994 (59 FR 47563, September 16, 1994). These rules were intended to slow the rate of harvest, prevent serious damage to habitat, and prevent geographical extension of harvest until permanent measures could be implemented through Amendment 2.
