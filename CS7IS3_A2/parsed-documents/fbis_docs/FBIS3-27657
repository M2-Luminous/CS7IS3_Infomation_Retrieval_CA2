He said that the publication fully shows that Britain has constantly not abided by its diplomatic accords, and that China certainly will respond accordingly. Zhang Junsheng made the above statement when interviewed at a spring reception given by the social work department of XINHUA's Hong Kong branch. Zhang Junsheng said: The Sino-British negotiations on Hong Kong's 1994-95 elections were conducted between representatives sent by the Chinese and British governments. Now the negotiations have broken down and Britain will publicize the contents of the negotiations. Although we are not against their publication, the contents of the negotiations should not be publicized until the two countries have held diplomatic consultations, because it was clearly stated beforehand that the contents of the negotiations are confidential. Without holding any diplomatic consultations, Britain has now taken a unilateral move to compile and publicize the so- called "white paper" in which it has said what it wanted to say for the purpose of deceiving the Hong Kong people and misleading public opinion. Is it not very clear that Britain has violated diplomatic norms? Is it not very clear that it has not abided by its diplomatic accords? Zhang Junsheng said: The so-called Sino-British disputes that have continued for more than a year are caused by Britain's failure to abide by the Sino-British Joint Declaration, by its own promise that the development of Hong Kong's political system must converge with the Basic Law, and by the memorandum of understanding and accords reached between China and Britain. Now it has unilaterally publicized the contents of the 17 rounds of negotiations. Is it not very clear that Britain has not abided by its diplomatic accords? Zhang Junsheng said: "We expected that China and Britain could cooperate very well on the issue of Hong Kong, but now Britain has seriously undermined the foundation of cooperation. Under such circumstances, Britain still acts as if nothing has happened. Is this not an act of deceiving others as well as itself?" Zhang Junsheng stressed time and again that Britain's unilateral move to publicize the contents of the negotiations is for the purpose of deceiving the Hong Kong people and misleading public opinion, and that China certainly will respond accordingly.
