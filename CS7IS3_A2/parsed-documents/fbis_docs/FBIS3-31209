The economic agents exporting a part of their production will be offered credit lines totalling some 40 billion lei with an interest rate of 70 percent. The preferential financing will further rise to several hundreds billion lei while a part of the costs would come to be supported by the Eximbank and the state budget so that the exporters will have to pay even lower interest rates, of 50 or even 40 percent, said the National Bank governor Mugur Isarescu. The preferential financing stimulates production, says the governor, including the export-oriented production, but the way to walk on would not be that of subsidizing the interest but of increasing the capital of the efficient economic agents. The reason is not hard to find out, reads the daily: Without a really positive interest rate it is practically impossible to stabilize the exchange rate but the economic agents do not even want to hear of an even more expensive credit as their working capital is very small therefore forcing them to borrow up to a gearing of 80 percent. When the situation will come to the contrary, hurdles will lay no more in the way of the trust in leu. Actually, the process has started already. Only the Bucharest branch of the Romanian Commercial Bank is buying from the population U.S. dollars at a daily average of some $100,000. In Ploiesti, 100 km north-east of Bucharest, people are selling dollars at the exchange houses and then cross the street where they buy with the fresh lei certificates of deposit issued by banks which are already yielding more than holding hard currency and anticipating its appreciation. Some days ago, in Bucharest, an exchange house sold dollars at an exchange rate of 1,460 lei that is below the inter-bank rate of 1480 lei, which is probably something that has never happened since 1989. The hunger for lei will surely become more compelling, the National Bank governor Mugur Isarescu says, as the National Bank "will no longer irrigate the economic field with the pail but with the dropper and only where it must."
