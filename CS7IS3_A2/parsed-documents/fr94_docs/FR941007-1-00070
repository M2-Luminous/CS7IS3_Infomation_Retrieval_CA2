FR941007-1-00070 FR941007-1-00009 Fourth, many commenters criticized the failure of the December proposal to require the collection of data on the race and gender of borrowers except to the extent such data was required by current law. These commenters were particularly interested in the reporting of race and gender data for small business loans in order to support the fair lending component of the CRA assessment. In response to these comments, the revised proposal would require institutions to collect certain race and gender data in connection with their small business and small farm lending. Each institution would be required to request, either in connection with a written application or, if the institution did not use written applications, at an appropriate point in the lending process, that an applicant or borrower indicate the percentage of the business or farm owned by men and by women as well as the percentages owned by members of different racial and ethnic categories. If the institution neither takes a written application nor originates the loan, the institution would not be required to request the information. To protect the privacy of individual borrowers, this detailed information would not be included on loan registers, which, as noted earlier in this preamble, would only indicate whether an individual loan was to a business or farm that was more than 50 percent women-owned or more than 50 percent minority-owned. The institution would also retain but not report or disclose the information on applicants who did not receive a loan. To further safeguard privacy, the loan registers would not be disclosed to the public but the institutions would include aggregate information about the loans in their public CRA files. Finally, some commenters were concerned that because community development loans were not required to be reported, examiners would not give them sufficient weight in evaluating an institution's lending performance. The revised proposal would require institutions to report on their Call Reports and TFRs the aggregate number and dollar amount of community development loans outstanding as of December 31 of each year. Public File and Disclosure The December proposal would have required institutions to make available for public inspection: (1) a file containing all the signed, written comments that it had received from the public for the past two years; (2) its performance data for that period; (3) maps of its service areas (with lists of the census tracts or block numbering areas that make up each service area); and (4) a copy of the public section of its most recent CRA Performance Evaluation. If an institution elected to be assessed under the strategic plan option, it would have been required to include a copy of its plan in the public file. The December proposal would have required the institution to maintain the public file at its main office and to make available copies of the file at cost to members of the public. Materials relating to a given service area would have been maintained at each branch in that service area, and every institution would have been required to post in the public lobby of each branch a notice of its CRA obligation and the public's opportunity to comment on and review data concerning that performance. Commenters generally favored the public disclosure of an institution's CRA-related activities, and the revised proposal retains all the relevant public disclosure provisions of the December proposal. The revised proposal modifies the required contents of the public file to reflect proposed changes in the various assessment tests and the proposed data collection requirements for small business and small farm loans. For example, consistent with the proposed service test, the revised proposal would require an institution to maintain a list of its branches and ATMs along with their locations and the services generally available at such facilities. To protect the privacy of borrowers and the competitive information of institutions, the revised proposal would not require an institution to include the small business or small farm loan registers containing information on individual applicants in its public file. Instead, the revised proposal would require the public disclosure of aggregated information on small business and small farm loans for the past two calendar years by every institution (other than a small institution). Loan registers would be available to agency examiners to confirm the accuracy of the aggregated data but the agencies do not intend to make unaggregated information publicly available.
