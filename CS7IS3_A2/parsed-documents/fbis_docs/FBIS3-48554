Sieng Kimhoun [spelling of name as received], director of the Ministry's Asia Bureau, also visited facilities being readied for October's Asian Games and said he hoped to return to Japan during the games. "I cannot find the words to adequately express how I feel with regard to the pain and misery suffered by Hiroshima," said Sieng. "We and the people of Hiroshima have a saying in common that this must never happen again," said Sieng, referring to the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima and the Pol Pot reign of terror in Cambodia during which an estimated two million people were killed and Sieng himself was forced to labor for four years. Visiting most of the sites for the October 2-16 Asian Games, Sieng said he hoped they would contribute to world peace. Cambodia plans to send its first delegation in 16 years to Asia's quadrennial multisport event.
