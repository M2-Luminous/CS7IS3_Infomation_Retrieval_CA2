N. Golyba, V. K. Zaruba, T. A. Oks, Energoproyekt Institute, Kharkov; UDC 662.66] [Abstract] Currently, Ukraine is meeting only 30% of its energy needs with its own resources. New coal deposits have been found in the Kharkov and Lugan regions (the Barvenkov and Bogdanov deposits, respectively). A single complex has been created for the extraction and processing of coal and production of electric energy all at one site. Preliminary research has shown that a 1600-1800 MW state regional electric power plant can be constructed at the Barvenkov deposit, and a 2700 MW plant can be built at the Bogdanov deposit. Technical documentation will be developed for these projects in 1993-1994. The configurations of the deposits are described. The industrial coal resource of the Barvenkov deposit is 403.8 milion tons. The Bogdanov deposit has balanced resources of 1068 million tons, with industrial resources of 860 million tons. Properties of the coal at each deposit are listed in a table. Table 1.
