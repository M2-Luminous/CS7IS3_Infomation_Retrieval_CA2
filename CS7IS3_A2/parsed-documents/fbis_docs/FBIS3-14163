FBIS3-14163 "drnes057dd_94006" FBIS-NES-94-057 Document Type:Daily Report 22 Mar 1994 Palestinian Affairs Al-Hasan Criticizes PLO Policy, UN Resolution JN2203132594 Amman AL-DUSTUR in Arabic 22 Mar 94 pp 22, 23 JN2203132594 Amman AL-DUSTUR Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Interview with Hani al-Hasan, Fatah Central Committee member, by Mufid 'Awwad; place and date not given] [Text] ['Awwad] To begin with, let us try to put the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in the context of the ongoing Arab-Israeli contacts. [Al-Hasan] In order for us to make sense of why it took three long weeks to pass the UN Security Council resolution on the massacre, we need first to ask why the massacre happened. It is believed by some that the massacre was committed by a murderous, psychopathic settler. The massacre was really the product of a debate inside the Israeli security services on how to handle Palestinian policemen in the impending self-rule authority. The recruits for the future Palestinian police force can be expected to be patriotic young men victimized by occupation. The Israeli security establishment goes on to argue that, driven by an urge to exact vengeance, many of these Palestinians may take it out on settlers. The Israeli security establishment also fears a mounting militant spirit among the Palestinians, buoyed by confidence that they are achieving success. There were two trends of thought within the Israeli military security community. The first was that If the Palestinians should break the Gaza-Jericho accord by attacks on settlers, they would reply with the proper means. The second trend, which, incidentally, has prevailed, argued that right from the beginning the security forces should create a climate of fear, warning the Palestinians of the dire consequences of any attacks they might mount on the settlers after April, 1994, especially since it was Fatah, in particular, that carried out most of the armed attacks inside the occupied territories, notably in the West Bank, since the signing of the Oslo agreement. Hence Israel's resort to direct and open terror, as seen in the bloody and savage Hebron massacre, to instill panic and fear among the Palestinian population. ['Awwad] So you think the massacre was perpetrated in implementation of a decision made at the highest Israeli security levels? [Al-Hasan] Absolutely. But what Israel did not bargain for was the scale of the Palestinian popular pressure inside Palestine and in brotherly Jordan. Israel was further surprised by the angry and strong Islamic, Arab, and even international reaction. Acting in character, the Israelis then set about an operation of damage control. The talks in Washington were held within the framework of a feverish Israeli effort and must be seen in this light. Rabin's visit to Washington was made to shore up his popularity. Tel Aviv, Tunis, and Washington all wanted to make the most of the massacre. It must be said that the Tunis leadership failed to use Israel's crime at the Ibrahimi Mosque to expose its true ambitions in the occupied land and push for the world to assume its humanitarian and moral responsibilities toward the Palestinian people. Now what do I mean by the Tunis leadership using the massacre? Let's not bury our heads in the sand. The Palestinian people are suffering from divisions while Israel is scoring major successes on the economic and international fronts. Any right-thinking person will tell you that the concessions made in Oslo and Cairo need not have been made -- not under any circumstances. Even President Mubarak's adviser Usamah al-Baz said that there was a need to restore balance to the Oslo agreement. Even the Europeans are now talking about the need to send international forces to protect the Palestinians, and this is quite important. Simply speaking, the world is interpreting UN Security Council Resolution 242 so as to mean Israel is sitting in occupied rather than disputed territory. The Palestinian leadership has no choice but to make what I would call a bold decision dictated by the national Palestinian conscience; namely admit that its political line is flawed. The split in Palestinian ranks and inter-Palestinian squabbling and Israel's gains are all the result of a mishandling of the negotiations. ['Awwad] Since Madrid? [Al-Hasan] Yes, since Madrid. ['Awwad] What do you mean by the political line? You were one of the Palestinian leaders that laid down the foundations of a political settlement for the Palestinian issue? [Al-Hasan] The Palestinians are being forced by Israel to negotiate with them unilaterally. This is the consequence of an Israeli argument that the Palestinians must enter into unilateral talks with Israel. Then there is the argument advanced by Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas]; namely, that if you are unable to get all that you want, you may settle for some of it. The result has been that Israel began talking about indispensable security settlements and dispensable political settlements. Israel thus capitalized on this argument by insisting that part of the occupied territories will not be vacated. ['Awwad] An example? [Al-Hasan] For example, agreeing in Oslo to delay the Jerusalem issue to the second phase of negotiations was dangerous. Israel says the Oslo agreement postpones the Jerusalem issue. I wonder what Jerusalem they are talking about. Israel is not talking about East Jerusalem, the small area it occupied along with Arab and Palestinian areas in 1967, or about West Jerusalem. It is talking about today's Jerusalem, according to the occupation authorities' concept of two cities with boundaries that have been extended close to Bethlehem in the south, Ramallah in the north, and Jericho in the east. When we begin to discuss the subject of assuming power in the West Bank after a few weeks, greater Jerusalem, with an area that is more than 10 percent of the West Bank, will be excluded from the areas that will come under Palestinian authority because Israel's interpretation of Jerusalem is different from that of the PLO. This should not be accepted at all. Accordingly, agreeing to the current phased negotiations, that is, a transitional and then a final stage, means agreeing to splitting territory. Anyone who partitions land will also partition rights. Therefore, under no circumstances should we accept phased negotiations, although we might accept phased implementation. In the letter of invitation to the Madrid [conference], the PLO accepted phased negotiations. This political line, which now prevails, is responsible for splitting the cause. We are now seeking security for Gaza and Jericho, but we are supposed to be seeking security for all Palestinians. The Palestine question is in a real impasse due to the phased negotiations. The PLO leadership should have benefited from the obvious international solidarity with the Palestinians -- people and organization -- after the Zionist massacre. This great national Palestinian support should have been employed to prove the indisputable fact that there can be no coexistence between settlers and Palestinians; it should have been used to immediately call for negotiations on the final solution as a new policy that will dictate new alliances and new coordination. ['Awwad] Why does Israel insist on phased negotiations? [Al-Hasan] Israel believes the PLO should not call for the implementation of Resolution 242 at the first stage of negotiations because, it says, the PLO is not a party to that resolution. ['Awwad] How can the Palestinians break out of this impasse? [Al-Hasan] The solution lies simply in coordinating with Jordan, which is a party to 242, and with Syria and Lebanon, for the sake of negotiating with one voice and one tactic and advancing or retreating together. The idea of one Arab delegation to negotiate all issues and deal with withdrawal as one issue, security as one issue, water as one issue, and mutual relations as one issue, can be proposed once again. ['Awwad] But Israel, whose policy is based on the tactic of dealing with Arab parties separately, will certainly reject the idea of a unified Arab delegation. [Al-Hasan] We can then run affairs according to one policy and one plan on all "tables." For example, Syria and Jordan emphasize that no economic normalization talks will be held with Israel unless there is progress in political negotiations and unless Israel promises to withdraw from every inch of the Arab territories occupied in 1967, whether they are Syrian, Lebanese, or Jordanian territories. ['Awwad] Why doesn't this apply to Palestinians? They used to say the Palestinian position is weak. [Al-Hasan] The helpless ones in the PLO said this. However, in the aftermath of the recent massacre, nobody can say the Palestinian situation or Palestinian awareness is weak. Therefore, receiving any Israeli delegation in Tunis before voting on the Security Council resolution was a big mistake. The wording of the Security Council resolution itself was very weak and wsa not in keeping with the horrible massacre. ['Awwad] As a prominent leader of the Fatah Movement and as a member of the Fatah Central Committee, do your political ideas on the peace process and your position on the Oslo accord reflect the views of the Fatah Central Committee or the views of a large number of the Fatah Central Committee members? [Al-Hasan] I speak as a Fatah Central Committee member. I cannot claim to be speaking on behalf of the Fatah Central Committee. Still, recently, more Fatah Central Committee members believe there must be a reconsideration of all that has happened, and all that is happening. The recent statements published in AL-DUSTUR reflected this trend. Brothers Muhammad Jihad and 'Abbas Zaki [Fatah Central Committee members], as well as many others, see a need to seriously reconsider all that is happening. As for me, I believe we must mobilize Palestinian popular forces with clear political positions so they can pressure the leadership and encourage it to take drastic measures to change the course of the negotiations. ['Awwad] When you mention the word leadership, what specifically do you mean? Do you mean the PLO Executive Committee, or the leading PLO institutions? When you mention the word leadership, what do you mean? If you mean the PLO Executive Committee, four members of this committee have resigned, not to mention those who tendered their resignations earlier, that is, in the immediate aftermath of the Oslo accord. It is true that the PLO has been experiencing a legislative impasse since the resignation of Palestine National Council Speaker Shaykh 'Abd-al-Hamid al-Sa'ih. But, can we say the PLO leadership is experiencing an executive impasse? If the answer is yes, what will happen, since the current phase requires concerted efforts by all in the context of a harmonious Palestinian leadership that is directly responsible for the destiny of its own people? [Al-Hasan] This question is extremely important and serious. It has been on my mind since you started this interview. What closes ranks and unifies efforts is a clear political line. By the same token, what divides is a mistaken political line. With regard to the Palestinians, they can simply judge the proposed solution as to whether it is sound or not, in light of the national consensus it enjoys. This is because nationalist political forces cannot disagree on national issues. Hence, we see the organizational impasse facing the PLO, the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. One-third of the PLO leadership, in terms of the political quorum reflecting the various political forces making up the PLO, has resigned. Only the Palestinian People's Party has continued to promote the PLO's current policy line. With regard to the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front and the Palestine Liberation Front, their votes reflect opposition to, not support for, the current policy line. This means the PLO Executive Committee is currently denied a political and a numerical quorum, particularly since three of its members have resigned. In case new resignations take place, the PLO will face a real impasse. ['Awwad] This concerns the PLO in general. What about the Fatah Movement? [Al-Hasan] With regard to the situation on the ground, there is a persistent, continuous, and serious Fatah demand that the course of negotiations be rectified, and the facts made available to the Palestinian people's masses. This is because the statements by some officials on the Gaza-Jericho accord were incorrect and untrue. They have not enlightened the Palestinian people about the facts. ['Awwad] Could you elaborate on this, please? [Al-Hasan] While commenting on the Gaza-Jericho accord, and the Oslo accord, Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh has said displaced people will return home immediately. Undoubtedly, 700,000 displaced people were overjoyed when they heard this. Nobody can blame them, because they then thought they would be returning home the next day. Now, it seems no more than 10,000 displaced people will be allowed to return over the next three years. It has been reported that the number may be increased to 20,000 or 30,000. All displaced persons must return together. This is common sense, and this is our conception of a proper solution. By not allowing the repatriation of displaced people, Israel wants to fragment rights and territories. When the issue of releasing Palestinian prisoners was discussed in Taba, the Israeli delegation rejected a PLO proposal to form a committee to discuss the issue, contending the provisions enshrined in the Oslo accord underscore security for Israel. Once Israel's security is ensured, then pertinent measures can be taken by Israel, Israeli negotiators argued. That is why the negotiators formed the security and confidence-building measures committee. Accordingly, the release of prisoners must promote Israeli security. As a matter of course, any level-headed person well-versed in conflict management would not have accepted any such ideas, the centerpiece of which is meant to promote Israeli security. This is because agreements should be balanced. Mutual interests must be promoted. Otherwise, there would have been no reason for engaging in negotiations in the first place. Given all this, the Palestinian people and the Fatah Movement are witnessing calls for reconsidering the course of the negotiations. However, international pressures on the PLO, the agency that makes decisions regarding the Palestine question, are immense. This, of course, does not exempt the Fatah Movement of its responsibilities, because it is the mainstay of the PLO. Hence, we would like to say that silence is no longer golden. We must make an effort to spare the Fatah Movement any further external international pressure. ['Awwad] In your opinion, there is some erosion in the PLO's stand on how to run the conflict. In this regard, there were two memorandums on how to launch reform, but the signatories to both memorandums were constrained in one way or another. So experience proves reform endeavors have not produced any remarkably positive results. The Palestinian street does not view many reformists as serious because until recently they supported and advocated the PLO's political line and political leadership. What suddenly made the reformists take their positions? How can a radical change be introduced into the current political line? [Al-Hasan] Anyone who studies the history of any political movement, including the PLO, will see that any history has its ups and downs. But, this is far from a collapse, which will indicate, if it takes place, a defect in the issue. Ups and downs, however, do not necessarily mean a defect, but may be the result of an upset in the balance of power. The difference between collapse, on one hand, and ups and downs, on the other, is that the people, in the second case, are always supportive. But collapse usually results in the disengagement of you and your popular base. This is scientifically true, not a matter of interpretation. When you propose a political line representing the aspirations of the masses, these masses will rally around you. Only then will you have a broad base. The members of the organization will grow in number and quality and there will be enough money. When you propose an incorrect political line that does not represent mass aspirations, the masses will abandon you, your organization will decompose, your revenues will decrease, your well-being and credibility will retreat before your people and the world, and you will collapse. The crisis is one of the political line. The refugee issue, as an expression, is no longer mentioned in the refugee committee. What is being discussed is the return of part of the displaced people, not the repatriation of refugees. The refugee issue was postponed until a final solution is found, while preparations are under way for self-rule to assume the responsibilities of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency on the eastern and western banks. This is why the current Palestinian political line does not represent the refugees' ambitions. Therefore, Palestinian circles in Syria, Lebanon, and the camps reacted negatively and violently against the agreement and even attacked the PLO leadership because the current political line does not represent them, and might sacrifice their interests. Therefore, I believe any talk about reform or democracy will produce no results unless a new political line is worked out that meets the aspirations of political and popular forces. Only then will circumstances for democratic action be available. ['Awwad] How can a new political line be worked out? What is the best mechanism for that? [Al-Hasan] As I said, the current political line has produced negative results. This cannot be denied except by arrogant people who claim Palestinians are making achievements and scoring victories on the road to the liberation of the land. Even after they enter Gaza and Jericho, there will be no guarantees that everything will take place quietly. The Israelis will not suddenly become peaceful. As I said, the recent brutal massacre is a studied security decision, which is being exploited by Israel to overwhelm Palestinian morale in preparation for the next stage of negotiations. Hence, strong political pressure should be placed on that leadership to prevent it from relinquishing any inch of land in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem, and relinquishing the refugees' rights by creating a new political line to run the conflict. ['Awwad] Since the establishment of the PLO and until the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the Palestinian masses have rallied around the PLO and its leadership, despite differences of views on the leadership's policy in running the conflict. It is noteworthy that as a result of the massacre, the masses called for toppling the PLO leadership for the first time in 30 years. Are the demonstrations that the Palestinian people staged after the massacre a spontaneous expression of the Palestinian masses' reluctance to support the PLO leadership and the beginning of popular abandonment of it? [Al-Hasan] The demonstrations in Jordan and inside and outside the occupied territories are undoubtedly an alarm to the leadership that its political line has become so weak that the masses will raise their voices and reject that line. We should not fall into the faults of the pan-Arab movement in the seventies, when they said that Arab unity did not take place because of the absence of popular awareness. Holding the masses responsible is shortsighted, and evidence of the leadership's weakness. The people always have the right strategic sense and they express their true interests. Our people believe the displaced will not return, that massacres against them will escalate, and that the Hebron massacre is the fiercest of all massacres, but will not necessarily be the last. They also believe that Israel will determine Palestinian entry into Jericho. This means sharing sovereignty, which is a step toward sharing the land. In other words, a part of the negotiations is based on the legitimacy of the occupation, and the wrong political line will, undoubtedly, serve the occupation and your enemy in the final analysis. ['Awwad] Abu-Tariq [Hani al-Hasan], this leads us to an open and angry question reiterated by the Palestinians: Are there no skilled Palestinians other than Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Jamil al-Tarifi, Nasr Yusuf, and the rest of the Palestinian delegation -- with all due respect to those people -- to confront Amnon Shahaq, Uri Savir, and others? How do you explain this? [Al-Hasan] Once again, I believe the problem lies in the political line, because it produces people who refuse to take part in any delegation because they are not convincing in this line or it produces people who agree to follow orders. When the political line is weak and a failure, many forces and skills withdraw because nobody can rectify the wrong political line. ['Awwad] So, the choices are being made on the basis of loyalty to the existing political line, not on the basis of who is capable of handling the conflict? [Al-Hasan] Yes. I was asked to supervise the multilateral talks. However, I set a condition of not holding the multilateral sessions between us and the Israelis in any Arab country. This means the rejection of normalization with Israel before realizing a political solution, that is, full Israeli withdrawal. I could have accepted the offer if the leadership had responded to this condition. ['Awwad] You mean no normalization before withdrawal? [Al-Hasan] Yes. This is in line with the other Arab parties' stands on this issue. I believe the PLO should abandon the multilateral talks, or at least not hold them in Arab countries such as Tunis, where the PLO headquarters is located. Indeed, holding the multilaterals in any Arab venue will be a big step toward normalization, but in return for what? Nothing. Israel so far has been recognized by India, China, and half the population of the world. It received billions of dollars in economic aid. It opened closed international markets to its exports. Israel's economy in 1990 suffered from a reduction in growth; the growth was minus 2. Today, however, and as a result of the huge aid it is receiving, Israel's economic growth is beginning and has reached plus one, and is on its way to become plus four. Israel received all this through the political settlement process, Meanwhile, none of the Arab parties gained an inch of their occupied territories and not a single Palestinian employee received a milligram of security. Why continue providing the Israelis with all the factors of benefiting from the peace process? ['Awwad] You said discussing the issue of Jerusalem at a later stage of negotiations shows the well-known Israeli intentions toward the city. How do you view the Jerusalem situation, since it is a sensitive situation that has been complicated in recent times? [Al-Hasan] Jerusalem is Palestinian territory to which Resolution 242 applies. The basic principle is that Palestinians should have sovereignty over this territory. Afterwards, all issues on the religious level can be discussed. As for now, we can only discuss the issues of Israeli withdrawal and returning the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 to the sovereignty of the Palestinians, including Jerusalem. We believe developments in the Jerusalem issue are a result of the wrong political line. The Vatican, for example, is beginning to talk about its responsibilities toward the Christian places. This is a big danger. However, when you adopt such incorrect behavior, the Vatican becomes free of its commitments toward what you, yourself, have been demanding and then abandoned or postponed to an unknown stage. When there was Palestinian and Arab Islamic insistence on a united stand toward Jerusalem, the Vatican, throughout the past 50 years, was committed to this stand. However, when it found that some Palestinians are willing to discuss the issue of Jerusalem from a perspective that is totally different than what is known, the door opened wide. The Vatican's interference is a very serious thing. However, we must admit that it is not the Vatican's fault. Indeed, the wrong political line is what opened the door. Moreover, President Clinton started saying that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. Vice President Al Gore also began to reiterate that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. It should be noted that Al Gore made new statements that were unprecedented by U.S. officials, in Clinton's era or in the era of those who preceded him. The basic issue that must be implemented and championed deals with the need to implement the political line. No one thinks entering Jericho is a good start. On the contrary, the Israelis have a well-studied plan for the stage following the Gaza-Jericho stage. This plan began with the Hebron massacre. In the next stage, Israel will seek to create many problems, massacres, and obstacles. I strongly believe there still exists a secret Israeli decision not to withdraw from the West Bank and to play around with political formulas to guarantee their stay in the West Bank. This is because their real policy aims at signing a military agreement with some authority, that will exist four or five years from now, in order to keep their Army as an allied Army and not as an occupying Army. However, this does not mean their plan will succeed because I have faith in the Palestinian people. I believe our people on both sides of the Jordan River can confront Israeli schemes. The biggest example of this is that the massacre did not weaken our people. Indeed, our 1948 Palestinians performed their full job in condemning the barbaric crime. However, this does not mean that our people's sacrifices should continues until time eternal. This is especially so since a successful political leadership is responsible for accomplishing its goals with minimum material and human losses. However, what is happening is that we are paying dearly as a result of our political line in terms of martyrs, money, and time, while the accomplishments, as we see, are not in keeping with this long struggle. ['Awwad] As a Palestinian official and a leading Fatah member, you and your comrades have well-known stands in defending independent Palestinian decision making. Based on this, how do you assess the Palestinian leadership's relations with the partners in the common Arab destiny? [Al-Hasan] Anyone who examines the current situation will simply realize there are Palestinian relations with Arab states, but there are no common policies between the PLO and the major Arab forces in the region. Of course, this is a serious disorder, considering that any political line derives its strength from the people's support and from its alliances with its partners and friends. If one of these two elements is missing, the political line will collapse. The current Palestinian political line is collapsing because it lacks popular support and common policies with the Arab states that are parties to the conflict. Therefore, in the first place, there must be joint Palestinian-Jordanian policies, then common Palestinian-Syrian-Lebanese policies, and common policies with the broader Arab arena, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Libya, and Egypt. This is because common policies can create a political balance between the Arabs and Israel. ['Awwad] But, how can you explain the current distinguished relations between the Palestinian leadership and the Egyptian leadership? [Al-Hasan] Egypt supports a phased settlement. But the brothers in Egypt have already restored their land, so they are no longer harmed by a phased settlement. I am sure that if Sinai was occupied, no Egyptian official would accept a phased settlement on behalf of the Palestinians. The proof is that President al-Sadat did not accept a phased settlement of Sinai. In a well-known press statement he said: No to phased negotiations, yes to phased implementation, and no to the relinquishment of any inch of Egyptian territory. Our difference with al-Sadat was because he said Sinai before Jerusalem--in other words, because he separated Jerusalem and Sinai. On the contrary, President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir said Jerusalem before Sinai and the Golan before Sinai. If there had been a common political line among the Arab peoples, we would have an important weapon in our hand, namely, summoning the Egyptian ambassador from Tel Aviv, and expelling the Israeli ambassador from Cairo. This would jeopardize the entire situation--the current situation in which Israel is making one gain after another as a result of Israel's dealing with each Arab side separately. ['Awwad] The Palestinian leadership is under pressure to go back to the negotiating table. There are attempts to beautify this return to the negotiating table through temptations that do not include the acceptance of the PLO's conditions to resume the talks. The question is how Hani al-Hasan sees the future stage in light of this Arab situation and the imbalance in favor of Israel? [Al-Hasan] I have written a lengthy study on the seriousness of accepting the Madrid paper. I still believe the situation in the Arab region has not been settled yet. This is because this entire region will witness many political earthquakes, especially after the international balance collapsed with the fall of the Soviet Union. A new balance is being built. Our region is the center of this new balance, because it is the center of energy and agricultural fields, which will produce unique agricultural stuffs in the future, taking into consideration the growing population of the world. A big conflict is raging in and around our region. This conflict is still hidden. The parties to this conflict are Europe, the United States, Russia, and Japan. The United States needs this region to be calm because it wants to control oil without any rivals in order to twist the arms of Germany and Japan and to obtain economic concessions from them. This is because the United States, which controlled more than 75 percent of the world's economy in 1948, now controls only 27 percent. The United States now spends a billion dollars every day--and I know what I am talking about--to pay its debts and interest. If the United States does not mend its trade balance, it will seek the help of the World Bank in the year 2007. So, the United States is trying to avoid this by controlling this region of the world. There is a conflict in the world on the balance required in the Arab region. Following the change in the situation in Iran, an agreement was reached to set up a Turkish-Iranian-Pakistani economic and political axis as a basic part of the regional balance of power. There is a decision to turn Israel into an economic and military force in order to maintain part of the balance in the region or to guarantee this balance. Former President Bush considered Egypt part of this balance, but President Clinton does not believe so. Therefore, these forces want to send us back to the Cold War days and not recognize a regional Arab force in this part of the world. During the Geneva meeting between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Clinton, al-Asad accomplished a great deal when he got the U.S. to decide that Syria will be part of the forthcoming regional structure. Therefore, we, the sons of the East and West Banks -- Jordanians and Palestinians -- must discuss the issue from this angle. Where do we stand in the forthcoming regional structure? The issue is not that of 2 km in Jericho and 2 km in Gaza. It is where we stand in the forthcoming regional structure. If Israel becomes a regional force and the Arabs do not become a regional force, we will return to 1948 and to Israel's military and economic belligerence. Israel -- which spends 33 percent of its annual budget to repay its debts and its interest, 16 percent for security, and 19 percent for the army -- is in dire need of security to maintain its role in the forthcoming balance. In other words, there will be no role for Jordan, Palestine, Syria, or Egypt. There will be no role for the Arabs. In accordance with the Oslo accord, the Palestinian-Israeli talks will resume two years after the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord. During these two years, an international agreement on the situation in the Arab region will be reached. Meanwhile, Israel is planning to keep the Palestinians and Jordanians outside the equation. Therefore, I believe the real battle is coming. I believe the problem of the Oslo accord is that it weakened the Palestinian position in terms of its regional role. The Oslo accord seeks swift economic prosperity to promote the economy of greater Israel. What is required now is to reach a Palestinian-Jordanian-Syrian-Lebanese concept to face the forthcoming stage. The PLO leadership will face darker political days if it does not immediately change its strategy, policy, and alliances. We cannot gamble on Israel's good intentions. Zionism has continued to exist because more than one-half of the Israelis announce this clearly, and still consider Hebron and the West Bank the land of their ancestors. In his Washington address to the AIPAC [American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee], Rabin called this land Judaea and Samaria. Therefore, I call on all national Palestinian forces and the political forces in Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon to develop a concept about our forthcoming regional role on the political, military, and economic levels to confront the coming plot aimed at weakening the Arabs and Muslims. The first task of Palestinian politics is to topple the economic section of the Oslo accord. This must be the headline of the coming stage because Israel wants to merge the $3-billion Palestinian economy with the $67-billion Israeli economy as a step toward absorbing the land and economy together. We must know that Jordan is forcibly linked with whatever takes place in the West Bank and that the Palestinians are forcibly linked with what takes place on the East Bank. Therefore, we must resist any call on the East Bank for Jordan to ignore what takes place in the West Bank as well as any call for merger with the Israeli economy and ignoring what takes place in the East Bank.
