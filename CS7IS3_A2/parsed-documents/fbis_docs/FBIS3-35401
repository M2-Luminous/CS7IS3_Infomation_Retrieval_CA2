The addition of conditions in such cases is called, generally in the West, deliberate moving of the goalposts. We have a better term for it: international blackmail. By this we mean that there are definite economc reasons behind the constant orchestration of new conditions against that Arab country. These reasons have roots in the world oil market glut. There are several oil producing countries which would give or do anything to keep Iraqi oil out of the international market for the simple reason that oil prices have dropped considerably in the past few years and are hovering now about $16 per barrel. Keeping Iraqi oil out of circulation would at least keep the already depressed prices where they are. The reintroduction of Iraqi petroleum products into the market stands to lower even further the current price ranges. The Arab oil producing countries alone saw their revenues drop from $180 billion in the early eighties to a mere $75 billion in 1993. And what applies to the Arab World applies also to other producers from various regions of the world. This is a colossal economic crisis, which would only be exacerbated by lifting the oil embargo on Baghdad. The Western industrial countries, which count on the revenues of the oil producing countries to grease their economies by selling them more and more aircraft, tanks and guns, have a stake in keeping the pockets of these countries full and ready enough in order to be able to perform exactly such a task. We would have thought there is a better way to stabilise the oil market than by continuing to punish the Iraqi people. Sooner or later, Iraqi oil will enter the market. It would be wiser and fairer if a global solution could be found for this problem based on sound economic considerations for both the exporters and importers of this basic commodity. The real issue now lies with OPEC countries themselves, which have not been able or willing to heed their own agreements. In the long run, a more equitable quota system could be applied that could satisfy the global economy in a balanced manner. Meanwhile, the persistent ostracisation of Iraq by the international community, even after it has gone more than 95 per cent of the way to meet its obligations, makes little sense besides being totally unfair and unjust. Gradual easing of the sanctions against Baghdad commensurate with the extent of its fulfilment of its international obligations must become the mainstay of the new policy towards it instead of the current arbitrary and unethical direction being followed now.
