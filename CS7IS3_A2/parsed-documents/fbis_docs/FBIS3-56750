Strong Economic Managers Getting Their Way in Council of Ministers"] [Text] Yegor Gaydar did the last thing he could for President Yeltsin: He announced his resignation when Bill Clinton's plane was approaching the United States. Whereas for Boris Fedorov, Gaydar's economic policy and parliamentary bloc comrade-in-arms, his decision came as a "total surprise," Viktor Chernomyrdin, according to his secretary, had been ready -- meaning that the prime minister had well realized where his actions were leading. As of November, Gaydar had been virtually barred from making decisions on the republic's budget on instructions of the head of the government. On 10 November, Viktor Chernomyrdin issued personal instructions transferring export quota responsibility to Oleg Soskovets; he himself completely took over the sharing out of centralized credits. All these were indications that the Council of Ministers was going back to the Soviet style of work. As early as the end of last year, several decisions were made which were clearly not backed by the budget's resources: subsidies for a number of economic sectors, and the indexation of minimum wages and pensions by 1.9 times. To the rejoicing of officials in the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, the sphere of export licensing has been widened; meanwhile, the dragging of Tajikistan and Belarus into the ruble zone spells a serious threat of price hikes in Russia. Thus, even the presence of Gaydar and Fedorov did not prove a serious constraint for the prime minister lately: He has achieved control of the cabinet of which he is in charge. An attempt to do the same on the scale of the Russian economy is seen as less than productive. Even assuming that Fedorov stays "on the promise" to fight inflation by all means, his good intentions would soon be swept away by the wave of demands from the agro-industrial lobby, while he would become a decorative symbol of reforms. The finance minister cannot but realize that, hence he would hardly agree to the role of scapegoat. Without him the government's Credit Commission, which in one way or another somehow filtered the thousands of requests for centralized credits from regions, sectors, and enterprises, would soon die. Viktor Chernomyrdin cannot be thought as totally ignoring the danger of inflation. Ukraine's example has long been for him a warning sign. And he would not have dared to oust monetarists from the government without having some idea, or program, in his name. He has such a program today, and he is quite enthusiastic about it. This is the concept of selective support for key enterprises of the national economy. Elaborated by Professor Yasin, it would not have drawn any objections from Gaydar, Chubays, or Fedorov had it contained reliable mechanisms to implement it. They are extremely weak at the moment. As a result of selective financing for the "points of growth," the thread of inflation will be stripped. It is good in a sense that "strong economic managers," "pragmatists," will work in Viktor Chernomyrdin's cabinet of ministers in an undiluted form. The purity of the experiment, as they say, is guaranteed. One unpleasant thing is, they are going to experiment with a living country. It is historically clear what hyperinflation ends in for a country. The more so because the old-new communists and the president's "best friend" who once a month "plays chess with him" are already vibrating with impatience.
