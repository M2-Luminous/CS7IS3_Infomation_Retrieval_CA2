Since recently, after the transformation by opposition organizations of protest rallies against the sentencing of the so-called "Ilascu group" by unconstitutional Tiraspol judicial organs into an antipresidential campaign, during which accusations of betrayal and duplicity were made against the president, and since these accusations, which have been rejected by the head of state as absurd and unfounded, have not stopped, the official representative of the republic president is authorized to declare the following: 1. The president of the Republic of Moldova refutes the claim that "he did not make public the conflict in the eastern rayons," as was told to BASA Press Agency by one of the members of the Intelligentsia Congress, for the simple reason that it was he who invited the CSCE mission to acquaint itself with the situation and the real assistance to eliminate disagreements in the eastern rayons. In this regard, the decision of the ministers of foreign affairs of the country members of the CSCE in Rome was published, through which the mission will continue its activity in this direction. Moreover, Mircea Snegur has repeatedly come out for a revival of the quadrilateral mechanism for resolving problems of the eastern rayons--a question that was also discussed during meetings with Leonid Kravchuk. 2. Also inappropriate is the statement of the weekly LITERATURA SHI ARTA special correspondent that Mircea Snegur, "the one who chooses and leads," is to blame for the "economic catastrophe." We all know under what conditions the ministers were proposed and elected by parliament, and how many commitments, including behind the scenes, certain parliamentary factions assumed for themselves for the appointment of several ministers. It was this kind of a state of affairs that determined the president's decision to support the initiative on the dissolution of parliament and the election to a new parliament of one party or a coalition capable of running the country. 3. With respect to the bloody conflict on the Dniester and the real culprits in its unleashing, in the near future the president of the republic intends to come out with a statement in reply to the irresponsible accusations of those who are transforming patriotism into a profession. 4. Dumitru Postovan, the procurator of the republic, denied in the press the claim that the president of the Republic of Moldova is involved "in dirty deals" with a SEABECO affiliate. According to statements like "the procuracy...establishes, but it does not have the courage to go farther, so as not to alarm 'Daddy'" ("Memory Exercise" ["Ekzerchitsiy de memoriye"], Ion Katsaveyka. LITERATURA SHI ARTA, 23 December 1993). The Procuracy should speak out. It should be noted that it was at the initiative of the president that a report was published on infractions committed by some leading persons, about whom an investigation has been started and whose results will also be published in the press. Resolutely determined to conduct reforms, President Mircea Snegur encourages and promotes with all means a dialogue of the workers of ministries with representatives of the IMF and the World Bank. He is attending to the development of a program for the social protection of the masses, understanding that certain forces are interested in arousing tensions, in this way pursuing specific aims. The head of state is confident that the organizations participating in the current election campaign will dot their "i's" and that the people will make their choice.
