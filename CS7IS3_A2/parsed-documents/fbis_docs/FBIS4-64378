He told MPs during question time there was a strong case for identity cards despite practical difficulties, and said they were being considered. The Government has previously always concluded that the practical difficulties and cost of issuing accurate and up-to-date identity cards made it impractical, though they are popular with the otherwise libertarian right as a means of tracking criminals and preventing social security fraud. Any attempt to introduce identity cards would cause political controversy and opposition on civil liberties grounds. The issue was raised by the right-wing backbench MP Nicholas Budgen (Wolverhampton SW) in the wake of police swoops on 60 alleged illegal immigrants from Africa working for Labour-controlled Southwark council. Mr Major said: "I think there is a strong case to be made for identity cards. There are undoubtedly great practical difficulties in introducing them, and there are other matters to be considered as well, but we have been looking at the options in this respect and we propose to go on doing so."
