A SUNDAY TIMES investigation has found they were fined more often than any other firms last year, with 39 convictions for pollution offences. Government ecologists have warned that contaminated waterways pose a growing threat to aquatic plants and animals. Yorkshire Water performed worst. Its 12 convictions in 1993 included two for allowing raw sewage to cascade across a beach crowded with holidaymakers near Whitby, for which it was fined £75,000. Last year Sir Gordon Jones, the chairman, promised that the company would "undertake whatever investment is required by legislation in environmental improvements." Last Monday, two 75-year-old pipes burst at its Bradford sewage works, pouring 30m gallons of effluent into the river Aire. The second longest criminal record belongs to North West Water. Sir Desmond Pitcher, its chairman, said that its expertise in tackling environmental problems in the region was "evident in the contracts we are winning around the world." The company had seven convictions in 1993, including one for allowing a tide of raw sewage more than 1ft deep to flood a hotel in Greater Manchester. Severn Trent, with six convictions, and Thames, with five, have also climbed into the top four in a league table of polluters. They overtook British Coal, ICI and Rechem, the waste disposal company. All were prosecuted repeatedly in previous years but improved their performance. Water companies, which have almost doubled charges in five years and made a combined profit of more than £1.5 billion in 1992-93, admit to operating nearly 200 sewage works illegally. They say it will be another three years before the problem -- first highlighted by THE SUNDAY TIMES "Water Rats" campaign in 1989 -- is brought under control. The National Rivers Authority (NRA), which monitors the waterways, said it had detected a substantial increase in reports of pollution incidents relating to sewage and the water industry. The number rose from 4,578 in 1988, the year before privatisation, to 6,420 in 1992. Fewer than one incident in every 100 results in a prosecution by the NRA, according to a study compiled by Friends of the Earth. Liana Stupples, the group's water specialist, said government promises of a big clean-up of rivers had been broken. "Instead, customers face escalating water bills while some of our finest rivers are devastated by sub-standard sewage treatment," she said. One of the most severely affected rivers is the Roch in Greater Manchester, contaminated by Rochdale sewage works, which has breached legal limits on pollution six times since last summer in spite of a £6m improvement programme. The failures have angered local inhabitants, who remember kingfishers swooping on fish that were plentiful in the river until pollution drove them away. Last week some said they could not bear to eat meals in rooms overlooking the river because of the smell. "If a stranger comes to the door in summer, you're embarrassed. You see them sniffing and wondering what it is," said Michael Greene, 56, a plasterer whose garden backs on to the sewage plant. Elsewhere, dozens of smaller rivers have had their wildlife tainted by sewage. Among them is the Kennet, one of England's most beautiful waterways, where discharges have been blamed for encouraging the growth of choking weeks at the expense of spectacular species such as water crowfoot. Malborough sewage works, beside the Kennet, is one of 35 identified by English Nature, the government wildlife agency, as needing relatively small improvements totalling £10m to protect the rivers of greatest scientific value. Thames Water, however, has so far refused to do the work, claiming it would make no significant difference. The worsening pollution of some of Britain's most attractive waterways has also dismayed leisure groups. Ramblers have protested about finding condoms and sanitary towels on the banks, wile anglers, fed up with finding rivers choked with stinking mats of sewage fungus, are resorting to legal action. Four companies, including Yorkshire, are being sued by the Anglers' Co-operative Association, a pressure group, after allegedly failing to clear up discharges that left fishing nets coated in slime. Rowers have protested, too. On the Aire, Bradford Amateur Rowing Club has stopped its tradition of throwing a first-time winner into the water on health grounds. Sir Gordon Jones, the Yorkshire Water chairman, played down the significance of the pollution. "We're talking about a problem, of course, but not a major problem," he said. All but 12 of the company's 620 sewage works now operated within the law, he added. The Water Services Association, which represents the privatised companies, said the proportion of its 4,000 sewage works failing to comply with legal requirements had fallen substantially from 13 percent at privatisation. It was estimated at 7 percent by the NRA last June. According to the industry, the huge cost of complying with European Community rules on beaches and urban waste means improvements to the sewerage system cannot be carried out any faster.
