In its declaration, the OeVP "invites all people, irrespective of party affiliation, to support this future course for Austria." Under the leadership of Foreign Minister Alois Mock an "excellent result" was achieved in the negotiations, "which has made possible our support for EU entry." The OeVP describes itself as a "guarantor that there will be no tax increases in connection with EU accession." For the OeVP, the EU referendum is the "most important national issue of the outgoing 20th century. This is why we will do everything we can to keep the referendum on EU accession out of the debate on daily and party politics. We are particularly anxious to see -- if possible -- all citizens participate in this vote, regardless of their convictions." In the statement, the OeVP also describes itself as the "driving force and guarantor" for accompanying national measures in preparation for EU membership. Thus, it has been ensured that accession will not take place to the discomfort or the disadvantage of a weaker social group. In terms of the national economy, EU membership will have positive effects for Austrian employees, for industry, and for farmers. It is the OeVP's goal to secure the achievements of farmers on a permanent basis and to make it possible for farmers to prosper. The national accompanying measures guarantee that Austrian farmers will get adequate financial compensation and will thus be able to cope with the EU entry. The necessary structural reforms in the farming sector can thus be accomplished. A set of measures has been devised for the protection of Austria as an economic and industrial center. To ease the transit traffic burden, additional railroad capacity on the Austrian part of the Munich-Verona route has been promised. This will make it necessary to build a new underground railroad track through the lower Inn Valley. This track can make a decisive contribution to relieving the population along the Tirolean transit routes of some of the burden. Regarding employees, the OeVP Federal Executive Committee points to a new employment protection law. It contains improvements in the spheres of occupational health and safety equipment. Austrian accesion to the EU will also stimulate the labor market. The Wifo Economic Research Institute has predicted an increase of 55,000 jobs between 1995 and 2000. Some 7.5 billion schillings would be provided from the European Union's social fund for fighting unemployment until the end of 1999. For the OeVP, EU membership is "our country's most important step in terms of security policy, comparable in its significance only to the conclusion of the State Treaty." As the eastern-most part of stable Europe, Austria lies in immediate proximity to the conflict zones in the Balkans and the CIS republics. It is for this reason alone that Austria must try to seek security in an alliance. It is important to have partners "who stand firmly behind us even when only the first signs of a crisis are showing."
