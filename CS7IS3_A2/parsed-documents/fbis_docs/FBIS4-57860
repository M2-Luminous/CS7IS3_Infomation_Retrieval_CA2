Although the information has not yet been confirmed, the precise details that have been supplied do not allow for many doubts. For months in Santa Cruz, the Conjunto Antares drug traffickers' boss has dressed his men in Army uniforms! Two members of the gang led by the trafficker, who "works" under the curious alias of Soldier, were arrested by the Drug Control Precinct (DRE), and revealed that the uniforms are obtained from recruits serving in Western Zone barracks. Soldier does not buy them; he barters them for drugs. The recruits are not only addicts. According to a former drug spot manager -- an important post in the drug trafficking hierarchy -- they receive "a larger amount of drugs" for each stolen uniform in order to open a market in a privileged sector: the barracks! This information is serious, but not because it deals with a bold attack against the Army. After all, how long have newspapers been reporting successive arms robberies from Army barracks? This has happened not only in Rio de Janeiro and -- to tell the truth -- not only in the Army, because the Navy and the Air Force have also been victims of that crime. It would be enough to know the caliber of the arms that the police have seized from drug traffickers' arsenals to identify the link between the broad availability of heavy weapons, which are for military use only, and drug trafficking. The problem consists in the new step forward: the possession of uniforms. The fact that drug traffickers steal uniforms used by Brazilians who are serving in the national Army has obvious significance. It is, as such, so serious that no additional observation is necessary. Aside from the worrisome implications of traffickers dressed in uniform, what is the objective of bartering military uniforms for drugs? To have an "assortment" that can open any door? Or, in the next fight with the PM [Military Police] or the Civil Police, make traffickers appear as Army members, creating an institutional crisis? Those who hurriedly proclaim that "the Army on the streets" is the only solution for the state of calamity in Rio de Janeiro should reflect a bit on why traffickers want military uniforms. The Conjunto Antares soldiers have confirmed the possibility for drug trafficking to enter the barracks. This is why it is necessary to pay attention to one fact: The longer the Army remains in direct contact -- through repression -- with the world of drugs, the longer Army soldiers -- the true soldiers -- will be exposed to a dangerous coexistence. Those who always imagine that the worst will happen should carefully reflect on the robbery of uniforms. The vulnerability of the forces of law might be at stake. That is why it is important to find out, as soon as possible, the reason why drug trafficking has chosen this target. Those who imagine that the price of cocaine is the main antidote against troop contamination should recall the September poll results by the Rio de Janeiro State Drug Control Council. According to this poll, 28 percent of the addicts who tried to obtain some help to end their addiction earn a minimum salary, while 56 percent of cocaine consumers live in the northern Rio de Janeiro zone! The poll's conclusion deserves attention: Drugs have reached sectors that do not have enough money to buy meat. Drug traffickers have an organization that observes methods and adopts efficiency techniques. In July in the Tijuca forest, Drug Control Precinct agents clashed with drug traffickers in a battle in which the latter used authentic guerrilla warfare methods. In the Roquete Pinto ghetto, the troops that protected the area after shots were fired on a recruit of the Ramos 1st Infantry Battalion found a surprising copy of their methods. For the time being, stolen uniforms are only a "passport" to a concentrated, well located market. They hint, however, at another type of use that is hard to identify by using common sense. Yet common sense advises that if the worst is to be avoided, the Army should keep away from drug trafficking.
