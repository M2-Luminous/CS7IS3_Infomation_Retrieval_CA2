FBIS3-39808 "drweu036aa_94006" FBIS-WEU-94-094 Document Type:Daily Report 23 February 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS India Rejects Charge as `Baseless' BK1802100594 Delhi All India Radio Network in English 0830 GMT 18 Feb 94 BK1802100594 Delhi All India Radio Network Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] India has urged the United Nations Human Rights Commission to avoid mutual recrimination and bring about an environment of trust and understanding. Speaking at the 50th session of the Commission in Geneva, the leader of the Indian delegation, Mr. Atal Behari Vajapayee, said the promotion and protection of human rights cannot be ensured through mutual recrimination, and far less through violence and terrorism. He said this was not the time for faultfinding in the name of fact-finding, and the issue of human rights must not be used for sectarian ends. Mr. Vajpayee assured the delegates that India has always worked in a spirit of openness and transparency. The efforts of the government is to create greater transparency regarding the actual situation of Jammu and Kashmir. Mr. Vajpayee said that setting up of an independent Human Rights Commission by India is an indication of the government's resolve to protect these rights. Earlier, exercising the right to reply to Pakistan's allegations of human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir, India asked the international community to declare Pakistan as a state sponsoring terrorism for its support to militants in Jammu and Kashmir. Miss Neelam Sabarwarl, who exercised the right to reply, rejected as baseless Islamabad's charges of human rights violations. She said Pakistan's sole objective is territorial expansion through violence and deception. The Indian delegates told the Commission that Jammu and Kashmir, like the rest of India, is a multireligious, multiethnic society in which Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Christians have lived in harmony until Pakistan introduced religion-based separatism through its policy of sponsoring terrorism. During Nawaz Sharif's reign as Pakistani premier, the U.S. had placed Pakistan on its watchlist of states sponsoring terrorism, she added. The Indian delegation also drew the attention of the Human Rights Commission to Pakistan's dismal record on human rights. Miss Sabarwal said Pakistan has introduced a system in which its citizens are identified on the basis of their religion. She said this is nothing but religious apartheid at its worst. Speaking before the Commission, an alternate leader of the Indian delegation, Ms. Justice Sujata Manohar, said that religious intolerance and extremism and use of religion-based terrorism for extraterritorial ambitions are the real threats to the enjoyment of human rights. She pointed out that the systematic religious extremism has led to the exodus of about 2 and one-half lakh [250,000] non-Muslims and as many as 50,000 Muslims from the valley. An organization of the Kashmiri pundits [Hindu sect] told the Commission that the genocide and the cleansing of the minority community in the valley by Pakistani-sponsored terrorism has forced the exodus from their homeland. Presenting their case before the Commission, they said that the pundits are living the life of exile as their rights to live with dignity and honor in their homeland have been snatched away by terrorists.
