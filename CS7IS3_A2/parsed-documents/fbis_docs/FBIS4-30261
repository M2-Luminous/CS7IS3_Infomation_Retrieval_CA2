According to government officials concerned, the government will propose to the North side that the summit talks be realized in Seoul on around 10 July. This is based on the judgment that it is good for the South-North summit talks to be realized right before or after 8 July--the date when the North-U.S. talks are expected to be held--because the two kinds of talks should go in tandem with each other. The government is going to propose Seoul as the venue with the expectations that if President Kim Il-song has the opportunity to have the firsthand look at, and feel from, the South Korean society, the atmosphere for the summit talks will change. Meanwhile, the government is planning to have all things--which the South and North can raise--included in the agenda items. At the same time, the government will give priority to those loose items on which the South and North can easily reach an agreement so that the atmosphere for the talks may not become rigid. Saying this regarding the agenda for the summit talks, one government official concerned said that such items will be reflecting the spirit and substance of the South-North Basic Agreement. He said on 24 June: "The government needs a loose agenda even for a joint statement to be released by the South and North right after the summit talks. The agenda items for the summit talks can smoothly be simplified in the process of keynote speeches by the head delegates to the preliminary contacts and of follow-up negotiations." In his keynote speech, Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister for national unification affairs, is going to clarify our position on the South-North joint declaration of denuclearization; the implementation of the South-North Basic Agreement; dispersed families; and economic cooperation between the South and North.
