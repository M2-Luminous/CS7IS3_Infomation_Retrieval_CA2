FR940223-0-00027 FR940223-0-00015 Public Comments We published the proposed rules with a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register on October 28, 1991 (56 FR 55477). Interested persons and organizations were given 60 days to comment. The comment period closed on December 27, 1991. We received comments from six commenters: Two State agencies which make disability determinations, and three legal services organizations and one private attorney who represent claimants and beneficiaries. One commenter supported the proposed rules without modification. This commenter agreed with our view that the proposed rules clarified our longstanding policy regarding our authority to reopen a final determination or decision on our own initiative. The other commenters either opposed the proposed changes to the regulations or conditioned their support for the proposed rules upon our making additional changes to our regulations. Most of these commenters generally perceived the proposed rules to be a policy change that would confer upon SSA a new or expanded authority to reopen and revise determinations or decisions on its own initiative. Many of the comments which were provided by these commenters also reflected a misunderstanding of the requirements and procedures for reopening a determination or decision. Some of these commenters recommended that the proposed rules be modified or withdrawn. Some recommended that they be expanded to clarify or further limit the specific conditions, which are stated elsewhere in our regulations, under which a final determination or decision may be reopened. We considered carefully all of the comments which we received on the proposed rules. However, for the reasons stated below, we did not adopt the recommendation to withdraw the proposed rules or any of the recommendations to modify or expand the changes to the regulations. The changes to the regulations do not represent a substantive change in policy. The sole purpose of the changes is to clarify in the regulations our longstanding policy that we may reopen and revise a final determination or decision on our own initiative as well as upon the request of a party to the determination or decision. Accordingly, the final rules are the same as the proposed rules. A summary of the comments that raised issues concerning the proposed rules and our responses to the comments are provided below. For ease of comprehension, we have consolidated the comments and organized them according to the general issues raised in the comments. Comment : Three commenters thought that the proposed rules would be inconsistent with a decision of a circuit court which had concluded that our regulations should be interpreted to allow the Appeals Council to reopen a final decision of an administrative law judge (ALJ) only on the basis of a request by a claimant or beneficiary. One commenter stated that the proposed rules would circumvent judicial decisions, but did not mention any specific court decisions. Response : As discussed earlier in this preamble and in the preamble to the NPRM, the regulations which we are revising, §§404.987 and 416.1487, were a part of the regulations that were published on August 5, 1980, which reorganized and restated in simpler language all of our rules on the administrative review process. Although no substantive changes were intended with regard to our authority to reopen final determinations or decisions on our own initiative, this authority was not stated as clearly in the recodified rules as it had been in the longer, more detailed prior rules. As a result, several lawsuits were brought challenging our authority under the recodified regulations to continue our longstanding policy to reopen and revise final determinations or decisions on our own initiative. All but one of the circuit courts that have directly addressed this issue have concluded, however, that our regulations on reopening do provide authority for us to reopen and revise final determinations or decisions on our own initiative, including authority for the Appeals Council to reopen and revise a final decision of an ALJ on its own initiative. Only the circuit court mentioned by the three commenters above and some Federal district courts have concluded that our existing regulations should be interpreted to allow the reopening and revision of a final determination or decision only when a claimant or beneficiary requests reopening. These final rules revise the regulations to eliminate the ambiguity which led these courts to interpret the regulations to mean that only a claimant or beneficiary may initiate reopening. We are revising §§404.987 and 416.1487 to state explicitly that we may reopen a final determination or decision either on our own initiative or at the request of a party to the determination or decision. Comment : Several commenters thought that the time periods within which a final decision of an ALJ may be reopened under current §404.988 (a) or (b) or §416.1488 (a) or (b), which we did not propose to change, are measured from the date of the ALJ decision. Some commenters opposed the proposed revisions of §§404.987 and 416.1487 because they believed that the Appeals Council would have the discretion under §404.988(b) or §416.1488(b) to reopen a final decision of an ALJ on its own initiative within 4 years of the date of the ALJ decision if the Council finds good cause to reopen. One commenter stated that the proposed rules would render meaningless the 60-day time limit within which the Appeals Council may decide to review a decision by an ALJ on its own initiative under §§404.969 and 416.1469. This statement was based on the commenter's belief that §§404.988(a) and 416.1488(a), when read together with the proposed rules, give the Appeals Council the discretion to reopen a final decision of an ALJ on its own initiative within 1 year of the date of the ALJ decision for any reason. Response : Sections 404.988 and 416.1488 state the conditions under which we may reopen final determinations or decisions under the Social Security and SSI programs, respectively. We are not making any changes to these sections of our regulations. Sections 404.988(a) and 416.1488(a) provide that a determination or decision may be reopened within 12 months of the date of the notice of the initial determination for any reason. Sections 404.988(b) and 416.1488(b) provide that a determination or decision may be reopened within 4 years (2 years for SSI cases) of the date of the notice of the initial determination if we find good cause, as defined in §§404.989 and 416.1489, to reopen the case. The time periods within which a final decision of an ALJ may be reopened under these sections, therefore, are measured from the date of the notice of the initial determination, not from the date of the ALJ decision. Under these sections, the Appeals Council may reopen a final decision of an ALJ within 12 months of the date of the notice of the initial determination for any reason, or within 4 years (only 2 years for SSI cases) of the date of the notice of the initial determination if the Council finds good cause to reopen.
