In Mato Grosso do Sul, where the Guarani-Caiova and Guarani-Nhandeva subgroups are concentrated, their lands have been taken over by large landowners. Upon being evicted, the Indians congregate in a few areas such as Dourados and Amambai, where they are left to endure growing poverty. Sometimes they submit to the semislavery of working in the alcohol factories that have been set up in the area. In other cases they wander around and get drunk. And the number of Guarani suicides remains a sad constant. Between 1986 and now, 116 Indians of all ages, but most of them young, have sought death by throwing themselves into rivers, taking poison, hanging themselves from trees, or killing themselves with knives. In 1987, the leader of Sete Cerros, Silvano Valiente, wrote a letter to the authorities asking that land be demarcated for his people. And he hanged himself. The situation grew worse in 1990, when 20 Indians committed suicide in Dourados alone. A total of 34 suicides were recorded that year. A report by the Funai [National Indian Foundation] office in Amambai shows that the figure was 23 the following year. There were another 21 suicides in 1992, and 17 Caiova and Nhandeva Indians killed themselves last year. The explanation for so many deaths can be found in the Guarani belief that land is a divine gift to certain communities and that it therefore must not be exchanged or transferred to others. According to anthropologist Celso Shitosshi Aoki of the Caiova/Nhandeva Project, which has now been merged with the Center for Indian Work (CTI), the Guarani religion is complex and very strong, giving its adherents a holistic view of the world. "They do not understand, for example, why the whites cause them so much trouble, since they believe that it is the Guaranis who sustain life on earth through their prayers," the anthropologist explained. Celso Shitosshi believes that the compulsory integration of the Guarani communities into the village of Dourados and other villages may be one factor explaining the suicides, but that liquor and the Pentecostal churches existing in the area are not preponderant factors. "I believe that the suicides have to do with the very way in which the Guarani must look at life from the standpoint of his religiousness," says Shitosshi, who disagrees with Funai's psychologist, Maria Aparecida da Costa Pereira, who stated in a report in April 1991 that the Guaranis were experiencing an identity crisis or losing their identity and that that was why they were committing suicide. In that report, Maria Aparecida points out that the situation of the Guarani-Caiovas--who constitute the largest of the Guarani subgroups--is disastrous. "It is a society experiencing economic, political, and social crisis--engendering in turn a moral crisis--with juxtapositions and contradictions." She says that the solutions to the Guaranis' problems are to be found primarily in the "magico-religious" field and that at present, being faced with the imposition of "a non-Indian ethic on their magico-religious universe, particularly by the Pentecostal sects," they have had two alternatives: either reinvent themselves to fit a Western Christian concept or commit suicide as an alternative to living. Suicide a Way of Asking for Help For the Guaranis, according to psychologist Maria Aparecida da Costa, planting and religion go together. Because of that, leasing land to non-Indians is also a factor in self-destruction. In the village of Dourados, where more than 7,000 Indians are rubbing elbows with no room to live or plant, the Pentecostal sects are finding what Maria Aparecida calls "an anchorage.... given the fragile state of collective and interpersonal relations existing there." According to her, the Indians themselves admit that they are sick and disoriented psychologically. She sees the suicides as "messages of extreme supplication" by young people who have no strength left. Aparecida recalled that at one big meeting, a young Caiova man said: "If they are not going to do anything for us, it is better to turn off the sun"--a metaphorical reference, the psychologist feels, to collective suicide. She emphasized that in view of the entire atmosphere of suicide in Dourados, measures must be taken to guarantee the minimum conditions in which the Guaranis can exercise their right to collective life. Anthropologist Celso Aoki goes further, saying that the Guaranis will not be able to reestablish the sociopolitical pattern for maintaining their ethnic identity until their lands are returned to them. "It is in the space defined by place that Guaranis fulfill their way of being and living and their traditions and customs: their `tecoha.'" Cases--Helio Bonito was 66 years old, Marcinei Souza only 11. Last year, they and 15 other Guarani Indians found in suicide the solution to the pain they were feeling. Helio Bonito threw himself into the river and drowned, while the Caiova youngster, who also lived in the turbulent village of Dourados 4 kilometers from the town of the same name, hanged himself from a tree. Two other members of a single family also killed themselves. A young girl named Neide Peixoto hanged herself early in October, also in Dourados. On the following day, her father took poison. Still in October, Ramon Garcia, 48, and Aparecido Barbosa, 40, hanged themselves in Amambai. The attempts at suicide are many and frightening. Of the 21 suicides recorded by the Native Missionary Council (Cimi) and Funai in 1992, 20 were Guaranis. The other was 13-year-old Janevan Rosa of the Tereno tribe, who also lived in Dourados. She hanged herself. Besides those cases, three deaths by poisoning among the Yanomami Indians seem to have been intentional. In one of those cases, 10 Indians ate marine toad eggs, which are known to be poisonous. Two died. And 24-year-old Piaba, whose family was decimated, ate nettle spurge. The hope of the Center for Indian Rights, the Public Prosecutor's Office in Mato Grosso do Sul, and other institutions and agencies concerned with the problems of the Guaranis in Mato Grosso do Sul is that it will be possible to persuade the STF [Federal Supreme Court] to overturn the injunctions obtained by ranchers. If that happens, the ratification decrees will have more force. Land Remains With Ranchers The struggle by the Guaranis for their land has ended up in court. Although most of the areas have already been demarcated and ratified, the big ranchers occupying them--with land titles to back them up--are not returning what has traditionally belonged to the Caiova and Nhandeva groups. The Constitution clearly states (Article 231, Paragraph 6) that acts having as their object the occupation, control, and possession of Indian lands are null and void, but the ranchers, claiming that the land in question does not belong to the Guaranis, are trying to invalidate even the decrees ratifying those areas and signed by the president of the republic. The Center for Indian Rights (NDI), in an alliance with the Public Prosecutor's Office in Mato Grosso do Sul, is defending the Guaranis in at least 10 cases now before the courts. According to NDI attorney Ana Valeria Araujo, a few communities have been able to hold out and remain in their original areas, but other thousands of Indians have been crowded into Dourados, Amambai, Caarapo, Sassoro, Takoapiry, and other places, where they live in a situation of growing poverty and despair. "They cannot live on the land that the government has taken so long to demarcate, and now it appears that the courts do not want to acknowledge their title to that land," said Ana Valeria. According to her, when Funai began its process of identifying areas, the ranchers went to court, claiming that the land was theirs. The Indians came to be considered invaders. Beginning in 1992, Judge Susana Gomes of Federal Court No. 2 in Mato Grosso do Sul granted all the petitions by the ranchers to halt Funai's actions even though the Indian Statute stipulates that a preliminary injunction halting demarcation proceedings cannot be granted. Judge Fears for Property Improvements The Center for Indian Rights appealed those rulings to the Regional Federal Court for the Third Region in Sao Paulo, but there again, "the judges invented a way out by upholding only part of the appeal," says Ana Valeria. "Funai could put the markers in place, but it could not put the Indians on that land." According to Ana Valeria, the Sao Paulo judge felt that if the Indians returned to their land, they might damage the improvements which the ranchers had made there in good faith and which are governed by the right to indemnification. Other actions still pending before the Federal Supreme Court challenge the decrees ratifying Indian areas. "The tendency is to reject them, since complex cases like these should not be debated in the form of injunctions, which are temporary and prove nothing," Valeria points out. Communities Stand Pat The process of demarcating Indian lands in Mato Grosso do Sul began with the establishment of the Indian Protection Service (SPI) at the beginning of this century. Areas totaling 19,845 hectares had been demarcated by 1935. Despite that, ranches continued to be established there, the ranchers obtained title to the land, and the problem has grown worse over the past two decades because of the continuing intention to settle the Indians in villages. Six communities are holding on to their land, while families in other areas have been evicted or moved. New areas have been demarcated over the past two years, but they are occupied by few Indians. The Guaranis are traditionally farmers, but they also engage in mining to a lesser extent. They live in groups of approximately 100 individuals in an area that they call "tecoha." According to Cimi's report, which is based on Montoia's dictionary, "tecoha" means "the place where one can find a way to exist." People at the Mercy of the Courts Until the situation is resolved by the withdrawal of the ranchers, the Indians will be living in desperation. One of the situations causing the most concern is that of the Jaguapire community in the municipality of Tacuru. The area in question, measuring 2,089 hectares, is now being used by two big ranchers: Jose Fuentes Romero and Otavio Junqueira de Morais. In 1984, the nearly 200 Indians living there were dispossessed by court order. In 1992, Minister Celio Borja recognized the land as belonging to the Indians, and the Guarani families who had been settled in Amambai decided to return, occupy a piece of land along the southern border of Romero's ranch, and resume their traditional activities. They began planting the cleared land, sowed crops, and gradually reacquired their former autonomy. When their activities took them close to Otavio Junqueira's ranch, he obtained an order in the Iguatemi District Court prohibiting the Indians from occupying his part of it. The Military Police were called in. Meanwhile, rancher Romero, who was already involved in legal action in the federal courts in Campo Grande, asked for a restraining order to make the Indians withdraw. At the end of last November, the case was heard, and the judge upheld the rancher. The public prosecutor in Mato Grosso do Sul, Joao Heliofar de Jesus Villar, and the NDI attorney asked for a 60-day delay. "That time is about to expire--on 29 January--and we have now appealed to the Regional Federal Court in Sao Paulo, but the trouble is that Judge Pedro Rotta of Section 2 of that court is not hearing the case," the prosecutor said, pointing out that the problem in the Guarani areas will not be solved until the Union takes real responsibility for demarcation. "It demarcates the land and then turns the matter over to Funai, which is helpless because it lacks the resources for enforcing any ban; all it can do is play a bureaucratic role, without taking political responsibility for the decision." Heliofar feels that if the problem is left solely in the hands of the courts, it will be five years before there is a solution. Indians Number Nearly 30,000 The Guarani Indians are subdivided into three groups: the Caiovas or Pai-Taviteraos (which is what they call themselves in Paraguay), the Nhandevas, who also live in Mato Grosso do Sul, and the Mbi'as, who live in the states of Sao Paulo, Parana, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. Funai data show an estimated population of 30,000, making the Guaranis the largest Indian nation in Brazil. In second place are the Ticunas in the Amazon Region, who number about 23,000. In Mato Grosso do Sul alone, where the Caiovas are the majority, there are 24,400 Guarani Indians, according to a survey conducted in April of last year. That includes about 2,000 Indians scattered around in the various regions. In an analysis made two years ago by the Native Missionary Council, experts collected historical data concerning the Guaranis, especially the Guarani-Caiovas, who descend from the Guarani-Itatims, to explain that group's current context of resistance and [word missing]. It is pointed out that their traditional territory was situated between the Paraguay, Mbotetei, and Pira'i Aquidaban Rivers and the Xerez lands and that at the end of the last century, they were living in the same region where they live now--the extreme southern part of the state from the Apa River to the Paraguayan border. The etymological meaning of the name Caiova, according to Cimi's anthropologists, is "inhabitant of the jungle"--that is, the rain forest. They emphasize that this anthropological component of the Caiovas "needs to be thoroughly understood, since it is the establishment of ranches and the consequent deforestation that lead to the discovery of Caiova Indian villages." At the end of the last century, that group's territory was the scene of many battles in the Paraguayan War. The border divides the Caiova communities on the Brazilian side from those living on the Paraguayan side.
