Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata had to order the freeze to bolster consumer psychology and help the economy, the director general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) told a regular press conference after a morning cabinet endorsed the freeze. "I think the very fact that it is across-the-board is meaningful" for beleaguered consumers, Terasawa said. But he said he wants to "respect" the EPA's position that hikes in public service charges should be decided case by case. He said the move will have little effect on overall prices, which are quite stable in Japan's still-sluggish economy, noting that the EPA wants some prices to fall, to reduce disparities with overseas prices. But he said the freeze "avoids the negative effect" of more increases. In his abrupt decision Wednesday, Hata said the government must show the people it is taking the same bitter cost-cutting medicine as private enterprises in their restructuring efforts. But the move to freeze for the rest of the year a vast array of rate hikes needing government approval, and a request to local governments to do the same, angered Japan's bureaucracy. Public opposition by Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito was labeled a bureaucratic "coup d'etat" by one newspaper Friday. Some cabinet members called at the morning's meeting for a drastic overhaul of the system for setting public service charges, such as highway tolls, utility rates and transportation fares, Terasawa said.
