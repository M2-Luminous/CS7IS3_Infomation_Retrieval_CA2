It's expected to go ahead on Tuesday, instead, along with the stayaway. March organizers today blamed what they called technical problems for the postponement. The say they'll make a final decision on the march late tomorrow. Police say they'll continue with their contingency plan in the city tomorrow, treating it as a crime prevention exercise. Arlene Wainstein reports: [Begin recording] [Wainstein] The IFP Youth Brigade is adamant that the march will go ahead in Johannesburg. They say it will be a peaceful one, but they are determined to defy the ban imposed by the regional commissioner of police. [Youth Brigade spokesman Charles Loliwe] We actually appeal to him as a party that he should give us a permission so that we should march in the Johannesburg city to mourn for our people who were brutally murdered, because if he is going to disagree to grant us a permission to march in Jo'burg [Johannesburg], what I'm going to say is, we are going to march by force in Jo'burg. [Wainstein] The pivotal part of any IFP march through the streets of Johannesburg will be a memorial service here at ANC headquarters in Plein Street. In line with ancient black custom the spirits of those who were killed here just two weeks ago can only be laid to rest once a wreath-laying ceremony has been held at the spot. The IFP Youth Brigade says ban or no ban, this is one duty they simply have to perform. It's a sentiment that was echoed today by IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. [Buthelezi] So I think that 53 people that were killed in cold blood has made the blood of many people to boil, and I think the least that they would like to do is to pay tribute to them. I don't think there are any other motives as far as I can see myself. [passage omitted] [Wainstein] The Youth Brigade says the rolling mass action will continue until after the election. Among their plans, the march is on the Independent Electoral Commission and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. They say they want to coerce big business into intervening to postpone the elections until the IFP is part of the process. Also on the cards is a demonstration at SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] headquarters. This is to protest, what they call, the ANC allegiance of board chairman, Dr. Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, and the assistant to the chief executive, Mr. Zwelakhe Sisulu. [end recording]
