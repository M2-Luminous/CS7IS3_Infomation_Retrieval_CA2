It was in Hong Kong that the prime minister quantified the economic results of the contacts established in China and Macao, specifically business deals worth over 100 million contos [1 conto equals 1,000 escudos]. [Announcer] Cavaco Silva's meeting with the governor of Hong Kong was the last official act of the prime minister's 11-day visit to China. Cavaco is now on his way home, but while still in Hong Kong he made an appraisal of his trip and declared himself very pleased. The visit achieved all the objectives we set ourselves, the prime minister stated, and proceeded to justify his statement with the economic results: The 60 Portuguese businessmen who travelled with the head of the government left China with 100 million contos' worth of contracts either signed or under negotiation, 25 millions corresponding to deals already guaranteed between Portuguese and Chinese companies, and the remainder still dependent on further talks. This represents a degree of Sino-Portuguese economic cooperation that has surpassed the best expectations of the Portuguese delegation.
