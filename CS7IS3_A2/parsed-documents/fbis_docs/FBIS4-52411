NODONG SINMUN today criticizes it as another tragedy produced by the "civilian" regime's war hysterics against the North. The news analyst says: The puppet Defence Ministry described "pressure of his heart by a blank shot" as the cause of the death, but it was a ridiculous sophism to conceal its criminal act in forcing the university students to fire live cartridges in a war exercise. Loud voices critical of the "civilian"-veiled war-maniacs who caused the death by driving students to a war exercise are ringing out from South Korea. It is a treacherous act for the Kim Yong-sam group to drive out the students as a bullet shield in a war exercise against fellow countrymen. The traitorous clique of Kim Yong-sam is staging war exercises almost every day, crying out for "tough posture" and "military countermove" toward the North. This inflicts immeasurable disasters on the people. Unless the racket of North-South confrontation and war is stopped in South Korea, the people cannot be freed from disasters.
