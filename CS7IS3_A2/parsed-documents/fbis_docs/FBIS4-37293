He said that the responsibility for the party's failure in the recent Histadrut elections lay with the Histadrut members. Rabin expressed disappointment with the party's central committee and complained that half of its members had been appointed through various party machinations. However, the prime minister asserted, elections to change the current composition of the central committee would be held prior to the next Knesset elections. Our correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that throughout the speech, the hostility between Rabin and the Labor Central Committee members was evident, and the prime minister's speech was constantly interrupted by catcalls. Yitzhaq Rabin warned the central committee members that if the new Histadrut secretary general was not nominated by August, it would mean a death sentence for the Histradrut sick fund. He attacked those who violated the party bureau's decisions with regard to establishing a coalition with the Ramon-Meretz Histadrut list, and said that there was no room in the party for people who broke agreements. Our correspondent adds that when Gershon Gelman, the secretary general of the Tel Aviv workers council, stepped up to the podium, Yitzhaq Rabin stood up and stormed out of the hall, sparking an uproar. Many participants yelled that because of Gelman, the Labor party had lost 40 worker council branches.
