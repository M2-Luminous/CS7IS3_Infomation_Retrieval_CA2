FR940926-2-00026 FR940926-2-00023 Financial Assistance Award: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University AGENCY: Department of Energy, Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE), Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.14 (e) and (f) it intends to make a Non-Competitive Financial Assistance Award (Grant) to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University based on an Unsolicited Proposal submitted to DOE by the University. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: U.S. Department of Energy, Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, Acquisition and Assistance Center, P.O. Box 10940, MS 921&hyph;118, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Attn.: William R. Mundorf, Telephone: (412) 892&hyph;4483, Comments or inquiries should be submitted within 14 days of the date of this announcement. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI) has proposed to DOE to cost share, by approximately 20%, a program to assist the U.S. coal industry to improve its efficiency in producing lower sulfur coals. VPI will be the lead organization of the Appalachian Clean Coal Technology Consortium (ACCTC). ACCTC involves three universities (VPI, West Virginia University and the University of Kentucky) as charter members, and five coal companies, an A&E firm and an equipment company as affiliate members. The objectives of the consortium are (1) to increase the production of lower sulfur coals, (2) to enhance the competitiveness of U.S. coals in the international market, (3) to create high-tech jobs in the economically-depressed areas of Appalachia, (4) to reduce the nation's dependency of foreign energy supplies, (5) to produce coals from refuse ponds in useable forms, and (6) to minimize the impact of coal burning on the environment. Cooperative relationships with coal companies, equipment manufacturers, and A&E firms are planned to assist in achieving the objectives. The work will entail (1) development of new advanced coal cleaning technologies, (2) improvement of the efficiency of existing coal cleaning technologies, (3) information exchange, and (4) train personnel/work force for industry. In accordance with 10 CFR 600.14 (e) and (f), acceptance of an Unsolicited Proposal from VPI has been justified. DOE support of the ACCTC activities would provide a unique and innovative method of enhancement of the competitiveness of U.S. coals that would otherwise be unavailable. This effort is therefore considered suitable for noncompetitive financial assistance and would not be eligible for financial assistance under a solicitation. DOE funding for this research is estimated to be approximately $250,000 for a 12 month period of performance. These funds shall be used to pay for the reasonable cost of research staff and support personnel necessary for the overall project. Issued in Washington, DC on September 12, 1994. Richard D. Rogus, Contracting Officer. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23745 Filed 9&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
