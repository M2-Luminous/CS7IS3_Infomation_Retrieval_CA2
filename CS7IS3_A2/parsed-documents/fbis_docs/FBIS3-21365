In that article, we found many questionable passages. Citing exogenous factors that enhanced the positive results of the SAP (Editor's note: Mr. Saadi write "la SAP" (Structural Adjustment Policy), but actually it is "le SAP" (Structural Adjustment Program)), Mr. Saadi enumerates: "Exceptional weather conditions, favorable worldwide economic conditions, 1985 aftereffects of the oil crisis, rescheduling of the foreign debt, and cancellation of $2.8 billion in debts owed by Morocco to Saudi Arabia, all these helped achieve the above-mentioned financial results." We shall remember, therefore, that some of the SAP positive results are due to external conditions. Second, Mr. Saadi writes: "The Moroccan economy experienced growth rates that were modest (3.5 to 4.0 percent during the eighties, and only 2.0 percent on the average in recent years!) and uneven (negative growth in 1983, 1987, and 1992; near stagnation in 1993). If we compare these rates with demographic growth rates (2.6 percent), we realize that per capita income remained practically stagnant during that period." Curiously enough, the author does not mention the growth rates experienced since 1988. They were as follows: 1988: 10.4 percent; 1989: 2.5 percent; 1990: 3.7 percent; 1991: 5.1 percent. In other words, from 1988 to 1991 the GDP [gross domestic product] rose by 11 percent in constant dirhams [DH] (from DH101.525 to DH113.460 billion) over a three-year period; if we take 1987 as a basis, the GDP grew by 23.4 percent in four years! For Mr. Saadi, it is an established fact that the GDP growth rate is low: "The low GDP growth rate," he writes, "is due first to the fact that Moroccan economy is very vulnerable to weather conditions and to economic conditions worldwide. But the SAP also contributed to it in two ways: on the one hand, it increased the involvement of Moroccan economy on the world market, based on ill-advised specialization in low value-added products, the prices of which fluctuate considerably on the world market; second, it triggered a shrinkage of the domestic demand as a result of the austerity imposed to the State--especially as far as economic intervention is concerned--and to low-income social strata. The author overlooks the disastrous harvest of 1992--and the 1993 harvest as well--although he just wrote that the SAP benefited from "exceptional" weather conditions. Actually, these exceptional conditions did not bring about good harvests, but bad ones. Besides, here are the results for the four leading grains (in million quintals): 1987: 42.1; 1988: 78.3; 1989: 73.3; 1990: 61.9; 1991: 85.3; 1992: 28.6 [sic]. As for the "shrinkage of the domestic demand as a result of the austerity imposed to the State," here are accurate figures: 1. Government expenditures (GDP) (in constant dirhams): 1988: DH15.521 [billion]; 1989: 16.303; 1990: 16.572; 1991: 17.343; 1992: 18.210. That is a constant progression (even in 1992); compared with 1988, it amounts to 17.3 percent. It is not a lot and undeniably an effort was made to reduce State expenditures, but you cannot waste money during a restructuring period. 2. Household consumption (in billions of constant dirhams): 1988: 115.989; 1989: 127.197; 1990: 138.720; 1991: 160.742; 1992: 159.667. Obviously, there was a marked shrinkage in 1992, but that was the year when the rural world saw its resources cut by DH9 billion compared with 1991. But can we really say that there was a "domestic shrinkage" during the four previous years? Besides, as can be seen, the 1992 shrinkage was due to the poor harvest, not to the SAP as Mr. Saadi would have us believe. As for the development of exports achieved by the SAP through deregulation and devaluation of the dirham, it is, he writes, "characterized by its weakness and it does not reflect an improvement in the economic competitiveness of the Moroccan economy at international level." Mr. Saadi mentions the textile industry, "which suffers both from the depressed climate that prevails on foreign markets and from strong foreign competition," in spite of which he notes that "the increase in exports during the second half of the eighties was due mostly to an increase in worldwide demand...." Morocco's lack of competitiveness, according to Mr. Saadi, comes from the fact that "the SAP completely overlooked the question of the creation of a local scientific and technical potential, and even specific problems that plague the industry," and he added that the SAP "contributed to the deterioration of human resources through the severe cuts it made in the budgets of social services (especially education and health budgets)" (see Table 1). Since 1988, credits allocated to National Education were increased by 58.2 percent; those allocated to Health, by 77.1 percent. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1 - Increase in Budgets of Social Services (Operations and Investments)| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Education (Billion Dirha-|Health (Billion Dirhams) | | |ms) | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1988 |9.448 |1.721 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1989 |10.627 |1.737 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1990 |11.803 |2.082 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1991 |12.093 |2.161 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1992 |14.229 |2.777 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1994 |14.950 |3.048 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mr. Saadi goes on: "Another indicator of the negative impact of the SAP on the growth of productive forces is the stagnation of the investment rate" (Ratio of the GFCF [gross fixed capital formation] to the GDP: 22.2 percent in 1980; 23 percent in 1985; and 23 percent in 1992)." [punctuation marks as published] Compared with the statistics published by the Ministry of Planning ("Morocco in Figures"), these figures are not accurate. Here are the figures we found (in current dirhams: Table 2 - GFCF and GDP Increases (Billion Dirhams) GFCF GDP Ratio 1980 14.767 70.024 21% 1985 24.724 119.658 20.7% 1990[.sup]1[/] 51.179 207.876 24.6% 1992 55.804 242.448 23% [.sup]1.[/] For information only. The GDP increased by 246 percent in 12 years, and the GFCF by 278 percent. Let us overlook "the SAP low impact" on agriculture (although "by eliminating subsidies for fertilizer and seed, it furthered a production cost increase"). Note that the 1994 Finance Law eliminates the PFI [import tax levy] and the value-added tax on fertilizer. As for the processing industry, "it is still handicapped by its low integration level, the uneven development of its branches, and it strong dependence on foreign suppliers of capital goods and inputs (raw materials, intermediate products), and its reorientation toward foreign markets was not enough to offset the negative impact of the shrinking domestic market; all this accounts for the low industrial growth rate experienced during the last 10 years (3.8 percent during the eighties, and 2.5 percent from 1990 to 1992)." Let us take another look at the GDP figures (in constant dirhams) for the industry, during the nineties: 1990: DH40,284.2 million; 1991: DH42,845.1 million; 1992: DH45,015.1 million. Let us say it again: The industrial growth rate was 6.35 percent in 1991, and 5.1 percent in 1992, in constant dirhams, which is far more than the results quoted by Mr. Saadi who, still with the same bias, goes on to consider the foreign debt problem. Here is what he has to say: "Although the SAP was supposed to settle the foreign debt issue once and for all and restore Morocco's solvency, it appears that, after 10 years of structural adjustment, the foreign debt level remains particularly high ($21.3 billion in 1992). Certainly, the foreign debt/GDP ratio declined from 97 percent in 1983 to 78 percent in 1992, but the debt still places a burden on the State budget and on the balance of payment, and we should expect this burden to increase, as Morocco decided that, starting in 1993, it would no longer reschedule its foreign debt (as an example, it is expected that 19 percent of all the 1994 State budget resources will be earmarked to cover the foreign debt, which represents a considerable reduction of the resources available to stimulate the economy and start solving social problems)." Mr. Saadi probably imagined that the objective of the SAP was to obliterate the foreign debt. Actually, it was to enable Morocco to honor its signature. It did so, which greatly enhanced its credibility and the confidence it inspires in investors. Certainly, the debt is a heavy burden, and if we listened to Mr. Saadi, who denounces "the drop in public investments" during the eighties, it would be still higher. But our economist has a ready solution. You read it right: the foreign debt service "represents a considerable reduction of the resources available to stimulate the economy and start solving social problems." The message is clear. You see, all we have to do is eliminate that reduction, reschedule again, in other words, not pay what we owe. But eventually Morocco will pay a high, a very high price for such an irresponsible attitude (not to use another word). Therefore, let us clean up the mess. And long live the SAP!
