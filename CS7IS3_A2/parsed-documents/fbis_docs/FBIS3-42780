In order to elect a new chairman and work out the tactics for interaction (confrontation?) with the parliament, since 14 of the 19 territories that make up the Association are represented in the Federation Council by their heads. Our correspondent met with Valeriy Zubov, governor of Krasnoyarsk Kray, who, in Sibirskoye Soglasheniuye, heads the Coordination Council on Finance and Investments. The meeting occurred shortly before Zubov's departure to Moscow. [Yukechev] Valeriy Mikhaylovich, how do you evaluate the fact that almost all the governors who ran for election have been elected to the upper house of the new parliament? And how are you planning to handle this victory? [Zubov] Well, I wouldn't call it a victory, since I do not see anyone who has been defeated. The population supported not so much the personalities, as I understand the situation, as they did the leaders of their regions. Since, whereas the State Duma has to be oriented on the resolution of Russia-wide problems, the Federation Council has to carry out expert deliberations concerning the draft versions of laws with the object of taking the interests of the regions into consideration. That idea has reached the population, and it voted for its rights. How will our "faction" behave in the Federation Council? I think that, rather quickly, we shall become coordinated and begin working on the formulation of a regional policy. [Yukechev] A regional policy, in its turn, consists of several policies. One of them is finance and credit policy. Wherein can the participation of Sibirskoye Soglasheniye and specifically your participation in its formulation be expressed? [Zubov] First, in influence on the Russia-wide financial situation. There is truly a misalignment of the interests here. We are exporting regions. Our welfare depends directly upon how Russia-wide export is carried out. Suffice it to state that Krasnoyarsk Kray exports more than Moscow, Moscow Oblast, St. Petersburg, and Leningrad Oblast. In addition, there are Tyumen and Irkutsk Oblast. If one looks at history, those regions were assimilated largely in order to produce output for export. But today the finance and credit policy does not promote the development of export as a whole, or, consequently, those regions. It is an absurd situation when three of the world's largest aluminum plants are in a critical state. We are putting our country's energy system in a critical situation, because the basic systems with a surplus of energy are here in Siberia. Our cheapest coal is here, but it is unprofitable to export it. As for our basic timber resources, once again we cannot export them. What do we want to get as a result? A short-term effect, when the ruble is stable and it is used to support branches that are operating exclusively on imported raw materials and equipment? Or do we want to develop our own production, which is capable not only of satisfying the country's needs, but also of producing output for export? Those are the key reasons why the Siberian regions occupy a special position. [Yukechev] Are you talking about an incorrect choice of priorities? [Zubov] Yes. [Yukechev] In that instance, how do you propose carrying out a re-evaluation of priorities? It is possible, with the same people, to sit down next to one another and try to understand one another better. It is also possible to exert an influence on federal policy by other methods: by lobbying, by promoting one's own people... Which methods seem to you to be the most acceptable? [Zubov] The most acceptable path, which, properly speaking, is the one that Sibirskoye Soglasheniye proceeded along until today, is negotiations. For example, when our council on foreign-economic activity began operating, we attempted there, together with the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs], to find those points where things were advantageous both for Russia and for Siberia. So far as I know, that kind of conversation with the northwest region did not occur. Or if we are convinced that, in this short period of time, the so-called Russia-wide interests must predominate, then we shall agree with that, or it will be necessary to agree with us: we cannot place three-fourths of Russia in a very serious situation for the sake of abstract stabilization on the rest of the territory. If all the financial resources are pulled into Moscow and St. Petersburg, what then about Siberia, "the territory of progress," to use Chernomyrdin's expression? Therefore we shall undertake efforts, as we have done up until now, to concentrate the financial means here -- in order to resolve regional problems. Putting it more succinctly, our task is to influence Russia-wide policy so that it will be advantageous for the regions. [Yukechev] What effect can the increase in the transportation rates have in the Siberian territories? [Zubov] A bad one, of course. It is necessary to weigh carefully which is more beneficial -- either to guarantee the profitability of the branches and regions situated on the Transsib [Trans-Siberian Railroad] by subsidizing the mainline, or to subsidize individual branches and individual regions. Nonferrous metallurgy (50 percent of the total industrial production), and the timber and coal industries, constitute the basis of the kray's economy. Two of these three branches depend entirely on the Transsib. So let's figure out which is more advantageous. [Yukechev] But what if, as has happened in the past, no one listens to the voice of the regions? [Zubov] When the negotiations fail, lobbying begins, by urging along people who understand, who share our views. There's nothing new about this. [Yukechev] You know, better than I do, that the rate of budgetary support in the various Siberian regions differs. The difference sometimes is too great. Is that normal? [Zubov] Krasnoyarsk Kray is among the five largest taxpayers into the Russian budget. It has developed that, for many decades the state, in a concentrated manner, invested funds into certain regions. Therefore they also proved to be in a preferential position. Of course, Krasnoyarsk Kray was developed by the entire country, like the Togliatti Automobile Plant. But it is necessary to help the other "weak" regions not at the expense of the collapse of the strong ones, which are obliged to be economically more supported at the expense of the taxes collected from themselves. A single standard for deductions to be paid into the budget is possible in the event that part of the budget will be redistributed in a purposeful manner to those regions that have previously been declared to be depressed or undeveloped, for which certain terms are created: over a period of, for example, ten years of state support they will reach the level of self-support. In this part, I must say, the federal government is proceeding correctly today -- this is approximately the way that the 1994 budget is being formed. [Yukechev] But is it possible to return to the idea of a consolidated budget within the framework of Sibirskoye Soglasheniye? [Zubov] No, it's impossible. This is a completely unnecessary idea. Today we must not reconsider the borders, or introduce new territorial or national formations. It is possible only to unite the budgets, according to the wishes of the territories, to resolve completely local tasks. But one cannot speak about a single budget, otherwise this problem will change over to the political plane... [Yukechev] Can you give examples of these specific programs? [Zubov] Yes. For example, Agrosib. A quota for the timber in Krasnoyarsk Kray was allocated to that program, with the assumption that the proceeds from that will go into developing the processing of agricultural output in the Siberian regions. [Yukechev] For Russia as a whole, the reprocessing of waste products is a vitally important problems. In addition to those waste products of our own that we have enough of, the European countries are ready to sell us more... At the same time, there have been proposals from abroad: to give us modern technological systems and even investments, if only we build reprocessing enterprises in our country. What is your attitude to this? [Zubov] I want to talk only about the reprocessing of waste products from nuclear electric-power stations. They are being stored today. There exists a definite period of time during which they can simply lie around. But if we do not build enterprises to reprocess them within the next 16 years, we shall finding waiting for us an ecological catastrophe that is more terrible than the Chernobyl disaster. There are two methods for resolving this problem: either find budgetary money to build those enterprises, or earn money from having those waste products brought to us. For us, only the second path is economically possible: we do not enough of a budget today. The cost of one such modern plant is approximately equal to the kray's budget (but in dollars). It is necessary to provide the opportunity to a nuclear enterprise (Krasnoyarsk, Tomsk, Chelyabinskny situation) to earn money for building a processing plant. France acts this way, for example, and there's no problem -- it's normal. And our technological systems do not yield to the French ones. [Yukechev] Does that mean, then, that you are ready to consider specific investment proposals? [Zubov] We are already considering them. [Yukechev] That sounds optimistic. [Zubov] No, it sounds pessimistic. Because all it will take is to have five energetic people come and stir up the entire population, and everything will go to rack and ruin... You cannot make decisions like this at rallies. And if you do make them, then there should be mention of your name in the newspapers: so that your descendants will know who made that decision. Just as, incidentally, they should know who made the decision to build the plant, who signed the contracts. In any instance the person's name should be known. [Yukechev] I have heard that Krasnoyarsk has announced its candidacy for conducting the 2002 Goodwill Games. Do you hope that this question will be resolved to our advantage? [Zubov] Yes. Most of the sports federations have already supported this idea. I must say that when, in 1982, the winter sports days were held in Krasnoyarsk for the first time, and the next ones were also set up here, we were convinced that we can do things normally. [Yukechev] Well, then, we also wish you luck in this matter. [Zubov] Well, I think that all Siberians should give us moral support too.
