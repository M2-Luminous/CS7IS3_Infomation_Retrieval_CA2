Incidents in Chiapas "are strictly internal problems of the Mexican state," and solutions should be reached while respecting Mexico's sovereignty, indicated the FMLN in a press communique sent to EFE. The former Salvadoran guerrillas expressed their support for the peace initiatives through dialogue between all the sectors involved and regretted the loss of human lives in the armed conflict. The FMLN reiterated that since the signing of the Chapultepec Agreement in January 1993, it is a completely legal political party, respecting noninterference in the internal affairs of third countries. The former guerrillas condemned press and political statements linked to the ARENA [Nationalist Reublican Alliance] party that attempt to tangle the FMLN in the violent Chiapas incidents. They warned that these accusations are evidence of despair in the face of the FMLN's electoral progress with regard to the March 1994 Salvadoran elections.
