Ross arrived in the Tunisian capital yesterday. The Israeli team is made up of the director general of the Foreign Ministry, Uri Savir; General 'Uzi Dayan of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]; and the prime minister's political adviser, Jacques Neriya. The decision to dispatch the delegation to Tunis came in the wake of the intensive American efforts to bring about renewal of negotiations between Israel and the PLO. Qol Yisra'el's Washington correspondent says also that Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and the PLO's Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] are likely to meet at the end of the week to restart talks on the autonomy for Gaza and Jericho. The Washington meeting is apparently dependent on the outcome of the contacts now under way in Tunis.
