Example 4_Nonqualifying Senior Position Bank D issues two classes of securities backed by a $212 million, well-diversified pool of consumer loans_a subordinated class of $12 million, which would be rated below investment grade, and a senior class of $200 million. Bank D retains the bottom-level class and sells the other class to a banking organization or thrift. In the absence of additional credit enhancements, a nationally recognized statistical rating organization will rate the senior class one grade below its highest credit rating as a result of the first dollar loss enhancement from the subordinated class. Bank D obtains a letter of credit to provide additional enhancement to the transaction from a company whose obligations have the highest possible credit rating from the same credit rating organization. The credit rating organization now gives its highest possible credit rating to the senior class in this transaction. However, since this credit rating is a result of a prior enhancement that is provided in the form of a standby letter of credit, which has performance risk, risk-based capital would be assessed against the senior class at the 100% risk-weight rather than at the 20% risk-weight. Under the ratings-based multi-level approach, the 20% risk-weight would only be applied to qualifying senior interests that are supported by prior credit enhancements that are in the form of overcollateralization, spread accounts, cash collateral accounts, or subordinated interests. Table 4 summarizes this example.
