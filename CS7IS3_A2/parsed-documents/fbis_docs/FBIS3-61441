Ilina, A.N. Galkin, doctor of agricultural sciences, and A.I. Kuzmenko, candidate of agricultural sciences, Slita Polvolzhya Scientific Production Association; UDC 633.111.1''321'':631.526.32] [Abstract] The variety Saratovskaya 58 was developed at the Scientific Research Institute Agriculture of the Southeast by graduated hybridization. The starting plant was selected from the population of the last cross of Saratovskaya 46 x Saratovskaya 39. It has been regionalized in regions I and III of the Saratov Oblast since 1991 and in the oblast's II region since 1992. It is of the variety lutescens. The spike is cylindrical and of average compactness. Its glume is of average size, and the tooth of its glume is short. The grain is red, oval, and glassy. A total of 1,000 grains weighs 35.9 g. Saratovskaya 58 is a medium-maturing variety, with a growth period averaging 84 days and with a period of 45 days from the appearance of shoots to the heading stage, which is practically on a par with the standard Saratovskaya 46. Saratovskaya 58 is more drought resistant than the latter and thus provides a more stable yield from year to year under the conditions of the right bank of the central lands along the Volga. The upper leaves of Saratovskaya 58 have a higher water retention capability than Saratovskaya 46. When compared with varieties previously regionalized in the said region, Saratovskaya 58 has a higher multiyear yield: In tests conducted over a 3-year period at government variety-testing sections in the Saratov Oblast, Saratovskaya 58 averaged 2.1 metric tons per hectare versus 1.8 metric tons per hectare for the standard. In commercial tests conducted in 1989 at the Kolkhoz imeni N.G. Chernyshevskiy in the Novoburasskiy Rayon of the Saratov Oblast, the yield of Saratovskaya 58 was 16 percent higher than that of Saratovskaya 46. Saratovskaya 58 is virtually completely resistant to smut and is resistant to sprouting of the grain (in comparative tests, only 0.2 percent of Saratovskaya 58 grains sprouted versus 30.5 percent of Saratovskaya 46 grains). From a grain quality standpoint, Saratovskaya 58 is a hard wheat, and from the standpoints of gluten and protein content, it is somewhat superior to the best hard wheat (Saratovskaya 29). Saratovskaya 58 has a higher gluten content than the standard Saratovskaya 46 and is in quality group 1. Like all hard wheat varieties, Saratovskaya 58 must be raised in rather fertile soil that is free of weeds, and it must be sown as early as possible in moist, well-prepared soil at a rate of 120-150 kilograms of seed per hectare.
