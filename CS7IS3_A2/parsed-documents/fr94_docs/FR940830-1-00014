FR940830-1-00014 FR940830-1-00002 In evaluating whether an individual's social disadvantage has negatively impacted on his or her entry into and/or advancement in the business world, §124.105(c) would be amended to clarify that SBA will entertain any relevant evidence, but that SBA would consider the experiences of the individual, where applicable, in education, employment and business history. The failure to establish disadvantage in any one area (i.e., education, employment, or business history) would not prevent an individual from meeting this requirement of negative impact as long as the totality of the circumstances experienced by the individual demonstrate his/her disadvantage in entering into and/or advancing in the business world. Section 124.106(a)(2)(i) would be amended by increasing the entry level personal net worth limitation from $250,000 to $300,000 in order to take into account inflation. The $250,000 net worth figure was established by regulation in April 1989. Inflation increased 19.6 percent between April 1989 and March 1994 based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. Applying the 19.6 percent inflation rate to the $250,000 figure would increase the net worth limitation to $299,000. This proposed rule would round that amount to $300,000. Section 124.106(a)(2)(ii) would clarify SBA's method of analysis in determining whether the applicant concern itself, as apart from its disadvantaged owner(s), should be considered economically disadvantaged. It would require SBA to compare an applicant concern to other small business concerns in the same four-digit Standard Industrial Classification Code which are not owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Section 124.106(a)(2)(i)(A)( 1 ) would be amended to provide that assets transferred by an individual claiming disadvantaged status to any immediate family member within two years prior to the date of application to the 8(a) program shall be presumed to be the property of the individual claiming disadvantaged status. Currently, property or assets transferred by an individual claiming disadvantaged status to his/her spouse within two years of the date of 8(a) application is presumed to be the property of the transferor for purposes of determining his/her economic disadvantage. SBA believes that a change is needed to prevent circumvention of its eligibility regulations by asset transfers to other than an applicant individual's spouse. Several applicants have avoided the intent of this regulation by transferring assets to children. SBA believes that it is necessary to prevent the recurrence of this practice, which if left unchanged, could admit firms into the 8(a) program that SBA believes should be considered ineligible. Section 124.106(b) would be amended for clarity, and would increase the personal net worth limitation for the Small Disadvantaged Business program from $750,000 to $900,000 to take into account inflation since the $750,000 standard was set in April 1989. Section 124.107(b) would be amended to clarify that the requirement that an applicant concern possess technical and managerial experience to be deemed to have the required potential for success to be admitted to the 8(a) program was not meant to contradict the provision in §124.104 that the individual(s) upon whom eligibility is based need not posses both management and technical capabilities. In order to have the requisite potential for success, an applicant concern must have both management and technical experience. Conversely, the individual(s) upon whom eligibility is based must possess either management or technical capabilities to meet that part of the control requirement under §124.104. Section 124.108 would be amended by adding a new paragraph (d)(3) that would state that any 8(a) applicant that is a dealer or wholesaler would not be required to demonstrate that it is capable of supplying the product of a small business manufacturer in conjunction with its 8(a) application. In the past, there has been confusion as to whether SBA's non-manufacturer rule (i.e., the rule requiring a regular dealer to supply the product of a small business in order for it to be considered small for a specific 8(a) or small business set aside procurement) should be applied in determining an applicant's initial eligibility for the 8(a) program. SBA believes that because the Small Business Act authorizes waivers to the non-manufacturer rule in connection with a specific contract where SBA determines that no small business manufacturer can reasonably be expected to offer a product meeting the specifications of the solicitation, the non-manufacturer rule should have no bearing on an applicant's eligibility for the 8(a) program. In addition, the 8(a) program should not be viewed solely as a contracting program. There is other business development assistance available to Program Participants which should not be foreclosed because of the non-manufacturer rule. Regular dealer applicants to the 8(a) program should be aware, however, that they must generally meet the requirements of the non-manufacturer rule in order to be awarded specific 8(a) contracts as regular dealers. Proposed §124.109(f) would add a provision making an applicant to the 8(a) program ineligible for program participation if the proprietor, or a holder of at least 20 percent of the stock, or a partner, officer, director of the concern is currently incarcerated, on parole or on probation. This provision is derived from a similar determination of ineligibility for SBA financial assistance currently contained in 13 CFR 120.101&hyph;2(f). Section 124.111 would be amended by revising paragraph (a)(2) to set the same personal net worth limitation for a Program Participant in either the developmental or transitional stage of program participation to maintain its continued 8(a) eligibility. Currently, the limit is $500,000 for firms in the developmental stage of 8(a) program participation, $750,000 for firms in the transitional stage of 8(a) program participation, and $750,000 for purposes of eligibility for the Department of Defense's Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) program. This rule would eliminate the separate net worth figure for firms in the developmental stage (i.e., eliminating the current $500,000 amount). It would then apply the $750,000 amount, adjusted for inflation, to all participant firms to make the requirement for developmental firms consistent with continued eligibility for transitional firms and simplify program administration. As with the entry level personal net worth limitation amount, the $750,000 figure would also be increased by 19.6 percent due to inflation ( see discussion relating to proposed §124.106(a)(2)(i)). A straight inflation adjustment would produce a net worth limitation of $897,000. This proposed rule would round that amount to $900,000.
