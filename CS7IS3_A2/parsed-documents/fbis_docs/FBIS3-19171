In reply to a question, Ciller said: The terrorists cannot be our equals. We cannot consider them our equals. We, therefore, cannot sit at the negotiating table with them. The important issue is to ensure the security of life and property of our citizens in that region. We are able to celebrate the holidays in security throughout Turkey today. We will hold the elections in a similar atmosphere. Had these terrorists not existed we would have reached this point much earlier. The important issue now is for them to give up. The state is powerful. The Turkish state is very powerful. We are very determined.
