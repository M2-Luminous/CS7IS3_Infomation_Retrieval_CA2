[Peres] Barring unexpected developments, the answer is yes. [Sukenik] What will take place then? Roughly speaking, when can the withdrawal start and when can it end? [Peres] If the negotiations start tomorrow [as heard] indeed, we may be very near the first objective, namely, the first half of April. Still, if there are further delays....[pauses] Look there is a certain paradox here: On the one hand, the PLO tells us to keep the timetable, but on the other hand, it does not begin on time. We cannot finish on time if we do not start on schedule. [Sukenik] You know that the PLO points to security problems in Hebron and to the Jewish core in the heart of Hebron in explaining the various delays. You and Mr. Rabin repeatedly declare that a decision on their evacuation is ours only, regardless of the negotiations. Were you in a position to do so, would you now decide on the evacuation of some of these Jews at least? [Peres] Look, I would take care of security in the largest sense of the word. This is not a personal matter. What happened in Hebron following the Cave of the Patriarchs incident is that the chance for peaceful coexistence between the settlers and the Arab residents was severely wounded if not killed completely. It will take a very long time for the wounds to heal. The settlers said they can have peaceful coexistence, but this is not the case today. We cannot reach unreasonable absurdities: place 120,000 Arab residents under curfew in order to defend 400 Jews who live there. [Sukenik] What is the conclusion then? [Peres] We need to reach appropriate conclusions about deployment in Hebron, from the civilian as well as the military viewpoint. [Sukenik] Can we assume that Tall al-Rumaythah and Netzarim are the first settlements whose moment of truth is drawing nearer? [Peres] I will not say a word on this. I would only say that there are large military shoulders carrying a very heavy burden. Still, civilian shoulders must share the burden. It is impossible to defend everything with pistols or guns or an army. We must radically change the situation and cannot avoid this. Today I heard of the slogan "All Israel Is Hebron." Let me react to this in simple terms: The fate of Israel will not be determined by the Hebron residents only. In contrast, the fate of Hebron will be decided by the majority in Israel. We may have different views among us, but the fashion in which a decision is made must be acceptable to all, without exception. In arguments there is no trigger, gun, or knife; there are only arguments in favor or against, and the majority can decide. We have reached a very sensitive situation on this matter. You saw a Jew getting up during the holiday and shooting an Arab driver in revenge. People use their arms as they please, and this is unacceptable to us. [Sukenik] Coexistence in Hebron is impossible then, in your opinion? [Peres] It is impossible at this stage. I believe the day may come when coexistence will be possible, but tension has reached its highest point today, and military measures are necessary. In general, we will not abandon anybody, neither a settler, nor any Arab resident of Hebron. Still, searching must be an overall thing, not just military. [Sukenik] It is impossible not to ask a short question on the Syrian issue. In your opinion, does the nation support the Golan cause indeed? [Peres] Many people who say we must not get off the Golan also say we must not give peace up, and everybody understands that the two are closely interrelated. The Syrians have now taken a step which the Americans greatly appreciate; it is quite a wise step on their part. It is they who accepted President Clinton's invitation to return to the negotiations in Washington. This move binds the PLO too, naturally; the PLO cannot stay out of the picture. I think that in contrast with a certain hesitancy in Jordan, in contrast with the difficulties we are facing with the Palestinians....[pauses] I believe, incidentally, that we are getting back on track, that within several weeks we will have a new situation in the Middle East: For the first time, there will be a piece of Palestinian reality which will be seen and felt, and, thank God, we will be able to say goodbye to Gaza. Goodbye to Gaza means peace for Israel without Gaza. I think it is possible to get on this track and that we should get on a track of very serious negotiations with the Syrians.
