FR941006-1-00059 FR941006-1-00013 A further notice with request for comments was published on June 3, 1992, (57 FR 23370), and a notice of final disposition was published on July 16, 1992, (57 FR 31458). The period during which applications for participation in this waiver program would be considered expired on December 31, 1992, after having been extended from September 21, 1992 (57 FR 45002, September 30, 1992). Over 3,700 applications were received. To assure consistency with safety, the FHWA set minimum requirements which a driver would have to meet before being considered eligible for a waiver. These included visual acuity of at least 20/40 (Snellen) in the better eye, three years driving experience with the vision deficiency, a safe driving record for that period, and a report on the condition of the applicant's vision from an ophthalmologist or optometrist, including an opinion as to the driver's ability to operate a CMV safely with the condition. A safe driving record was defined as the absence of chargeable accidents, no convictions for serious traffic offenses, and no more than two convictions for other moving violations. The agency based its requirement that drivers participating in the study have a three-year safe driving history with their vision impairment upon studies (discussed more fully in ``Rationale for the Determination'') indicating that past experience can be used to predict future performance, especially when combined with other predictive factors such as geographic location, mileage driven, and conviction history. The agency also relied upon opinions from the medical community that individuals with vision impairments are often able to compensate for that impairment over a period of time. Because of the discrepancy as to how much time is necessary to allow an individual to compensate for an impairment (which generally ranged from several months to a full year), the agency's choice of three years provided added assurance that drivers would have had sufficient time to develop compensatory behavior. It was also the longest period for which driver histories were uniformly available from State motor vehicle departments (MVD). Court Decision The Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates) filed suit in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, requesting a review of the FHWA's notice of final disposition granting waivers to individuals who otherwise did not meet the Federal vision standard required for the qualification of CMV drivers in interstate commerce. The Advocates asserted that the waiver program was in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 553) because the rule implementing the program was not issued with opportunity for meaningful comment and was otherwise arbitrary, capricious, or not in accordance with law. A three-judge panel for the D.C. Circuit issued its opinion in the case on August 2, 1994. The Court found that the FHWA's notices of the program did provide for meaningful comment and that the comments received were given consideration. The Court also held that the FHWA's approach, given the apparently conflicting demands, was reasonable, and therefore not arbitrary and capricious. The Court observed, however, that the FHWA ``initiated a program to issue temporary waivers to visually impaired drivers in order to procure the hard evidence needed to determine the effect of visual deficiencies on safety. Yet, before it may grant a waiver, the Safety Act required the agency to determine that such waiver *␣*␣* is consistent with the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles.'' 28 F.3d at 1294. The Court found that the agency's ``determination that the waiver program will not adversely affect the safe operation of CMVs is devoid of empirical support in the record,'' 28 F.3d at 1294, and that ``the FHWA has failed to meet the exacting requirements of section 2505(f) (now 49 U.S.C. 31136(e)).'' 28 F.3d at 1294. Consequently, the Court concluded that the FHWA's adoption of the waiver program was contrary to law, and vacated and remanded the rule to the agency.
