Here is a report by Jasenka Dudic and Kreso Zadravec on the statement and the course of the session, which was addressed by Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs: [Dudic] The Geneva declaration is in accordance with fundamental efforts of the international community and the EU action plan, is in line with the essence of President Tudjman's peace initiative, and is a concrete step in its implementation. This is what the Chamber of Counties says, among other things, in its statement. In the statement, the declaration was assessed as a step toward mutual recognition of the two sovereign states, a decisive act for the permanent resolution of the crisis, and a path leading toward a political solution for the temporarily occupied parts of Croatian territories. This is leading toward the final and unconditional incorporation of UN Protected Areas into the Republic of Croatia. The declaration will not only contribute to the normalization of the situation and to relations between the countries that are signatories to it, but also to the beginning of general normalization, which is a precondition for the establishment of the new world order and the promotion of stability and security in the whole of the southeastern part of Europe. An important initial step on that path is the open recognition of all states within their legitimate international borders in accordance with the UN Charter and basic CSCE documents. In the statement, the Chamber of Counties calls on the Bosnian Muslims unconditionally and immediately to halt their offensive actions against Croat-populated areas, particularly in central Bosnia. Otherwise, the Chamber holds that the government and the president of the Republic ought to analyze and reexamine the current situation in diplomatic relations between the Republic of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and, in accordance with the assessment of this situation, take appropriate steps. Alongside the condemnation of all misdeeds, crimes, and acts in contravention of the law on international war and the humanitarian law, in its statement the Chamber of Counties encourages the Croatian Government to do everything in diplomatic, political, humanitarian, and all other areas to secure the continuous presence and the normal life of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The statement was adopted with 38 votes against. A separate statement was adopted by the club of deputies of the Croatian Social and Liberal Party [HSLS], Croatian Peasants' Party, Istrian Democratic Alliance, Social-Democratic Party, and Croatian People's Party. I am sorry that, despite all our efforts, we did not succeed in formulating a joint statement that would be acceptable to the deputies' club of the HSLS, Granic said in his address to the deputies. He explained the important objectives of Croatian foreign policy. These are, first of all, to reintegrate the occupied territories into the state system of the Republic of Croatia, to resolve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina in such a way that the survival and equality of Croats is guaranteed, to have good-neighborly relations with all states, and to integrate Croatia into European and world processes. Granic stressed that the current situation in the occupied territories is untenable, since the Serbs have completed ethnic cleansing and do not respect the human rights of Croats; however, opting to liberate the occupied territories militarily would cause great casualties and, probably, the international isolation of Croatia. This is why Croatia opted for the strategy of negotiation, in order to first establish communication and to resolve humanitarian and other questions, which should eventually bring about a peaceful reintegration of the temporarily occupied territories into the Croatian state system, Granic said. He added: [Begin Granic recording] This path, which includes primarily peacemaking and a peaceful option, does not -- at the end of the day -- exclude any methods of achieving the final goal: the goal of a completely free Republic of Croatia. We shall try to do our utmost, however, to exhaust the peaceful option and to get the international community's support for it. As regards Bosnia-Herzegovina, this means that lasting relations between Croats and Muslims should be established, that all confrontation should stop immediately, and that the Bosnian-Muslim state should develop as a secular state, acceptable to Europe, to its entire environment. Croats should also stay in their areas, with their safety and development guaranteed. [end recording] [passage omitted]
