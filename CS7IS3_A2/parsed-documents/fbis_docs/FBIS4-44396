Unfortunately a number of law enforcement organs, responding to the slogan of "overhauling our thinking, changing our ideas, and serving economic construction" but misinterpreting the policy, behave in a way that departs from the law in doing their job, as epitomized currently by their abuse of power to profit themselves illegally. First of all, they confiscate, collect fees, and impose fines arbitrarily. Taking advantage of their power to manage traffic, public security organs set up checkpoints, stop traffic, impose fines, and confiscate as they please. As managers of the permanent residency registration system, they arbitrarily demand payments, all clearly marked on a price list, from peasants who want to switch from agriculture to a non-agricultural sector and from people who want to transfer their residency registration from one locality to another. As keepers of law and order, they arbitrarily confiscate and impose fines higher than the maximum amounts allowed under the regulations. As investigators of crime, they arbitrarily collect fees and impose fines, masquerading them as "deposits," and replace prison sentences with fines or confiscation, even demanding a "case-solving" fee from the victim or defendant. As managers of prisons and detention centers, they demand from suspects and defendants in custody as well as convicted criminals money to cover meals and collect from them a "management fee." Relatives of convicted criminals who come to visit are told to pay a "visitation management fee." Abusing their power to investigate some cases, to approve and rule on arrests, and to file charges, procuratorial organs substitute a fine for a prison sentence and collect "deposits," "exemption from lawsuit fees," "exemption from lawsuit study fees," and "exemption from lawsuit bang jiao fees" arbitrarily. Taking advantage of their judicial power, judicial organs collect "sentence suspension fees," "sentence suspension study fees," and "sentence suspension bang jiao fees" arbitrarily. Judicial administrative organs in prisons and reform-through-labor facilities even go so far as to allow criminals in custody who have already been sentenced to go out to engage in commercial activities and take a cut of the latter's profits. Second, acting ultra vires or sidestepping the law, some law enforcement organs meddle in economic disputes by collecting fees or demanding debt repayment on behalf of an enterprise. In the name of "serving economic construction," "protecting an enterprise," and bolding searching for a new way to serve economic construction, public security organs and procuratorial organs marshall the human and material resources of their own units to help enterprises with their debt or payment collection efforts in return for some form of compensation known variously as "service fee," "labor fee," "sponsorship fee," and "deduction." Deviating from the judicial principle of not accepting or hearing a case unless charges have been filed, judicial organs collect bad debts on behalf of enterprises through extra-judicial channels. All these activities differ from recovering stolen goods for the victim in a criminal case. They also differ from ruling in or adjudicating civil cases and economic cases in accordance with mandatory civil rules or enforcing mediation agreements. Third, they engage in all manner of revenue-generating activities. Abusing their power, for instance, law enforcement organs collect fees, levy taxes, and impose fines on behalf of other departments in return for appropriate compensation. A few law enforcement organs even use police cars as taxis to make a profit. These days a widely held view among law enforcement workers in the field is that since law-enforcement organs are seriously under-funded when it comes to processing cases, the practices of fining a criminal instead of imposing a prison term and demanding sums from defendants and victims can only strengthen those organs economically and therefore make them better able to handle cases. Fining a defendant, it is also argued, serves the purpose of punishing him. Regarding the practice of collecting debts on behalf of an enterprise, some law-enforcement personnel claim that as a method of solving an economic dispute, the civil lawsuit takes too long. Even if a person wins a case, the verdict is often difficult to enforce. Enterprises turn to law-enforcement organs for help, it is said, because they are leery of getting trapped in litigation. When a law enforcement organ, overstepping its authority or sidestepping the law, succeeds in collecting a debt promptly, it provides production with a powerful safeguard. On the one hand, it wins praise for "protecting an enterprise." On the other hand, it obtains a tangible benefit that would enable it to add new equipment or modernize existing equipment and improve its financial position. It is a case of killing two birds with one stone. What is wrong with that, they ask? To my mind, the above argument is long on trivia but short on major principles. To argue thus is to see the part while overlooking the whole. These people are only concerned about the preservation and aggrandizement of departmental interests while ignoring the preservation of the general interest. Work guided by such thinking will inevitably damage the reputation of state organs and encourage the spread of corruption. First of all, law enforcement organs which abused their office to profit themselves illegally constituted a blot on China's political history. There were two major chronic ills in China's political history. One was autocratic politics, which had its origins in the Qin Dynasty. Calling himself the First Emperor, its founder thought he embodied the moral virtues of the Three Emperors and considered his achievements greater than those of the Five Emperors. He unified the whole country and made China his personal possession. Although the dynasty he founded did not pass from one generation to the next endlessly, contrary to what he had hoped, the autocratic system he put in place lasted with no interruption to become a terminal disease in our feudal history. The other was bureaucratic politics. It too had an impressive list of symptoms. Economically, bureaucratic politics manifested itself as abusing one's power to profit oneself. One way to do this was to create a state-run economy. Another was to extort excessive taxes and levies by virtue of one's power. [passage omitted] Third, when law enforcement organs abuse their authority to enrich themselves illegally, they in effect connive at criminal conduct and hurt legal construction. Lax law enforcement is an outstanding problem these days. One of its causes is the phenomenon of law enforcement organs making money illegally. Consider : 1) Public security organs demand a "case solving fee" from victims. Only after they are paid would they agree to return the stolen goods or economic damages. Since victims are made to suffer two times over, they often balk at reporting a crime. The result is a serious crime under-reporting problem. 2) The practice of demanding a fine instead of imposing a prison term has given rise to a de facto system of bribing one's way out of jail. In handling some cases, law enforcement organs take the mediation route. After paying the victim a specified sum, they make him drop the charges regardless of the interest of the state in prosecuting the case. The upshot is a new way of handling cases in which a criminal who pays a fine will not be physically punished or can buy his way out of prison. Criminals get off easily. 3) In collecting debts, law enforcement organs content themselves with the recovery of properties. Even when they discover criminal activities, they ask no questions, let alone handing over the case promptly to the agency with the proper jurisdiction so that the latter can investigate it in accordance with the law. Consequently, criminals escape scot-free and remain beyond the reach of the law. This deals a heavy blow to the authority and dignity of the law, in addition to preventing the elimination of adverse factors in the economic climate, which in turn militates against healthy economic development. 4) When a law enforcement organ devotes a substantial portion of its human and material resources to collecting debts and other sums, normal case-solving is affected, resulting in half-hearted law enforcement. Without exception all these circumstances are a byproduct of law enforcement organs trying to line their pockets illegally. At a time when the market economy needs the protection of the law, they disrupt the legal system and undermine the concept of the rule of law. The danger is obvious. Fourth, it is corruption itself for law enforcement organs to profit themselves illegally by abusing their power. In so doing they seriously damage the image of law enforcement organs in the public eye. When law enforcement organs abuse their office and collect fines and fees arbitrarily under all sorts of pretexts, they are behaving in a way that runs counter to the honesty and incorruptibility long advocated by our party. This situation has aroused the concern of people of insight as well as the anger of the masses and severely damaged the image of law enforcement organs in the public mind. When law enforcement organs demand case-solving fees from victims or meddle in economic affairs with hopes of taking a cut, when they help enterprises or individuals collect unpaid debts, they are in effect behaving like for-hire social service organizations such as private-investigation companies or debt-collection outfits, projecting an image far from appropriate for law enforcement organs. Once state organs preoccupy themselves with money-making, they lose the incorruptibility indispensable to operating impartially. Practice also proves that the inevitable result of such conduct is more and more people bending the law for personal gains. In collecting unpaid debts, moreover, some law enforcement organs misuse their coercive state power to, for instance, take a person into custody. This practice seriously tarnishes the reputation of state organs. [passage omitted]
