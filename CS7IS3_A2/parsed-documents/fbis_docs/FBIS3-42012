Its new version was suggested by Russian scientists. Academician and Nobel prize winner Nikolay Basov, who heads the development project, told ITAR-TASS that ``the new reactor is a hybrid model, because it incorporates both nuclear and thermonuclear sub-systems.'' ``Time has forced us to make use of this `combination'. Russia has accumulated large stockpiles of uranium and plutonium as a result of disarmament and curtailed research in the sphere of nuclear energetics. They can be successfully used in the new reactor,'' Basov stated. A laser will play the role of a high-intensity neutron source in the new reactor. The results of the already staged experiments speak in favour of this type of a hybrid nuclear-thermonuclear reactor.
