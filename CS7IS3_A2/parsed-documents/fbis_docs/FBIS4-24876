The report by TA KUNG PAO, which is supported financially by Beijing, attracted keen attention since it is the first detailed mentioning by a daily widely reputed to be a "virtual Chinese official paper" of China's possible joining in U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang. In a six-column article titled "Situation on Korean Peninsula Becomes Tense Again," the newspaper said, "If the United Nations decides to impose economic sanctions, China will stop supplying food and oil to North Korea together with border trade involving all other commodity goods." The newspaper pointed out that, upon a U.N. decision in favor of economic sanctions, the United States will undertake a naval blockade of North Korea while Tokyo stops remittances by pro-communist Koreans in Japan. "North Korea cannot cope with such extensive economic sanctions by China, America and Japan," warned the newspaper. Urging North Korea to accept outside nuclear inspection, the paper said this would help clear up international suspicions over Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions and improve North Korea's relations with South Korea, the United States and Japan. North Korea's devastated economy cannot bear any massive war expenses, the paper explained. Should it become engaged in war, its domestic economy would worsen and therefore it should refrain from provoking South Korea. Should war break out on the Korean peninsula, Russia would not support North Korea as the Pyongyang-Moscow friendship treaty is to be scrapped in two years, the paper said. South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who is currently visiting Russia, had a series of discussion on the nuclear issue when he met with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, it noted. However, TA KUNG PAO urged South Korea, the United States and Japan to negotiate with Pyongyang and hold off on the much-talked-about threat of sanctions. A Hong kong-based expert on China said the newspaper's report deserves special attention in that it appeared at a time when U.N. sanctions against North Korea are imminent. The newspaper previously reported that China was persuading North Korea to solve the nuclear problem.
