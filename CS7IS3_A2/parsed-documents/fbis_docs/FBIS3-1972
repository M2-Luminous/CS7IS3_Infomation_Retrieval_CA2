Hainan Island is the country's largest special economic zone. The outline of reform was announced yesterday by Governor Ruan Chongwu to deputies attending the second session of the first provincial people's congress. In his report of governmental work, the governor demanded that a manager responsibility system with a board of directors as the supreme authority should operate in all enterprises, and that all enterprises should be freed of subordination to administrative bodies. While promising enterprises full freedom in employment matters, the governor also pledged that workers would be given more freedom in changing jobs between enterprises of different ownership or in different places. In his report, the governor said the province would seek to reform its allocating method of import and export quotas and licences, hinting that a tendering system might be established. The province will also seek to attract more overseas investment in improving its tourist and agricultural infrastructures, and in developing its rich tropical agricultural resources and ocean resources, the governor said. According to the governor, the province will further develop its insurance service in pensions, industrial accidents, unemployment and medicine. Besides employees of enterprises, the report said, such insurance networks would be extended this year to employees of government bodies and self-employed people. In relatively rich villages, a medical insurance system that aims to cover farmers against risks of serious diseases would be established on an experiment scale, the report said. Seeking to further improve the province's infrastructure in 1994, Hainan will invest seven billion yuan (805 million U.S. dollars) in 24 key projects, including an international airport in Sanya city, an expressway running along the east side of the island, an airport for the provincial capital, and three power plants. By all these means, the governor said, the province aims to produce a GDP [gross domestic product] value of 27 billion yuan (3.1 billion U.S. dollars) in 1994, which would be 18 percent higher than in 1993.
