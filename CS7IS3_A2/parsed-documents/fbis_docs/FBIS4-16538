Kozyrev wished allied aircraft had refrained from bombing Serb positions near Gorazde pending consultations with Moscow. He said Russia and NATO had agreed to launch special, gentlemanly, relations on the basis of a more or less standard pilot document. According to Kozyrev, Russia wanted more than the end of hostile relations with NATO. It wanted NATO to either learn to promote full-scale cooperation with Russia or set thought on integration into a mechanism that would be suited to meet new reality. He wanted NATO to treat Russia as a great power. And, Kozyrev would want Russia and NATO to promote more serious and constructive relations in addition to signing a pilot document of limited importance.
