FR940617-0-00019 FR940617-0-00004 The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are about 300 California nectarine and peach handlers subject to regulation under the orders covering nectarines and peaches grown in California, and about 1,800 producers of these fruits in California. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. The Nectarine Administrative Committee (NAC) recommended that the pack requirements for volume-filled containers of California nectarines be revised, and the Peach Commodity Committee (PCC) recommended that the pack requirements for volume-filled containers of California peaches be revised. These committees meet prior to and during each season to review the rules and regulations effective on a continuous basis for California nectarines and peaches under the orders. These committee meetings are open to the public, and interested persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations and information, as well as information from other sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or termination of the rules and regulations would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Section 916.350 (7 CFR 916.350, as amended at 59 FR 15838) specifies container and pack requirements for fresh nectarine shipments. Paragraph (a)(1) of §916.350 specifies that nectarines in any closed package or container, except master containers of consumer packages and individual consumer packages, shall be packed in accordance with ``standard pack''. ``Standard pack'' is defined in paragraph (b) of §916.350 as having the same meaning as set forth in the United States Standards for Grades of Nectarines (7 CFR 51.3145 through 51.3160). Under the definition of ``standard pack'', nectarines packed in certain containers must be tightly packed and the containers must be ``well filled''. ``Well filled'' means that the container is properly filled, allowing no movement of its contents, and the container should have its contents in firm contact with the cover. This rule revises §916.350 by adding a new proviso to paragraph (a)(1) specifying that the nectarines in any such container need only be filled to within one inch of the top of the container. This rule also removes the proviso in paragraph (a)(1) of §916.350 reading ``That nectarines in any container shall be fairly uniform in size'', because such requirements are included within the definition of ``standard pack'' in the United States Standards for Grades of Nectarines, and therefore are not needed in this paragraph. Section 917.442 (7 CFR 917.442, as amended at 59 FR 15840) specifies container and pack requirements for fresh peach shipments. Paragraph (a)(1) of §917.442 specifies that peaches in any closed package or container, except master containers of consumer packages and individual consumer packages, shall be packed in certain containers in accordance with ``standard pack''. ``Standard pack'' is defined in paragraph (b) of §917.442 as having the same meaning as set forth in the United States Standards for Grades of Peaches (7 CFR 51.1210 through 51.1223). Under the definition of ``standard pack'', peaches in certain containers must be tightly packed and the containers must be ``well filled''. ``Well filled'' means that the level of the fruit must be slightly higher than the top edge of the container and the peaches are held firmly in place. This rule revises §917.442 by adding a new proviso to paragraph (a)(1) specifying that the peaches in any such container need only be filled to within one inch of the top of the container. The NAC and PCC recommended these revised pack requirements for fresh nectarines and peaches in volume-filled containers after a comprehensive review of changes in the nectarine and peach industry packing practices over the years, and the need to make appropriate changes in the pack requirements. When the pack requirements were established, most containers were of a place-pack or a tray-pack type, but at the present time substantial quantities of nectarines and peaches are shipped in volume-filled containers throughout the entire range of sizes packed. This revision will provide handlers with more flexibility in selecting the appropriate size container for certain volume-filled packs without potential bruise damage to the fruit. Under current packing conditions, nectarines and peaches of certain varieties and sizes are sometimes bruised when packed in accordance with ``standard pack'', because the fruit extends above the top of the container and is damaged when the lid is attached. There are a combination of factors contributing to this situation, including: (1) Handlers must pack a specific quantity of fruit, in terms of minimum weight, in certain containers, and some handlers prefer to pack precisely this quantity in each such container; (2) the volume of fruit packed in a particular container varies depending on the variety and size of fruit for a given pack weight; (3) handlers maintain a limited number of different size containers in inventory; and (4) handlers pack most of their fruit at the well matured stage of maturity, and such fruit is susceptible to bruising when packed too tight. This revision will enable handlers to pack their nectarines and peaches with up to one inch space between the top of the fruit and the top of the container, and result in less bruising of the fruit due to excessively tight packs.
