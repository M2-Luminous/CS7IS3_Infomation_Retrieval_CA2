Speaking at a press conference on his return from Luxembourg, Kravchuk declared that a referendum would actually take place in Ukraine on 26 June. "If the people come to elect the president they will actually give their backing to the presidential-parliamentary form of the state system," he believes. Kravchuk underlined that in the course of the 26 June elections the president would be elected in accordance with the acting Constitution--both as the head of the state and the head of the executive power. In this case, he emphasized, in the future the legislature should be brought in line with this provision. "If the Supreme Soviet refuses to do this then a confrontation will be inevitable," declared Kravchuk, who running for the presidency for the second term. On Tuesday [14 June], Ukraine's Supreme Soviet declined amendments to the decree on the formation of local self-management bodies which stipulates that heads of local councils should be subordinated to the president. The present law preserves their subordination to the government and to the council standing above them. According to observers, this will lead to a sharp restriction of the president's influence in domestic policy. "Somebody wants to make these elections into a farce," said Kravchuk. He said that "at first the deputies voted for nationwide elections of the president" and then started to restrict his authorities. Kravchuk was also critical of the position of communists in the parliament who speak about the need to abolish the presidency in the Republic. He called their actions "a strategy" which is intended "to bar movement forward."
