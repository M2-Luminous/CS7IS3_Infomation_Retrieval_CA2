Montanelli has decided to leave IL GIORNALE, which he founded 20 years ago, to try his fortune with LA VOCE -- a glorious title created in 1903 by Giovanni Prezzolini, another "anarcho-conservative" like himself. "The rift between Berlusconi and me remains irremediable," Montanelli told the editorial board. He added: "Berlusconi has neither the courage nor the strength to dismiss me, so I will decide when to leave." The immediate response from Fininvest's president was: "I rule out the possibility that the Montanelli that I know could have made any such remarks." Soothing Remarks Be that as it may, the team for the new paper -- which will probably be based in via Manzoni, in the very center of Milan -- is ready, or almost. The art director will be Vittorio Corona, another escapee from the Fininvest group, former domestic news desk chief on Italia 1 and before that editor of KING, the lively monthly owned by RAI [Italian State Radio and Television] publications. Head of publicity will be Luigi Guastamacchia, long head of the SPI [Italian Advertising Association] agency (though negotiations are also under way with Publikompass). In any case, its official presentation is now imminent: It will take place 14 January at Rome's Ambasciatori Hotel. Yesterday was a long day for Montanelli. His rapid luncheon (at which the main course was tagliatelle) with Silvio Berlusconi at the latter's Milan apartment on via Rovani, cannot have been the best part of it. This is confirmed by the fact that the meeting did not take place at Berlusconi's mansion house at Arcore. Montanelli's dislike of courts and courtiers is well known. Berlusconi's strained expression after the meeting was more eloquent than his soothing remarks. "Of course Montanelli is not leaving," he told journalists. "I think we could say that there has been a lot of fuss about nothing." But the prince of journalists himself made no statements. Inevitably. Despite Berlusconi's forced optimism, the meeting was apparently rather stormy. This, partly because Montanelli is someone who loves making vitriolic remarks. According to certain disclosures, Berlusconi apparently began by asking Montanelli to stay on as editor of IL GIORNALE until the elections. This, as a sacrifice for the sake of the conservative alignment on whose behalf Berlusconi is working. Montanelli apparently did not reply directly. But he did criticize him harshly for having attended IL GIORNALE's editorial board meeting a couple of days ago. This move was regarded as an attack on his prerogatives as editor. But above all it was a gaffe that follows the criticisms leveled by editor of Television Channel 4 news, Emilio Fede, speaking on the Fininvest network. The remarks, as reported by Montanelli to IL GIORNALE's editorial board yesterday afternoon, sound like a slap in the face to Berlusconi: "It was wrong of you to come to the meeting here yesterday," Montanelli told Berlusconi. "This, first because you gave to understand that the Mammi law can be circumvented; and, second, because you split the editorial board by making it understood that whoever sides with you will have money, while those who side with me with have their independence."
