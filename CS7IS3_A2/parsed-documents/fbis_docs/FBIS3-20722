But then Miodrag Djeric emerged. His son Srdjan is one of two soldiers who, according to the official version delivered to the parents, died in the garrison in Subotica last May, which VREME wrote about in its last issue. There was no press release about that event, and Gen. Perisic skipped over it when he addressed the public. On Tuesday, 18 January, POLITIKA published an obituary of Goran Galjak, a captain in the Army of Yugoslavia in the special forces who "was killed by enemy bullets on 27 December 1993." Officially, the Army of Yugoslavia never published a word about his having been killed. Unofficially, a story emerged in public about how Captain Galjak was killed in Bosnia (near Vogosca), and he was not alone. According to certain sources close to the Army of Yugoslavia, two days before Perisic was to be a guest on the TV news program and skip over stories of this kind, three other members of the special forces from here were killed near Vogosca, and three were missing. Other sources give other figures on the number killed (10 dead members of the Army of Yugoslavia), but the essence is the same--Capt. Goran Galjak and his comrades were killed in Bosnia. The Legal Cover Aside from the general's forgetfulness and the absence of official press releases, there are two other facts that link the cases of Srdjan Djeric and Capt. Galjak. The first is that for months some people from the Srpska republic have been trying to convince Miodrag Djeric that his son is alive, that he fought on the other side of the Yugoslav border, was captured and then exchanged, and that he would soon return home. The other is much simpler. In both cases, the Army of Yugoslavia made a mess of it without having any very important need to do so. There is a simple and effective legal cover for all the officers and men of the Army of Yugoslavia fighting in Bosnia. It is sufficient for them to be recorded in their own units as men who are, say, on annual vacation or on leave. The fact that during the 10 or 15 days they are officially absent they are on the battlefield as volunteers of the Army of the Srpska republic need not interest the Army of Yugoslavia at all, and, still more important, this allows it, again officially, to remain uninvolved in the events on Bosnian soil. Although they have been nicely disguised, these absences are concealed in every possible way. An officer of the Army of Yugoslavia wounded in Bosnia says that he went to the battlefield voluntarily, that mainly regular army officers are involved where things are not going well, so that even closest relatives are not notified of the absences. In case of death, everything is reported as a "traffic accident." Our informant says that the thing in all of this that pains him the most is the phrase in obituaries--"killed in a traffic accident." "When I know they died a hero's death." The answer to the question of why so much secrecy if the story is officially legal might be found in the fact that the Army of Yugoslavia has usually been involved in the thick of things, so that probably there has not even been time for all the necessary preparations. According to VREME's informants, that is why sometimes people go to the battlefield in uniforms of the Army of Yugoslavia with all the relevant insignia, even with the little metal canister around their neck with the soldier's name, rank, military specialty, and all other information written on waterproof paper. The extent of this identification of its people becomes a problem for the Army of Yugoslavia only if one of them is captured. If he is killed, the body is extricated, and all the rest has already been described: a traffic accident, except in cases when the relatives obviously know what is going on, and the obituaries mention enemy bullets and defense of the Serbian cause. What is certainly not to the Army's credit is the fact that even then, when everything is already out in the open (but nevertheless can remain "covered"), even his own unit never publishes an obituary of the person killed. Official Papers The Army displayed a still greater unprofessionalism, ineptness, and carelessness in the case of Srdjan Djeric. And it did so from the very outset if we assume the official version of the entire event to be accurate. (When the VREME reporter was in Subotica, people in Djevdjelijska Street, which runs along the perimeter of the exercise ground of the garrison there, told him that they remembered a thick column of smoke far inside the exercise ground and the military ambulances that quickly arrived.) According to the official version, Private Srdjan Djeric and four of his comrades (none of them had at the time been in the Army more than 40 days) were in an armored combat vehicle [BOV] containing two Malyutkas, four Zoljas, 400 rounds for the 20-mm cannon, and 2,000 rounds for the 7.62-mm PKT machine gun. One of the soldiers (Sasa Boskovic, who later succumbed to his injuries) took the Zolja and caused the accident. The Army, of course, never explained either to Srdjan's father or to anyone else what the BOV fully equipped for combat was doing on a training ground, nor what five young soldiers were doing in such a vehicle when not a single officer was present. The official papers say that on that day the Army had no combat alert whatsoever, but the instruction being given on the training ground was in tactical training referred to as "Operation of a Mechanized Squad in Preparation for March and Combat." Anyone who has been in the army knows that that exercise (and all others) is done without live ammunition. Nor does it sound very likely, as is stated in the "official record of the event," that at the moment when everything occurred Srdjan Djeric was actually showing his four comrades the vehicle's steering controls and interior. The holes in the official communication might have been filled if the Army had admitted that at the time of the accident soldiers of the Srpska republic and the Serbian Republic Krajina were also training in the Subotica Garrison. One soldier whom the VREME reporter came upon in Subotica during his visit to that city said that they (soldiers from the western Serbian areas) have not been there for at least the last three months (since November), but that they had been and that they were excellent comrades. Certain other informants of VREME, military personnel, explain that the training of these soldiers is considerably shorter and is frequently done with live ammunition. In other words, Srdjan Djeric might have been on the training ground at the same time as his comrades from the krajinas. What in fact should not have happened is for the officers to be training him in the same way (with live ammunition), and still less not to be with him and his comrades in a combat-ready BOV. Strange Disappearances The likelihood that all of this did nevertheless occur and that the Army simply wanted to cover up its own lapses seems much more likely than the possibility of someone having taken Srdjan to Bosnia from the garrison, or his having himself volunteered for some similar mission. A soldier who was our reporter's informant in Subotica rejects the second possibility and even says that "his people (the Army of Yugoslavia) would never have let him cross the Drina." There are certain other details that also indicate a foolish cover-up. First of all, it seems that most of those involved in the entire case are no longer in the Subotica Garrison. The guards at the gate of the 1st Garrison in Subotica have not seen Capt. Milovan Kukolj, Djeric's commanding officer, pass through the gate for a long time now. Another officer, Capt. Vekic, "is somewhere in the field." A third officer, Major Radoslav Petrovic, is unable to state the whereabouts of the Privates Zoran Jovanovic, Davor Dralic, and Radomir Ilic, who according to the official documents were in the BOV at the time of the accident, nor the whereabouts of Sergeant Zoran Matovic, who marched the soldiers to the exercise ground. (Unofficially, Kukolj and Matovic are under investigation.) In addition to all that, Maj. Petrovic even says that Srdjan Djeric was one of the best soldiers, while the unfortunate Sasa Boskovic, who fired the Zolja, "was immature." Presumably, he is thereby the only one to blame, case closed. All that is left is for people to swallow the whole story. Unfortunately, the Army was unable to make this one wrong move and leave it at that. It went on to make another. The coffin which came to the house of Miodrag Djeric contained a body that did not correspond at all to the findings of the autopsy at the Military Medical Academy. Miodrag opened the grave, compared photographs and the findings with what he found, and held his head in both hands. In short, according to the findings of the autopsy, Srdjan Djeric's body was almost entirely charred (and Maj. Petrovic is unhesitating to the effect that "he saw with his own eyes--the body was burned and very little of it could be recognized"). Also, to be brief, the body which Miodrag Djeric dug up was not burned at all and possessed everything that did not exist in the autopsy findings--ribs, backbone, lungs, heart, internal organs, stomach.... Ruzica Also Disappeared When he made this discovery, Miodrag Djeric wrote up a request for exhumation and has received no reply to this day. This kind of behavior on the part of military authorities would be very strange on the assumption that they are convinced that the assertions of Miodrag Djeric and five other witnesses who were present when the grave was opened and the comparison was made to the photographs from the autopsy are inaccurate. If they wanted to prove that people under stress saw something other than what was actually in that grave, they could have no easier way than exhumation. But if there has been a mistake (an accidental substitution of bodies at the Military Medical Academy), the case becomes more complicated, because an extra corpse has turned up in the whole story. From what training ground or battlefield did it reach the Military Medical Academy? That question would probably begin an altogether new tale. That, of course, should never have been grounds for not explaining to Miodrag Djeric in the calmest way, long before he came to the editors of VREME with his story, that what had happened was yet another stupid mistake, and for not thereupon sending him his son's body. As though someone really wanted complications, and so they gave Miodrag his son's military record, in which there is no entry at all that he was killed. And they sent him two death notices. And summons to a trial in which Srdjan Djeric was supposed to appear in court as an injured party. And in all of this there emerges the mysterious Mrs. Ruzica Milanovic (VREME's reporters tried to find her in Mladenovac, but absolutely without success--she literally vanished), with her story about Miodrag's son being alive, and when the father asked that someone check it out, they told him in the police that they could not, because she "is not an unimportant person." And then they confirmed to Miodrag in the General Staff of the Army of Yugoslavia itself that our soldiers are going to Bosnia. And.... Officials of the Army of Yugoslavia have promised that next week they will arrange a meeting of VREME newsmen with the people who worked on the case of Srdjan Djeric. Until then, the most accurate definition of everything that has happened to Miodrag Djeric and his son was furnished by Vukosava Bogisic, the records clerk in the Subotica records office, whom a VREME reporter asked about technical aspects of issuing death certificates. When she heard about the double death certificate, she departed from the context of explaining the technique of reporting a case of death, and said: "When the war stops, we will see who is alive and who is dead."
