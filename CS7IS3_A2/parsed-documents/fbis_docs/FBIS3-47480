FBIS3-47480 "dreas009_a_94016" FBIS-EAS-94-009 Document Type:Daily Report 13 January 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Government Fixes Price of Imported Rice OW1301132194 Tokyo KYODO in English 1223 GMT 13 Jan 94 OW1301132194 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- The Rice Price Council on Thursday [13 January] approved a Farm Ministry plan to set the government selling prices of imported table-use rice at 60 to 84 percent of the average selling price of standard Japanese rice, ministry officials said. The approval came when the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry briefed the government advisory council on the plan at an informal council meeting, the officials said. They said the ministry is likely to make an official decision next week on the prices of imported rice, which is scheduled to go on sale nationwide in Japan next month. The imported rice will be blended with Japanese rice for sale to consumers. Japan is importing rice on an emergency basis due to a bad crop in 1993. The prices will be based on two categories of rice -- long-grain and short- or medium-grain -- and on the country of origin, the officials said. Among the imports, rice from the United States and top-grade rice from China, both short- or medium-grain, will be sold for 16,898 yen per 60 kilograms, 84 percent of the average selling price of standard Japanese rice. Long-grain non-glutinous rice from Thailand will be sold for 11,992 yen per 60 kilograms, 60 percent of the Japanese rice price. Major supermarket chains, meanwhile, have started studying plans for selling imported rice to consumers. Daiei Inc. said it plans to sell blends of imported and domestic rice and expects to eventually replace 100 percent top-grade domestic rice with blended rice. Daiei officials said 100 percent imported rice is likely to be sold at prices 30 to 50 percent lower than domestic rice. Ito-Yokado Co. said it plans to test-market imported rice at limited outlets, beginning in February. Restaurant chain Skylark Co. declined comment on the possibility of cutting menu prices by using imported rice. Frozen food manufacturer Nichirei Inc. also declined comment on possible price cuts for its products through the use of imported rice. The company last year raised its prices for frozen rice-based foods.
