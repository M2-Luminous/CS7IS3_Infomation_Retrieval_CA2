Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Eijiro Hata told reporters no such raise is being considered to deal with the scheduled conversion of nontariff barriers into tariffs for milk imports as agreed on at the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks in December. A ministry advisory panel, the Livestock Industry Promotion Council, is expected to decide next month on the price for the year beginning April 1. Farmers' organizations are calling for a raise in the price they receive for milk, currently 76.75 yen per kilogram, in the face of expected competition with imports.
