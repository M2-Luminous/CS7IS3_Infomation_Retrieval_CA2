On Saturday night [12 March], he issued invitations to Marian Krzaklewski (Solidarity), Ewa Spychalska (All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ]), Marian Jurczyk (Solidarity '80), and Jan Kisielinski (Polish Miners' Trade Union). Yesterday, members of the National Protest Headquarters met in Katowice in order to make a decision on what Solidarity's action should consist of and to take a stand on the prime minister's proposal. Deputy Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said after Saturday's meeting of the Council of Minister's Economic Committee and the Council of Minister's Social and Political Committee: "We were pondering the phenomenon of the situation where both the government and Solidarity are declaring their willingness to conduct talks, but still, such talks are not taking place. And that is why we came to the conclusion that it would be a useful thing if a representative of the government, who would be of a high rank appropriate for that or even of the highest rank, could talk to a representative of the Solidarity trade union, who would have been given sufficient powers, and the purpose of the meeting would be to determine what kind of procedural obstacles are preventing a meeting from taking place." When asked about whether the government intends to conduct separate negotiations with Solidarity, Cimoszewicz replied: "Substantive negotiations aimed at arriving at mutually agreed conclusions must be taking place with all trade unions, just the way Solidarity wanted it to be when it initiated the idea of establishing a Trilateral Commission." Addressing an accusation by the General Administration of State Railroads that the railroad strike was illegal, the prime minister admitted that "procedures required by the law make it practically impossible to organize a legal strike." Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski says that the prime minister's proposal is a "kind of opening up, but it also has flaws." According to the chairman, because it is Solidarity that is involved in collective bargaining with the government, the trade union should sign an agreement on its own behalf. Solidarity's National Protest Headquarters, which held a session on Sunday [13 March], accepted an invitation to talks issued by Prime Minister Pawlak, but the trade union does not regard the talks as a formal initiation of negotiations. Because the government has so far failed to reply to the trade union's demands, which were submitted in mid-February, the trade union's protest action will continue: Protests in Wroclaw, Opole, and Walbrzych have been announced for Monday, strikes in several plants of the Bydgoszcz Region have been announced for Tuesday, and, beginning Thursday (in connection with the initiation of proceedings regarding a new law on popiwek [tax on excessive salary increases] ), picketing in front of the Sejm building will begin. But, for the moment, Solidarity has given up a combination of the protests and a "major blow," which had been planned before. Krzaklewski did not reveal the amount of financial resources collected for a strike fund because that information is secret. He announced that Solidarity will initiate more collective bargaining, dealing with the government's failure to implement the "Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises" over the past year. According to OPZZ Deputy Chairman Waclaw Martyniuk, given the "current tension and the general situation," the prime minister's meeting with trade unions' chiefs is a logical thing. In his view, the talks will concern the "establishment of the Trilateral Commission." Marian Jurczyk will respond to the prime minister's invitation. For the chairman of "Solidarity '80," "economic revival is a fundamental issue. Jan Kisielinski would first of all like to discuss problems faced by the mining industry (including his alternative proposal to the program of restructuring the mining industry), and also issues associated with the Silesia region.
