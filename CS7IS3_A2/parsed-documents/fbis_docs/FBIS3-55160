Nobody can protest against that. We are striving for stability and security and this causes neither danger nor humiliation for anybody. I also see that Lithuania's wish to become a member of NATO and its request do not contradict the agreement on Partnership For Peace. But the agreement on partnership will not serve as a substitute for conditions which should be fulfilled by Lithuania in order to become a member of NATO. This complies with the agreement on European security initiated by France and maintained by European Union. It is very important that the process of peace and European consolidation in the Baltic region should not be disturbed by any non-democratic imperialistic forces".
