Zhu made the request during a 30-minute meeting with International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai. Kumagai said China must do more on environmental issues if the government is to receive full public understanding on aid to China. Zhu promised that projects to be financed by Japan's yen loan program will contain measures designed to address China's environmental conditions. Chinese companies failing to meet environmental standards would not be allowed to take part in yen loan projects, Zhu said. Kumagai called for Beijing's efforts to narrow the industrial gap between inland and coastal areas. Zhu replied that Beijing will formulate ways to upgrade its traffic system in the inland area while doing its utmost to create new industries there, taking advantage of abundant natural resources. Kumagai voiced hope that Japan's yen loan and other economic assistance will help promote industrial restructuring in China.
