(i) If more than 5 percent of an insured loan made prior to November 1, 1993, or of a municipal rate loan is terminated or rescinded, the amount of supplemental financing required in the borrower's next loan after the rescission for which supplemental financing is required, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, will be adjusted to average the actual supplemental financing portion on the terminated or rescinded loan with the supplemental financing portion that would have been required on the new loan according to paragraphs (c) (1) and (2), in accordance with the formulas set forth in paragraphs (c)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this section. (ii) If a borrower's supplemental financing requirement as set forth in paragraphs (a), (c)(1), and (c)(2) of this section has not changed between the most recent loan and the loan being considered, then the amount of supplemental financing required for the new loan will be computed as follows: Supplemental financing amount, new loan = [(A + B) x C] ^ D where: A = The total funds ($) actually advanced from the first loan, including both REA loan funds and funds from the supplemental loan, plus any unadvanced funds still available to the borrower after the rescission. B = The total amount ($) for facilities of the new loan request, including both REA loan funds and funds from supplemental loans. C = The proportion (%) of supplemental financing required on the loans according to paragraphs (a), (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. D = The amount ($) of supplemental funds actually advanced on the first loan, plus any unadvanced supplemental funds still available to the borrower after the rescission. (iii) If a borrower's supplemental financing requirement as set forth in paragraphs (a), (c)(1), and (c)(2) of this section has changed between the most recent loan and the loan being considered, then the amount of supplemental financing required for the new loan will be the weighted average of the portions otherwise applicable on the two loans and will be computed as follows: Supplemental financing amount, new loan = (A x C 1 ) + (B x C 2 ) ^ D where: A = The total funds ($) actually advanced from the first loan, including both REA loan funds and funds from the supplemental loan, plus any unadvanced funds still available to the borrower after the rescission. B = The total amount ($) for facilities of the new loan request, including both REA funds and funds from supplemental loans. C 1 = The proportion (%) of supplemental financing required on the old loan according to paragraphs (a), (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. C 2 = The proportion (%) of supplemental financing required on the new loan according to paragraphs (a), (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. D = The amount ($) of supplemental funds actually advanced on the first loan, plus any unadvanced supplemental funds still available to the borrower after the rescission. * * * * * 5.
