FR940404-1-00042 FR940404-1-00018 The rules proposed below accordingly would establish a third income eligibility level (Category C) for nursing home services only. See, proposed ยง124.505(a)(2)(iii). Category C individuals would be those individuals whose annual incomes are greater than two times, but do not exceed three times, the poverty level. The regulations already define which facilities are ``nursing homes'' within the scope of the regulation. See, ยง124.502(h). HHS has considered, but rejected, even higher income eligibility limits. The higher that income eligibility limits are raised, the farther the program gets from targeting services to persons unable to pay. On the other hand, given the usual cost of nursing home care, it is apparent that individuals in need of such care are still unable to pay for the cost of that care, even if they have annual incomes of three times the poverty level. Thus, HHS believes that the proposed regulation represents a reasonable approach to reducing compliance problems for nursing homes and retaining the program's traditional focus on persons unable to pay. While HHS recognizes that this proposal on its face does not resolve all nursing home compliance problems, it also does not expect the proposed change to operate in a vacuum. Rather, HHS currently has under consideration another compliance alternative, published in the Federal Register on November 4, 1993, as a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, designed in part to help alleviate the compliance problems of certain private, nonprofit nursing homes. The proposed compliance alternative would exempt qualifying facilities from the procedural requirements of the general regulations. Qualifying facilities are those private, nonprofit facilities that either receive substantial philanthropic support and provide free or reduced cost services, or do not collect monies directly from persons unable to pay. The combination of these two proposed rules should allow all of the 287 Hill-Burton obligated nursing homes to satisfy their uncompensated services obligations and reduce their uncompensated services deficits more easily. In light of this, it appears prudent to minimize the change in the underlying program until it is seen what effect the two program alterations currently under consideration have in resolving the compliance problems of nursing homes. The rules proposed below also set out technical and conforming amendments to other sections. The only one of note is proposed ยง124.506(a)(1)(v). That section would provide that if a nursing home provides services on a reduced charge basis to both Category B and Category C individuals, it may not employ a discount method that gives Category C individuals greater discounts than those given to Category B individuals. This policy is simply a logical extension of a similar policy that already exists with respect to Category A and Category B individuals. The Secretary solicits comments on the viability and advisability of the above proposal. If there are suggestions for alternative approaches to addressing the problems of nursing home compliance, the Secretary is interested in receiving those as well. Economic Impact Executive Order 12866 requires that all regulations reflect consideration of alternatives, of costs, of benefits, of incentives, of equity, and of available information. Regulations must meet certain standards, such as avoiding unnecessary burden. Regulations which are ``significant'' because of cost, adverse effects on the economy, inconsistency with other agency actions, effects on the budget, or novel legal or policy issues, require special analysis. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that we analyze regulatory proposals to determine whether they create a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities (for purposes of the Act, all nursing home are categorized by HHS as small entities). The Department believes that the proposed rule change in this regulation is beneficial. This regulation does not have an impact that exceeds $100 million for nursing homes. While it will allow nursing homes to qualify more individuals for uncompensated services and thus reduce facility deficits, it will not alter existing procedural and reporting requirements for obligated facilities. For these reasons, we do not believe this rule necessitates an economic analysis. Therefore, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Secretary certifies that this regulation will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Pursuant to Executive Order 12866, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has reviewed this rule. The Department requests comments on whether there are any aspects of this proposed rule which can be improved to make nursing home compliance more effective, more equitable, or less costly. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 This proposed rule contains no information collection or reporting requirements which are subject to review by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Although this rule discusses the requirement for developing and submitting affirmative action plans, the requirement is not new and has been previously approved under OMB control number 0915&hyph;0077.
