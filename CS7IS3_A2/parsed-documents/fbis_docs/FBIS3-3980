Pentagon Spokesman Dennis Boxx told a news briefing that there are currently 219 military personnel in Mogadishu awaiting transportation and 496 in transit. "Once the last troops are gone," Boxx said, "the 1,328 Navy and Marine Corps personnel ashore from the Inchon Amphibious Ready Group will load back on the ships" and will depart the area. Boxx said, "That will leave about 50 Marines behind as security for the U.S. liaison office and about 13 service members as logistics and contract support advisers to the UNOSOM II commander." 549 other American military personnel operating elsewhere in the region in support of the Somali operation are scheduled to depart by the end of this month, the spokesman also said. A welcome home ceremony will be held at Andrews Air Force Base on March 28 and that "marks the completion of the withdrawal and the exit of U.S. forces peacekeeping duties in Somalia," Boxx said.
