"It's certainly the case that Japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons but has not made them," KYODO quoted Hata as telling Japanese reporters inside the Diet (parliament) building. He said Japan has abstained from doing so in line with its obligations as a non-nuclear state under the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), KYODO said. Hata made the comment in connection with an alleged remark made in a House of Councillors Budget Committee meeting earlier in the day. The prime minister was quoted by parliamentarians as having said he "agrees absolutely" with an interpellator's views that Japan should confirm to other nations that it can indeed produce nuclear weapons, though it is refraining from doing so for political reasons. The interpellator, opposition Liberal Democratic Party member Hiroshi Oki, cited the NPT and Japan's three non-nuclear principles -- not possessing, manufacturing or introducing nuclear weapons on its territory. KYODO said Hata denied to the press at first that he made the alleged remark, though Oki insisted that the prime minister "roundly affirmed" Japan's potential for producing nuclear weapons. It is believed to be the first time for the Japanese Government to publicly acknowledge such potential in the Diet or public, the news service said.
