FBIS4-49773 "drchi091_b_94005" FBIS-CHI-94-091 Daily Report 10 May 1994 United States & Canada U.S. Businessmen Support MFN Extension U.S. Businessmen Support MFN Extension OW1005141694 Beijing XINHUA in English 1350 GMT 10 May 94 OW1005141694 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Some Beijing-based U.S. entrepreneurs called recently for their government to extend China's most favored nation (MFN) status this year out of consideration for U.S. business interests in the large market of China. The entrepreneurs include the first representatives of the Beijing offices of General Motors (GM), Ford, McDonnell Douglas (MDC), Motorola, United Technology Company (UTC), Du Pont, American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T), Chase Manhattan Bank, Amoco and Caltex oil company. During recent interviews with XINHUA, they shared the view that China's economy, developing at a high rate and providing favorable opportunities for U.S. enterprises in the country, and the bilateral trade ties played a significant role in the recovery of the U.S. economy. The United States would pay a high price if the U.S.-China trade relations were damaged as a result of suspension of MFN status, they said. Diane Terry, secretary general of the American-China Chamber of Commerce representing 400 U.S. companies in China, pointed out that the countries' two-way trade has expanded rapidly since the two countries established diplomatic relations 15 years ago, and China has become the 8th largest trade partner of the United States. And more than 500 multi-national companies in the U.S. have marked China as one of their future investment priorities, she said, adding that total U.S. contracted volume of investment reached 11 billion U.S. dollars in China's over 10,000 projects by the end of last year, which led all foreign investment in China. Only if the bilateral trade ties were normal could the U.S. companies make expected achievements, she said. Richard Latham, president of the United Technologies China operation, expressed his hope that President Clinton would extend China's MFN status in the interest of U.S. companies in China. Peter Chapman, president of McDonnell Douglas China company, said that if the U.S.-China relations can develop smoothly, U.S. enterprises will benefit a lot since China will import goods valued at 700 billion U.S. dollars within the next seven years. He took his company as an example by saying that since MDC entered China in 1975, it had sold China a batch of planes, and 40 planes have been assembled by the MDC-China joint venture in Shanghai. If an agreement could be reached, the company would manufacture scores of additional planes for China's main air routes, Chapman said. Rudi von Meister and James Paulsen, heads of GM and Ford in China, shared the view that if a trade conflict was triggered by the MFN issue, other Western companies, taking the opportunity, would occupy the lion's share of the Chinese market, thus becoming strong competitors of U.S. enterprises. Chai Sun Lai, president of Motorola China company, said that when President Clinton makes his decision in June, he must take into account the interests of the American people. According to some experts, the inflation rate in the U.S. would be 0.15 percent more annually if it lost China, a main supplier of consumer goods, and each U.S. consumer would pay 140 dollars more for substitutions for Chinese products. Besides, 160,000 people would lose their jobs. Besides, all these enterprisers pointed out, the policy of linking trade and human rights is popular neither in the world nor in the United States. "In the past, companies postponed canvassing in Washington until May," Latham said. "But they began their action at the beginning of the year this time. UTC has made a plan from January to June." All the businessmen said that a good trend has appeared recently in Washington, and they hoped that Clinton would not make the "mistake of the times" as THE NEW YORK TIMES called it -- eliminating China's MFN status.
