Black-market train ticket transactions have become a headache for the public security sector that have not been stopped despite repeated attempts. China's rail transport industry has grown rapidly in the over four decades since the founding of the PRC, with rail-operation mileage at 53,565 km by 1992, up 140 percent from 1949. Moreover, rail freight volume is up over 20 times, while our population has nearly tripled. So in contrast, railway construction remains severely lagging. China's per capita rail length is now equivalent only to that of a cigarette, leaving Chinese railways ranking lower than 100th place in the world based on territorial area. As to running speed, the world has at least 25 countries with trains running at a top speed of over 140 km per hr, with running speed above 100 km per hr, while China has only a few lines on which trains run at a top speed of just 120 km per hr, with running speed generally at only 10-100 km per hr. This low volume and slow speed, in addition to our rail transport industry being responsible for 52 percent of our passenger service and 70 percent of our freight volume, has left our railways operating at overload capacity while fighting for consumption and equipment, with rail trunk-line transport in all-out shortage, and both capital and consumer goods entering and leaving east, south, southwest, northwest, and northeast China piled up like mountains. Sichuan Province, commonly known as a land of plenty, has not even one multiple-track line, leaving Governor Xiao Yang [5135 4441] to sigh about Sichuan's productive forces being packed in a bottle. National trunk-line passenger volume is similarly exploding, with exceptional service shortages every spring. During the 1993 Spring Festival, Shanghai experienced 8 consecutive days of passenger volume averaging 560,000 a day, Chengdu had over 50,000 passengers stuck in stations, and the surging crowds in the Guangzhou station broke through six arm-thick iron railings. So how are we to change our rail transport industry's shortages and slowness? In recent years, everyone from Central Committee and State Council officials to communications and transportation experts, scholars, and industrialists have been paying attention to and exploring this question, with almost all holding that we need to speed up the pace of our railway construction, doing all that we can to build new lines and upgrade old ones. But what sort of new lines are we to build, and how are old lines to be upgraded? I interviewed many concerned figures on these details, with most holding that the basic way out for China's rail transport industry is to raise its running speed, by building high-speed railways. In recent years, high-speed rail construction has gradually found its way onto our economic-development agenda. High-speed rail refers to a railway system with speeds topping 200 km per hr, using special lines with no grade crossings and absolute running safety. It concentrates high technology in fields, such as pulling force, rolling stock, line and track structure, communications signals, driver command and control, driving organization, and operating model, having advantages, such as large transport capacity, high speed, good safety, low consumption, little pollution, and small area occupied, having become the general railway-development trend in today's world. When Japan's new east-coast trunk-line from Tokyo to Osaka began commercial operation in 1964 at a speed of 210 km per hr, it was the world's first highspeed-rail system. France's high-speed train, the TGV, began operation in 1981. Italy's Baishi highspeed train connected Milan to Rome in 1988. Germany's high-tech ICE train went into official operation in June 1991. Spain started to use a rail service system with speeds over 250 km per hour in 1992. Britain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the former Soviet Union have also built their own highspeed railways. And in addition to the European countries, others, such as the United States, South Korea, Canada, India, and Australia, are also planning their own highspeed railways. The world now has 8,000 km of highspeed railways, with the fastest running trains being France's TGV (515 km per hr), Germany's ICE (406 km per hr), and Japan's WIN350 (350.4 km per hr). High-speed rail construction in all countries generally goes through stages, such as discussion, planning, demonstration, project-establishment, construction, and commercial operation. Japan set a 7-year record for the whole cycle, which is generally about 10 years in other countries. I learned from my investigations and interviews that China's high-speed rail construction is assimilating advanced world experience, by combining the discussion, planning, and demonstration stages into one, with a series of design and planning details now in systematic progress under the leadership of four commissions and one ministry (the State Planning Commission, the Economics and Trade Commission, the State Restructuring of the Economic System Commission, the State Science and Technology Commission, and the Ministry of Railways). To greet the return of sovereignty over Hong Kong to China in 1997, by providing China's high-speed rail construction with a scientific experimental line, the State Council decided to build a high-speed railway from Guangzhou to Shenzhen (with a top speed of 160 km per hr and a running speed of 100-120 km per hr). In March 1990, the Ministry of Railways' S&T Research Academy formed an expert taskforce to jointly tackle the key problems involved. Then in December 1991, the official foundation-laying ceremony was held at Shilongqiao with, by the end of November 1993, the line's bridge upgrading being basically completed, engine and car samples having been developed, and construction smoothly underway, now in the crucial stage of all-out rail-laying and station-upgrading on the whole line. Plans are for this high-speed railway to be finished and opened to traffic in 1994. On 19 April 1992, Fujian's local railway head office signed a contract of intent with Japan's Jingkawa Trust and Investment Group, with the two parties signing on 15 July the cooperative-grounds agreement documents. This agreement provides for Sino-Japanese cooperation in building a new bullet-train line from Fuzhou to Xiamen, to be completed by no later than 1998, at which time bullet trains will speed between Fuzhou and Xiamen at 210 km per hr. While a number of factors have kept bilateral cooperation on this line from making substantive progress, leaving the bullet train still in "a sort of dream" state, concerned figures indicate that the Chinese Ministry of Railways and Fujian Province are very determined to build this highspeed railway, either as a joint venture or alone, to turn this dream into a reality. In late September 1992, a high-level forum was held at the Jingxi Hotel in Beijing, whose theme was how to develop China's highspeed railways. It was proposed at this conference that the development of China's highspeed railways should begin with the Beijing-Shanghai line, and then proceed to the construction of the Beijing-Guangzhou and Beijing-Harbin lines. The Beijing-Shanghai line is China's busiest north-south artery, being 1,462 km long. It runs through four eastern coastal provinces and the three large municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, connecting the two major economic zones of Beijing-Tianjin-Tang Shan and the Chang Jiang [Yangtze] Delta. Along this line, the population makes up 26.2 percent of China's population, the GVIAO accounts for 37.9 percent of China's, and the per capita national income is over twice the national average. While this line accounts for only 2.8 percent of China's railway mileage, it is responsible for 14.3 percent of China's railway passenger turnover, with a passenger-traffic density 5.2 times the national average, and a freight-volume density 3.6 times the national average. The experts hold that building a highspeed railway first between Beijing and Shanghai will be of extremely far-reaching significance to our whole national economic development. Long before this high-level conference, experts from the Ministry of Railways and concerned departments had done much preliminary work for the building of the Beijing-Shanghai highspeed railway, studying the overall program and plan. This conference then strengthened everyone's resolve. It is understood that the Ministry of Railways' Third Research Academy has completed the "feasibility-study report for the Beijing-Shanghai highspeed railway," which holds that highspeed trains on this line will travel at 250-300 km per hr using highspeed engines and cars, with the key equipment being purchased abroad. The whole 1,400-plus km line will be elevated and closed, and gradually developed into separate passenger and freight lines. Once the Beijing-Shanghai railway is finished, its annual passenger and freight volume will reach 100 million trips and 100 million tons respectively, shortening the travel time from Beijing to Shanghai from 17 to 6-7 hours, to make it possible to "set out in the morning and arrive by evening," not to speak of its impact on national economic development and efficiency. As to the investment, projecting price changes, the overall investment will reach 30 billion RMB. The experts hold that the Ministry of Railways should be the major investor, paying 6-7 percent of the 3 billion yuan a year over the 10-year plan. Then, construction funds raised every year for the Beijing-Shanghai railway could amount to 15-20 billion yuan. This would ensure the funding. And provinces and municipalities along the line could also invest through shares, or use land for share-investment, to take part in the building of the highspeed railway in line with national preferential policy. As to ticket prices, Beijing-Shanghai highspeed-rail passengers could pay two-thirds the price of CAAC airline ticket prices for the same distance. This would meet the terms for repaying the capital with interest, in addition to the possible sale of stocks and bonds, the use of foreign loans, and even the attraction of overseas technology and equipment for joint-venture shareholding. The construction of the Beijing-Shanghai highspeed railway will promote tourism, industrial and commercial, and real estate development along the line, which will have a great impact on eastern China over the next decade. Concerned figures and certain experts and academics have appealed to the policymaking sector to make a resolute decision as quickly as possible after detailed examination and approval of the feasibility report and further demonstration, so that the Beijing-Shanghai highspeed railway can be established as a project and put under construction as soon as possible. Certain figures hold that if it is pushed hard, it will be entirely possible for construction to start on the Beijing-Shanghai highspeed railway in one to four years, with construction to be completed in about a decade, by which time, China's rail transport industry will have pioneered a new age.
