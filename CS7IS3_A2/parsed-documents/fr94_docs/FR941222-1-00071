FR941222-1-00071 FR941222-1-00008 The Agency seeks comment on the recordkeeping burden that accompanies its implementation. The Agency realizes that facilities that would wish to take advantage of such an exemption would be required to allow compliance personnel to examine process records (reaction rates, reactants, process flows, etc.) to verify that a facility is able to achieve the exemption. Therefore, the Agency solicits comments on this topic as well. A quantity-based exemption in a listing determination bears a strong relationship to another ongoing Agency project which seeks to establish an exit from the hazardous waste management program. The Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR) project is an effort, in part, to set exit criteria for any listed hazardous waste so that materials which clearly fail to pose a threat to human health and the environment can exit the Subtitle C system. The HWIR concept, as currently envisioned, would be expected to be similar to that of a quantity-based exemption for a specific listed hazardous waste: a risk- based exemption process that employs analysis of multiple exposure pathways to determine a safe exit or exemption level. A principal difference between the HWIR concept under discussion and a quantity-based listing could be that HWIR is meant to apply to all listed wastestreams, while a quantity-based listing could be targeted to a specific wastestream in a listing determination. In that sense, a listing exemption could be considered to be more tailored to the known exposure routes of a specific wastestream and may be able to generate an exemption level which is specific to that wastestream. For example, if the listing determination analysis shows a wastestream in a listing can be managed only in tanks, then the exemption analysis could be focused on the exposure pathways affected only by tanks. The exemption levels for that wastestream could be tailored to those exposure routes (air pathways) and could be different than HWIR exit criteria. The Agency solicits comment on the advantages and disadvantages of a quantity-based exemption in listing determinations to a more generic exit level lkie that being contemplated in the HWIR project discussions. Relationship to the Definition of Solid Waste The Agency has observed in the dye and pigment and other industries that material recovery may be discouraged due to restrictions placed on materials designated as ``solid and then hazardous'' waste, as defined by RCRA. Over the past two years, the Agency's Definition of Solid Waste Task Force in the Office of Solid Waste examined possible modifications to the definition of solid waste to encourage environmentally sound recycling. A final report of the Task Force was issued on September 19, 1994. An example in the dye and pigment industries of using as a product a material that ordinarily would be a waste involves the blending and sale of collected dusts and fines as inexpensive black pigments useful to shoe polish manufacturers. D. Waste Minimization and the Dye and Pigment Industries The dye and pigment industries have expended considerable effort to cooperate with the Agency on a voluntary waste minimization program, coordinated through ETAD. As part of this effort, waste minimization, recycle, and reuse practices in the dye and pigment industries were described for all aspects of production in the ``Pollution Prevention Guidance Manual for the Dye Manufacturing Industry'' (EPA/741/B&hyph;92&hyph;001). The Agency is interested in options to modify today's proposed listing determinations to support and enhance the voluntary waste minimization efforts already initiated by the dye and pigment industries. The Agency requests comment on the feasibility of the waste minimization-based listing approaches described above for the dye and pigment industries. EPA also solicits ideas and comments on other possible approaches to tailor the hazardous waste listings and promote waste minimization in the dye and pigment industries. In particular, the Agency requests comment on other approaches that may provide more flexibility for waste minimization and better assure that constituent reductions would be achieved through waste minimization (rather than through treatment). EPA specifically requests comment on the feasibility of developing the quantity-based listing approach described above for the dye and pigment industries. The quantity-based approach is based on the Agency's experience with other industries in which production is continuous. Because of the batch nature of production and the multiplicity of chemicals involved in the dye and pigment industries, the quantity-based listing approach may be more difficult for this industry. The Agency requests comment on how these issues ( i.e., batch processes, multiple chemicals) might be addressed in a quantity-based listing approach or other waste minimization-based option. The Agency also solicits comment on whether certain of the dye and pigment wastestreams are better candidates for waste minimization, and whether a waste minimization-based listing approach should target these wastes. Finally, EPA requests comment on the testing and monitoring needed to ensure proper implementation of a waste minimization listing approach. Based on the comments the Agency receives on the above issues, EPA may issue a supplemental proposal addressing a waste minimization-based listing approach for the dyes and pigments industry. IV. Applicability of the Land Disposal Restrictions Determinations A. Request for Comment on the Agency's Approach to the Development of BDAT Treatment Standards RCRA requires EPA to make a land disposal prohibition determination for any hazardous waste that is newly identified or listed in 40 CFR part 261 after November 8, 1984, within six months of the date of identification or final listing (RCRA Section 3004(g)(4), 42 U.S.C. 6924(g)(4)). EPA also is required to set ``*␣*␣* levels or methods of treatment, if any, which substantially diminish the toxicity of the waste or substantially reduce the likelihood of migration of hazardous constituents from the waste so that short-term and long-term threats to human health and the environment are minimized'' (RCRA Section 3004(m)(1), 42 U.S.C. 6924(m)(1)). Land disposal of wastes that meet treatment standards thus established by EPA is not prohibited. The wastes being proposed for listing in this action would be subject to this requirement once a final rule is promulgated.
