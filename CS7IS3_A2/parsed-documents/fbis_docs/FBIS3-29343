Mr. Button says it is simply a case of the United States resenting Japan's success in manufacturing and as a trading nation. He said while the United States is upset over Japan's huge trade surplus with them, Washington had to realize Japan had earned that surplus. Mr. Button said there are parallels between the United States' attitude to Japan and its attitude to Vietnam. [Begin Button recording] Clinton has now lifted the embargo, but for a long time you could only conclude that the embargo, in spite of all the rhetoric, was really about the fact that Vietnam really won that war and America lost it. And that is a strange and unfortunate way to conduct foreign policy in a realistic sense, in my view. And it is the same with Japan -- very difficult circumstances for some American industries occasioned by better manufacturers in Japan. And I don't know that that is something you ought to be sort of punished for. [end recording]
