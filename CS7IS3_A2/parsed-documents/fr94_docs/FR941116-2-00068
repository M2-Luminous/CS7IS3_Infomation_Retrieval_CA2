FR941116-2-00068 FR941116-2-00055 Notice of Lodging of Consent Decree Pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) In accordance with Departmental policy, 28 CFR 50.7 and 42 U.S.C. 9622(d), notice is hereby given that a proposed consent decree in United States v. AMF Reece, et al., Civil Action No. 94&hyph;12153 (EFH) was lodged on October 28, 1994, with the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The consent decree settles an action brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq., and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq., for injunctive relief and reimbursement of costs. The PSC Resources Superfund Site was operated as a waste oil recycling facility from 1970 to 1978 and is located in Palmer, Massachusetts. As a result of the waste oil operations, the Site became contaminated with hazardous substances and was placed on the National Priorities List. The Environmental Protection Agency performed a removal action and a remedial investigation and feasibility study to identify the nature and extent of the contamination at the Site and to examine how best to remediate the Site. Under the terms of the proposed decree, eleven defendants (``Performing Settling Defendants'') will perform the required remediation of the Site. The remediation is today estimated to cost $7.35 million. A remedial trust fund will be established to fund the remedy. Approximately one hundred and forty-five (145) de minimis settling defendants will contribute $3,755,484 to the remedial trust fund. The New Jersey Department of Transportation will contribute $3.5 million and the federal agencies will contribute $625,152, respectively, to the remedial trust fund. The Performing Settling Defendants and settling federal agencies will pay $3,175,000 to the Environmental Protection Agency and Commonwealth of Massachusetts for costs incurred in performing the RI/FS, removal activities and for other past costs and interest, totalling $4,291,333. The Performing Settling Defendants within 30 days of entry of the decree will also pay $153,720 to the Department of Interior in compensation for natural resource damages. Additionally, over the course of the remediation, the Performing Settling Defendants will pay $537,500 of an estimated $575,000 in oversight costs to the Environmental Protection Agency and the Commonwealth. The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments relating to the proposed consent decree. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. 20530, and should refer to the United States v. AMF Reece, et al., DOJ reference # 90&hyph;11&hyph;2&hyph;922. The proposed consent decree may be examined at: The Office of the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts. 1003 J.W.
