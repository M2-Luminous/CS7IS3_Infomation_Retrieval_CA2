The Elf Aquitaine oil and UAP insurance companies will be privatized "in the next few weeks," Alphandery announced Wednesday. Providing further details Thursday, he said that current core shareholders in Elf Aquitaine would hold 10 percent of its capital after privatization. A call for future core shareholders, who will hold 8.5 percent of capital, will be launched in the official government journal at the weekend, while the remaining 1.5 percent reserved for core shareholders will be taken by Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), he said. The state will remain the leading shareholder in Elf Aquitaine, with 10 to 15 percent of the capital, through the Erap state holding company. It also reserves the right to veto an investor's crossing the limit of 10, 20 or 30 percent of capital or voting rights. Elf Aquitaine's current stock market value exceeds 100 billion French francs (17.25 billion dollars), 50.76 percent of which is controlled by Erap. France is expecting to earn 55 billion francs (9.49 billion dollars) from privatization of state-owned companies in 1994, 50 billion of which will go into the general budget. Total state earnings from privatizations between 1994 and 1997 are expected to reach 200 billion francs (34.5 billion dollars), bringing the budget deficit down to 2.5 percent of GDP (gross domestic product) in 1997, compared with 4.5 percent in 1993. The 1993 privatizations of Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) bank and the Rhone Poulenc pharmaceutical company brought some 41 billion francs (7.1 billion dollars) into French state coffers.
