United Nations Forms Additional Contingent of `Blue Helmets'"] [Text] An interesting progression. Whereas in 1987 peacekeeping operations were carried out by UN forces in five areas of the planet and the number of "Blue Helmets" was then 10,000 soldiers and officers, today 70,000 UN troops are insufficient to pacify the warring sides in 17 hotbeds of tension. Fifteen countries prepared to put at least another 50,000 soldiers under arms have responded to the world community's call to increase the ranks of the peacekeeping forces. In January of this year UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali authorized the French Colonel Gerard Gobyez [surname as transliterated] to poll the 184 UN members on the subject of their readiness to facilitate the imposition of order in the world. The Gobyez team flew to 50 world countries and entered into correspondence with the remainder. Fifteen countries declared their readiness -- the participants in the new project. The list of these countries is being kept secret until the UN mobilization plan is established. It is clear only that they do not include the United States. There is no noticeable shortage of countries ready to act as donors of military force. However, there are only two states in the world capable today of realistically carrying this project through. Russia and the United States are the two countries which possess the necessary means to deliver "Blue Helmets" to trouble spots quickly. The UN troops need heavy transport planes, special naval vessels, and the appropriate medical aid, equipment, means of communication, and satellite links. Russia's participation in this program is also under question, but, experts claim, this idea must be seized with both hands. The Russian soldier, having overstayed his welcome in the former fraternal republics, will be happy to see the world. Especially since, in addition to additional training, extra pay is also promised. And the operations plans will include only classical functions: the separation of warring parties on the basis of agreement, as is done in countries like Cambodia and Macedonia [FYROM]. Somalia and Bosnia will not be on offer.
