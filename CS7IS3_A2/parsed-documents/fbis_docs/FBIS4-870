They hesitated between the desire to fight back and the need to avoid plunging the country into chaos. Apparent calm prevailed in the Niger capital where streets, which are still strewn with broken glass, melted tires, and charred tree trunks, testified to the degree of violence that marked the demonstrations which resulted in one death and 24 injured on 16 April. In all, 87 people were arrested, among them leaders of the three main opposition parties which had called the previous day for a civil disobedience campaign to protest the exclusion of their cadres from the management of the country. This morning, civil servants of all political leanings reported normally to their administrative services. "This country belongs to us. If it collapses, we will perish," a government employee -- a well-known opposition activist -- stated. "Our leaders called on us to observe a peaceful civil disobedience campaign but unfortunately we indulged in violence," he regretted. "I support the opposition but not violence. Should this violence continue, Niger will experience the same situation as other countries," added one of his colleagues, a supporter of the National Movement of the Development Society [MNSD], the former single ruling party which became the main opposition force after the country's first free elections in February 1993. At the MNSD headquarters, however, young activists, who were openly brandishing knives, were already working out strategies: "Offensives must be increased to speed up the fall of the regime," one of them shouted. The two main parties within the ruling coalition -- the Democratic and Social Convention [CDS] of President Mahamane Ousmane and the Niger Party for Democracy and Socialism [PNDS] of Prime Minister Mahamadou Issoufou -- yesterday evening appealed to their activists "not to yield to the opposition's provocations." The most violent clashes took place on 16 April between opposition activists and supporters of the ruling Alliance of Forces of Change near Niamey stadium, where the ceremonies commemorating the first anniversary of President Ousmane's inauguration were being held. The CDS and PNDS have, in a joint communique, "condemned the insurrectional situation and the appeals for civil war" made by the opposition which is now completely beheaded. Its three main leaders -- Mamadou Tanja of the MNSD, Andre Salifou of the Union of Progressive Patriots and Democrats, and Issoufou Assoumane of the Democratic Union of Progressive Forces -- have been imprisoned. No incidents were reported in the interior. The national radio and television reported on the ceremonies organized in many localities that are considered opposition strongholds but where supporters and adversaries of the majority celebrated the first anniversary of the advent of democracy in Niger "together in a brotherly manner."
