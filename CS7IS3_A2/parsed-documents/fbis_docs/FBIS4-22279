Nevertheless, from confidential sources the KOMMERSANT editors obtained information on the volumes and structure of the allocated quotas. There were also a few sensations. Yesterday telegrams arrived at the Mintopenergo [Ministry of Fuel and Energy] and the Minekonomika [Ministry of Economics] from Bashkiriya and Komi, stating that these republics reject in favor of their producer enterprises the regional quotas set for them on the export of oil and petroleum products (Bashkiriya for the first quarter of 1994, and Komi--for the entire year). Up until now, no one has ever rejected quotas. Quotas: Yesterday and Today The riddle of export quotas which, as we know, are hammered out by hook or by crook, consists of the fact that in the end they are never exhausted. In 1993, the quotas on oil were utilized by 95.6 percent, on petroleum products--by 73 percent, on lumber--by 56 percent, on copper--by 70 percent, on nickel--by 97 percent, and on aluminum--by 90 percent. The reasons are different in each case. However, the result is the same. Last year's results are explained not by the fact that the quotas allocated were too high, but by the fact that there was a change in the price relations on the Russian and world markets. Domestic prices increased, outstripping the relatively smooth reduction in the currency exchange rate of the ruble. However, world prices on such goods vitally important to Russia as oil and aluminum declined, and for other raw materials goods they stagnated. The price gap, which determines the effectiveness of export, was narrowed. Russian exporters had already recovered from the gold fever. The reduction in the volume of quotas for 1994 as compared with last year is a reaction to the reduction in effectiveness of export and pressure by the EC [European Community], which has 16 "anti-dumping cases" pending against Russian exporters (on aluminum, a number of other metals, and fertilizers). The tightening of state control over export, however, is a poor substitute for support of exporters. Quotas, Desired and Not Overly So The basic raw material flows of Russian export are, as before, controlled by administrative ties: Quotas--licenses--special exporters. However, individual segments in this system have been weakened. The regions traditionally do not not suit special exporters as an instrument of centralized control over the effectiveness of export. The innovation of 1994 consists of the fact that, first of all, the already effective currency control, strictly speaking, makes this administrative institution unnecessary. Secondly, the demarche of Bashkiriya and Komi clearly shows that within the family of export quotas, regional quotas are the most unprofitable. Export credited toward state quotas is exempted from customs duties. As practical experience shows, the receipt of customs privileges by enterprises producing export products, especially if currency is used for the production needs, is much more realistic than the resolution of this same problem by the region. Thus, it is quite justified to assume that the regions will ever more actively strive toward achieving changes in the regulation of export. Quotas From the Right, Tariffs From the Left Despite the unfavorable price conditions for exporters on the domestic and world markets, last year's positive foreign trade balance ($16 billion) was obtained primarily due to an increase in the absolute volumes of export of basic raw material goods. In 1993, Russia exported 79.7 million tonnes of crude oil beyond the boundaries of the former USSR. This is 20.4 percent more than in 1992. The volume of currency revenues comprised $8.2 million and $8.5 million respectively. In other words, in a year it declined by 4 percent. The export of petroleum products in 1993 totalled 34.5 million tonnes, or $3.4 billion. In 1992 it was 25.3 million tonnes, or $4.2 billion. The physical volume increased by 36 percent, while the cost volume declined by 17.4 percent. The export of gas in 1993 was 96 billion cubic meters, or $7.2 billion worth. In 1992 it was 88 billion cubic meters, or $7.5 billion. The physical volume increased by 9 percent, while the cost volume declined by 3.4 percent. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Reduction in volumes of quotas for basic types of Russian raw material expor-| |t for 1994 (as compared with 1993) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Product |Percent reduction | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Oil |27 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nickel |38 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Timber |49 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Petroleum products |53 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Aluminum |53.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Copper |62.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Level for 1993 - 100| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In 1994 the volumes of quotas on key goods, despite tradition, may be fully utilized according to their designation. For now, in any case, this tendency is clearly apparent. The grounds for this have appeared: World prices on oil and aluminum have begun to move upward, and the drop in the exchange rate of the ruble has notably accelerated. In January-February, 38 percent more petroleum products (in physical volume) were exported than last year. The increase is partly explained in a purely technical manner--by the carryover of deliveries from last year. Nevertheless, the general picture is paradoxical: The quotas are being reduced, while export is growing. The explanation is simple. The volumes of quotas which have been coordinated for the present day are clearly not final. Corrections will be introduced due to the most varied factors--sectorial lobbying, anti-dumping limitations on the part of the Western countries, and sharp changes in market conditions on the domestic as well as on the world markets. However, the irrevocable fact remains that the stake, as before, is being placed on raw material export. For its effectiveness, especially under unfavorable price components, the level of customs rates is critically important. A new tariff has been introduced as of 1 November of last year. Its rates are significantly lower, but nevertheless raw material export is subject to duty payments. It would be logical to remove export customs duties altogether. Yet for now each exporter solves this problem to his own fear and risk. The most popular is the export of raw material "on a customer-supplied basis." It was specifically this type of oil deals with Lithuania that cost "LUKoil" its status as a special exporter. There are also more trivial variants associated with this same Lithuania: According to the data of the GTK [state customs control], 70 percent of the crude oil delivered to Kaliningrad Oblast is "lost" en route. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Effectiveness of export of basic raw material goods | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Commodity positions |World prices ($/tonne) |Domestic prices (thousan-| | | |d rubles/tonne) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Crude oil |90-100 |80-107 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Fuel oil |45-65 |37-90 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Diesel fuel |152-161 |160-257 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Aluminum |1300 |1370-1900 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Who Will Upgrade Russian Export? The strategic resolution of the problems of Russian export is inseparable from the change of its structure. For the time being, state support for upgrading export is expressed only in the absence of export duties on finished products and in instituting the Russian Eximbank [Export-Import Bank] which, however, will be able to begin ruble crediting of producers of industrial export products no sooner than this summer. Moreover, the structural changes must begin with increasing the degree of processing of initial raw material. In this sense, the theme of changing the structure of Russian export is directly tied with quota setting. We are speaking primarily of the status of foreign investors who, having invested funds into mining sectors, may realistically, starting with more intensive processing of raw material, build bridges also to the specific processing sectors. For now, however, the vulnerability of foreign investors is not declining, but on the contrary, increasing. The procedure which was ratified by the government for defining specific production of SP [joint ventures] makes it possible for them to export their own products without obtaining quotas and licenses. However, it does not exempt them from having to register with the MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] as special exporters, and this is rather complicated. The MVES guards the interests of Russian exporters, protecting them from foreign competitors. Thus, foreign investors are in solidarity with the Russian regions in their desire to eliminate special exporters "as a class." On the other hand, the hopes placed by foreign investors on the Russian Agency for International Cooperation and Development (RAMSIR) as the official lobbyist for their interests are most likely unfounded. In the course of the latest reshuffling within the government, RAMSIR was official handed over to the management of the MVES. However, the new patron clearly has no burning desire to deal seriously with foreign investors. As a result, the agency in fact is in a stage of division between the MVES and the Ministry of Economics. This, clearly, does not benefit either foreign investors, or, ultimately, the cause of improving the structure of Russian export.
