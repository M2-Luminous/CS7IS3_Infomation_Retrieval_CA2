The compromise being informally offered by the 10 EU partners falls short of Anglo-Spanish demands to maintain present voting rules, whereby two big countries and one small member state can combine to block decisions. But it might allow London and Madrid to proclaim a partial victory in their efforts to protect the interests of big member states when the Union expands from 12 to 16 countries. The UK cabinet yesterday authorised Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, to reach an agreement that falls short of Britain's present position. But he was warned by colleagues that any deal must preserve the "substance" of the original position. Several ministers said that any compromise that could be interpreted as a climbdown could cause "uproar" in the party. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the government would continue to fight for Britain's interests at the heart of Europe. At prime minister's questions, Mr John Major rebuked a Conservative Euro-sceptic who tried to draw him on the negotiations. He said Mr Hurd would defend "Britain's best interests without any delay in enlargement." Tory Euro-sceptics, led by Mrs Ann Winterton, unsuccessfully demanded a debate on the future shape of the EU. Senior EU diplomats made clear that the "delaying minority" formula was the most the UK and Spain could expect when EU foreign ministers try, once again, to break the deadlock at a meeting in Brussels next Tuesday [22 March]. "They will not get all they want, but they will receive something," commented one official. The compromise would give member states at risk of being outvoted an automatic right to one month's delay. The rotating presidency of the EU and the Commission would be asked to seek a consensus. The procedure could be repeated, again for a month, at which point member states could take a decision. Mr Hurd has said the UK could live with a Spanish compromise on weighted voting. That would increase the threshold of the "blocking minority" from 23 to 27 votes, but it would not apply when three member states that together have 23 votes and represent more than lOO million people either oppose or abstain on a measure. However, the informed judgement in Brussels is that formula is not acceptable to the European Parliament, which must approve accession of the four countries by May 4. EU diplomats have also warned that several parliaments, notably those of Belgium and the Netherlands, would refuse to endorse the Anglo-Spanish proposals because they would paralyse decision-making and strengthen the power of the bigger states. A compromise on voting weights would remain in force until 1996.
