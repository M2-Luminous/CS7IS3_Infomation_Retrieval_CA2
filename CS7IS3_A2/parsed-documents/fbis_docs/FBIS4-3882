In an interview with the German magazine "DER SPIEGEL", Yeltsin voiced his confidence that the signing of a memorandum of the civic peace accord scheduled for Thursday would provide a basis for a civic consensus in Russia. The civic peace accord was proposed by Yeltsin in late February following a political amnesty, under which his main opponents including former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy and former parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov were released. The draft accord has been "fundamentally amended" since Yeltsin consulted with the leaders of political parties and various republics or regions, according to the presidential chief-of-staff Sergey Filatov. Yeltsin said that the economy could be stabilized in 1994. In the past two months inflation had stood at eight to 10 percent, much lower than in the same period last year, and the decline in production slowed down and the budget deficit shrank, he said. Meanwhile, Yeltsin said whether he would run in the 1996 presidential election would depend on how the situation will develop, but for now he would stick to his earlier decision not to participate. "If I see that the situation improves in Russia, I will be able to leave with clear conscience and raised head..if the difficulties are not overcome, then it will be necessary to think everything over with regard to a new situation. Meanwhile, I stick to my earlier decision," he said. He said that neither Rutskoy nor "ultra-nationalist" Vladimir Zhirinovskiy would have a chance to become the president. But he expressed deep concern about a possible vacuum in the top leadership. He said he is trying to find out who will be serious contenders for presidency in 1996. Yeltsin said he would not put his "presidential party" in a special place because "the president should be responsible for the whole nation instead of the supporters of his party". Yeltsin also talked about the situation in Bosnia. He said that air strikes can only make the situation worse and the war endless. He called for peace negotiations in solving the Bosnian conflict. Asked about his attitude towards NATO's "partnership for peace" plan, Yeltsin said that it is a "specific proposal", although "some things have yet to be cleared up". He said that Russia, which has "an army as big as NATO", was ready to sign the document. But he would also like to sign an additional protocol with NATO to settle "a whole range of key issues". There are also technical problems, including different weapons systems which need to be unified, he added. Yeltsin believed that Russia would always be a great power, as demonstrated in its tradition, history and culture.
