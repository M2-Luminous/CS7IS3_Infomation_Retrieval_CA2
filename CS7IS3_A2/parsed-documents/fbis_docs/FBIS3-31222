Should Hungary fear Russia again? [Horn] One should not take Mr. Zhirinovskiy's statements seriously. Of course, one must not ignore him either because this nationalist-imperialist direction that he represents is a certain challenge. However, I do not fear that Russia will again turn Eastern Central Europe into its sphere of influence. [Mayer] Why not? [Horn] Russia neither has a reason nor the power. It is struggling with its own internal difficulties. It is not easy to hold Russia together. [Mayer] Moscow's aspirations to push through some kind of Monroe Doctrine for the territory within the ex-Soviet borders do not alarm you either? [Horn] Hungary and the other countries of Eastern Central Europe never belonged to Moscow. This is completely different from Georgia or the other ex-USSR republics. [Mayer] However, you proposed as early as in 1990 that Hungary should strive for its admission to NATO. [Horn] At that time, I proposed that close relations with NATO be developed. Even though this may have been differently interpreted, I meant political, not military cooperation. [Mayer] At any rate, at that time, when the new democratic parties still talked of neutrality, you were a silent caller in Hungary. Are you disappointed today at NATO's hesitation to admit the Eastern European candidates as members? [Horn] The "Partnership for Peace" program is a clever idea because it holds out the prospect of the development of cooperation to the East Europeans and does not commit NATO to anything in the question of admission. [Mayer] Poland has, therefore, reacted with frustration. [Horn] I am rather disappointed, because I do not see a guarantee that NATO would do something against a possible crisis in this region or how this would be done. [passage omitted]
