It was already known that a Heroj-class submarine, the "Uskok," had already sailed. Now, however, a Sava-class submarine has also been observed, a navy spokesman confirmed. Each boat can be fitted out with 10 torpedoes. Western ships are patrolling the Adriatic Sea in order to supervise the UN oil and arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia. The Netherlands ships serving there are the "Jacob van Heemskerck" and the "Van Kinsbergen." The Adriatic Sea is not a no-go area for submarines from Serbia and Montenegro, the navy spokesman said. He did say, however, that it was interesting that a second submarine was operational.
