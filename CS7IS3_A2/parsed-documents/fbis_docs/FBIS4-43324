"I think the single currency is a problem that must be treated as indivisible," said Martino, an economist by trade, of ideas that the currency could be introduced for some European Union [EU] countries before others. "Either it's single, or it's not." Martino was speaking on the eve of a visit to Rome by a European Commission delegation with the task of reporting on Italian progress towards the targets set for launching the single currency. According to Martino, whose views are generally strongly free-market, setting domestic finances to right is "obviously necessary and desirable," but he claimed it was a problem apart from the single currency. "I don't believe in gradualism, which can be applied to divisible problems such as tariffs. These can be reduced gradually," he asserted. "In my view, the monetary crisis in September 1992 confirms the validity of the idea. You can't achieve a single currency by freezing exchange rates; it's unsatisfactory. My idea is that all those who are in the EU should be in (the single currency)." Martino also said he does not agree with the idea that enlarging the EU may prove a hurdle to extending its political integration: "But if that were true, I think it is a price that would be worth paying." On Italy's economic prospects, Martino said he sees "serious indications" of recovery and would expect effective government to be able to boost it without creating inflation. He also claimed that Berlusconi found the public deficit in worse shape than expected, though he admitted that, in 1993, while the public debt had risen to 119.5 percent of gross domestic product, the public deficit was less than 10 percent and dropped about half a percent last year. "There is movement in the right direction," he commented. According to Martino, the terms of the debate at the OECD seem to have changed, from considering employment in macroeconomic terms to a microeconomic approach. He also said that employment will be a major point on the agenda at the Group of Seven summit in Naples in July. In other points, Martino said that, in the next few days, the Italian Government would make a linked series of proposals "to be discussed with our allies" on who should get which jobs at the summit of a series of international organisations. Due to a series of changes of the guard, the top jobs are becoming available at the European Commission, the OECD, GATT, or rather the World Trade Organisation that is to succeed it, and the Western European Union. The appointments should be considered "as a whole, not one name at a time," said Martino. On the fringe of the OECD meeting, Martino met European Commission Deputy President, Sir Leon Brittan, one of the candidates to succeed Jacques Delors as the Commission's presidency.
