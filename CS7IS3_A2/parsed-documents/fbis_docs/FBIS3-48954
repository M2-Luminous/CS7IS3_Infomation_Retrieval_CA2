If the European Union and NATO do not admit the Eastern European countries, Russia would seek to re-assert its influence in the region, said the president. If Europe and NATO decided within a short period of time, six months at the most, to expand gradually towards the European countries that were communist, then the field of confrontation would diminish, Walesa stressed. He added that otherwise Russia will take the initiative, exercising economic pressures on Poland and countries more important than Poland like Ukraine. We will have to give in to compromises and the former Soviet bloc will organise itself again, concluded Walesa.
