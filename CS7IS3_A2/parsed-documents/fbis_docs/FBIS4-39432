Meanwhile, Pyongyang is threatening to withdraw once and for all from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The majority of Security Council members no longer has any doubt that the introduction of sanctions against the DPRK is the best means of forcing the North Korean leadership to come to its senses. However, Moscow views such a development as extremely undesirable. Trading interests aside, there is also the Russian Embassy in the DPRK, which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs fears would become the target of the "uncontrollable wrath of the Korean people" -- to use Pyongyang's terminology. Our diplomats and their families would feel this wrath directly were Russia to support any sanctions, whose introduction Pyongyang assesses as "a declaration of war." Meanwile, our military experts are already analyzing the possible reaction of the North Korean leadership to the introduction of sanctions. A military specialist who worked in the DPRK for several years told IZVESTIYA that field commanders are in a state of constant stress. Especially those whose subunits are stationed in the region of the demilitarized zone. No one can predict what may prompt a salvo of fire on Seoul from the almost 10,000 North Korean guns stationed in this extremely dangerous region.
