Hashemi-Rafsanjani, in a meeting with Qian, urged Iran and China to play a "more active" international role in order to ward off "interference" by Western powers. "Such a goal requires planning, cooperation, and further exchanges of views between the regional countries, particularly Iran and China," Hashemi-Rafsanjani said, according to his office. The president urged Asian countries not to allow "domineering powers" to gain influence in Central Asian states and other regional countries in the "guise of solving their problems." The ex-Soviet republics of Central Asia are Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan. Qian, who arrived here Friday at the head of a political and economic delegation, said cooperation between Tehran and Beijing had accelerated after the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran "because of their common political views." He agreed on the "need to resist" the influence of foreign powers in the region, a reason for which China was "determined to strengthen cooperation with countries like Iran," according to Hashemi-Rafsanjani's office. Qian stressed the "need to ensure peace and stability in Central Asia to pave the way for economic progress" in the former Soviet republics. "China supports economic prosperity in these countries and desires closer cooperation with Iran to solve regional crisis," he said. Qian, who is here on the last leg of a tour of five Asian and Middle Eastern countries, is to leave for home Sunday. An Iranian newspaper said Saturday that Tehran could serve as "Asia's Geneva" in solving the regional conflicts and urged major Asian countries, such as China and India, to support the idea. "Tehran, a city synonymous with peace, possesses the necessary qualities and the good will to realise the idea," the English-language TEHRAN TIMES said. Qian also held talks with his counterpart 'Ali Akbar Velayati and was to meet later with parliamentary speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri. The two countries were also expected to discuss expansion of trade and economic cooperation and settling Iran's 100 million dollars in overdue debt to China. Bilateral trade stands at around 700 million dollars, with China exporting 300 million dollars, mainly in machinery, and importing 400 million dollars, mostly in oil and steel. Tehran and Beijing could discuss Chinese participation in several projects here, including the completion of the Tehran subway and construction of several cement plants and dams throughout Iran. Newspapers said here in November that Tehran and Beijing had agreed to undertake a 60-million dollar project for building a copper foundry in southeastern Iran. Iran and China are to launch a wide range of agricultural cooperation projects including sending Chinese experts to help in raising bees, fish and shrimp, according to Chinese sources.
