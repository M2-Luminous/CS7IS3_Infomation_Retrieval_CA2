FR941005-0-00038 FR941005-0-00011 Service response: The Service announced on June 12, 1991, that it was reviewing the status of arctic peregrine falcons and considering whether proposing to delist the subspecies was warranted. The Service notified the federal governments of Canada and Greenland of the status review and asked that they provide pertinent information and comments on whether delisting was appropriate. Neither nation stated a position on delisting but numerous biologists and resource managers within Canada provided the Service with information on the status of the subspecies in Canada. On September 30, 1993, the Service proposed to delist the subspecies and again the governments of Canada and Greenland were asked to provide information and to comment on delisting. The response of the anatum Peregrine Falcon Recovery Team, Canadian Wildlife Service, stated that ``the proposal to remove the arctic peregrine falcon from the U.S. list of endangered and threatened wildlife seems well justified by the population increases and sustained productivity that is documented in the September 30, 1993 Federal Register .'' One specific concern was raised (see Comment 4 above) concerning the harvest of arctic peregrine falcons for falconry; this concern will be addressed by the Service when harvest regulations are formulated under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. No comments were received from the government of Greenland. Comment 10: The data presented in the proposal indicate that populations in some areas have declined for the last two years. The Service attempted to discount this trend as being the result of ``exceptional years.'' Service response: Surveys of nesting peregrine falcons at Hope Bay and Coppermine, NWT, are conducted by helicopter at about the time that falcons in these areas are hatching (Shank et al. 1993). Failed or non-nesting pairs may be absent at nesting cliffs during single, brief visits to cliffs, so may go undetected in this type of survey (C. Shank, pers. comm., 1992). As a result, annual variation in the number of pairs counted can be greatly affected by annual variation in nesting success. In years with good success, most pairs have viable nests and are present when nest sites are checked. In years with poor nest success, many pairs may have failed by the time surveys are conducted and the adults may go undetected. Annual variation in nesting success is large at Hope Bay and Coppermine, and is probably caused by the extreme weather conditions found near the coast in arctic areas (C. Shank, pers. comm., 1992). Regression analysis provides a means of detecting and describing trends in the number of pairs found at these areas despite annual variation. Regression analysis shows that the number of pairs at Coppermine and Hope Bay has increased significantly since surveys began and that the rate of population growth has averaged about 10 percent per year. Furthermore, surveys in 1993 showed a slight increase from the previous year at Hope Bay and a substantial increase from 1992 at Coppermine (see Summary section above). The Service believes, therefore, that despite several short-term decreases in the number of pairs detected, local populations at both Hope Bay and Coppermine have shown considerable growth in the last 10 to 12 years. Furthermore, the Service believes that decreases seen between 1990 and 1992 do not indicate that populations are declining in either area. Comment 11: The recovery plan established four criteria to be met before delisting should be considered but only two of the four currently have been met. The data on organochlorine concentrations in eggs and eggshell thickness (the two criteria that have not been met) are unpublished and as such have not been verified and validated by scientists. Service response: As required by the Act, the Service collected all available information on the status of arctic peregrine falcons before deciding whether delisting was warranted. Much of the available information is unpublished. In using unpublished data, the Service is able to include the most recently acquired data as well as data collected by a broader array of sources. The Service recognizes, however, that unpublished data have not been subjected to review by the scientific community. The unpublished data and the Service's interpretation of that data were presented to the scientific community for review in the proposal to delist, which was published in the Federal Register (September 30, 1993). Since the Federal Register is not widely read among scientists, the Service sent copies to and requested comments from over 30 professional biologists that have worked with peregrine falcons in Greenland, Canada, and the United States. Additionally, copies were sent to members of the Western Peregrine Falcon Recovery Team, a number of professional ornithological organizations, the appropriate natural resource agencies in seven provinces and territories in Canada, and every State fish and game agency in the United States. Several professional biologists or resource managers expressed support for delisting_none expressed opposition to delisting. Furthermore, neither the validity of any data contained in the proposal nor the Service's interpretation of the data were questioned. Summary of Factors Affecting the Species According to the Act and implementing regulations outlined in 50 CFR part 424, a species shall be listed if the Secretary of the Interior determines that one or more of five factors listed in section 4(a)(1) of the Act threatens the continued existence of the species. A species may be delisted, according to ยง424.11(d), if the best scientific and commercial data available substantiate that the species is neither Endangered or Threatened for one of the following reasons: 1. Extinction; 2. Recovery; or 2. Original data for classification of the species were in error. After a thorough review of all available information, the Service has determined that arctic peregrine falcons are no longer endangered or threatened with extinction. A substantial recovery has taken place since the 1970's, and none of the five factors addressed in section 4(a)(1) of the Act currently jeopardizes the continued existence of arctic peregrine falcons. These factors and their relevance to arctic peregrine falcons are as follows: A. The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range. Arctic peregrine falcons nest in arctic tundra regions of Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. They migrate through the mid-latitudes of North America across a broad front, but concentrate in some coastal and estuarine areas along the Atlantic coast and Gulf of Mexico. Migrants also pass through inland areas including the Great Lakes, Great Plains, and Rocky Mountains, although the relative importance of coastal and inland habitats to migrants is unknown. Most arctic peregrine falcons spend the winter in Latin America, but some winter as far north as southern Florida. Although the rate of habitat alteration in nesting, migration, and wintering habitats is greater now than in the past, the rapid increase in the number of arctic peregrine falcons during the last 15 years indicates that habitat modification does not currently threaten the continued existence of the subspecies.
