Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Haji Ahmad Badawi said it would be improper for the summit to be attended only by certain countries. He also called for the summit to be immediately convened because time is running out. He said Malaysia may show a positive attitude and hopes that a settlement will be achieved although it is not so sure about the matter. He was commenting on reports that U.S. President Bill Clinton had welcomed President Boris Yeltsin's proposal that a summit on Bosnia- Herzegovina be held. Meanwhile, the International Parliamentary Group on Bosnia- Herzegovina [IPGB] has urged Muslim nations and the Third World to consider immediate concrete steps to protect that country and its people. Mr. Kassim Ahmad, member of the IPGB Secretariat, said the latest developments -- the attack by Serbian terrorists on the town of Gorazde -- proves that the United Nations no longer serves as an effective and authoritative international organization that can maintain the security of its member nations. In a statement in Penang today, he said the IPGB fully supported Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's statement that the United Nations had failed and colluded with the Serbian terrorists in their efforts to capture Gorazde and impose a partial and unfair peace plan on Bosnia-Herzegovina.
