It says that protective measures should be immediately taken to provide maximum protection for people and property from possible attacks by the NATO air force. It stresses that it is necessary to tidy up cellars and communal shelters and secure the most basic quantities of food and equipment for administering first aid to the wounded. In the event of attack one should behave sensibly and follow instructions by civil defense officials. The Command of the Herzegovina Corps believes that the territory of Serbian Herzegovina can be threatened by deliberate bombardment as well as by technical faults along the flight path of NATO aircraft. It also points out the possibility of aircraft carrying lethal loads being shot down or crashing into each other and their dropping lethal loads at random on inhabited settlements. "Serb units are taking every measure to protect free territory and the population from possible attacks by the NATO air force and they will warn the population in time about any possible threat from the air," the Command of the Herzegovina Corps says in its warning announcement.
