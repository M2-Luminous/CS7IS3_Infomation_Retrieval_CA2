And that a meeting was actually held in Algiers recently between Iraqi and Kuwaiti officials for the first time since the Gulf war. The sources said that Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad's visit to Algiers during his Maghreb tour this week was not actually made at the invitation of the Algerian Foreign Ministry as mentioned in the joint press statement issued at the end of the visit. It was made at the Kuwaiti foreign minister's request and in response to the Kuwaiti Government's attempt to break the isolation imposed on Kuwait since the Gulf war. But Algeria, on receiving the Kuwaiti request, proposed -- or, rather, made it a condition -- that Algerian mediation should be initiated between Kuwait and Iraq during the Kuwaiti foreign minister's visit in return for announcing that the visit was made at the Algerian Foreign Ministry's invitation. Kuwait agreed to the Algerian proposal and hence the visit took place. The Algerian Foreign Ministry believes the visit will achieve success for it with regard to the two countries, Iraq and Kuwait. [passage omitted] The sources said that Kuwait's attempts to achieve rapprochement with the Arab states that supported Iraq in the Gulf war began not so long ago. In this connection Kuwait sent two ministers to Algeria before Foreign Minister Sabah al-Ahmad's visit. These visits were not covered by the official media because of Kuwait's refusal in the past to receive any Algerian official. [passage omitted] It is worth mentioning that the Kuwaiti foreign minister's visit took place only two weeks after the visit to Algeria by Barzan al-Tikriti, adviser to the Iraqi president, who delivered a message to Algerian President Liamine Zeroual from Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. No information was issued about Barzan's visit. His activities remained almost secret. Even Iraqi Embassy officials in Algiers did not know the reason for Barzan's visit to Algeria or its results.
