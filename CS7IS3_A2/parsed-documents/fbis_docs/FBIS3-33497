On 22 February, the Army commander in chief, General Raoul Cedras, did not answer the invitation of the alternative office of the chamber led by Senator Bernard Sansaricq. This invitation was reported; the session has been postponed to 23 February at 1100. Sen. Thomas Eddy Dupiton says that all the country's authorities are concerned about the Haitian situation and must look for a solution to the crisis. Sen. Dupiton asked Gen. Raoul Cedras to guarantee the safety of the legislators. We should say that this session was punctuated with nationalist speeches. For her part, Sen. Margareth Martin asked the parliamentarians to fill the vacuum of the executive power -- the vacuum created by the resignation of Prime Minister Robert Malval.
