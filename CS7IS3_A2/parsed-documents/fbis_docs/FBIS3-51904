During a working meeting with his Brazilian counterpart Celso Amorim at the Foreign Ministry yesterday, Sunsiri decided to postpone the opening of a Thai commercial bureau in Brazil. The minister decided rather to begin by seeking to promote commercial and economic ties with Brazil, and by sponsoring a seminar in 1994 for entrepreneurs to exchange views and become acquainted with the economic situations in the two countries. For Sunsiri the main problem is distance, for which reason Brazil "does not import products like jewels, electronics, and textiles" from his country. In 1992 the bilateral exchange stood at $367 million, of which $13.3 million are accounted for by Thai exports. Brazilian sales on the Thai market amounted to $353.7 million. The Thai minister added that the two countries do not have the same economic potential. In the technological field, he said, Brazil is ahead in some areas, while Thailand is ahead in others. "We must use this in joint investments, `joint ventures,' and in cooperation with other markets," he said. "Within the foreseeable future I see the economies of Europe and the United States going through a period of recession, while the economies of Asian and Pacific countries will grow." Sunsiri said that in the 21st century Brazil will have to look toward the Pacific in a different manner, as an alternative to dependence on European and U.S. markets. The minister is accompanied by three entrepreneurs: Kanchana Thaichon, of Thailand's Chamber of Commerce; Prasert Poongkumarn, senior vice president of C.P. Trading Company, and Suphat Wibulseth, of the same enterprise. The C.P. Trading Company is Thailand's biggest group, with investment in various sectors such as farm industries and telecommunications. The entrepreneurs will afterwards visit Santiago de Chile and Buenos Aires. The objective of the tour of Chile and Argentina is to sound out opportunities for investment. Chile, the minister said, will become a full APEC -- Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation -- member in 1995. Brazilian imports from Thailand include natural rubber products, motorcycle accessories, cameras, watches, and teleprinters.
