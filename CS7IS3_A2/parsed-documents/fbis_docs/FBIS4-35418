"We are with legitimacy in Yemen, with the unity of its land and with respecting the reconciliation accord" which was signed in Amman in February by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his then-Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani told the Jordan Times Monday. Dr. al-'Anani said the Kingdom has not taken sides with either of the parties to the conflict, which developed into civil war on May 4. He said the official media's reference to the government in Aden as "the legitimate government" and to the forces of Mr. al-Bid as the "secessionists" does not mean that the Kingdom has sided with Sanaa against Aden. "Jordan supports the unity of Yemen," he said. It did not therefore refer to the warring parties as north and south because that "would mean you have accepted the secession," Dr. al-'Anani said. "We will not take a stand against legitimacy and say north and south," he said. The position of the official media is right. They are calling things by their name because those who declared secession are secessionists," former foreign minister, Deputy Abdallah al-Nusur told the Jordan Times. Insisting that this position does not mean the Kingdom has taken sides with either of the conflicting parties in yemen, Dr. al-Nusur said "Jordan has a record of not interfering in the internal affairs of any other country." Though blaming the south for seceding, Islamic Action Front (IAF) deputy 'Abd al-Rahim 'Ukur said: "We did not hear any Jordanian official saying the Kingdom has taken sides in the conflict." Dr. 'Ukur blamed Arab regimes that he said have supported one party in Yemen against the other, adding that "these attitudes only serve the objectives of the United States and its satellite states in the region. Jordan supports the unity of the Yemeni people and land but does not work to impose anything on them, Lower House of Parliament member Salih Irshaydat said. If this support of unity was interpreted to mean that the Kingdom has taken sides in the conflict then that is a wrong interpretation, he said. "We are with unity as long as it is the wish of the Yemeni people," Dr. Irshaydat said. His Majesty King Husayn had earlier said that the Kingdom will provide humanitarian assistance to Yemen but will not interfere in the internal affairs of the war-torn Arab peninsula country. North Yemen has previously rejected any foreign intervention in the civil war, which has been raging for over three weeks without leading to a decisive military victory. Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali had said that Jordan would not mediate in the conflict unless both parties to it agree on its role, adding that the Kingdom would not "interfere in support of either parties to the crisis." AKHIR KHABAR Arab daily Monday reported that a group of journalists it did not name have protested to Dr. al-'Anani what it called "the biased coverage of the Yemeni war by the official media." The paper quoted the group as telling the minisiter in a statement that such an attitude would not allow Jordan to play any positive role in trying to mediate the conflict in the future.
