Answering SNARK correspondent's question on the appraisal of Armenian Government's concrete actions, Nersesiants noted that Armenia has successfully accomplished land privatization. "Other countries need 20-30 years of persuasions to make such a step", stressed he. In Nersesiants's view, housing privatization and open trade also provide favorable image for Armenia. However, the reforms in financial system are being postponed. "Yet, strategic course of Armenian economy's development is appraised by the World Bank highly enough", said Vahram Nersesiants.
