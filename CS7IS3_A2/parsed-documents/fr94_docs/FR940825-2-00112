FR940825-2-00112 FR940825-2-00073 The Judgment enjoins Johnson and Bayer from entering into any agreement to allocate territories or markets for the distribution or sale of household insecticides, unless such an agreement relates exclusively to markets other than the United States and has no effect on United States commerce, and requires that Bayer license Cyfluthrin to any person on reasonable terms and conditions. 1 Further, the Final Judgment provides the Department with the opportunity to review any future exclusive licenses for new active ingredients that Johnson might seek to obtain from Bayer or any other person. 2 1 In this respect, the Judgment provides relief somewhat similar to the terms of a settlement of private litigation to which the defendants were also parties, Koerber v. S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. and Bayer A.G., Civil No. 93C 20267, N.D. Ill. 1993. However, the Judgment, unlike the private settlement, leaves Bayer free to decide whether to license Cyfluthrin to others on terms more favorable than its license with Johnson. 2 The Judgment would prevent Bayer and Johnson from entering into any exclusive license for any active ingredient if the Department of Justice has disapproved such license within 90 days after receiving notice of defendants' intent to enter into the agreement. The Judgment requires the defendants to file annual reports with the Government that certify that each has distributed the Final Judgment to responsible executives and explained the terms of the Judgment to them. Entry of the Final Judgment will terminate the Government's action against the defendants, 3 except that the Court will retain jurisdiction over the matter for further proceedings that may be required to interpret, enforce or modify the Judgment, or to punish violations of any of its provisions. 3 Bayer and Johnson have cooperated with the Department of Justice in this matter. II Description of the Activities Involved in the Alleged Violations During a three-year period between 1985 and March 1988, Miles, Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of Bayer, developed a new line of household insecticides to be marketed under the brand name ``Laser.'' The Laser products were to have contained a potent new active ingredient, Cyfluthrin, a chemical compound developed and patented by Bayer. Cyfluthrin promised to provide Laser a significant competitive advantage over existing U.S. household insecticides because it extended the insecticide's killing power up to three months after initial application. By early 1988, Miles had substantially completed its preparations to enter the U.S. household insecticides market. Evidence indicates that its entry would have been successful. According to Miles' projections, first-year sales of Laser products would have made Miles one of the nation's leading makers of household insecticides. In March 1988, however, Bayer canceled the Laser project. It instead agreed to sell Miles' Laser-related product research and packaging design to Johnson, and to license Johnson to use Cyfluthrin in its household insecticide products. 4 4 Although the patent license states that it is nonexclusive, the United States believes that the license was actually exclusive. Bayer was subsequently approached by several Johnson competitors for Cyfluthrin licenses; it declined to license them to use the compound. Under the terms of that ten-year license agreement, Johnson agreed to pay Bayer a minimum of $5.2 million annually in addition to a specified per pound fee for the use of Cyfluthrin. In addition, Johnson acquired a right of first refusal to any other active ingredient Bayer later developed. Through this agreement, the United States alleges, Bayer effectively chose not to compete in the U.S. household insecticides market, instead, licensing to Johnson the right to use those assets Bayer had assembled and would require to compete in the United States. The agreement helped ensure Johnson's continued dominance of the highly concentrated U.S. household insecticides market. Johnson is the leading maker of household insecticides with somewhere between 45&hyph;60 percent of total market sales. It is significantly larger than any of its six major competitors, whose market shares range from 6 to 12 percent of overall sales. By purchasing some of the assets Bayer would have used in entering the market, and entering into what was in effect an exclusive license for Cyfluthrin, Johnson effectively eliminated competition that could have helped drive down prices or improve the quality of household insecticides. Because new entry or expansion in this market is difficult in light of the high cost and significant time it takes to comply with federal and state governmental regulations, new entry into or expansion within this market is unlikely to militate against the anti-competitive effects of the defendants' agreement. III Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment The United States, Johnson and Bayer have stipulated that the Court may enter the proposed Final Judgment at any time after compliance with the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง16(b)-(h). The Judgment provides that its entry does not constitute any evidence or admission by any party with respect to any issue of fact or law. Under the provisions of Section 2(e) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง16(e), the Judgment may not be entered unless the Court finds entry is in the public interest. Section XI of the proposed Final Judgment set forth such a finding. A. Terms The Judgment provides that: (1) Johnson and Bayer are each enjoined and restrained from entering into any agreement or understanding, the purpose or effect of which would be to allocate or divide, territories or markets for the distribution or sale of household insecticides, unless any such agreement or understanding relates exclusively to markets other than the United States and has no effect on United States commerce.
