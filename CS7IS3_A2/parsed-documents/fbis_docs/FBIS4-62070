"Notification about this will be given 60 days in advance," Viktor Yushchenko, the chairman of the board of the National Bank of Ukraine [NBU], has told a UNIAN correspondent. The ban is to take effect in the summer of this year. Viktor Yushchenko made the following comment: "Fighting dollarization has always been an element of national currency stabilization at a certain point in the financial stabilization of the state. It is the national currency having the exclusive right to circulation on the market of the state, rather than the conclusion of contracts in foreign currency being prohibited, that is at issue. The ban will concern goods trade for foreign currency and will extend to every single foreign currency." The NBU chairman of the board recalled that at the third attempt dollar circulation had been banned in Russia from 1 January of this year. In the Baltic countries, that had been done a year and a half ago. In Viktor Yushchenko's words, "the directive cannot achieve full prohibition, and even after a legal ban the dollar is still in circulation in Russia." The NBU chairman of the board did not rule out that the same situation could occur in Ukraine. In his words, "it is hard to imagine the French franc being in circulation in the Canadian province of Quebec only because the majority of the province's population is francophone." The NBU chairman of the board is convinced Kiev is to retain its monopoly in currency policy regulation. "The circulation of the Russian ruble in separate regions and in Crimea in particular, is out of the question."
