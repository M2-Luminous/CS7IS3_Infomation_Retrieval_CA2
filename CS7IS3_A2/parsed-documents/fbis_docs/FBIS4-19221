The explosive device, consisting of three cartons linked with wires and batteries, was spotted by the manager of a nearby service station, who alerted the police. The bomb had been placed in the gutter of the via Formellese, a small road leading into and out of Rome, and had been covered by tree branches. A special bomb unit was called in to deal with the device. The controlled explosion was heard for miles around, and windows were shattered in nearby houses, which had been evacuated. According to well-informed sources, the bomb was planted near the home of Mafia supergrass Salvatore Contorno, but police refused to comment on speculation that Contorno was the target for the bomb. Interior Ministry sources said that "at this point nothing can be ruled out." Contorno is reported to live about seven km from the point where the bomb was placed, but does not travel that road every evening, well-informed sources said. The device was blown up by a robot after explosives experts examined it and failed to defuse it manually. The robot directed a jet of water towards it, causing an explosion, but detailed photographs were taken beforehand. Investigators are now combing the fields around the bomb site for the remains of the device which, the sources said, was probably to have been set off by means of a radio command. Contorno, 48, settled down in the area near Lake Bracciano north of Rome after an unsuccessful attempt at living under a witness protection scheme in the United States. He was arrested a first time in the Lake Bracciano region in 1982, when another supergrass, Tommaso Buscetta, persuaded him to collaborate with the authorities. His confessions led to 127 arrest warrants, but the collaboration slowed down and then dried up completely because, he said, "many of the people I accused were acquiteed and set free. Today the Mafia is stronger than ever, and Cosa Nostra's vendetta could strike me at any moment." Contorno has lost 19 members of his and his wife's family in Mafia vendettas, and about thirty of his friends have fallen under Mafia bullets. In a statement to ANSA this evening, Contorno's lawyer Luigi Li Gotti said "they predicted this. These mafiosi turned state's evidence have said many times that there would be bloody attacks against them." According to Maria Rita Bonafede, the mayor of Formello where Contorno lives, the supergrass has no police escort, unlike former magistrate Carlo Palermo who occasionally visits the area to rest in his house outside the town.
