With David Hunt, the Employment Secretary, sitting out because of the British opt-out, they approved a directive to establish European works councils in transnational companies with at least 1,000 employees in the community outside Britain. The law is designed to ensure that workers are consulted about strategic corporate decisions which could affect their livelihood, such as changing technology, shifts in production from one country to another, or large-scale redundancies. Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, said the decision was an historic breakthrough after 23 years of argument. He claimed the law could improve the competitiveness of business by strengthening its most important asset -- good relations between managements and their staff. "We have reaffirmed in a dramatic way the commitment of member states to maintain social progress at the same time as other policies," he said. But Mr Hunt said the decision to establish "trade-union dominated works councils" was a dreadful mistake which would "impose unnecessary costs and bureaucracy on companies at a time when the overwhelming need is to reduce costs and increase employment." The measure was opposed by every employers group in Europe, he said. Up to 100 of the largest British-based multinationals might be affected by the legislation because they have more than 1,000 employees in the EU outside Britain and meet the threshold of at least 150 in two or more of the other 11 member states. They will be obliged to set up works councils for their continental and Irish employees. "But they will be free to decide for themselves what arrangements they have for consulting and informing their staff in Britain," Mr Hunt said. He presented this as a benefit of the opt-out, but this interpretation was disputed by Norbert Blum, the German labour minister, who said: "Modern entrepreneurs must have a system of informing their employees if they are going to make headway. This is all about motivation and we can't have the standards of the last century." Mr Flynn said the evidence from company boardrooms was that they intended to apply the directive right throughout the EU. "De jure this legislation covers the 11, de facto it will be applied across the 12," he said. He estimated that 1,500 multinationals would be affected in the EU as a whole, of which 15 to 100 would be based in Britain. John Monks, general secretary of the TUC [Trade Union Council], said yesterday: "I regret the British government opt-out means some British workers will be denied rights that obtain elsewhere, but I am confident that many of the British-based companies concerned will take the sensible course and apply the same provisions to their British operations." The legislation agreed yesterday is expected to pass through the European Parliament in September and to receive a second and final approval from the Council of Ministers before the end of the year. The 11 member states then have up to two years to transpose it into their national law. The directive is designed to encourage managements to agree arrangements with their trade unions for consulting employees in the way which best suits the style of the business. Its legislative bite lies in a fall-back procedure which imposes works council machinery if these negotiations fail. On a proposal from the French government, the allowable negotiating period was extended from two to three years. This means no compulsory machinery can be established before the year 2000, but Mr Flynn believes there is now the incentive for firms to start negotiating immediately. Another amendment approved yesterday was to restrict the legislation to firms with at least 150 employees in two or more member states, instead of 100. The social affairs council gave final approval for a directive to prevent the exploitation of young workers, including a controversial exemption to allow 14 and 15-year-olds in Britain to continue to work more than 12 hours a week. Mr Hunt said this was a "UK opt-out" which would protect British schoolchildren's traditional right to earn pocket money by delivering newspapers and gaining work experience from a few hours work at weekends. Mr Flynn said there was a temporary concession, but no opt-out. Britain would have to legislate to comply with the directive within the next six years because the exemption would automatically expire unless the European Commission proposed its renewal, which it would never contemplate.
