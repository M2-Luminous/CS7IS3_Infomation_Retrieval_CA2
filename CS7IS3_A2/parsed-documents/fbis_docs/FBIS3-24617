This was followed, in the same place, by another seminar organized by UNICEF, the Kazakhstan Ministry of Health and the Bobek Children's Charitable Fund. This time, the talks revolved around the subject of a program of controlling pneumonia among children in Kazakhstan. What prompted such representative meetings of physicians in Alma-Ata? At the newspaper's request, Aman Duysekeyev, deputy health minister of the Republic of Kazakhstan, shared his thoughts: First, let me cite some figures: in our republic 40 children are born per hour, but there is also one death per hour, which is indicative of high infant mortality. Analysis of child morbidity revealed that it has risen everywhere. For example, the highest incidence of infectious diseases is noted in Kzyl-Orda and Mangistau oblasts, and the city of Alma-Ata. Most often, blood and hemopoietic organ diseases are detected in the above-mentioned oblasts, as well as Semipalatinsk Oblast. In our opinion, the rise in morbidity among tots is related, first of all, to the poor ecological situation in this republic and worsening of the people's socio-economic status. Infant mortality is one of the most sensitive indicators of socio-economic development of society, which comprises the educational and cultural level, condition of the environment, efficacy of preventive measures, medicogenetic consultations, availability and quality of medical care, distribution of social and material wealth. It has been established that the highest indictors of infant mortality are observed in oblasts with a high birthrate, since they have the poorest obstetric and pediatric care resources, and lowest per capita consumption of basic foods. And this enables us to conclude that planning of resource capabilities of mother and child care services was carried out for many years without consideration of the regional distinctions (in the sense of high or low birthrate). True, for the last few years emphasis has been placed on the regional conception of distribution of resources. But the difficult socio-economic situation, reduction in funds allocated to medicine from the State budget have diminished the capacity to carry out the work that was begun. Yet we are dealing with children. Today, more than ever, safeguarding their health requires effective government support. What else causes infant mortality? Studies carried out by the Kazakh Scientific research Institute of Pediatrics show that the more abortions are used as a birth control method, the higher the gynecological pathology, the more often there are complications of pregnancy, considerable share of premature infants, while the risk of infant mortality increases 20-fold. The physical condition and morbidity rate of children, particularly in infancy, is also directly related to how they are fed. Yet requirements such as keeping mother and infant together in maternity homes, and immediate nursing of the infant are not followed actively enough in Kazakhstan. And this can ultimately lead to catastrophic rise in number of infants deprived of maternal milk. Even now, in this republic only half the infants up to the age of 3 months and one-third of those up to 6 months old are breast fed. This cannot fail to cause alarm. Especially since the prognosis is depressing, since Kazakhstan does not have its own baby food industry, and support of breast feeding involves major socioeconomic difficulties. In most of the world's nations, including CIS states, prevention and treatment of respiratory diseases is one of the pressing socio-medical problems. In our republic, for example, bronchopulmonary pathology among children constitutes more than 64 percent of all diseases. Thus, the rise in incidence of acute pneumonia among tots in Atyrau, Zhezkazgan, Kzyl-Orda and South Kazakhstan oblasts is attributable to inadequate supply of necessary equipment to the roentgenological service, difficulties in making the exact diagnosis, and problems of professional training of pediatricians, particularly on the primary level. The high incidence of pathology of respiratory organs among children is related not only to unsolved medical, but also socioeconomic, ecological and ethnic problems. For this reason, only a comprehensive approach is needed to solve this problem. In recent years, many scientists have concluded that it is important to instruct mothers on first medicosanitary aid. As shown by studies, the education of moms was instrumental in establishing a health lifestyle, expanding knowledge about acute respiratory infections, and helped lower infant mortality by 29 percent. Consequently, we consider primary prevention and hygienic education of the public to be the chief role of out-patient and polyclinic institutions. At this stage of economic and social transformations, and with changing demographic processes, the most important task to health care practice is to preserve the life of every infant. And I should like to state through AZIYA, which devoted a page in its preceding issue to the problem of mother and child health the following: everything we discussed above will be only a good intention unless funding of health care in Kazakhstan is carried out on the basis of scientifically validated forecasts and more generous investment in programs that guarantee the health of children and women.
