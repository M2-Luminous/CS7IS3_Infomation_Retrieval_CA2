The proposed land tax is composed of 3 sub-taxes. These are, a tax on undeveloped land bought for purposes of speculation, a tax on land price increases and a tax on capital assets. The objective of the first tax is to "eliminate the buying and selling of land which is causing land prices to rise, leading to problems for foreign investors", according to a ministerial statement. "In particular, the intention is to make owners of such unused land pay taxes to the state, or encourage them to sell or rent their land to businessmen looking for a base for their industrial or commercial operations," the statement added. The rate of this tax would rise progressively in proportion to the time over which the land stays undeveloped. For example, the state would tax two per cent on the cost price of the land for the first year and thereby increase this by two per cent each year, so that by the fifth year, owners of undeveloped land would have to pay 10 per cent of the land's cost price. The second tax, which is aimed at discouraging the rise in land prices, that is owned privately and by commercial companies. For land owned by private individuals, this land tax rate would be the same as that levied for personal income. That is, 10 per cent to 30 per cent on the profit gained on the land at the time of resale. In the case of commercial companies, profits on land sales would be taxed the same rate as for other profits, at 20 per cent. The tax on capital assets has been confined by the Ministry to a yearly tax levied on the third house, or more, owned by a private individual in a town. The tax, with a rate of two to three per cent of the estimated market price of the house, is designed not to penalise farmers or those living in the countryside. The system of land taxes is welcome news for investors, especially the tax on undeveloped land bought for purposes of speculation. The recent visit of the business delegation from Malaysia highlighted the problem of escalating land prices and the lack of industrial parks for setting up labour-intensive industries. Businessmen pointed out that the favourable conditions created for investment and sustained by agencies like the Cambodia Development Council would be crippled by the unavailability of competitively priced land. This includes not only the kingdom's capital but outlying urban centres like Sihanoukville. However, some observers say that the taxes are not differentiated enough, especially the tax charged on land speculation. Investors might need to hold on to land until conditions are deemed more propitious for developing it, given the security situation. The solution would lie in the comprehensive nature of the new tax regime introduced by Sam Rangsi's Ministry. These include the Salaries Tax, the Tax on Construction Licenses and the Profits Tax on import-export companies. Their overall objective is to "broaden the revenue base which is at present heavily dependent on customs duties, particularly those levied on reexports". The Minister has already declared that the objective of the tax reforms is to achieve a more balanced distribution between direct and indirect taxation, and to avoid over-reliance on customs revenue. Most of the foreign companies in the kingdom indicate their presence here as involving commercial and social obligations. Their projections for rates of return are based on medium-term and longterm investment strategies. The reform of the customs' systems and its fiscal structure has already managed to increase government revenue eightfold. This has allowed the government to fund its public sector deficit without having to demonetise the currency. It has also allowed the control of the previous runaway inflation. The new tax regime is aimed at further stabilising the economic environment towards encouraging investment possibilities.
