Chiang said Sunday [20 February]. Chiang made the remarks upon returning from Subic where he and Philippine Trade Secretary Rizalino Navarro jointly presided over a groundbreaking ceremony for the Taiwan-invested industrial park. During the ceremony, Richard Gordon, chairman of the Subic Bay metropolitan authority, and M.H. Huang, chairman of Taiwan's United Development Corp. signed an agreement for joint development of the industrial park. A number of high-ranking Philippine officials and a 140-member Taiwan business delegation also attended the ceremony. The Taiwan industrial park will be developed over a 325 hectare area in three stages using a US$23.5 million soft loan from Taiwan. The park is only one kilometer from a port and 10 minutes from an international airport. Because of its easy transportation access, Chiang has suggested that Subic Bay be developed into Taiwan's fourth export processing zone. Subic Bay is an ideal choice for Taiwan investors, he added. It boasts almost-free rent, a free-market economic system and abundant, low priced, English-speaking labor. The Philippine Government turned the former US Navy base at Subic, 80 km northwest of Manila, into a free port and industrial zone after US forces left in 1992. Since then, a great number of Taiwan companies have shown interest in investing in the area and 51 more this time said they would jump on the bandwagon. Taiwan investment is expected to pour US$1 billion into the industrial park and create 100,000 jobs, delivering a boost to the slumbering Philippine economy, the Manila-based Taipei Economic and Cultural Office said.
