In a statement from the Emergency Rule Region Governor's office the deaths of 18 terrorists in clashes with security forces in the provinces of Hakkari, Sirnak and Tunceli were reported. One of the dead was reported to be a high ranking member of an outlawed leftist organization who had escaped from Nevsehir prison some time ago. Two children named Saddulah Gokyavas and Nihat Aydin were killed in an explosion in a village in Bingol. It was said that the explosion might have been due to a mine or bomb left by soldiers. The mayor of Bingol, Selahattin Kaya confirmed the news. The soldiers had apparently dug a trench while they were in the area and had afterwards left. The explosion took place while the children were playing. The bodies of the children were taken to Bingol but it was reported that there was trouble at the scene of the autopsy.
