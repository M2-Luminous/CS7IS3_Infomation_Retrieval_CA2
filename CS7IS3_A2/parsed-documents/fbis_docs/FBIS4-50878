Zou Jiahua welcomed the representatives' visit. He said: Youth is the hope of our times. You not only are youths, but also company presidents. You have been doing important work in enterprises in Hong Kong and have played a very significant role in the economic development of the mainland and Hong Kong. Hong Kong's economic development, prosperity, and stability are inseparable from the mainland, and the mainland's economic development also needs Hong Kong's support. Therefore, it is very beneficial to both sides to increase economic cooperation and exchange between the two sides. The China and Hong Kong chapters of the Association of Young Company Presidents are organized by the heads of large Hong Kong companies, the second generation of famous Hong Kong entrepreneurs, and accomplished young businessmen in Hong Kong. The association has more than 100 members. The visiting group, which is made up of more than 80 young company presidents and led by Wang Mingang and Li Dazhuang, arrived in Beijing yesterday afternoon. This is the first visit to Beijing by a group of the two chapters since they were founded. Members of the group hoped that, through the visit, members of the association will have better understanding of the mainland. They especially hoped association members will gain in-depth understanding of the mainland's situation and policies since the policy of reform and opening up was adopted. During their stay in Beijing, members will visit the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and hold forums with officials of the State Commission for Economic Restructuring, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, and the Bank of China. Zou Jiahua briefed the group on the reform of China's taxation system, developing the economies in China's central and western regions, and his recent visits to the United States and Canada, which members of the group had been concerned about. Also attending today's meeting were Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office; Hu Deping, vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce; and persons in charge of relevant departments.
