FBIS4-1175 "drafr079_c_94008" FBIS-AFR-94-079 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA ANC Issues Statement ANC Issues Statement MB2504060194 Johannesburg SAPA in English 2057 GMT 24 Apr 94 MB2504060194 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Statement issued by the ANC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 24 April] [Text] Once again enemies of democracy have plunged our country and its people into a period of mourning with a car bomb-blast that left 9 people dead and 92 others wounded in the Johannesburg city centre on Sunday 24 April. According to eye-witness accounts, a white man was seen alighting from the car used in the blast and rushing away from the scene minutes before the explosion. In the ensuing explosion, ANC, PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], Cosatu [Congress of South African Trade Unions] offices in the vicinity, private homes and business premises were damaged. Windows, communication lines and computers at ANC headquarters and regional offices were seriously affected. A member of the ANC local government transitional team and ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional elections candidate Susan Keane, who was on her way to a meeting at ANC PWV regional office was killed. Her colleague and a member of the ANC PWV regional executive committee Joan Fubbs escaped unhurt but had to be treated for shock at a local hospital. Although the ANC cannot at this stage point accusing fingers at a specific organisation or persons, the ANC believes that the blast is an attack on peace, democracy and the forthcoming April 27 elections by a tiny minority. Their plans must not succeed. The ANC appeals to all our people, black and white not to be provoked into rash actions but to hand down their verdict on such heinous acts by massively turning out to the polls on April 27 to vote for democracy. The ANC extends its deepest sympathy to members of the bereaved families and wish those wounded a speedy recovery. We express our sympathy with all those whose homes and business premises have been damaged. In this regard, the ANC dips its banners in memory of one of our glorious daughters of our country, our beloved Susan Keane. It is unfortunate that she died at a time when all she had lived and struggled for throughout her life is about to come to fruition. Our people deserve the right to live without fear of violence and intimidation. The ANC calls for a speedy and thorough investigation into the cold-blooded murder and injury of innocent men and women of our country. In this context, we call for the arrest and prosecution of those responsible.
