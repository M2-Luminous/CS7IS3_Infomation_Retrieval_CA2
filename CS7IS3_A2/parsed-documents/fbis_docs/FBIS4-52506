Moriyoshi Sato, chief of the Hokkaido and Okinawa Development Agencies, said at a press conference after a cabinet meeting that the administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata "made the worst start. I'm ashamed of (such remarks) by our comrade. He resigned too late." Sato, like Nagano, belongs to Hata's Shinseito. Referring to the responsibility of Hata, who appointed Nagano as justice minister, Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi defined Nagano's resignation as a dismissal, saying that discharging the justice minister settled the matter. Transport Minister Nobuaki Futami expressed regret over the remarks by Nagano, saying he and Nagano had different perceptions of history and it was "natural" for Nagano to resign. Nagano, 71, who assumed the post of justice minister on April 28 in the new Hata administration, in an interview May 3 with the MAINICHI SHIMBUN, one of the country's major dailies, said, "I think that the Nanjing incident was a fabrication." Imperial Japanese Army troops slaughtered more than 300,000 Chinese civilians following the invasion of Nanjing in December 1937, according to Chinese estimates. Japanese historians tend to cite lower estimates and some argue the mass killings were caused by troops who got out of control. Nagano also told the MAINICHI that it was wrong to call Japan an aggressor in World War II. His remarks brought sharp criticism from neighboring countries, especially China and South and North Korea, which were invaded by Japan before the war. Nagano was replaced on Sunday by Hiroshi Nakai, a House of Representatives lawmaker of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP).
