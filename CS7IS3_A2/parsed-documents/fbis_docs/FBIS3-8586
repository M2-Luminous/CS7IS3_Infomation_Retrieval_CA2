Seventeen district heads and two government commissioners signed the document, also saying that Kovac's "reckless and false accusations" of Premier Vladimir Meciar and some members of the government "cannot be described as being other than an expedient aimed at destabilizing political situation and discrediting the government." They said that Kovac's "attacks" addressed to State Secretary of the Privatization Ministry Ivan Lexa were a show of "vanity incompatible with the post held by Michal Kovac," and that in this way, Kovac detracts from the weight of his office. The statement says that Kovac is playing into the hands of the forces which lost in the elections, were against the Slovak independence and work for its destruction.
