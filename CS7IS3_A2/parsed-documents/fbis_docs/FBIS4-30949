Under discussion were current political problems, on which the prime minister replied to numerous questions from representatives of the press. After the meeting, reporter Lydia Mrazova asked Jozef Moravcik for an interview. [Begin recording] [Mrazova] Today is 77 days since you became prime minister in this government, and during this short time -- you could describe it as such -- the opposition has tried to dismiss Roman Kovac and Minister Janicina. Do you think will there yet be another? [Moravcik] The tactics of the present opposition suggest that it will probably not stop playing this game, this destructive game, and that it will try to continue with it. I do not have any concrete information about who it might be. [Mrazova] And what about fears? [Moravcik] No fears, because until now the means of presentation tended to harm those presenting proposals for dismissal. [Mrazova] According to what you said, although the coalition was formed with partners of differing orientations, the coalition is functioning well. During the vote of confidence vote in the minister for the administration and privatization it transpired that even deputies from the coalition parties contributed several votes in favor if his dismissal. Some expressed the view in the lobby that although they will not be voting for his dismissal they consider him to be the weakest point in the government. I do not expect you to criticize your minister, but how would you characterize this post? [Moravcik] I have already said many times that privatization is a meeting point for a large number of conflicting interests and various organizations which exert various kinds of influence. What we call lobbies today are very strong. A minister in this position has to have a very firm character and also sound nerves because to manage all that, to resist all the pressures, and to organize and carry out privatization in such a way that it supports the government's policy is very demanding. It really is a very demanding position and I am satisfied with how the work is being carried out. So far, we have managed to overcome all the differences that have appeared, the different views that have appeared, which are entirely natural. [passage omitted] [end recording]
