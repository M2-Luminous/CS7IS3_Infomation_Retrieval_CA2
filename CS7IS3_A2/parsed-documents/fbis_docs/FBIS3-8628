The Croat-populated village of Lovrici near Gradacac in the north has been completely depopulated, which the Moslem media are trying to deny. Also, Croats in Zenica, central Bosnia, are selling out their property at a frenzied rate, a sure sign of preparations for a move-out. Moslem authorities have ordered the torching of Croat houses in the abandoned village of Zubici near Travnik, also in central Bosnia, and the two sides are trading accusations of burning and demolishing houses around Mostar in the south. On the Kiseljak front near Sarajevo on Friday, Moslem infantry forces attacked Croat positions at the locality of Kazagici in an effort to break into Croat-held territory, said Zagreb-based Croatian radio. The Croat troops fought back and repulsed the attack at no casualties to themselves, the source said. The Croatian radio correspondent in Mostar said on Friday that the exchange of prisoners, in the course of which Croats held in Bugojno, central Bosnia, and Moslem-controlled east Mostar should be released, "is not going well."
