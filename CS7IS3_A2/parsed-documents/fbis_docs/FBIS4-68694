The report was postponed until the first day after the holidays. The two-week delay has changed the context of the Yugoslav "showdown": both in consequence of the dynamic situation in the Balkans and on account of the Accord Treaty. Chapter One of the document contains clause 6, which was absent from the drafts of 20 and 26 April: "The subscribers to the treaty undertake to contribute in every possible way... to implementation of a unified national foreign policy course." The set goal of the delegation was to visit the territories of the parties to the conflict and to conduct an impartial investigation. Representatives of all registered factions headed by General Nikolay Bezborodov, from the communists, set out for the Balkans. There was piquancy in the fact that Deputy Bezborodov, deputy chairman of the Defense Committee, being a member of the Communist Party, is part of Sergey Baburin's Russian Way group of deputies. And reporting on his trip to the Balkans, the latter had back on 8 April not only advocated the abandonment of sanctions but also proposed how this be done, spitting in the face of the world community: delivering commodities by ship along the Danube, and if Bulgaria or Romania "order us to stop, we are not required to do so." Considering the supremacy of the "railroad engineer"-general and the presence of the Zhirinovskiyite Vyacheslav Marychev, whose position, like that of his faction boss also, is a whole lot worse than that of Mr. Baburin, there were serious doubts as to future impartiality. This would in jury selection have sufficed for rejection, here, however, it remained to hope that those on the assignment would overcome the actual stereotype. A rough idea of the course of the future discussion was provided by the news conference given by the delegation, already described in SEGODNYA, which was held on the Duma's final day of business on Novyy Arbat. The first conclusion was that, contrary to Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, vice speaker from the LDPR--Zhirinovskiy Party--the trip was not "political tourism": Thanks to the Foreign Ministry and the embassies in Yugoslavia and Croatia, the members of the Duma were able to visit Yugoslavia, Croatia, Bosnia, and the republics of Serbia and Serbian Krajina and to meet with their top leaders and also with the representative of the UN secretary general and the commander of the UN force in Bosnia. The second was based on the communique on the preliminary results, which affirmed four positions: the anti-Serb information campaign and violation of the principle of equal responsibility, the need for the lifting of sanctions and preservation of the embargo on arms supplies, a weakening of the role of the United Nations thanks to the delegation of a number of functions to the North Atlantic bloc, and mistakes of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the diplomatic recognition of Bosnia-Hercegovina and in the approval of sanctions. It was proposed that the efforts for their cancellation be made exclusively within the framework of the United Nations here. The third conclusion concerned the members of the delegation. General Bezborodov was a pleasant surprise. He approached the problem in military fashion: If an objective investigation is needed, investigate objectively we will. And the other members of the delegation, while supporting their Yugoslav and Serbian brothers, did not go beyond the framework of the communique and did not propose exotic means of a lifting of the blockade like the said breakthrough along the Danube or the basing of the Russian Navy on the Adriatic coast (the suggestion of that same Vice Speaker Vengerovskiy). Mr. Marychev was, naturally, the exception: To SEGODNYA's question as to who "the geopolitical forces of evil" in the region visited actually are, the deputy named NATO and only NATO. Indeed, it followed from the news conference that the NATO people are suffering from "Captain Tushin's disease" and that the UN representatives are having difficulty keeping them from pulling the trigger of the "hanging gun." And that in tactical ability General Mladic has repeatedly gotten the better of General Rose and that the latter is annoyed at this. But it was not NATO that began the war in the Balkans and slaughtered peaceful inhabitants, and General Mladic is more significant than Yeruslan and, judging by his conduct and his relations with Mr. Karadzic and his remarks about NATO, bears a striking resemblance to the words of Mr. Marychev. The fact that the latter remained in the minority at the news conference permits the hope of the similar location of his faction on 11 May. The day promises to be, if not sensational, then tumultuous. The first three points of the communique, although they could arouse the deputies' ardor, will for all that most likely be approved by the Duma. But discussion of the fourth point--charges leveled at the Foreign Ministry--promises to be serious. Andrey Kozyrev is a member of the Russia's Choice faction, and it was not fortuitous that it was only the Russia's Choice representative who failed to sign the communique as a whole. It was he, Aleksey Sarychev, incidentally, who raised at the news conference the question of the need for a closed sitting on 11 May. Why so open a discussion would inflame passions in the Balkans, whether such will be the opinion of the faction and whether it would be approved by the Duma, and, finally, whether it would not be better to follow the words and styles than take umbrage at journalists getting information by the "tainted telephone" from the garrulous members of parliament remained unclear. One thing, however, is clear: The discussion will lead to recommendations for a change in Russia's Balkan policy, and possibly to demands for personnel reinforcement of the Foreign Ministry also. And whereas the Duma lacks the constitutional license for the latter, as the Mr. Yerin incident shows, it could make recommendations, as mentioned at the news conference, law. It could, if turned down by the Federation Council or the president, be approved, all the same, by the Duma by a two-thirds vote--and, judging by the news conference, it has this. I believe, however, that following the Accord Treaty the president would not go against the Duma, especially since movements at the Foreign Ministry are obvious. In addition, the two-week breathing-space has most likely been used for active consultations between members of the delegation and the Duma leadership and Russian diplomats. Of course, observance of the clause concerning a "unified foreign policy course" could be impeded--if the Duma devotes its first sitting to a discussion not of Yugoslavia but of the methods by which Ivan Rybkin won from the lower house the right to sign the treaty and if this treaty signature is disavowed. But such a development of events is unlikely and constitutes a different subject, what is more.
