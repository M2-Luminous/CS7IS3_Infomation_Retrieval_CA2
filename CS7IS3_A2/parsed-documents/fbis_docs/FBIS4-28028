President Ramos says he leaves it up to the court to decide whether or not to free Lagman. He made his statement during an audience he gave to the family of slain Police Chief Inspector Timoteo Zarcal. Zarcal was killed on 7 May allegedly by the rebel hit squad Alex Boncayao Brigade [ABB], which Lagman is the alleged head. Defense Secretary Renato De Villa said earlier the government was not inclined to unilaterally release Lagman as it did to another communist leader Wilma Tiamzon. Tiamzon had been freed on humanitarian and medical reasons. Several sectors including Congress have asked for Lagman's temporary release but military, police, and justice authorities said they were still evaluating Lagman's case in terms of security.
