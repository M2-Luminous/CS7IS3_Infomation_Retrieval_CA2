Although certain reports had indicated that the new cabinet list would be released today, a communique has disclosed that the prime minister has adjourned the meeting he convened for this morning to confer with party leaders. The communique stressed that the meeting was adjourned due to the absence of opposition political leaders. Sources close to the prime minister, whom the head of state has asked to confer with all the political parties to establish a priority action program, indicate that the prime minister is continuing his consultations. Gabon is one of the African countries that will appear before the IMF next week to have their letters of intent examined.
