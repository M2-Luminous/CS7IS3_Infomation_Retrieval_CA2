Having put his cards on the table, the leader of the progressive alignment can indeed hope that the other competitors will now abandon fatuous advertising language and their coarse invective and compete in the arena of the things that need to be done at this difficult time in the nation's life. In his 50-page document, the PDS secretary has made this effort, in a forum and language that confirm, better than any number of television interviews, the PDS' break with its past as a communist party. First and foremost -- though it is tempting to say, at last -- the program no longer features the cathartic inspiration, so deep-rooted in the Italian Communist Party's traditional documents, that implied a vision of politics as an instrument for spreading happiness among people. Nor, logically and as a consistent consequence, does it any longer indicate the metahistorical objective of a transcending of the market economy and therefore of the real conditions of the world as it is now. Indeed, the entire program seems to be rooted firmly in these very conditions. Indeed, the ultimate goal of the PDS blueprint seems to be leading to the acceptance of a market economy in a country that, both in the past and in the present, has always inclined toward the more comfortable path of protectionism and unfair promotion of vested interests. There are two assertions in the introduction to Occhetto's program that deserve to be examined. The first says that the precondition for rebuilding the state in Italy "is the existence of a government force that cannot be held to ransom by perverse compromises and unknown potentates that still influence the republic's life." The second important statement is the following: "To help business to create wealth is the precondition for possessing the means to allocate to the citizens' prosperity, both material and other, and to support the underprivileged. We cannot distribute that which we do not have." Italy's timid -- or, more often, sham -- adherence to the rules of the market economy in recent decades has been at the same time both the cause and the effect of a decline in the relationship between politics and business that has imposed on the country an overall system of government based on partisan agreements between those governing the institutions and those managing businesses. Now the Left is at last displaying an awareness that its battles on behalf of an alternative system had no other result than to strengthen, to everyone's detriment, the mechanism of secret agreements between political and economic bigwigs, in contempt of the golden rules of free competition and free trade. Having reached this realization, the Left is now grasping and espousing the weapon of the market as a means of liberating the country from the heel of the political and business oligopolies. And it does so through an explicit adherence to one of the linchpins of a liberal economy when it states, as we have seen, that "we cannot distribute that which we do not have." You can turn these words around however you want, but their ultimate meaning is not very different from, or is indeed identical to, that of the now famous warning issued by the American monetarist school, namely, that in modern societies "there is no such thing as a free lunch." I do not know whether Occhetto will like this interpretation of the document that he presented yesterday or whether it will suit him (looking to his left). But the fact is that his government program deserves general attention not so much because of its numerous and detailed social welfare plans (unemployment, social security, health), but rather because of its overall approach, which seems to be inspired by the most solid principles of democratic and liberal thinking. Liberal, mind -- not liberalist, in accordance with a fundamental distinction on which both Benedetto Croce and Luigi Einaudi had some excellent things to say. This, particularly where it outlines a state that will not submit to the invisible and domineering hand of business and that will not claim the right to take its place in despising the rights of freedom. And, vice versa, of a state that, as a leading actor in conflicts, will act as their arbiter, will "manage less and govern more, that will do fewer things but that will help others to do them." This, precisely in accordance with the teachings of the liberal doctrine of the state, in contrast to the liberalist anarchism which is only a disguised version of the ancient law of the survival of the fittest. Hitherto this election campaign has profoundly disoriented the public because of the general and chaotic race by almost all the political forces to exclusively appropriate the liberal democratic label. Now the Left has specified its stance in this area and has defined its identity. It seems highly desirable that the other competing groups abandon the generic banalities of television commercials and present the voters with their own government programs -- equally clear in their principles and plans -- in order to start practicing the principles of the market and fair competition in politics too. Nobody would dream of suggesting that the PDS' program is a kind of cure-all for the country's problems. Indeed, it includes some proposals that seem still ill-defined or unsupported by adequate arguments -- for instance, where it postulates a growth, albeit sacrosanct, in expenditure on education of 6-10 percent of GDP, without clarifying to the detriment of whom and what this would take place. Be that as it may, however, this examination of the good and bad features of the PDS program can produce useful and meaningful assessments only on the basis of a comparison with the proposals and programs of its rivals. To be specific: There are a couple of issues that have particularly occupied the start of the election campaign -- taxation and the media. With regard to the former, Occhetto says that "a reduction in taxation will be achieved as and when the general conditions of public finances make it possible." In other words, it is necessary first to emerge from the trap of the public deficit by bringing inflation down still further, the continuation of an incomes policy, and further spending cuts. This, essentially, is the policy being pursued by the Ciampi government, and we are acquainted with both its advantages and its disadvantages. Do Occhetto's rivals have a different program in mind? We know that they are talking about cutting taxes, but what do they intend to do about the public deficit? To deal with it by means of inflation and by printing money? Or by means of something less destructive? It would be helpful if they were to say. As for the media, Occhetto proposes reversing the rationale of the "perverse compromises" -- again -- behind current legislation, centering the defense of the public not on the vested interests of the existing bigwigs but on the citizens' right to pluralism in their sources of information. What are the other rival political forces offering as an alternative? Some further compromises in line with the oligopolistic Mammi bill, or a real opening to this market based on the principles of competition? It would be helpful to know this, too, in order to assess the liberal substance of Occhetto's proposals: It is possible to do better than him, but someone has to do it.
