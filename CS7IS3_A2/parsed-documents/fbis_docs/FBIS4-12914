Council head Hayim Aviv informed the commander of the Central Command and the commander of the Judaea and Samaria Division that the decision was made in the wake of an increase in hostile activities against Israelis on this road. According to Aviv, the settlers are not getting appropriate protection from the Israeli Defense Forces. This is reported by our settlement affairs correspondent Gil Litman.
