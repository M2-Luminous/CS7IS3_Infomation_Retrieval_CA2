The belligerent parties used heavy artillery, missiles, and aircraft in the battles, which broke out day before yesterday between President Borhanoddin Rabbani's forces on the one hand and General `Abdol Rashid Dostam's Uzbek militias and the parties allied with Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami on the other. Local sources spoke of "hundreds of dead and wounded" in the clashes, and medical sources were not at first able to broadcast an official count due to the continued fighting. however, they commented that 70 people were killed and almost 700 wounded. The sources expected the count to rise, especially since the president's side used aircraft to bomb Bala Hesar Palace in the capital, where Dostam's forces are concentrated. Sadeq Tashkari, one of President Rabbani's aides, told AL-HAYAH that responsibility for the fighting lay on the shoulders of the Uzbek militias, which previously supported the Communists and hold strategic positions in Kabul. He said the Hezb-e Eslami and the Shi'ite Hezb-e Wahdat forces allied with it entered the battle at the side of the militias afterward. The presidential official mentioned that President Rabbani's Jam'iyat-e Eslami forces, led by former Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, had been able to repel the attackers. However, Hezb-e Eslami sources strongly denied this and said the attacking forces had taken over major strategic areas in Kabul and that the fighting is concentrated around the Presidential Palace. Meanwhile, General Fowzi, a commander of Dostam's militias, said they had captured the radio and television station, the Defense Ministry, and the president's Central Corps General Headquarters. President Rabbani day before yesterday called for a jihad against his adversaries. he described the current battles as being "a new stage in the jihad that cannot be distinguished from the past 14 years" against the former Communist regime and the Soviet forces that invaded Afghanistan to support it. He said the goal of the alliance hostile to him "is to defend the cause of former Communist President Babrak Karmal." He described the Kabul attackers as "Karmal gangs." The Hezb-e Eslami responded with a communique yesterday carrying counter-charges against Rabbani for cooperating with former Communists in the current fighting in Kabul. Tehran radio said the Iranian Embassy in Kabul was hit yesterday by several shells for the second time in the space of 24 hours, and that there were no losses among its employees. Iran announced Saturday its "deep regret" for the new clashes, which have broken out in Kabul. It requested of all sides "rapid action to put an end to these battles by peaceful means." An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Iran "is ready to intervene and participate in putting an end to the clashes."
