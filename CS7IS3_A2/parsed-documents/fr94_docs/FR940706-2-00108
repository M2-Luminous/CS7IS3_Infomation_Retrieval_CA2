FR940706-2-00108 FR940706-2-00060 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Docket No. AB&hyph;6 (Sub-No. 361X)] Burlington Northern Railroad Company_Abandonment Exemption_In Bureau County, IL Burlington Northern Railroad Company (BN) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_ Exempt Abandonments to abandon approximately 5.09 1 miles of rail line between milepost 193.36 near Ladd and milepost 188.27 near Howe in Bureau County, IL. 1 Although BN stated it was abandoning 5.13 miles of rail line, the actual mileage between mileposts is 5.09 miles. BN has certified that: (1) no local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) there is no overhead traffic on the line; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on this line (or a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental report), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee affected by the abandonment shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on August 5, 1994, 2 unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues, 3 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), 4 and trail use/rail banking statements under 49 CFR 1152.29 must be filed by July 18, 1994. 5 Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be filed by July 26, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 2 Pursuant to 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(2), the railroad must file a verified notice with the Commission at least 50 days before the abandonment or discontinuance is to be consummated. The applicant, in its verified notice, indicated a proposed consummation date of August 4, 1994. Because the verified notice was filed June 16, 1994, consummation could not take place prior to August 5, 1994. BN's representative has confirmed that the correct consummation date is on or after August 5, 1994. 3 A stay will be issued routinely by the Commission in those proceedings where an informed decision on environmental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission's Section of Energy and Environment in its independent investigation) cannot be made prior to the effective date of the notice of exemption. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines, 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay on environmental concerns is encouraged to file its request as soon as possible in order to permit the Commission to review and act on the request before the effective date of this exemption. 4 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist., 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). 5 The Commission will accept a late-filed trail use request as long as it retains jurisdiction to do so. A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Sarah J. Whitley, Burlington Northern Railroad Company, 3800 Continental Plaza, 777 Main Street, Fort Worth, TX 76102&hyph;5384. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. BN has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environment and historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by July 11, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA, at (202) 927&hyph;6248. Comments on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA becomes available to the public. Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where appropriate, in a subsequent decision. Decided: June 27, 1994. By the Commission, Joseph H. Dettmar, Acting Director, Office of Proceedings. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr., Secretary.
