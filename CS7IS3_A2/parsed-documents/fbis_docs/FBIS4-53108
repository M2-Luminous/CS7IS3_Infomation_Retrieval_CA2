Minister and State Secretary Murdiono said this when he briefed reporters on the results of talks between President Suharto and Prime Minister Jim Bolger in Jakarta this morning. He said the two leaders agreed that such visits would be beneficial. The minister said Bolger did not bring a petition on East Timor from New Zealand deputies. The prime minister simply asked the president about East Timor. Suharto said the East Timor people had decided to be part of Indonesia. Any resistance to the East Timor people's strong wish to remain part of Indonesia will be categorized as an act to undermine national security. According to Murdiono, the two leaders also touched on matters to be discussed by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] forum. [passage omitted on Mrs. Bolger's social acitivities in Jakarta]
