They were recently discharged from the hospital after comprehensive evaluation and treatment. As the intern of the chair of childhood diseases, M. Soboleva, testifies, signs of the influence of mercury, which to one degree or another affected the health condition of the young patients and may be a factor in their future, were found in all the children. The case with which I began occurred precisely when the Days of Protection Against Ecological Dangers was being held in St. Petersburg. The two-month event has the resounding motto, "Ecology--Safety--Life," which in itself testifies to the significance of raising ecological issues in the city. The lives of the people are indeed on the line! However, recently yet another warning sign--"Attention--mercury!"--appeared on Podkovyrov Street in Petrogradskiy Rayon, next to a house where a playground used to be. Almost one month has passed, but so far only the initial work on the cleanup of the area has been done. The further demercurization (this is precisely what a mercury cleanup is called) has been suspended, because it is not clear who must pay for the quite complex measures to clear away the pileups of construction refuse, metal, and all kinds of junk, as well as to dismantle a burned-out outbuilding. Mercury does not forgive haste and negligence; it appears on the list of particularly poisonous, toxic substances. Inhaling mercury vapors is extremely harmful: The liver, the kidneys, and the nervous system are afflicted. Initially, the symptoms of poisoning are unclear and fuzzy--fatigue, irritability, headaches, dizziness. However, most serious diseases develop later under the protracted influence of the vapors. After an extensive survey was taken several years ago, it was discovered that about one-half of the schools in the city, one day-care center in five, and one-fifth of the premises of health-care facilities, including maternity wards, were contaminated with mercury. Major measures to control the danger of mercury were taken; the citywide Demercurization program was developed for the first time in Russia and is being implemented. An obstacle was thrown up to the vicious "mercury breath." A tremendous and significant effort has been undertaken; as of now, contamination has been cleaned up in all schools and day-care facilities for children of the city. It is forbidden to use any instruments containing mercury in class; nor is mercury used in chemical experiments now. The case is more complex with health-care facilities, numerous colleges and scientific research institutions, and enterprises where mercury-containing instruments are used. They usually get away by claiming that demercurization will allegedly interfere with the normal operation of enterprises and institutions. However, is it normal for newborns to be on occasion held in rooms where the maximum permissible concentration of mercury is exceeded? Is it normal for students to remain for a long time in laboratories contaminated with mercury? Is it normal for dozens of enterprises using mercury and instruments containing mercury not to be certified from the point of view of ecological danger? Is it normal that any one of us may be taken hostage by some plant in whose compound the unrecorded poisonous metal freely "circulates?" For the first time, mercury cleanup specialists developed, jointly with the sanitation and disease control inspectorate, clear-cut rules for recording, storing, and using mercury and mercury-based instruments, set strict norms, and mapped out all possible obstacles in the path of the toxic substance. Alas, the documents on which protection for you and me could have been based have drawn no response from the mayoralty for many months now. Fortunately, St. Petersburg is one of the few cities of Russia that has everything it takes to control mercury pollution. An ecological unit is in operation at the All-Russian Institute of Geophysical Surveys, VIRG (telephone 567-88-02) whose specialists can promptly survey premises, city territories, and sources of water supply. The State Enterprise for Ecological, Geological, and Geophysical Research, EGGI (telephone 312-62-09) has likewise mastered all up-to-date methods for mercury detection and cleanup at facilities. The municipal PITsER--the St. Petersburg Engineering Center for Ecological Projects--was established in 1991. It has assumed responsibility for both emergency efforts and planned actions to clean up contamination, and for the collection of mercury and mercury-containing instruments whose service life has ended or which have broken down while in operation. Even during such a small accident, it is best to call in the PITsER at the telephone 218-80-69. The mercury cleanup specialists of St. Petersburg earn their bread through hard labor. It is good that several subdivisions exist which are independent of one another--the PITsER, the EGGI, the VIRG-Rudgeofizika. It is bad that they, those who protect us against a real threat, are put in a situation of continuous rivalry, that each one of them uses solely his own methods without striving to use outside accomplishments. I think that it would be very proper for our environmental protection department to ensure effective interaction. It is hardly reasonable at present to sacrifice some elements and be left without knowledgeable and self-sacrificing people when the danger has not been completely eliminated.
