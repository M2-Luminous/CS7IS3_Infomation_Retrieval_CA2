In his letter to Presidents Yeltsin, Clinton, Jiang Zemin, Mitterrand, and Prime Minister John Major, a copy of which has been forwarded to TANJUG, the president of the Serb Republic said that Serbs unilaterally proclaimed a cease-fire, but Muslims did not want it. "Both sides, not only one, must support peace and end this war," Karadzic said. "In its effort to attain a balance of power on the ground, the international community is only prolonging the war. At the same time sanctions and threats against Serbs are encouraging Muslims to remain on the war path." In his letter to the five statesmen, Karadzic says Western countries keep repeating that their approach to the conflict was a mistake, even that some mistakes were repeated, some of them being even more serious. "The latest American initiative was a fatal mistake, because the starting point was a presupposition that the Sarajevo model of pacification could be applied to all safe areas. However, this is not possible because of geographical and other reasons. The American initiative could create a situation of 'neither war nor peace'; it would lengthen rathen than end the conflict." "We believe the only way of achieving instant peace would be to proclaim the entire territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina a safe area, taking into consideration two realities -- one is the Muslim- Croat federation and the other is the Serb Republic," said Karadzic. The Serb proposal, stressed Karadzic, aims to establish a general cessation of hostilities. This means, he adds in the letter, an instant cease-fire and the cessation of all military actions, followed by the separation of forces and by negotiations. "The end of the war is only possible through a political agreement," Karadzic said, adding that the agreement could only be possible if the fighting stopped. "The general cessation of hostilities is therefore the only solution," said Karadzic in his letter to the five statesmen whose countries are permanent members of the UN Security Council.
