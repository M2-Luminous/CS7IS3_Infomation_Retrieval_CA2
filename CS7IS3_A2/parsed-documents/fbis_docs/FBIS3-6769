The article says: Now the Korean-style socialism is making a long drive, not wavering in any howling wind, because the steadfast faith in socialism of chuche which is advancing confidently under the guidance of the party and the leader has struck its roots deep in the hearts of our people. The Korean people accept the socialist idea of chuche as their faith and are making the revolution and construction as demanded by it. And they are struggling with a great pride and honor of living and making the revolution in the most advantageous socialist society in the world. They are firmly convinced through the course of giving full play to the dignity and might of the Korean-style socialism under the banner of the socialist idea of chuche that they can accomplish the cause of socialism when they take as the guideline of their struggle the socialist idea of chuche which is being developed and completed by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. This faith of our people is immutable and strongest even under the circumstances in which the imperialists are intensifying anti-socialist moves, loudly advertising "material prosperity" and "advantages" of capitalism. The whole society forms one big family and an independent and creative, socialist life of the people is in full bloom, with the entire people united behind the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in one mind. Our people deeply bear in mind through the present-day reality and the miserable situation in the countries where socialism has suffered a setback that capitalism has nothing to present to the people. Hence, our people's faith in socialism cannot be shaken with anything. The Korean people wholly integrate socialism with their destiny and devote their all to the struggle to defend socialism.
