FR941021-0-00099 FR941021-0-00020 In §600.101 Definitions, DOE has decided to include commercial organizations in the definition of ``recipient.'' In §600.104 Subawards, the applicability of this subpart to commercial organizations is included to be consistent with existing DOE policy as provided in the current subpart B. In §600.123(a)(6) under Cost sharing, ``when required by the Federal awarding agency'' is deleted to reflect that DOE is requiring cost-sharing contributions to be shown in the approved budget. In §600.123(b) under Cost sharing, ``only with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency'' is deleted to reflect that DOE is permitting unrecovered indirect costs to be included in cost sharing. In §600.124(f) under Program income, ``If authorized by Federal awarding agency'' is deleted and replaced with ``Unless program *␣*␣* provide otherwise'' to reflect that DOE is permitting incidental costs to be deducted from program income unless there are contravening program regulations. In §600.125 (c)(5) under Revision of budget and program plans, ``if approval is required by the Federal awarding agency'' is deleted and replaced by ``If required by program regulations'' to reflect that DOE is permitting rebudgeting between direct and indirect costs without prior approval, unless program regulations provide otherwise. In §600.125(c)(6) under Revisions of budget and program plan ``the Federal awarding agency'' is deleted and replaced by ``program regulations or the terms and conditions of award'' to reflect that the prior approvals included in the Circulars and regulations cited in the subparagraph are required unless specifically waived in DOE program regulations or in the specific award document. In §600.125(e) pertaining to prior approval requirements, ``Federal awarding agencies are authorized, at their option'' and ``Circular and OMB Circulars A&hyph;21 and A&hyph;122'' are deleted and replaced by ``program regulations may'' and ``subpart and its Appendices'' to reflect that DOE is choosing to limit the waivers of prior approvals to those contained in program regulations or in this implementation of Circular A&hyph;110 and not extending it to waive prior approval requirements contained in the cost principal Circulars A&hyph;21 and A&hyph;122. In §600.125(f) on rebudgeting, ``The Federal awarding agency may, at its option'' is deleted and replaced by ``Program regulations may'' to reflect that DOE is choosing to allow unrestricted rebudgeting by a recipient (provided the uses are consistent with the original appropriation) unless program regulations provide otherwise. In §600.125(i) regarding imposing other prior approval requirements, ``unless a deviation has been approved by OMB'' is deleted and replaced by ``Except in accordance with the deviation procedures in §600.4 or as may be provided for in program regulations'' and ``by the DOE'' to reflect that there may be program regulations that need to be considered in understanding what prior approval requirements may exist for a particular financial assistance program. Additionally, ``may'' has been changed to ``will'' to more emphatically state what DOE policy is. In §600.125(l) on budget request formats, the entire text is deleted and replaced by ``Requests for budget revisions may be made by letter'' to reflect DOE policy that the use of budget forms are not required (although, of course, they may be used) for requesting budget revisions. In §600.126 (c) and (d) on Non-Federal audits, the entire text is deleted and replaced with the language shown to reflect DOE policy that the Contracting Officer has wide discretion in determining the nature of the audits needed for hospitals not covered by A&hyph;133 and commercial organizations. In addition, subparagraph (e) is added to address audits of individuals who are financial assistance recipients.
