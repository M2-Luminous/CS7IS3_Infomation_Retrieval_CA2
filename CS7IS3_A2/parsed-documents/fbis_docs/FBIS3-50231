Following yesterday's meeting of the Academic Council, about 7,000 intellectuals, professors, and citizens signed a petition in support of the student strike. Today, students from the University of National and World Economics joined in supporting the demands of their Sofia University colleagues and will probably issue their own declaration. The strike committee will set up a group of experts to prepare a standpoint regarding the strike declaration, including item 1, which demands that 2 percent of the GDP should be allocated to science and education. The protest has already produced an international reaction: a NEW YORK TIMES journalist has interviewed the striking students. Minister of Science and Education Marko Todorov issued an official statement on the student strike, in which he said that it is political in nature and that the demand for 2 percent of the GDP to be allocated to education and science cannot be satisfied. The sit-in at the university continues. At a general meeting tomorrow, professors and staff of the university are expected to declare their own strike, because more than 50 percent of the signatures required have already been collected. Today Prime Minister Lyuben Berov received representatives of six student organizations, who expressed disquiet regarding the occupation of Sofia University and the politicization of the strike. They called upon the executive power to help to ensure that the rights of students who want to take their examinations and not interrupt the study session are not restricted. The prime minister undertook to speak to Sofia University Rector Professor Lalov, asking him to bring under control the tension that is developing between the striking students and those not on strike.
