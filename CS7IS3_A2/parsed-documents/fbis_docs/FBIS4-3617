Shortly after that, the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong issued a statement: "According to what is known to the U.S. Government, it seems that Xi Yang merely collected data by the reasonable and habitual professional means used by reporters worldwide and his sentence was far more serious than the crime he was accused of committing." The two sides expressed themselves in different ways but the meaning was the same. They were echoing each other. In the British Parliament report, highly praised by Patten, a passage stated: In its China policy, Britain "should adopt the same policy and carry out cooperation with other countries in the world, especially the European allies and the United States." By linking these words with current happenings, people may ask: Was Britain trying to carry out "cooperation" with its allies against China by using the Xi Yang case? Here, we may first quote the "Proclamation" of international law: "A country does not have the right to directly or indirectly interfere in the internal and foreign affairs of other countries for whatever reasons; therefore, armed interference or interference in other forms, or attempts to threaten another country's dignity or political, economic, or cultural affairs must be condemned." Was the handling of Xi Yang's secret-stealing case by the municipal judicial organs of Beijing Municipality an internal Chinese affair? Did the criticism of China's handling of the Xi Yang case in the form of making comments and issuing a statement constitute interference and should this be condemned? China has never made comments on the handling of criminal cases inside Britain and the United States but Britain and the United States have often attacked China's handling of criminal cases according to its own laws. Why so? Can Mr Patten answer this? Here, we can analyze "what was known to the U.S. Government." According to the United States, "Xi Yang just collected data by the reasonable and habitual professional means used by reporters worldwide." If that was the case, Xi Yang should not have been found guilty but should have been given credit. Would there still then be any difference between good and evil in the world? Would there be any rule-of-law society? In June and July last year, Xi Yang did not collected so-called "data" in Beijing but secrets. This is a plain fact. Some people said that China did not clearly define "secrets" and demanded that the state give the definition. This is untrue. Like all other countries, China has its own secrets and the degrees of confidentiality are determined by their influence regarding state security and state interests. The state will not maintain things which need not be kept confidential as secrets. Being a reporter, especially one who has lived and worked on the Chinese mainland for many years, Xi should be well aware of this. Xi Yang was not unaware that he was collecting secrets; on the contrary, he was well aware that the documents about the printing of banknotes, the People's Bank of China's decision on selling gold on the international market and adjusting the interest rates, and the "Explanation of the Interim Rules for the Renminbi Business Operation of Foreign-Funded Banking Institutions" were all confidential documents. Therefore, he pried into such information and stole the secrets by taking surreptitious action and coming into secret personal contact with the information supplier. As for the "means," Xi Yang adopted the means of stealing secrets rather than the means of gathering news. Lumping these two things together and even describing secret-stealing as the "habitual means used by reporters worldwide" is just an insult to reporters worldwide. Reporters are not supermen and superwomen free from the control of the law. When gathering news in any country or region, reporters must abide by local laws and the international norms and practices. Naturally, when gathering news in China, reporters from outside the mainland should abide by China's laws. When covering news in Britain and the United States, Chinese reporters should also abide by the laws of Britain and the United States. Would Britain and the United States allow foreign reporters to freely pry into their secret information and steal their secrets by despising their laws? The means is always linked with the purpose. By seeing whether a means is proper and legal, we should link the means with the purpose. The means aimed at stealing secrets constitute illegal means and must not be regarded as news covering. A country has its national dignity, a newspaper has its reputation, and a person has his or her personal dignity. Being a reporter with personal dignity, he or she must not do things which violate the rights and interests of other people in order to curry favor with his or her employer, or do things endangering the security and interests of a country or even his or her own motherland! A provision of the international convention specifies that when citizens exercise their right of "freedom of speech," they "have to be subject to certain constraints," including the need to "respect other people's rights and reputation" and to "guarantee national security, public order, or public health and morality." Is it not true that reporters worldwide should abide by this norm? Can they behave like Xi Yang in doing what is harmful to their motherland's security and interests for the self-interest of themselves and their newspapers? Is this the "reasonable and habitual professional means used by reporters worldwide?" When covering news in China, reporters from outside the mainland can dispatch as many reports as they like. The Chinese authorities do not censor such reports and do not require them to only report good news and cover up bad news. Are they not free enough? If some people say that they are still not free enough, does this mean that they should be allowed to freely pry into the state's secret information and steal state secrets? Would there be such freedom in any part of the world? It seems that it is not true that the sentence "was disproportionate to the charge" in Xi Yang's case; instead, Patten's interference was very disproportionate to his status.
