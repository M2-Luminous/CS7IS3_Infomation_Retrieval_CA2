This undoubtedly is positive news, because the trend of such an important economic indicator remained stable for the second consecutive month, even though it should be pointed out that a great effort must be made to lower the cost of living in order to attain the officially announced annual goal of a maximum 25 percent. In fact, the average cost of the family basket between September 1993 and February has not experienced major changes (only around 0.2 percent), no sudden variations, which represents a major stabilization achievement when taking into account that this was during a period when inflation grew significantly due to seasonal factors, such as the beginning of the school year and the fact that March is the deadline for tax payments. All this is very positive because, despite a series of political factors such as the specific case of the "Cantuta Law," the economic and production agents basically show confidence in the government's economic model. However, what we consider substantive warnings must be made. First, inflation during the past two years has experienced an invariable percentage of about 2 percent per month. That, intrinsically speaking, is not bad for a national situation such as ours. It indicates, however, that one of the needs of the structural adjustment model is to invigorate the market's reaction, not only be expediting reforms but also by what is implicit: reactivate the market. Through January, according to the INEI [National Institute of Statistics and Information Science], the GDP had grown 9.7 percent; the mining industry accounts for a larger percentage of this growth, which needs to spread to the entire industrial sector. This means, therefore, that this year emphasis must be placed on increasing competitiveness. The economic reactivation must spread to all productive sectors by two means: by the establishment of regulations allowing national industries to become fully competitive, not only at a national level, but also at a regional level, because one cannot forget that the reconversion must unavoidably be projected into large economies. It also should be taken into account that inflation must be fought through tax collection. So that Peruvian enterprises can recover -- and, therefore, reduce their costs and the prices of goods and services -- it is not only necessary to lower the tax burden but also expand taxes and tariffs to more goods and services, thus avoiding illegal trade and contraband. From another viewpoint, in order to make the struggle against inflation successful (and so, in turn, its monthly average drops) the Economy and Finance Ministry program must widen its scope so it channels the huge funds being received by the AFP [Pension Fund Administration Board] and the CTS [Severance Pay Fund] in a more rapid and effective manner so the financial and banking systems can make better and faster investments. It should be pointed out, however, that the accumulation of resources is not always positive if it is not designed to accumulate international reserves. The same goes for the funds being obtained through the privatization of public enterprises. For example, the money -- which up to a point was unexpected in the case of the sale of the CPT [Peruvian Telephone Company] and Entel [National Telecommunications Enterprise] -- must be earmarked for adequate and profitable social projects because if not, we may soon find that the foreign currency is converted into national currency with an eventual negative impact on the inflation rate. An additional aspect is, precisely, that the monetary policy must continue to be administered with great care. We must not forget that 80 percent of the primary monetary supply is expressed and endorsed in dollars. And if the resources are not used with full guarantees and in a profitable manner in the short and medium term, we could be faced with inflation nourished by strictly monetary factors or by an exaggerated increase of expectations. Moreover, and it is good to point out, although we are on a good footing, especially compared to the previous government, the essential thing in order to avoid a price increase and other concomitant factors is to avoid new political changes. When political instability is generated -- 1994 is an electoral year -- the expectations of the productive and financial agents may become excessive and cause an increase in the cost of living that, under current circumstances, would be extremely negative. Therefore, in sum, currently Peru is on the right path in its struggle against the inflation monster. However, what is worrisome is the fact that after four years of government, its economic model, which undoubtedly has its positive aspects, especially in the market liberalization, continues to follow an extremely slow pace that must not last much longer. Regardless of the unchanged indicators for a few months, reforms must be implemented expeditiously, not only to attain the 25 percent inflation rate per year, but also to minimize or eliminate as soon as possible the social cost this will entail and the threat of recurring inflation. The average inflation rate considered acceptable in Latin American countries is established, in acceptable and even optimum terms, at nine points per year. This must be our goal in the short term because, becasue we are drawing closer to the general elections, we must avoid the resurfacing of economic scourges of the past.
