Palk's survey of 128 companies throughout SA found that 18 percent of respondents were not prepared to negotiate affirmative action issues. Of these 45 percent would consult a union and 36 percent would inform the union of their policies, but not discuss the content. "Union involvement is likely to be a source of conflict since unions have clearly stated that they believe affirmative action issues need to be negotiated." Palk's survey found that 95 percent of top management positions were held by whites, who also occupied 86 percent of middle- management positions and 63 percent of skilled worker positions. He warned that it would take many years to change the composition of a company's workforce to reflect the labour market's racial breakdown, especially at a time when formal sector labour turnover stood at between 5 percent and 10 percent. "If this rate of turnover persists, there will not be much room to make substantial progress with affirmative action without major economic growth. "This could lead to unfulfilled expectations which have been heightened in regard to affirmative action." Palk found that most progress in implementing affirmative action policies had been made in service industries where front-office staff interacted with the public. In industries which were task- rather than service-oriented, much less had been done, with the exception of the oil, chemical, pharmaceutical and food and beverage industries. Males dominated top and middle-management posts, but females had made inroads into skilled worker categories. This was the case in the financial, insurance and banking industry where women accounted for 62 percent of skilled workers. Male dominance was most pronounced in mining, with men occupying 90 percent or more of the positions in all three categories. "A minority of companies has shown commitment to affirmative action by drawing up a written policy; an even smaller minority has communicated this to employees. These findings are rather disturbing since there is a high expectation of affirmative action taking place."
