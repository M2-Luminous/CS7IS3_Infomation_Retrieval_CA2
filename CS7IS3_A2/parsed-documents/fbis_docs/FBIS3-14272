[passage omitted] His majesty expressed satisfaction at his visits and told the "News at Ten" that everything was back to normal. [Begin recording] [Husayn] It was excellent. I really had an opportunity to have a very frank and open discussion with all my brethren whom I met during these last few days in Oman, where we have had excellent relations throughout our history. And in Qatar, they were established many years ago on a very solid foundation of confidence and trust. I think everything is back to normal and our views are, I believe, much the same, as we face problems and challenges throughout this region and in this life. [Reporter] Do you care to say anything about what happened yesterday [23 March] in Hebron? [Husayn] I was shocked to hear what happened on the news. And obviously, we'll be seeing what details emerge. Right now, not much details are available here. [Reporter] Your Majesty, where do you see the future of Jerusalem, especially with the latest events? [Husayn] That's a very difficult question to respond to immediately now. What I have felt over a long period of time is that the holy places in Jerusalem -- important to all of us -- should revert to only the sovereignty of God over them. Important to all believers. Beyond that, as far as the Muslim holy places are concerned, we have called, as you know, for a body that would represent all the different schools within our Islamic world to share in addressing the problem. We are the custodians of these holy places, hopefully, in the future. And we've also encouraged interfaith dialogue between the followers of the three great religions. [end recording] His majesty also told Jordan Television that Jordan was seeking clarification on the American position regarding the status of Jerusalem. He added that Jordan is also seeking assurances that nothing has changed with regards to Jerusalem as an occupied Arab land. The king stressed that Jordan recognizes no sovereignty over the holy city except that of God almighty.
