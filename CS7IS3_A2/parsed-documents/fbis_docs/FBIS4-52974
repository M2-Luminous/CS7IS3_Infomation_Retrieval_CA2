FBIS4-52974 "dreas095_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-095 Daily Report 14 May 1994 North Korea U.S. Academic on Withdrawal of Weapons From ROK U.S. Academic on Withdrawal of Weapons From ROK SK1405215994 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1509 GMT 14 May 94 SK1405215994 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- American professor of Chicago University Bruce Cumings said at an academic seminar on the theme of "nuclear war crisis in Asia" that the United States should strive to pull nuclear weapons out of South Korea with the responsibility for its introduction according to NEW KOREA TIMES, a paper of overseas Koreans. It is, he said, for a political purpose to keep up the cold war in the Korean peninsula that the United States is putting pressure on North Korea while keeping itself from making an official utterance on the introduction of nuclear weapons in South Korea. Criticising the one-sided press attitude of the American media gossiping about "nuclear suspicion" in North Korea, the professor said that for the elimination of nuclear arms in the Korean peninsula and its peaceful reunification, it is preferential to have a correct understanding of the starting of the June 25 war, the U.S.-South Korean military tieup, the South Korean authorities' attitude towards the North, etc. It is proper for the United States to solve the "nuclear issue" by means of dialogue with North Korea, not by military means, he stressed.
