The one-week visit to Vietnam will start on 7 July and will be led by the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on foreign affairs, defense, and trade, Stephen Loosley. The other two parliamentary members will be the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs Andrew Peacock and the Australian Democrats foreign affairs spokesman Vicky Vaughan. The consultative delegation to look at human rights and other issues in the relationship was confirmed during the visit to Vietnam last month by Australia's prime minister Paul Keating. Announcing the delegation's makeup, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said it would be accompanied by two academics noted for their expertise in Asian affairs and human rights and two prominent Vietnamese now living in Australia. The academics are Professor Nancy Viviani, dean of faculty of the Asian studies at Queensland's Griffith University; and Professor Philip Olsten, director of the Center for International Law at the Australian National University. Senator Evans said Australia had taken up the suggestion from the Vietnamese prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, made during his visit in May last year that Vietnamese Australians should go back to Vietnam to see the situation. The foreign minister said the delegation will include Quang Luu, head of radio for the Special Broadcasting Service and Ho Mai, a Footscray city councillor in Melbourne. Senator Evans said the delegation was a strong, well-balanced one that had both status and expertise.
