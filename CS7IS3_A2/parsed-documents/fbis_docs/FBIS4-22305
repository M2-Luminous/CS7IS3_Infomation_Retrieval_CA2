The first time was when he have up his seat in the USSR Supreme Soviet for the disgraced politician. Now the "unauthorized" resignation of General Procurator Kazannik--immediately accepted by the president--is being discussed equally heatedly. The jurist, in turn out of favor, has returned to Omsk, where our correspondent met with him. [Kutorgin] Aleksey Ivanovich, when you took the job you said that the procuracy's work will be subordinate to the law. However, the first serious disagreement with the authority, with the president, showed that the "law of authority" in our country is currently stronger than the authority of the law. Or is it now quite so? [Kazannik] Almost so. I was very well aware that the president and his team are masters of creating dead-end situations and resolving them by unlawful means. Take, for instance, the October crisis, when the president placed the law on the Constitutional Court on the list of suspended acts. But it never occurred to me that they would so frankly, so crudely violate the still "warm" Constitution, and the State Duma Decree "On Political and Economic Amnesty." In a civilized country the entire team would have been sent packing for such a violation. Still, I am convinced that this is not a defeat of the law and not a personal tragedy for General Procurator Kazannik. In the final analysis, this is the defeat of the entire presidential team. People who blindly believe in the primacy of force over legality are doomed. Society cannot exist without continuity, stability, predictability. Without strict compliance with the law we will not know what awaits us tomorrow, even by the end of the day. Daily uncertainty wears people out, makes their life unbearable. We cannot live like this any more. [Kutorgin] Does this mean that you have reappraised your values? I am a witness that the act of giving up your seat in the Supreme Soviet in favor of Yeltsin was not an emotional reaction--rather, you carried out your electoral promise to Omsk residents, which you had given at a rally long before you were elected to the Supreme Soviet. You sincerely believed in Yeltsin then--a democrat and a statesman. Does this mean that you see him differently now? [Kazannik] I will tell you honestly. Until recently I saw Yeltsin through the rose-colored glasses of 1985-1989. I was greatly impressed by his speech at one of the last party congresses, in which he talked about the lack of democracy, about abuse in the upper echelons of power. I especially liked his confession that in the past he had been afraid to tell the truth. I also liked Yeltsin's democratic style: He goes to the stores himself, rides the subway and trolley buses. I did not pay attention, though, to the fact that whenever he went to a store, by pure coincidence there were also journalists with television cameras there. Not least, there was also this traditional feeling of sympathizing with the underdog. And I sincerely hoped then that he would be able to bring together truly democratic forces in the USSR Supreme Soviet. He did not bring anybody together. [Kutorgin] Wait a minute, your protege was a leader in the Interregional Deputy Group [IDG]. [Kazannik] You know, there are formal and informal leaders. Yeltsin was the leader by virtue of his job. The IDG's informal leader was Andrey Dmitriyevich Sakharov. I have no doubt that had Sakharov still been with us now, he would have voiced his contempt for the president and his team's petty intrigues around the amnesty, for instance. [Kutorgin] So when was it, Aleksey Ivanovich, that you saw the light? [Kazannik] Paraphrasing the well-known lines of a poet, I can say that you see big things better from a distance, but small ones in close-up. Looking from Omsk, I thought that Boris Nikolayevich was not a bad leader. It was painful for me to see his mistakes, which were literally there on the surface. But to get to know a person you have to eat a bushel of salt with him. In my time as the general procurator I was not that close to Yeltsin. Nevertheless, I became convinced that this man has no respect for the law. He can make a decision at any moment that would be contrary to the law and the Constitution, and instruct his team to find a way to get around the prescriptions of legal norms. And they would work hard to accomplish it... Yeltsin never asked me in our conversations whether the procuracy strictly observed the law in investigations of criminal offenses. But he did ask often why such or such people were still free. After all, he would say, they have committed crimes, and something should be done about it. I calmly explained to the president that I would rather put a brand on my own forehead than put my signature to a blank piece of paper. That until we have convincing proof that these people have committed a crime, they cannot be detained or arrested. This is out of the question. And the president agreed with my arguments. But when it came to the notorious amnesty, I finally realized that our views on the law differ. Neither an individual nor society will benefit from arbitrariness and lawlessness, however. As soon as we learn to observe the law, in a month or two our life will become much easier... [Kutorgin] So perhaps it was a different "reading" of the procuracy's duties on the part of you and the president that gave rise to rumors about the need to downsize it as a body not well suited to contribute to the envisaged reformation of our state? Or were these rumors groundless? [Kazannik] The president had nothing to do with it. There was a large group of democrats at the Constitutional Assembly who were hostile to the procuracy. Now they work as the president's representatives in the State Duma, are generously represented in parliamentary factions Russia's Choice and PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord]. Interestingly, I have not met opponents of a strong procuracy either among communists or liberal democrats. Only "real democrats" kept proposing to eliminate the procuracy or substantially cut its functions and subordinate it to the Ministry of Justice. The arguments in support of it were laughable. The procuracy, they said, does not fit into the system of separation of branches. Besides, it used to "serve" the totalitarian regime. I had the impression that these people were seriously trying to fit our traditional Russian reality into dogmatic theories of Western thinkers, and with the naivete of a six-year-old believed that other state bodies did not serve the totalitarian regime. It appears that everything has been ruined in Russia by now--the economy, legality, culture, morality... Only the procuracy remained as a single centralized system. To a certain extent it acts as a guarantor of the unity and territorial integrity of Russia. In an environment where our country is overcome by a tidal wave of crime, we cannot tinker with the procuracy. It took a tremendous effort on my part to "squeeze" Article 129 into the draft Constitution literally days before its publication, and thus protect and legally formalize the system of procuracy organs. It is regrettable that Western specialists understand the danger of reforming the procuracy, but our democrats do not. In May last year a pan-European conference on the problems of procuracy reform was held in Vienna. And specialists from all countries came to two fundamental conclusions. First, attempts to reform the procuracy without taking into account historical, national, and cultural specificities usually do not succeed. Second, in the environment of instability, social crises, and cataclysms, it is extremely dangerous to reform the procuracy. We have ignored the conclusions of this extremely authoritative conference. Of course, I support an increased role of the courts. But what is the court now, with its high court costs? Not every person, especially a disfranchised one, can turn to it for protection of his interests. The procuracy has ended up being the only organization that provides free legal aid. [Kutorgin] In Russia since time immemorial the procuracy also carried out general oversight. Especially now that the sarcastic conclusion of the classic is more true than ever: People do steal in Russia... [Kazannik] Only a blind man would not see this. The democrats, however, have started telling us: You have no business at enterprises; if they have a problem, let them go to court. How do we resolve this new controversy: theft on an immense scale and new forms of managing production? Under my leadership the General Procuracy developed a concept of reforming general oversight: The procuracy must interfere immediately wherever the interests of entire regions, cities, or certain categories of the population are encroached upon. For instance, we were checking on compliance with the legislation on preferences for Chernobyl victims. The situation is bad. And who except ourselves will check it out objectively? The sectoral inspectorate? Of course not. Or, for instance, the problem of implementing the legislation on support of orphaned children. We absolutely have to protect the interests of those without a voice, too. That is, the interests of disabled, underage, and elderly people. Those who for some reason do not even know where to turn to. Third. There now exist 49 inspectorates--tax, customs, environmental protection, and others. They quite often violate the law. Who will keep them in line? And fourth. There are now many parties and various sociopolitical entities. By their unlawful activities they can bring society to an explosion in a matter of days. Who will conduct oversight in this area? The same goes for numerous private investigative and protection services. All of this falls into the sphere of general oversight. Instead, we are told: We need to fold the procuracy... [Kutorgin] Perhaps it is the mafiosi structures that have the greatest stake in weakening the procuracy? And those people who have something to fear? [Kazannik] I said the same thing many times publicly... [Kutorgin] Could it be that the arguments over the procuracy's oversight rights also reflect the mushrooming administrative apparat's struggle for existence? [Kazannik] Undoubtedly. The apparat has grown almost 10-fold as compared to the end of 1980's. And in my opinion, the growth of the apparat is in direct correlation to the bureaucrats' incompetency. This actually is obvious. When there is a highly skilled professional, he carries out a certain function or task alone. When there are no professionals, you need 10-15 clerks. A sad sign of our times... The government moved into the huge White House--there are no vacant offices there anymore. The president's staff moved to Staraya Square--no more available space there. In the Kremlin everything is filled to capacity. Even in our General Procuracy, which I wanted to reduce by half, there are twice as many staff as there were in the all-Union procuracy. [Kutorgin] Where does such a influx of incompetency come from? [Kazannik] I see two reasons for it. The first, and most important one. When the democrats came to power they did not have experience in administrative work. They did figure out, of course, that this way they would not stay in power. So they started to appoint people not by their business or professional qualities but by the principle of personal loyalty. It is not accidental that we kept reading in the newspapers at the time the assurances of contenders for cushy jobs: "I am loyal..." The second reason. A predominant amount of people in the highest echelons of power were party leaders. They, however, provided only general leadership. As they say, upheld the general line. As to routine work, they considered it beneath themselves to engage in it. This generally has led to the apparat's growth and its incompetency. [Kutorgin] It looks as though the new constitution will not provide a barrier to this process either... [Kazannik] We may criticize the new constitution, but currently it is a guarantee of stability of the state. This is the first constitution that clearly codifies the principle of separation of branches. But I see tremendous danger in the attempts that immediately ensued--to violate the constitution or get around it. One such attempt manifested itself in the attitude toward the issue of the amnesty. Another is in the idea to draft and sign a Memorandum of Civil Accord. Now many democrats sing praise for the president's initiative, admire his "propensity" for compromise and "desire" to establish peace and accord in society. Excuse me, but what can you write in such a memorandum? Proclaim to the entire world that parties and sociopolitical movements will temporarily suspend their political activities and will not hold rallies and demonstrations? That miners and oil industry workers undertake to work without pay--just for moral satisfaction? And that all of us are to work hard strictly for the benefit of the coming generations? We have already lived like this for 70 years. A reasonable question arises, though: How will the Memorandum and the Constitution correlate? The constitution has supreme legal force over any legal act. The constitution has given us extensive rights, including the right to engage in political activities. And if we put these restrictions into the Memorandum, it will again be lawlessness. I am amazed that such ideas, cataclysmic for society, occur to the bright minds in the president's team. For us, the constitution is the foundation of civil peace and accord. By the way, the president himself said that. But his words often diverge from his deeds. [Kutorgin] And in whose, as you put it, bright minds, specifically, are such ideas born? [Kazannik] Here is an example. The unsinkable democrat Poltoranin speaks at a press conference and says: We should not hold general elections in 1996; what we need is to extend the terms of the president and the Federal Assembly for two more years. We should not, he says, distract the people from creative labor with an election campaign. While they--that is, Mikhail Poltoranin and company--will direct. Let people work. It does not matter that the constitution says the direct opposite. The important point is that the democratic authorities are not bound by any laws; they are above the constitution! Or, I read contrived "analytical" articles written by the patented democrat Gavriil Popov. Without a second thought he accuses me of some collusion with the president, faults me for not protesting, as Russia's general procurator, the Duma decision on political and economic amnesty while it was still at the stage of drafting and adoption. According to him, I was supposed to go to the Duma and convince the deputies to not adopt the "bad" decree on amnesty. But it was the democrats at the Constitutional Assembly who stripped the general procurator of the right of legislative initiative, the right to issue at his discretion an evaluation of draft laws! And more "practical" advice from Popov: Instead of carrying out the State Duma's amnesty decision, I should have simply... resigned. In his logic, the general procurator behaved not like a mature politician but as a professional jurist. Is this where the root of all evil is?! Wait a minute, Mr. Popov, no procurator likes the obsolete Criminal Code these days, among other reasons because it does not contain norms on combating corruption and organized crime. So what do we do now--do all procurators stop applying the norms of criminal law and resign en masse? It is not a procurator's business to discuss such things! He must ensure precise and undeviating compliance with the law. Regardless of what kind of law it is. Perhaps the minds of many democrats are organized in a way I cannot comprehend. Their thoughts regarding compliance with the law go in an entirely different direction. It was recommended to me, for instance, not to release the Lefortovo prisoners without first obtaining a pledge from them that they would not engage in political activities. But all of this would be contrary to the constitution! The most adamant democrats maintain, however, quite seriously that observing the constitution and the law is not the main task of the general procurator. You see, he must be a politician and personally loyal to the president. [Kutorgin] Is this not where the proposal came from to transfer Lefortovo prison to the procuracy's jurisdiction? [Kazannik] For us, it was a complete surprise. Although, you know, I have also begun to get used to the fact that you cannot find the authors of presidential edicts and directives no matter how hard you look. The liquidation of the Ministry of Security was a surprise even for our glorious chekists. Thousands of criminal cases that were being investigated by security organ investigators were left hanging. In many of them, people had been arrested. They started moving "cases"--in sacks!--to the general procuracy without any legal grounds. We, however, do not have the staff, office space, or money to investigate "outside" criminal cases. We got our heads together. Prepared a draft presidential directive to transfer the investigative detention facility in Lefortovo to the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], and the investigative staff, money, etc. to the procuracy. The heads of all the agencies involved initialed the draft--myself, Golushko, and Yerin. Then the directive comes out, from which I learn that the general procuracy for the first time in its history has acquired its own prison. That is something to see! [Kutorgin] The paradox of the case with your resignation, Aleksey Ivanovich, is apparently clear to everybody. The press, however, especially the Moscow press, tirelessly continue to label you as a Don Quixote, a fighter of windmills. Why do you think this is happening? [Kazannik] I think that it is simply beyond comprehension for journalists that a normal person can give up a high-level state job and a good salary. For this kind of goodies, some probably reason, one could keep in prison nearly the entire population of the country! After all, in the 1930's-1950's some criminal cases were fabricated for the single purpose of confiscating good apartments from honest people and giving them to chekists who did well in uncovering "enemies of the people." And here a man voluntarily, for the sake of some amnesty, gives up material things. Is it not obvious that he is God's fool? [Kutorgin] Forgive me for asking, Aleksey Ivanovich, but could you reveal the burning secret: How much was the general procurator paid? [Kazannik] The working people's acute curiosity regarding this issue is understandable. After all, we are still ruled by the Bolshevik perception that only wealth is worse than poverty. Well, after the new year my salary with all allowances amounted to almost 1 million rubles. A month. I was given an apartment in the so-called "presidential house." The general procuracy, in keeping with the law, provided me with financial aid (fully repayable), to help me settle in Moscow. But now it is all... history. I returned the apartment to the government of Moscow, and the furniture and other property--to the general procuracy apparat, in accordance with the inventory. Everything, to the last nail. The second reason for all the scoffing around my persona is completely paradoxical: I wanted... to increase the fight against crime, to protect the individual's inalienable right to life. To this end, I intended to reform the procuracy. But this is not a realistic undertaking, they said; this is fighting windmills. We, meanwhile, drafted a concept of procuracy reform. We put at the forefront (on a pedestal, if you wish) the central figure in the criminal process--the investigator. He should be paid well, and be positioned high in the rank structure. A talented investigator, even in a rayon procuracy, should be awarded the title "distinguished," "honorary," "people's academician." Like rural school director Sukhomlinskiy! In this undertaking I was met with understanding by the general procuracy's collegium, support in the regions, and frankly, I was joyous. Some journalists, however, began to contend that I had been deceived... everywhere. That is, that I was allegedly surrounded only by crooks. [Kutorgin] Is it true that the presidential representatives in some regions attempted to "pressure" you and your staff, "influence" you, so to say, in their interests? [Kazannik] Yes. After the October events the entire scope of authority in the regions essentially shifted to heads of administration and presidential representatives. Much like a long time ago, when petitioners went to Lenin, they began showing up at the general procuracy with one and the same request--to immediately remove the local procurator and replace him with one of "their people!" The main reason? Procurators' "hesitation" during the October crisis. In other words, they were making demands on the procurators in the spirit of old party traditions: You did not support the president's course, they said, did not show political maturity. "Vacillated together with the course..." We immediately turned away such petitioners. I have not relieved of duty a single procurator for political reasons. Not a single one! The important point is not in waving the presidential banner, which has long turned into a worn rag, but, I repeat, strictly observing the law. [Kutorgin] Those who have visited you at home before, Aleksey Ivanovich, will confirm, as I can, that the pilgrimage to power has not given you any material wealth. You still live in a Khrushchev period small apartment. With a view of an oil refinery and a penal colony. Next door is a dormitory for early parolees. Honestly--do you not regret that you ended up where you started? [Kazannik] Honestly--a professor and a doctor of science probably could count on better housing. But I do not regret the loss of Moscow conveniences. Money is dear, but honor is dearer. My own fate is not that important. I will return to the university, to my old collective, to my students. I will nurture new jurists into independent procurators who respect the law. They are the future... Will get involved in political activities as a volunteer. Perhaps I will give a hand to some people in the parliamentary and presidential elections in 1996. I realize that I have used up the limit of errors. If I am going to "fall" for someone, this time there should be no mistakes. It should be once and for all...
