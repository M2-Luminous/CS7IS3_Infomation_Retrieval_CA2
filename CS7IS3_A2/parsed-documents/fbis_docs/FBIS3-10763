The newspaper, which cites Army "officers" as its sources, reports de Leon has been the object of two thwarted coups since he assumed the Presidency in June 1993, replacing deposed President Jorge Serrano, following his self-perpetrated coup on 25 May of the same year. Troops loyal to the president thwarted the attempted coups, the paper reported without expanding on the details of those who participated in the alleged coups to disrupt constitutional order. The report adds after the thwarted coups the Army "has been strengthened, and democracy is safe." Both de Leon and his defense minister, General Mario Rene Enriquez, have denied intense rumors of alleged coup attempts to unseat the chief of state. They have admitted, however, "retired military and frustrated politicians," who were not identified, once knocked on the doors of the garrisons to promote a coup d'etat against Ramiro de Leon, former human rights ombudsman. Enrique states the Armed Forces will no longer lend itself to any more revolts as in the past and that institutionality and the democratic process are guaranteed.
