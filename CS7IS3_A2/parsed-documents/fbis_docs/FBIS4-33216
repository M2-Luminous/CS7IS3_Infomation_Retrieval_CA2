Overwhelmed with the misery he found on the outskirts of Brasilia, Bisol said yesterday during a meeting with the people of Santa Maria that violence is justified when it is used to resist violence for which the government is directly responsible. As a retired appellate judge, Bisol recalled that he has spent years judging cases of legitimate and illegitimate violence. "The people have the right to take the law into their own hands when the government cannot guarantee justice," he said. According to Bisol, this norm is included in any modern study of the general theory of law. He said that with the increase of violence and insecurity in the cities, the rich are protecting themselves, equip their houses with alarms, and even buy weapons with which to defend themselves. "The poor do not have police protection or weapons with which to defend themselves," he said. According to Bisol, his statements in defense of the revolution, which were widely covered by the newspapers, were originated following a meeting he had with two women in the satellite city of Santa Maria. They complained about the lack of security, and told him their daughters had been raped as a consequence of the lack of police protection in one of the most violent areas of the Federal District. The senator's statements were interpreted on the following day as a speech in defense of violence. "Anyone can defend his possessions with violence," Bisol clarified today. He said that as a candidate for vice president he is worried that his statements during the election campaign are being taken "out of context." He said that some days ago he referred to the presidential candidate for the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], Fernando Henrique Cardoso, as a sociologist, noting that sometimes people show wisdom in one field and ignorance in another, as for example in the juridical field. Bisol said: "On the following day a newspaper published that I had called Cardoso ignorant." This is why the senator announced that he intends in the next few days to speak with the attorney general, and suggest to him a meeting among politicians and journalists to carry out a campaign focused on "more substantial issues." Bisol said that if the current trend continues, the candidates will have to spend most of their time justifying their statements.
