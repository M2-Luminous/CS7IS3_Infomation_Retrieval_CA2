Notably, Hungary had the largest deficit in the balance of payments and the largest relative trade deficit (compared to exports and to the GDP). The fact that exports increased slightly in the first quarter of this year cannot be interpreted as a sign of reversal in view of the extremely low level of trade in the same period of last year. Imports grew much faster than exports, and the enduring and very considerable deficits in the balance of trade and the balance of payments ($750 million and $800 million, respectively, in three months) begin to threaten the stability of the economy. The trouble is greater than one would think; to realize this, one should discard two beliefs in particular. According to one belief, the 1993 decline in our exports was part of a general East European trend which was caused primarily by the recession in the West. According to the other, the huge deficit in the balance of trade and the balance of payments in the first quarter of this year is actually "a good thing" because it is a sign that the economy began to grow. Both parts of the first belief mentioned above are based on an error. On the one hand: In 1993, in a number of East European countries, the value of exports expressed in U.S. dollars did not decrease but increased (especially that of the exports into industrialized countries), and the fact that the total exports of the region decreased slightly was largely due to the extreme decline in Hungarian exports. Concerning the entire region, we have final data only for the first three quarters of last year. These data indicate that the total exports from Eastern Europe as well as the exports to the industrialized countries expressed in U.S. dollars decreased by approximately 2 percent compared to the same period of the previous year. However, if we disregard Hungary's results and look at the exports of only the other countries, it appears that last year the rest of the countries increased their total exports by 3 percent, and their exports to the West by 4.5 percent.[.sup]1[/] On the other hand, in spite of the recession in the West, the Czech Republic was able to increase the dollar value of its exports to the West by 20 percent, Poland by 12 percent, and Romania by 7.5 percent. (Since the export prices of the aforementioned countries calculated in U.S. dollars decreased, the increase in the volume of their exports was even more considerable.) In view of these results it is difficult to believe that Hungarian exports to the West decreased in 1993 by 21 (!) percent largely because of the recession in the West. And indeed, this explanation is without any factual foundation. Namely, while the Western demand for import goods from the entire East European region decreased by 5 percent, the so-called specific demand for imported goods which is relevant for the individual countries[.sup]2[/] decreased more than the average (by 5.5 percent) in the case of the Czech Republic and Poland, which both exhibited considerable export growth. Thus, the recession in the West does not explain anything. The reason for the difference in export results must be found within the individual countries, in the internal prerequisites and the differences in economic policies. The other belief is that the Hungarian trade deficit is actually a good thing because it is connected to the vitalization of the economy. This opinion is unfounded, but this is not the only problem with it. Namely, those who believe or want people to believe that things are basically all right unwittingly obscure two connected but fundamentally different issues. One of them is whether there are favorable economic processes behind the trade deficit, i.e., whether the deficit is desirable. The other question is whether the imbalance can be sustained. Strongly simplified, one can say that the trade deficit is desirable if it happens while exports are increasing and is prompted by processes which can provide a foundation for the subsequent growth of the economy. However, it is certain that the deficit is undesirable when it is accompanied by a decrease in exports, a considerable increase in imports not for the purposes of investment projects, and by domestic producers being squeezed out of the domestic market. These symptoms indicate the low or decreasing ability of the country to compete on the international market; they are hardly desirable. However, the trade imbalance is characterized not only by the favorable or unfavorable processes which created it, but also by its relative size. Although there are no rigid limits, generally it is still possible to decide whether the relation of the deficit to the country's foreign currency income, GDP, foreign currency reserves (or other indicators) is still in a realm in which the deficit can be financed on a sustained basis (without undermining the country's future financial standing), then the deficit can still be sustained. However, there is a limit beyond which the deficit becomes unsustainable. Of course, this limit is not independent of the perception of creditors and foreign investors whether the deficit is desirable, and by far precedes the point after which the deficit becomes technically impossible to finance. (Incidentally, one should not rely on the momentary judgments of creditors and investors, because they can unexpectedly and fundamentally change.) Approaching this limit, the country itself must take convincing steps to reduce the deficit. If these steps are not taken by the country, sooner or later they will be taken by creditors and investors. Looking over the East European countries' 1993 results, one can find examples of desirable and sustainable trade deficit. For instance, in the Czech Republic, exports increased very rapidly, and investment-oriented imports increased considerably, while the deficit remained negligible. Slovenia offers an example where the deficit is presumably undesirable (it was induced by a slight decrease in exports and an increase in consumption), but because it is insignificant, it is also sustainable. Finally, there is also an example where the deficit is the result of desirable processes (primarily due to economic expansion; it was accompanied by a rapid growth in exports to the West and the import of machinery), but it is presumably still not sustainable, because it is too large; this is the situation in Poland. The trade deficit in Hungary is fundamentally different: The deficit is primarily due to a decrease in exports, and the increase in imports in 1993 had little to do with an acceleration of the economy; at any rate, indications of the latter are uncertain. But independent of all this one must see that if the deficit reached one-third of the value of the exports, and is beginning to exceed 10 percent of the GDP, it is certainly not sustainable. Not even when, due to credits, the level of foreign currency reserves increased to a relatively high level. Namely, these reserves are meager compared to the deficit, and they imply mostly debts. A comparison of the results of Hungarian foreign trade with other countries of the region indicates that the decrease in Hungarian exports was unique and by far not unavoidable. The roots of the problem must be found not without, but within, in Hungarian economic prerequisites and economic policy. Footnotes 1.

The source of all the data in the article is the database of the UN European Economic Committee which is based on national statistics. See: Economic Survey of Europe in 1993-1994. 2. The change in the ("specific") demand for imports from individual countries can be calculated as the weighted average of the demand for imports in the OECD countries, in such a way that as a bias we employ the percentages of the share of Western countries in the exports of individual Eastern countries.
