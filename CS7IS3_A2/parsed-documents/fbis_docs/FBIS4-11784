[Peres] It stems from the special situation in the city, and in my opinion it can alleviate the tension in the city, as well as bring about the resumption and early conclusion of the Gaza and Jericho talks. [Ganor] Will this agreement serve as an example for other agreements which could be implemented on the ground before the autonomy is established? [Peres] I do not think so. I hope there will be no need to repeat this thing, meaning that there will be no more terrible incidents such as at the Cave of the Patriarchs. I want to state unequivocally that the Israeli Government alone is responsible for security at the Cave of the Patriarchs and for enabling Jewish and Muslim worshipers to pray freely and without any danger to their lives. Not the settlers, guards, or anyone else is responsible for security -- only we are. Naturally we are interested in implementing arrangements which would permit peaceful prayers. In future we will consult with the Waqf on everything relating to the Muslim side, just as we have done in the past. [Ganor] What are the next steps, now that this agreement has been signed? [Peres] The main thing now is to facilitate the final part of the Gaza and Jericho negotiations and to implement this agreement soon. On the basis of the agreement achieved last night, seven days following the signing of the agreement on Hebron Palestinian police units are slated to start entering Gaza. This is to all intents and purposes the beginning of the agreement's implementation. [Ganor] Does the Hebron agreement pave the way for implementing the Gaza and Jericho agreement? [Peres] Certainly. The negotiations on Gaza and Jericho started the moment we reached agreement on Hebron. The Hebron agreement was signed today at 1100; immediately after that the Gaza and Jericho negotiations started. We will work ceaselessly until these negotiations are completed. The implementation stage will also be considerably accelerated. [Ganor] Is there an understanding regarding the timetable for the completion of the negotiations? [Peres] Some people say it will take a week, others that it will take two weeks. It depends on the rate of our work and on the problems we encounter. If we find quick solutions to the problems -- such as the problems of jurisdiction and authority -- then the process will be very quick. If there are problems, this could slow down the process. [Ganor] Will Israel stick to the target date of 13 April? [Peres] Israel will strive to honor this date -- whether the 13th, 14th, or 15th of April, the precise day does not matter so much. Again, this depends on our not encountering serious or unexpected problems. I hope things will run smoothly. My inner feeling is that the PLO -- just like us -- is interested in finally ending the negotiations and turning this into a reality. This is the first time the Palestinian people will have a concrete piece of reality, not merely a piece of paper, a declaration, a congratulatory or condolences letter -- but rather a territory, an authority, an administration, and responsibility, as is proper.
