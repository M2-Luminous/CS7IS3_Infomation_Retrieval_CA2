After our report was published, we were flooded with calls both from the press bosses and from our readers. We were congratulated by the public for our bold stand while some newspaper publishers complained that the report did not represent the facts. We had said the newspaper in Turkey had turned into a "state press" because all the leading papers were receiving state assistance. Some publishers strongly disputed this and said their editorial policies had reflected a pro-state stance simply because Turkey was going through hard times and they felt they had to defend the government "as we are all in the same boat." Last week the public was shocked when it was revealed that Prime Minister Tansu Ciller issued a new memorandum to state banks that all the advertisement they gave would be subject to the approval of the prime minister. So the prime minister will serve as an official advertising agency. Beyond that it became public that with such an application the prime minister is admitting she has created a state press that will receive its advertising money straight from her. So whoever is pro-government can get ads from the state banks but if you speak the truth and try to correct the ills of the country then you will face a boycott from the prime minister. We have seen all this too many times before and they have never succeeded. What is said is that now the leading newspapers with the exception of SABAH (because we have seen in the past few weeks that the paper does not run front page advertisements of state banks) are all running ads of state banks on the right-hand bottom corners of their front pages and thus the prime minister's memorandum has cast a shadow on their editorial policies. It is hard to understand why the prime minister issued such a memorandum and by doing so admitted her guilt of trying to control the newspapers. She was already providing heavy subsidies to the press that support her. She was giving them incentives and advertisements especially by state banks. So why make it all public? No wonder our press is being described as a "state press" abroad and among diplomats in Turkey. What a great shame.
