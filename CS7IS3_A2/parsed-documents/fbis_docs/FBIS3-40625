After taking over the government, it is its responsibility to make good on its election promises and focus on changing the condition of the people. It is a welcome development that Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has issued an ordinance to fulfill her election promises. Pakistan is an Islamic nation. It was established on the Islamic principle. In addition to protecting the nation's physical boundaries, it is the foremost duty of the government to protect its ideological boundaries. A country that is ideologically weak suffers from internal strife; an example is the recent division in the Soviet Union. In contrast, an ideologically strong nation can overcome all difficult and testing problems. The latest example of this is Afghanistan, which defeated a superpower and is busy building a new country. After Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan, Pakistan is the strongest fort of Islam. All those satanic forces that want to hurt Muslims are focusing their ugly eyes on Pakistan. In these modern times, any country can be weakened without any military action by weakening it on the inside. Therefore, the easiest system for it is to affect any country's ideological perspective in the name of culture. This way, one can bring about a revolution according to their wishes. In Pakistan, under this cultural campaign, and in the name of cultural heritage, innocent minds are being made prey. The electronic media is airing programs which are opposed to our Islamic and cultural beliefs. These are nothing more than meaningless noise. They are using inconceivable language, strange clothing, jiggling bodies, and trying to put these ideas in the minds of the people, as if this is our culture. All this is done by the government-controlled electronic media. The hand that holds the pen and the mind that represents purity are both being eroded by shameless and wayward behavior. If we do not stop this spreading flood, then it will drown our traditional and cultural pride. This country was not made easily, and we will not let it become a victim of foreign conspiracies. It was not established by the sacrifices of some joker. The devout blood of innumerable young men was shed on this land. Its progress is the result of the hard work of thousands of young people. That is how the dawn of independence emerged finally to give light to the lightless eyes. We request of the federal cultural minister that he stop the spread of this flood with his wisdom and strategy. We hope that he will take some action immediately and will keep his promise.
