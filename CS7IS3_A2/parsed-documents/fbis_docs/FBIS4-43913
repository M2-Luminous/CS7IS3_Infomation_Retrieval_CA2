"The government must inform Parliament before any decision is made on a military intervention in Rwanda" he said, adding "this is the only seat where the (mission) objectives can be fully examined as well as the risks for our troops which could derive from decisions made in haste or without due reflection." "Thus Minister Previti, who for some time has promised to illustrate to the Senate defense committee the guidelines of his policy" Senator Bertoni added, "should now quickly fulfill this commitment, to communicate the government's intentions regarding the conflict in Rwanda." "It is inadmissible" he concluded, "that Parliament must be limited to only information relayed through the media and not put in the position to express its views on such an important question through a meeting with the minister." Defense Minister Cesare Previti confirmed later that Italy could participate in an eventual humanitarian mission on the condition that it be multi-national and for peaceful purposes. Speaking to the press before entering a cabinet meeting, the minister told the press how such a multi-national peace mission would have to be commanded by an authority which was above any national level or interest. Italy, Previti added, "is taking part in diplomatic negotiations" for such a solution and that his defense minister was raising no objection to such a project. The United Nations Security Council last night gave its green light to a French-led humanitarian mission. Opposition Progressive groups in both the Senate and the House have asked that Previti appear in their competent committees to illustrate the new defense model. In a joint statement issued today, Senate Progressive whip Cesare Salvi and House whip Luigi Berlinguer and the respective committee chairmen Loreto and Ruffino, also asked that the matter also be subject to a floor debate. The Progressives went on to point out how the new government has been in power for some six weeks and has yet to illustrate its policies to parliament for discussion. "This becomes even more subject to criticism" they stated, "given that during the confidence debate the government dealt with security and defense policies in a generic and brief way." In reference to statements made by Previti on Rwanda, the Progressives underscored how "Even on such topics the minister did not feel it was opportune to inform the parliament committee of his intentions. Such behavior is not adapted to our parliamentary democracy."
