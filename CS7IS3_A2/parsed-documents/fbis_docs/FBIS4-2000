At the same time, industrial enterprises strove to overcome the effect caused by such unfavorable factors as financial strain, soaring raw material prices, and insufficient transportation capacity, by deepening their internal reform. Taking the market as a guide, they vigorously readjusted their product mix and organizational structure, promoted technical transformation, tapped potentials, and cut down on raw material consumption. As a result, the industrial output value for the whole region topped 10 billion yuan for the first time, and economic efficiency increased remarkably. In this way, our region realized the goal of increasing output value, sales, profits, and taxes simultaneously, thus laying a good foundation for further development. Production passed into the realm of accelerated development. According to preliminary statistics, our region's total industrial output value reached 12.08 billion yuan in 1993. With the price factor included, it increased by 13.9 percent over 1992. The industrial output value of the industries run by townships and above stood at 11.28 billion yuan, an increase of 12.1 percent. At the same time they were increasing their production, enterprises speeded up new product development and product structure adjustments to increase their value. In 1993 all industrial enterprises that practice independent accounting run by townships and above increased their output value by 3.22 billion yuan, an increase of 43.4 percent over the previous year. There was good linkup between production and sales. At the same time that industrial enterprises in our region were firmly grasping production, they were also developing and broadening their various sales promotion activities to improve the linkup between production and sales. In 1993 the industrial enterprises at the township level and above realized total industrial sales of 11 billion yuan. With the price factor included, sales increased by 13.5 percent. The product selling rate stood at 97.6 percent, an increase of 2.2 percentage points over 1992. This surpassed the national average rate by 1.2 percentage points. The product selling rate of big and medium-sized enterprises was as high as 99.1 percent. Efficiency as a whole picked up, and there was remarkable improvement in enterprise management and operation. In 1993, all the industrial enterprises that practice independent accounting in the region succeeded in raising output value and sales income by 43.6 percent and 55.1 percent, respectively. Their profits and taxes increased by 54.7 percent over 1992, reaching an all-time high. Profits were 184 million yuan, 2.4 times that of 1992. In particular, the big and medium-sized enterprises that occupy leading positions achieved great results in turning losses into gains. Sixty-nine enterprises, with a deficit of 9.33 million yuan in 1992, realized a surplus of 122 million yuan in 1993. Their profits and taxes stood at 700 million yuan, increasing by 82.9 percent over 1992, which accounted for 71.1 percent of the total profits and taxes of all industrial enterprises that practice independent accounting, an increase of 11.2 percent over 1992. Their efficiency improved, as did their capital utilization result. The reproduction cycle tended to be normal, the input-output level was strengthened, and the comprehensive economic index improved. In 1990, the comprehensive economic efficiency index of industrial enterprises that practice independent accounting in our region stood at 76.7 percent, rising by nearly 10 percentage points over 1992. Looking at six different indexes, their results were better than those in 1992, with the exception of the industrial added value rate. The comprehensive economic efficiency index of big enterprises reached 82.2 percent, increasing by 13.5 percentage points over 1992. The big enterprises surpassed the levels of industrial enterprises that practice independent accounting of the whole region in four out of the six indexes.
