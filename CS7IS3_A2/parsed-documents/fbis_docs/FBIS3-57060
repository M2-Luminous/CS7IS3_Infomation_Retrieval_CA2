An aggressive nationalist policy aimed at establishing a nation state, which manifests itself through a well-considered system of legislative acts, is directed toward ousting the Russian-language population from Estonia and brings them humiliation and suffering. This is what the appeal adopted at the session of the Representative Assembly's presidium on 18 January says. The appeal states that over a third of permanent Estonian residents have been declared to be foreigners; the principles of the Human Right Declaration and the Convention on the Elimination or Reduction of Statelessness have thereby been ignored. The Representative Assembly notes that until now the awarding of citizenship on the basis of one's free will has not been decided, as had been envisaged in the agreement on the foundations of interstate relations concluded between Estonia and Russia on 12 January 1991, as well as the granting of permits for permanent residence. This is what the Representative Assembly's statement says.
