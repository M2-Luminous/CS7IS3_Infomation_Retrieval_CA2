Whether a "green light" will be on is not clear yet. Still, signs are strong that a new situation is about to develop. The ROK Government thinks the talks between Carter and Kim Il-song will pave the way for resuming dialogue between the United States and North Korea. Everyone seems to agree on this. This is because the government has left open its door to dialogue with North Korea even though it has tried to have the UN Security Council pass a resolution on sanctions. An official concerned said: "We have no reason to say no to the efforts to resolve the issue through the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks." Still, the government is quite negative. An official concerned said: "We know North Korea better than the United States does. We must watch North Korea because it may change its attitude anytime." In this way, he did not slacken his wariness of North Korea. The government convened a Unification and Security Policy Coordination Council meeting, during which no decision was made. This means the government decided to wait; it will make a decision upon hearing explanations from Carter, who will return to Seoul on the morning of 18 June. The government assumes such an attitude because of its displeasure with the United States. It seems displeased, first of all, with the United States' attitude toward special inspections. The government worries that the United States may unilaterally seek to back away from the ROK-U.S. agreement to penetrate "North Korea's nuclear past." The results of the talks show that holding the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks is conditioned on "North Korea's freezing its nuclear activities at their present level." If North Korea expresses its position on this issue through diplomatic channels, the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks will take place naturally. ROK Government officials have refrained from commenting on the talks between Carter and Kim Il-song. This appears to be intended to express their displeasure. If a policy concerning a draft UN Security Council resolution on sanctions, which was released on 16 June, without a justifiable explanation, is changed, the trustworthiness of such policy will be questioned. Our government seems displeased because Carter was playing the role of more than President Clinton's special envoy, even though the U.S. Government repeatedly insisted he was visiting North Korea as a private citizen and even though our government expressed its worry that North Korea might make ill use of him. The attempt by the United States to change its policy by taking advantage of Carter's visit to North Korea makes the ROK-U.S. cooperation system unstable. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Secretary of State Christopher had three telephone conversations on the morning of 17 June and discussed the details of the talks between Carter and Kim Il-song. This was a deliberate attempt for the United States to win an understanding from our government and dispel our government's worry on the cooperation system. Anyway, our government's efforts to push for the sanctions will likely go nowhere with making any gain. However, the possibility is high that North Korea, as it has done so far, will start mapping out and implement another strategy.
