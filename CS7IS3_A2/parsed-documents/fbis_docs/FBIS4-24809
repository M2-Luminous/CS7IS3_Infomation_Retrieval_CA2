For half a year, she complained about her loss to the studio executives and the relevant departments in charge of the studio, but without avail. On April 5, 1993, she brought a lawsuit through a local court for protecting consumers' legitimate rights and interests. The court is part of the People's Court of Qinhuai District in Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu Province. She demanded that the studio apologize to her and compensate her for her loss. She did not know then that her case would become the first case handled by China's first court for protecting consumers' rights and interests. During the court hearing, the studio apologized to Xiao Qing. Mediated by the court, it agreed to pay her 500 yuan in compensation for her loss. Since its establishment in March 1993, the court for protecting consumers' rights and interests has handled nearly 200 cases, according to Wang Dianyou, president of the Qinhuai District People's Court. Wang said that these cases involved a wide range of disputes between buyers and sellers concerning the quality of goods, such as a fur-lined coat costing several thousand yuan and a pair of shoes costing about ten yuan. He said that the court had made decisions on a small number of cases and had mediated in the rest. "With our help, some disputes are resolved easily," he said. For instance, a woman complained to the court that a skirt made by a tailor was too tight for her, but the tailor refused to alter it or give her compensation. The dispute was resolved within two hours, with mediation by a court official. The tailor agreed to either compensate her or make her a new skirt. Some owners of private shops refused to refund consumers even if their goods were found shoddy, Wang said. But when a court official arrived at such shops, none of the owners would refuse to refund consumers, he added. Wang said: "The court for protecting consumers' rights and interests must speak and act on behalf of consumers. I think it should enable the people to have a place to give vent to their grievances." The court also provides consultancy services to local consumers, as well as consumers in the Daqing Oilfield in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province and in the island Province of Hainan in south China, he said.
