Roy MacLaren, Canadian minister for international trade, said in Tokyo that Canada "regrets" the revival of "Super 301" trade legislation by U.S. President Bill Clinton as well as the U.S. insistence on setting numerical trade targets in bilateral trade with Japan. But he quickly added, "there is broad recognition, including by the Japanese Government, that meaningful action to address Japan's chronic current account surpluses is essential." Canada, MacLaren said, favors a more open, international Japan and suggested that the country must bring forth "meaningful regulatory and administrative reform," particularly in distribution, transportation, communications and financial services. Speaking to Japanese and Canadian executives, MacLaren emphasized that while he does not support the U.S. approach to negotiations with Japan, "Japan remains limited by regulations, many of which appear to us as quite unnecessary." Meeting reporters after his address, MacLaren said both Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata outlined Japan's commitment to deregulation in meetings with him. Detailed plans were not presented, but an outline for changes over the next five years were shown him, he said. At later meetings with International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai and Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, MacLaren said he would press for significant action in reducing regulatory barriers to the expansion of Canadian exports of building products, other materials, and value-added goods to Japan. Touching on the market access measures Japan released last week, the minister said Canada "welcomes them." But, he added, "they hardly meet what we regard as a desirable goal -- they don't go very far -- but are a step." He also stressed that Canada supports decentralization in Japan and pointed to his visit to the southernmost main island of Kyushu earlier this week as underlining the benefits small and medium Canadian companies can obtain if they don't have to do business "through Tokyo's great trading companies." At the regional level, he suggested, business-to-business ventures and agreements "come quickly." MacLaren will host a roundtable on Japan-Canada business and economic relations Friday and meet with several business leaders before departing Saturday for Morocco where he will represent Canada at the signing of the Uruguay Round multilateral trade agreement.
