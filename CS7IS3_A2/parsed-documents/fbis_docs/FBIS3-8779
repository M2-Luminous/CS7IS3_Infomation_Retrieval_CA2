[Fur] Visibly and regrettably, the developments in the radio have an impact on political life. However, they certainly do not have any effect on society. Dealing with these kinds of internal affairs of an institution is the least of society's problems. As for the allegation that the government is behind the dismissals, I have to refute it most firmly. [Pinter] What is your reaction to the view that, since you were elected party chairman, you have subordinated all your political activities exclusively to the propaganda of success? [Fur] This view is unfounded and unjust. We are in a period of assessment and we should not tolerate a situation in which only our failures and mistakes are revealed to society. This is not because it hurts us but because it creates a distorted image, and only provides the voters with a basis for drawing the wrong conclusions. Noisily and with demagogic methods rather than arguments, our competitors are trying to take away from us even those results that can be proved to have been achieved by us since 1990. The barrage has persisted since the moment our government took office, and it has had some effects. Our period of being defensive has ended. We are not just advertising our successes, we are providing information about the facts. The economic decline began at the beginning of the 1980's -- partly as a result of the radical change of external circumstances, the south Slav war and the embargo, and the difficulties that went with the change of regime -- it accelerated from 1990, but we cannot talk about a slump. The year 1993 was the turning point. At the moment, we can only talk about some development in comparison with the beginning of the decline but this does not yet mean the rise of the nation. The favorable tendencies of 1993 are continuing in 1994. A 6 to 7 percent inflation was projected for January but the actual figure was 3.2 percent. This is a fact. For some people, stating this fact is the same as the propaganda of success, but for us, it is proof that we are following the correct road. [Pinter] Is it also not a fact that there are many people in this country who have been left to fend for themselves and are stumbling along this road with ever greater difficulty? [Fur] It is. However, encouragement supported by the facts is also meant for those who, as a result of their increasingly desperate living conditions, feel that this government coalition or this system has left them on their own. We do not want to make the situation look better than it is, because it also is depressing for us, but it is not paralyzing. We must not talk about hopelessness. [Pinter] Have you formed an opinion on the campaign behavior of other parties? [Fur] The opposition is mainly trying to gain social support by damaging our reputation. They want to blame us for all the troubles of the transformation. The favorite statement of the Hungarian Socialist Party's [MSZP] chairman [Gyula Horn] is that this government was characterized by unprecedented dilettantism. Says he, who was formerly part of the power that was almost completely unable to do anything to stop and reverse the damaging processes. Under the rule of their great expertise, only the negative things were accumulated. However, what is really dangerous is that many people are making irresponsible promises to the nation. Should they get into government, it would soon be discovered that they have misled society, and this would result in a formerly unseen -- mainly moral and economic -- crisis for the country. Chaos could reappear where there should be order. [Pinter] Do you link the danger of this chaos with the fact that various ideologies are gaining ground? [Fur] The unshakably left-wing and liberal ideology that is created at writing desks will prove to be a restraint on social development. During the decades of socialism, we had the chance to experience the true meaning of ideological obsession. An invented theoretical system was forced onto reality. I caution the country against a power whose thinking is so much within theoretical limits. It is to be feared that the representatives of a power like this would follow the example of the Bourbons and we will find that they have not learned or forgotten anything. [Pinter] According to many surveys, the left wing has gained significant support in recent months. When you formulate your sharp criticism, are you not worried that, because of the terms you use, you will find yourself irrevocably opposed to the section of society that supports the left wing? [Fur] My intention is completely different. I certainly do not want to get into a conflict with anyone. As a believer, I do not have hatred for anyone. It is always the political thoughts and mentality that I criticize. I am concerned for the country in case the left wing comes to power. This danger exists because, after four decades of dictatorship, this way of thinking -- and please do not forget: organization -- has its traces in society. [Pinter] Do you hope that the election campaign and your arguments will change this? [Fur] Undoubtedly, I believe in the power of words, and that the expression of various realizations can divert thinking people in the right direction. I am aware that people who have very much committed themselves to the joint political action of the MSZP and the trade unions, or the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], which is drawing closer to the left wing double quick, will not be much influenced by my arguments. It is almost as important, however, to win the silent majority to ourselves. They make up 50 percent of society in Hungary. [passage omitted] They will decide the fate of the elections and what side the country, which is unfortunately still very quiet, will take. [passage omitted] [Pinter] While you are constantly warning the country against expecting miracles, is it not possible that the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is expecting a miracle as far as its own fate is concerned? [Fur] The only thing we trust in is that the country will appreciate our results and efforts. There are encouraging signs for this. [Pinter] Are there any signs of this that you deliberately do not talk about? [Fur] We do not have secrets. [Pinter] In your view, how successfully are the MDF politicians, who face the country's public, serving the intention to gain more ground? [Fur] The MDF's national committee does not necessarily agree completely with all statements. However, I am not aware of major deviations. The slight differences, on the other hand, are explicitly useful. For example, the MDF's liberal, Christian, and conservative wings are still mentioned. I find the term conservative more acceptable than populist-national, which has been torn to shreds. [Pinter] Do these tendencies actually exist? [Fur] They do not exist as political tendencies. However, we can say that our members have different ideological sources of thought. Some were more affected by national liberalism, others by Christian democracy, or conservatism. [passage omitted] [Pinter] Do you have any contact with Istvan Csurka [co- chairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party, MIEP]? [Fur] I do not. [Pinter] And with the MIEP? [Fur] No. [Pinter] Do you see this the only natural state of affairs? [Fur] I do. [Pinter] Does your answer also mean that, regardless of the election results and the political situation that arises afterwards, there can be no common road for the MDF and the MIEP? [Fur] It is impossible for this kind of road to exist. The MIEP is attacking us in an astonishing style. It is outright shocking that Csurka and Jozsef Torgyan [chairman of the Independent Smallholders Party] participated in a joint demonstration in the Sports Hall. [Pinter] Was it this fact that shocked you or what was said there? [Fur] The fact that this joint appearance took place. What the participants said was nothing new. In the past, we already had the chance to be shocked at what they had to say. [Pinter] In your view, is Csurka's and Torgyan's supporting camp growing? [Fur] Not at all. The followers come from a narrow social group. Many of them are unable to process their injuries or are psychologically broken, perhaps misled people. [Pinter] Are you sure that the MDF membership has the same views on Csurka's and Torgyan's politics and supporters? [Fur] If there had been any supporters of these people in our party, they would have left us and joined Csurka's and Torgyan's parties. The unity and atmosphere of our seventh national meeting should have convinced the doubters and those who are sincerely concerned about our political line. Not one of the 720 deputies who gathered there appeared as a supporter of undesirable tendencies. [Pinter] After the national meeting and your election as party chairman, is your cooperation with Prime Minister Peter Boross changing in any way? [Fur] Only in the sense that our cooperation is even stronger. I can say the same about [Deputy Chairman] Sandor Lezsak, the other key character in our party. These three people are operating without any problems. We will take care to keep it this way. [passage omitted] [Pinter] What do Boross's prime ministerial activities so far mean for the MDF? [Fur] A huge gain. Boross has brought a powerful pragmatism into governing and politics in general. His legal training and experience as a company leader make him very well informed in the details of state administration. The membership expects a lot of him. [Pinter] What is your reaction to the loose and not very clearly defined election cooperations? [Fur] With some reservation and acknowledgment. The left wing has obviously sorted itself out, while there is much uncertainty at the liberals. We are not certain if the SZDSZ is one of the left- wing parties. It shows itself to be one because it is getting increasingly close to the idea of forming a coalition with the MSZP. it is strange because a liberal party by no means can belong to the left wing. I wonder if the supporter of a social-liberal model can belong to the liberal bloc. [Pinter] Do you also have doubts about the line of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]? [Fur] Not at all. There have been serious changes in the Fidesz, the supporters of the social-liberal solution have left the party. [Pinter] In a situation when the coalition is being planned, has this made the Fidesz a more attractive party for you? [Fur] I can answer this when I see the election results. In my view, a regular dialogue on various practical issues is certainly possible. This could be very useful in the remaining period of parliament. [Pinter] Have you been surprised by the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] statements in connection with the MDF in the campaign? [Fur] I do not think it is right to try to blame the MDF for the corrupt practices in privatization. They have also made some other badly worded criticisms. Regardless of this, the two parties, which are in close relationship, often fight for completely identical goals. [Pinter] Could relations between the MDF and the KDNP become tense in the fight for votes? [Fur] No. We see this campaign as a running race, rather than a boxing match. [Pinter] Does this understanding apply to all participants? [Fur] It certainly applies to the current coalition partners. [passage omitted] [Pinter] Are you not preparing to continue your activities in opposition after the elections? [Fur] This possibility does not exist in my conscious mind, it might exist in my subconscious at most. On the basis of what I can see now, I say that we will succeed. [passage omitted] [Pinter] Do you expect we will have a parliament that can give a stable government to the country until 1998? [Fur] Only if the calm and sober political forces get the majority. All other solutions hold out the danger of a standstill and anarchy. We should not upset the country. [Pinter] Do you think that this is what would happen if the current opposition came to power? [Fur] I do, equally in politics and the economy. The country cannot take this risk.
