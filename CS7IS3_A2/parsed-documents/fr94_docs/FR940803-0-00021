FR940803-0-00021 FR940803-0-00007 At the same time, lowering the ceiling would not change the rates the vast majority of credit unions are charging, since they are already at or below market. A ceiling can cause rates to be higher than they would have been without the ceiling. The closer a loan rate is to actual market rates, the more likely it is that the ceiling will act as a floor for rates. There are two reasons why this happens. First, setting a ceiling close to market rates creates the impression that the ceiling rate is the ``federally approved'' rate. Second, if credit unions feel they may not have the flexibility to raise rates in the near future should market rates rise unexpectedly, they are more likely to keep current rates higher than they otherwise would, as insurance against market rate increases. This ceiling-as-floor phenomenon militates against letting the ceiling approach the more common, typical market rates. In conclusion, the Board has continued the federal credit union loan interest rate ceiling of 18 percent per year for the period from September 9, 1994 through March 8, 1996. Loans and line of credit balances existing on May 15, 1987 may continue to bear their contractual rate, not to exceed 21 percent. Finally, the Board is prepared to reconsider the 18 percent ceiling at any time during the extension period, should changes in economic conditions warrant it. Regulatory Procedures Administrative Procedures Act The Board has determined that notice and public comment on this rule are impractical and not in the public interest, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). Due to the need for a planning period prior to the September 9, 1994 expiration date of the current rule, and the threat to the safety and soundness of individual credit unions with insufficient flexibility to determine loan rates, final action on the loan rate ceiling is necessary. Regulatory Flexibility Act For the same reasons, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required, 5 U.S.C. 604(a). However, the Board has considered the need for this rule, and the alternatives, as set forth above. Paperwork Reduction Act There has been no change in the paperwork requirements. Executive Order 12612 This final rule does not affect state regulation of credit unions. It implements provisions of the Federal Credit Union Act applying only to federal credit unions.
