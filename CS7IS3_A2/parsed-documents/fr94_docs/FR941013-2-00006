FR941013-2-00006 FR941013-2-00005 [C&hyph;408&hyph;046] Determination Not to Revoke Countervailing Duty Order; Sugar From the European Community agency: International Trade Administration, Import Administration, Department of Commerce. action: Notice of determination not to revoke countervailing duty order. summary: The Department of Commerce (the Department) is notifying the public of its determination not to revoke the countervailing duty order on sugar from the European Community (EC). effective date: October 13, 1994. for further information contact: Brian Albright or Mercedes Fitchett, Office of Countervailing Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On July 5, 1994, the Department published in the Federal Register (59 FR 34410) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on sugar from the EC (43 FR 33237; July 31, 1978). Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of interest to interested parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation and no interested party requests an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month. Within the specified time frame, we received objections from domestic interested parties to our intent to revoke this countervailing duty order. Therefore, because the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii) have not been met, we will not revoke the order. This determination is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4). Dated: October 4, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25375 Filed 10&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P&hyph;M
