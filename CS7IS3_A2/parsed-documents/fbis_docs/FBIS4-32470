Never before--or since--had we achieved such a large turnover. The Czech Trade and Industry Ministry says that the value of the realized contracts in arms exports in 1993 amounted to $167 million. Stanislav Fritzl, an employee in its licensing administration, told us that the general analyses conducted by the Stockholm institute are renowned; however, there are inconsistencies between its figures and the figures of the countries that export arms. The same institute stated recently that we exported tanks to Pakistan, although only an informative meeting on the possibility of supplying them had been held. The contract fell through in the end. "If, in their analysis of Czech arms exports, the Swedes applied the same method, incorporating deliveries that were not made or even the tentative contacts made by manufacturers, I am not surprised at the difference between their and our figures," said Fritzl. According to him, the Czech Trade and Industry Ministry will ask the Stockholm institute to reveal how it reached the sum of $0.5 billion. The Czech Republic is an important exporter of small arms (Czech Arms Plants Uhersky Brod) and jet training aircraft (Aero Vodochody), while the Vlasim-based Sellier and Bellot or Tatra Koprivnice, whose once ambitious military production is being phased out, however, are among the companies with good prospects. Stanislav Fritzl told us that the Czech Republic is no longer viewed by the West as an armed-to-the-teeth opponent; nevertheless, it is viewed as a competent rival in the production of quality arms. Fritzl described as speculation the theory put forward by LIDOVE NOVINY that the Stockholm institute's report, which ranks us as the sixth-largest arms exporter, could be aimed at casting doubt on the Czech Republic's credibility. Nevertheless, he did admit that very tough competition, whose methods are not always clean, is taking place among the competing arms plants. The case involving the six impounded Aero Vodochody guns, in which both Aero and the Cechofracht forwarding company made minor mistakes, probably does not fall into this category. However, the Austrians could use these minor mistakes to seek a legal solution to the multimillion [currency not specified] shipment for Thailand. Cechofracht and Aero agreed yesterday to end the mutual accusations over who is responsible for the seizure of the guns. The forwarding company has claimed that the guns were declared only as spare parts for L-59 aircraft. On the other hand, Aero's director has told LIDOVE NOVINY that, without the gun carriage, the guns are just a piece of iron comparable to a spare part.
