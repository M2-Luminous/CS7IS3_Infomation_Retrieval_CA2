January: the three gas turbines installed at Ba Ria, with a total capacity of 100 megawatts of electricity, generate electricity. April: the 500-kv north-south landline goes into stage-1 operation. June: one of the two 75-kw Thac Mo turbines goes on line. Those will be joyous news items this coming spring. With a capacity of 150 megawatts, Thac Mo has greater capacity than Thac Ba (120 megawatts) and almost the capacity of Da Nhim (160 megawatts). But to date, this is the largest hydroelectric project for which all the geographical and geological research and for which the technical designs for almost all the main projects were done by us. The energy line and water gates, pipelines, plant, outside distribution stations, and spill heads of the pressure lines were built by the Interenergo Corporation (Ukrainian Energy Projects Institute). All of the other technical projects, including the main dam, the spillways (including intake and drainage canals and foundation holes), the Duc Hanh dam and secondary dams, the canal connecting the two reservoirs, and the plans to organize construction--pressure line, surfaces, and hydroelectricity--were the responsibility of Research and Design Corporation II. Nguyen Van Thinh, the deputy director of this corporation, said that most of the people who participated in the Thac Mo project were very young. A few people such as Doan Hai Minh and Nguyen Xuan Hoa were present at Song Da and Tri An, but at the time that they were there, there was little work and the technical requirements were not great. Work on the project got underway on 20 November 1991. But the "intellectual products" of the people at Research and Design Corporation II, that is, the economic and technical arguments of Thac Mo, had been approved 8 months prior to that, and by June 1991 all the technical designs had been examined. But it was not until 27 December 1993, when the Be River was safely dammed, that the quality of the design was affirmed. "Brain power is very cheap," joked a number of people. Thac Mo cost more than 1.5 trillion, but the technical design work of the men cost only about 3 billion, which is just 0.2 percent of the total cost. Thac Mo is no longer a dream. The same is true of other large hydroelectric projects such as Ham Thuan-Dami (472 mw). Things have been turned over to them and they have gotten underway. Many people refer to the 500-kv north-south landline as the "rapid landline." Ten years ago, the 220-kv landline from Bien Hao to Tri An, a distance of 23 km, was called the "rapid landline" because it was built in just 7 months. Another well-known landline was the 230-kv landline from Thu Duc to Can Tho: after more than 6 long years (1979-1985) and tens of "operations," 180 km were "basically completed." This was the case even though pillars, insulators, lines, and so on were on hand in the storehouses prior to the start of construction. The 500-kv north-south landline runs for 1,480 km from Hoa Binh to Phu Lam in Ho Chi Minh City. People have done research, drawn up designs, carried on construction, and purchased equipment. There is nothing simple about this ultramodern landline. The line passes through many very difficult sections: the Cam Thuy mountains in Thanh Hoa, 25 km; the Hai Van area from Hue to Danang, 50 km; the the Lo So gorge in Kontum, 120 km; Krong Ana to Daknong in Dak Lak, 100 km, and so on. Who would have thought that in less than 2 years from when construction officially got underway, the basic work--laying the foundation, erecting the pillars, laying the landline--would have been completed. Hoang Dinh Hai, Nguyen Van Tan, Ly Van Tho, Le Van Hien, Tran Vinh Tai, and Tran Phuoc Nhi, the leaders of the units subordinate to Power Construction and Installation Corporation II, the unit responsible for constructing that section of the line from Buon Ma Thuot to Phu Lam (a distance of 320 km), confirmed that it had been necessary to overcome many great "obstacles." Construction had to be carried on in mountainous terrain filled with mines and bombs left from the war, there were battles against malaria, and there were difficulties because of the long distances involved, because the area was uninhabited, and because of the swamps near the cities. Together with many other "landline workers," about 5,000 people along the route and 110,000 other people were mobilized to complete the landline on time and transmit electricity from the north to the south by spring. Bui Van Luu, the director of Power Corporation II, said that to date, the national power network has reached 93 percent of the districts and 55 percent of the villages in the south. In 1993, per capita electricity output in the south reached 150 KWh, which is almost double that (80 KWh) in 1975. But in a number of provinces in the Mekong Delta, output has reached only 40 KWh per person. In An Giang, the province with the highest rice yield in the country, output has reached only 35 KWh per person per year. As of October 1993, An Giang was ranked fourth in the south with respect to the number of galvanometers: 28,152. But in Tri Ton, Tinh Bien, and Phu Tan, some villages had only six galvanometers. The average is one galvanometer per 10,000 people. Here, the people have to purchase electricity at a cost of 750-900 dong per KWh. In many other places besides An Giang, the peasants in the south are not very happy with "Mr. Electricity." Many localities have formed hydroelectric corporations, power service corporations, and so on in order to purchase and sell electricity. Peasants in the south are still waiting for the Spring electrical current to reach every house. Facts About the Thac Mo Hydroelectric Project on the Be River Capacity: two 75-mw turbines for a total of 150 mw. Ensured capacity: 55 mw. Yearly power output: 610 million KWh. Normal rise in water level: 218 meters. Still water level: 198 meters. Total reservoir capacity: 1,360 million cubic meters. Reservoir area: 109 square km. Water current flowing through the 0.5 percent spillway: 3,700 cubic meters per hour. Water current flowing through the 1 percent spillway: 4.122 cubic meters per hour. Water current flowing through the plant: 196 cubic meters per hour. Largest water pillar: 106 meters Smallest water pillar: 83.4 meters. Official start of construction: 20 November 1991. Date the river channel was blocked: 27 December 1993. Date turbine No 1 will go into operation: June 1994. Power development in the southern provinces: 1976: 1,280 million KWh. 1993: 4,600 million KWh. 1995: (predicted) 12,500 million KWh. Per capita average: 1975: 80 KWh per person. 1993: 150 KWh per person. In the Mekong Delta, a number of provinces have an output of only 40 KWh per person.
