However, having experienced the hardship of steep hikes in grain and vegetable prices last year, many people still harbor a lingering fear. They are particularly concerned about grain and vegetable prices, and have called on the government to hold down the prices of the "grain bag" and "vegetable basket" at all costs! Unquestionably, if the prices of goods and clothing increase a little, we can buy less or refuse to buy them. However, food is a necessity which we must purchase daily. When grain and vegetable prices increase excessively, it will of course have a strong impact, and immediately affect the people and aggravate the hardships of low-income families. However, we have taken the task too lightly if we believe we can control commodity prices as well as grain and vegetable prices by applying the sole "commodity price control" measure. For example, grains are primary products and raw materials for the food processing industry. However, for farmers, grains are terminal products as well. Grain prices are affected by demand, moreover, they are factors that finally determine capital investment in agriculture. When capital increases following the hike in prices of chemical fertilizers, farm chemicals, and machinery, controlling only grain prices and not the prices of capital goods is obviously unfair because it will harm peasants' benefits. No wonder that as the busy farming season approaches, farmers are making this urgent call: "Like holding down grain prices last year, the country must adopt strong measures to control price hikes for capital goods." However, chemical fertilizers and farm chemicals are also terminal products of capital goods manufacturing enterprises. When prices of capital goods are low, manufacturing enterprises naturally ask for preferential prices for the supply of oil, water, power, and coal. Subsequently, a chain reaction that also affects other prices will be created. It is evident that prices of grains and other commodities are linked to and affect each other. As a fundamental commodity, the fluctuations of grain prices will affect other prices. However, when other prices fluctuate, grain prices cannot help but fluctuate. For example, exceeding our financial capability by expanding and embarking on too many projects will not help to control grain prices. On the contrary, the action will precisely become the driving force for hiking grain and commodity prices. According to a report by RENMIN RIBAO, the total fixed asset investment in 1993 was 1182.9 billion yuan, a sharp rise of 50 percent over that of the previous year. A piece of stone will create a thousand layers of waves. The first wave created was a steep hike of 38.2 percent in capital goods prices; the second wave spurred a 24-percent increase in industrial goods prices; and the third wave caused a 13-percent increase in consumer goods retail prices. Further, subsequent effects became factors for continued inflation, making the trend of this year's commodity prices not too optimistic. As they are a part of the commodity price chain, how could grain and vegetable prices not be affected? Since price hikes are due to many factors, a multitude of measures should be taken to stabilize commodity prices. The inflation problem should be tackled by looking into both its root cause and symptoms, and a multitude of -- instead of singular -- measures should be adopted. If we do not wish to see outlandish increases in the prices of the "grain bag" and "vegetable basket," we should urgently call for a halt to embarking on an excessive number of projects, excessive spending, neglecting the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, and rampant spread of shocking profiteering in the market. First, the size of capital construction planned for this year should generally be the same as last year. It is necessary to strictly control galloping expansion, and prevent a tight supply-demand situation that will become a motive force causing price hikes. Second, we should not use bank overdrafts to cover financial deficits, but should raise funds by issuing government bonds to prevent money depreciation due to deficits. Third, we should attach great importance to agriculture and the "vegetable basket" project. We should increase investment in the project by adopting appropriate comprehensive measures that will raise grain purchase prices. We should strive to arouse peasants' enthusiasm, stabilize grain and vegetable production, increase supply, and maintain the supply-demand balance. Fourth, we should strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, and monitor the prices of 20 essential commodities that concern the people's livelihood, including the "grain bag," "vegetable basket," and "stove." We should standardize pricing to bring the margin of price hikes within the limits consumers can afford. We should undertake various measures to curb the excessive growth in demand, regulate the supply-demand situation, and hold down commodity prices. To obtain desired results in implementing a multitude of measures for curbing inflation and stabilizing prices, it is necessary for all sides in society to enhance the concept of giving due consideration to the overall situation, conscientiously submit to macroeconomic regulation and control, gradually implement every measure, and expend vigorous efforts to solve each practical problems. We can then realistically curb the rampant growth of various factors that cause inflation, and succeed in ensuring basically stable prices for the "grain bag" and "vegetable basket" without extra efforts.
