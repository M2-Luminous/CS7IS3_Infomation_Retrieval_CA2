According to People's Deputy Mykola Biloblotskyy, a deficit-free budget reminds one of a book with a nice cover, but without the equivalent content. People's Deputy Mykola Naumenko proposed that the 14 trillion karbovantsi, which he predicts will be the deficit of the pension fund in 1994, be transferred to the budget. "It is about financing the superstructure of the state, said people's deputy Ruslan Bodelan. Compared to 1993, expenditure on defense is being increased by 5.82 times, on law enforcement bodies by 6.88 times, on bodies of legislative authority by 17 times, and executive authority by almost 6 times. However, it is planned to increase expenditure on social protection only by 2.28 times." Many deputies spoke about a concealed defecit, which is being transferred to local budgets, and about the reduction of expenditure on the needs of Chernobyl sufferers. Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, acting prime minister of Ukraine, called on deputies "not to fear administrative measures." The Supreme Council adopted a resolution "On the plan for the economic and social development of Ukraine for 1994," which confirms the fundamental indicators of the plan, and establishes the personal responsibility of the Cabinet of Ministers and other executive bodies for their implementation. The Cabinet of Ministers is obliged to report to the Supreme Council every quarter on the implementation of this plan. The people's deputies voted on the law "On the state budget of Ukraine for 1994" four times, but it did not get the required number of votes. Amendments and additions to many legislative acts were made, in particular to the Criminal Code and Code of Criminal Practice of Ukraine, regarding economic crimes, deliberate tax evasion, currency regulation, and currency control, and also to the decree of the Cabinet of Ministers on issues of customs regulation, to the Customs Code of Ukraine, and to the decree of the Cabinet of Ministers "On the procedure for imposing customs duty on objects being taken out of the country." A resolution was adopted, "on a list of goods subject to excise duty," and others. Plenary sittings of the Supreme Council will continue on 1 February.
