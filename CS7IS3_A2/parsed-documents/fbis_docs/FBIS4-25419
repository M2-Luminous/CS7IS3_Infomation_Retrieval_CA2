The five-year bonds carry an interest rate of 7.125 percent, and were sold to underwriters at a price 101.425 percent of the face value, a BOC spokesman said. It was the third time since 1988 for the BOC to issue Deutsche mark-denominated bonds in international financial markets. The BOC spokesman said that the fact that the interest rate of the Deutsche mark hit its record lowest point had been conducive to the bond issue. The Commercial Bank of Germany served as the lead manager for BOC, and the underwriting group consisted of 29 banks and securities companies from Europe, Japan and the U.S.A. The BOC has floated bonds in foreign currencies three times so far this year: once each in the U.S., Japan and Germany, netting capital totalling 830 million U.S. dollars.
