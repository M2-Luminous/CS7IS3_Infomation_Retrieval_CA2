First, regarding the allocation of economic authority between the center and the cantons, accepted are those solutions that are typical for a usual federal setup of modern states -- on the one hand, kept at the central level are those solutions that ensure an unified economic-social system with unified money, freedom of the flow of goods, factors of economic operations, monetary and fiscal policy, and so on, and on the other, in allocating economic authority solutions also typical for federal states in the modern times are accepted, which means that apart from the separate powers of the center and the cantons, also accepted are joint engagements of the two levels of authority. Second, such solutions also create a basis for adequately realizing agreements with political, social, and other non-economic characteristics, which means that a basis is also thereby created for outlining the draft of the constitution of the federation, the work of which should start today. [Agovic] What does this economic concept mean for the third side, which is not included in this agreement -- the Serbian side? Can (?this) be a kind of integrative (?link)? [Begic] I must stress that the solutions that have been envisaged in this agreement are to a great extent identical to solutions that were offered at the initial Geneva negotiations by the legitimate bodies of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Namely, our official proposal within the framework of the peace plan was to try a federal setup of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, these solutions are to a great extent identical to our proposal from July 1993 and these solutions were offered for the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina, which means that such solutions from this agreement are also creating a basis for this so-called third side, for it to be able to join this agreement in a way and do so in a very short period. [Agovic] The Republic of Croatia is also included in this entire arrangement. What is this problem like? [Begic] I must say that the framework of the preliminary agreement, which envisages the founding of a confederation between the Bosnian federation -- that is, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- and Croatia in an economic aspect and seen from present angle of vision, above all, contains a lot of optimistic and, I could even say, unrealistic content. Namely, this preliminary agreement, among other things, envisages the creation of a customs-monetary union, which already addresses elements of a special state entity. The fact that it sounds too optimistic as the prerequisite for joining a confederation between two sovereign states is, above all, an adequate constitutional setup of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, only when the work on the constitution of the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina is near completion will it be possible to assess the scope of the offered preliminary agreement on creating a confederation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. [Agovic] You are leaving for Vienna this evening to take part in the work of the committee for drafting these documents. Would this be a sufficient basis for doing so? [Begic] The basis is good. I hope that the Transitory Committee, in whose work I will take part, will be able to continue along this good path that the Washington papers have offered and I hope that this will be a key to peace for Bosnia-Herzegovina.
