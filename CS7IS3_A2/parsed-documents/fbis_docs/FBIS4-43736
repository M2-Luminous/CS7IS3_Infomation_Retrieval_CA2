Many in the League no longer seem to understand you.... [Bossi] The definition may create some embarrassment. Let me reexplain: We invented the Freedom Alliance, which we conceived as being a liberal-democratic alliance. Well, it won the election, as did free enterprise which became its system. In this system there are two irreconcilable spirits. The conservative one, which already exists and is represented by Forza Italia and the AN [National Alliance], which is pushing toward private monopolies, and the popular and federalist one which embraces small shareholdings and the defense of small business. This is the neo-Laborite spirit. In order to make free enterprise win, we worked out how to enter but also how to get out. Having paid the toll we are now out of [Prime Minister] Berlusconi's orbit. After tactics we will return to strategies.... [Brambilla] This is where the difficult part begins. Is it sufficient to say that you are left-wing to make yourselves recognized? [Bossi] With its values the League has lit a strong beacon toward the world that is disintegrating and that must be reaggregated under free enterprise. Let us not forget that 70 percent of the votes lies in that stormy night sea. Therefore it is not a matter of stating that we are left wing. The League is a popular force that has lit the beacon of federalism and free enterprise. Those who do not think so do not belong to the League but to Berlusconi. [Brambilla] In light of what has been said, what will relations with the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] be like? [Bossi] The alliance that is governing and that will have to govern for at least another two years until a real alternative has been created, is a system with a well-defined dialectic between the two spirits and not a single party pushing us toward Forza Italia as Berlusconi would want. In this way the merger of the forces in the alliance would lead to the creation of a single party given the fact that no other politicians outside the alliance are currently able to object. This would constitute a danger for democracy. Therefore I insist: We will set small business against Fininvest, federalism against centralism and so on.... [Brambilla] [Interior] Minister Maroni does not seem to think along the same lines.... [Bossi] It does not appear to me that Maroni has a single party in mind. This story over differences was invented by the newspapers. I spent most of the other evening with him in Rome. We talked about a great many things.... And the only difference that I noted between him and me was that he had the flu. [Brambilla] This may even be so, but Maroni insists on an organizational agreements between the League-Forza Italia and the AN.... [Bossi] Let us cut the Gordian knot.... Berlusconi invited me to be the secretary of that jumble. I said no. I answered that the League will never be able to do what Berlusconi wants. The League has never dabbled in the previous regime. The League means change. We have a different ideology: We are popular, free traders, and federalists. Our blood is fiery, it is not blue blood. Therefore no single party in Italian politics. [Brambilla] Well then, quarrels with Berlusconi are in sight.... [Bossi] We are not the ones who are quarreling with Berlusconi, it is history that is quarreling with someone who is reasoning with the logic of "I will take everything." [Brambilla] Is the Knight focusing on early elections for this reason? [Bossi] Yes, so much so that the day after the European elections he went to [President] Scalfaro to ask him to dissolve parliament. But elections now, without having completed everything that must be done within the framework of a well-balanced democratic system, is an adventurist and dangerous choice. [Brambilla] Could you provide a picture of the current state of the League.... [Bossi] We are a car that is running again. We have paid the toll and we have entered into the highway of strategy again. Every 100 meters we will try to accelerate at least 20 kilometers an hour. The finish is at the end of the road. The finishing tape reads: free enterprise and federalism. Change is starting up again.... [Brambilla] You are confident then. And what will you say at Pontida [League rally venue]? [Bossi] Everything that I have illustrated up to this point. I will explain the strategy, furthermore I will explain that the League knocked down the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and that it is now beginning to make the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] waiver. And that therefore, for the time being, it is guaranteeing a governable situation provided that there is no stop to change. Then I will open the issue of the independentist faction.... [Brambilla] What does this mean exactly? [Bossi] The federalists and the independentists are the two spirits of the League. The first is flourishing within the country. It is already ahead. The other is still against the country. Coexisting in this way without any prospects there is a risk of reciprocal destruction, of unleashing an immunilogical reaction.... The independentist component must be given a political conscience, I must lead the way.... [Brambilla] But will they both be part of the League.... [Bossi] An internal dialectic will be created. I will be its guarantor. A dialectic that will make federalism become the common good for the whole country. I can say that the independentist faction was not created up to now because many militants stalled in order not to displease me. Now they must all be conscious of their own role. Every difference must emerge.
