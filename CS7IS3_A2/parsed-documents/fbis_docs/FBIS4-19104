According to an interview by the prime minister to NCNA [New China News Agency], this country is one of the priorities of Portuguese foreign policy. The prime minister's second visit to that country has many aims, but economic and trade cooperation is no doubt the great Portuguese interest. Evidence of this is the large party taken by the prime minister, particularly a group of 60 businessmen. Maria Pimentel will comment on Cavaco Silva's interview: [Pimentel] We have found out that relations with China is one of the greatest priorities of Portuguese foreign policy. Evidence of this statement by Cavaco Silva to NCNA is the delegation the Portuguese prime minister is taking with him on his second official visit to that country. There are over 60 businessmen alone, representing the most varied sectors. The aim is to take advantage of the open policy of the Chinese to foreign investment. [passage omitted] Let us remind you that the balance of payments between China and Portugal is clearly unfavorable to Lisbon. Portugal imported over 29.5 billion escudos worth of Chinese products and the total of Portuguese exports was a little over five billion escudos. Cavaco Silva's visit to China -- the most economics-orientated ever -- also aims to mark the seventh anniversary of the joint Luso- Chinese Declaration on Macao, which defined the transition rules of that territory to Chinese administration within five years. Among the issues relating to Macao's future which Cavaco Silva may debate with the Chinese authorities, is the nationality of the Portuguese from Macao, which is being considered by sources linked to the process as the point of greatest friction at present between Portugal and China. [Announcer] Cavaco Silva will depart tomorrow morning for China. He will be in the east for two weeks: seven days in China and then Macao.
