FR940627-0-00027 FR940627-0-00009 The reporting requirements require pipelines to provide information relating to transportation transactions with affiliates. The pipelines must file FERC Form No. 592, a log containing information relating to requests for transportation service by affiliated marketers and to discounts provided to affiliates. The regulations also require the pipelines to maintain the same information for non-affiliated shippers and to provide that information to the Commission upon request. The Commission imposed a sunset provision requiring a reevaluation of the requirements of the rule within one year to determine whether increased competition in transportation had mitigated the concerns about affiliate abuse. The Commission has extended the sunset provision on several occasions, most recently extending it until June 30, 1994. 5 5 Order No. 497&hyph;E, III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles ¶ 30,987. In Order No. 636, the Commission created a new operating environment for interstate pipelines and shippers by requiring pipelines to unbundle their sale of gas from their transportation service and by implementing changes in the terms and conditions for providing transportation service. One of the principal changes introduced by Order No. 636 was the initiation of capacity release mechanisms through which firm shippers can release their firm transportation capacity, including storage capacity, to others wanting to obtain the capacity. The Commission also required that pipelines establish EBBs to provide information about available firm and interruptible capacity on the pipeline, including the firm capacity available through capacity release. 6 6 §§284.8(b)(4); 284.9(b)(4). The Commission also has issued Order No. 563 promulgating standards governing the methods by which pipelines will provide information about available capacity through their EBBs. Standards For Electronic Bulletin Boards Required Under Part 284 of the Commission's Regulations, Order No. 563, 59 FR 516 (Jan. 5, 1994), III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles ¶ 30,988 (Dec. 23, 1993), order on reh'g, Order No. 563&hyph;A, 59 FR 23624 (May 6, 1994), III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles ¶ 30,994 (May 2, 1994). The Commission previously has addressed the effect of EBBs and capacity release on the Order No. 497 requirements. In Order No. 497&hyph;D, the Commission eliminated the requirement that pipelines file the Form No. 592 containing the affiliated transportation log with the Commission, requiring instead that they provide this information on their EBBs. 7 The Commission also determined that Order No. 497 does not apply to temporary capacity releases, because such releases are not a request for transportation to the pipeline. 8 The releasing shipper, not the pipeline, controls and makes the determination to release capacity; the pipeline merely facilitates the transaction. 7 Order No. 497&hyph;D, III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles at 30,737. 8 Northwest Pipeline Corporation, 65 FERC ¶ 61,007 (1993). A temporary capacity release occurs when the releasing shipper retains its rights to the capacity when the release period ends. A permanent release ends the releasing shipper's rights and responsibilities under the contract and the contract is transferred to the replacement shipper. With the implementation of Order No. 636 on virtually all pipelines, the Commission reevaluated its Order No. 497 requirements in light of the requirements of Order No. 636 as well as the Commission's experience under Order No. 497. On December 23, 1993, the Commission issued the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) 9 in this docket in which the Commission proposed significant reductions in the Order No. 497 reporting requirements as well as the elimination of one of the Standards of Conduct. The Commission, however, also invited comment on the need for, and retention of, the requirements as a whole. The Commission has received 22 comments on the NOPR. 10 9 Standards of Conduct and Reporting Requirements for Transportation and Affiliate Transactions, 59 FR 268 (Jan. 4, 1994), IV FERC Stats. & Regs. [Proposed Regulations] ¶ 32,504 (Dec. 23, 1993). 10 Appendix A lists all those filing comments with the abbreviations used for each. IV. Summary of the Final Rule The final rule revises both the Standards of Conduct and the reporting requirements in a number of respects. The Commission is reducing the pipelines' reporting burden by eliminating maintenance and posting requirements relating to requests for transportation service and implementing in their stead limited requirements that better comport with pipeline operations under Order No. 636.
