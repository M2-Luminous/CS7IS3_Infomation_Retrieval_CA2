Experts from the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), will resume negotiations tomorrow in a bid to break the eight-year impasse over the disposal of military land in the territory before 1997. Emerging from the second of four scheduled days of talks, Chinese team leader Luo Jiahuan said the Chinese side remained dissatisfied over the size of the military base for the People's Liberation Army on Stonecutters Island after the changeover. "We insist on a naval base as big as the present HMS Tamar headquarters," Mr Luo said. But he rejected claims that a sizeable naval base in the future Special Administrative Region (SAR) was needed because it would be used as a strategic defence base for southern China after 1997. The Chinese side also raised new proposals on the future disposal of military land during the four hours of talks yesterday. "But the British side failed to give a response on the spot," Mr Luo said. British team leader Alan Paul said he would carefully consider the proposals raised by the Chinese. Mr Paul maintained the two sides would try to reach agreement in the remaining two days of discussion. He also revealed that the two sides had already discussed the construction costs of the future naval base and the disposal of married quarters for the British garrison in Central. The Chinese have stipulated that the married quarters should be kept for PLA officers.
