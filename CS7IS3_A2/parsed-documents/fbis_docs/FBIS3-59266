The reasons for the increase are as follows: First, the push is from the oil processing industry's demand for soybean material. In recent years, due to feed and feed material industries development, the soybean has become popular in the market, stimulating the irregular development of the oil processing industry. The processing demands at the oil factories far exceed the actual supply of soybean materials. Many oil factories have a serious shortage of supply. In the future the improvement in the people's living standards and the adjustment in their diet structure will inevitablly cause the feed and feed materials industry to develop. This trend will require an increased development of the soybean supply and the oil processing industry, causing the already "hungry" oil processing factories to demand more soybean materials. This is unquestionably the main stimulation for the price rise in the soybean market. Second, price differences between the production area and the marketing area. In the selling area the soybean market has always been tight with a large selling amount and high prices. Using Shanghai as an example it can be seen that its annual demand is several hundred thousand tons, and the local selling price is 1.9 yuan per jin which is 0.20-0.30 yuan diferent from the market selling price in the main producing area of Heilongjiang. This area price difference means that the managing unit would gain profits if they could send the soybeans directly from Heilongjiang. Third, the total opening of the grain market has caused the distribution system to operate smoothly with the soybean transported by train. Thus, it will cause a conflict between supply and demand. Customers arriving from outside are finding it increasingly difficult to locate soybean resources. The phenomenon of rising prices comes back. As time goes by, the conflict between supply and demand becomes more serious, causing contracted soybean prices to continuously rise. Therefore, since last fall, the procurement purchasing prices of soybeans has always remained high and even risen to 0.8 yuan per jin. However, some economically sound large sellers still don't want to sell the soybeans. The purchasing prices are continuously increasing, and will have a chain effect on the contract prices in the market. Last year was a period of increase for the soybean market price. At the beginning of the year the soybean contract prices to other provinces were 1.30 yuan per jin. Up to the fall grain harvest the highest price was 1.74 yuan per jin. It is projected that this year's soybean market will no longer have this striking increase, but rather a slow increase. The reason is as follows: 1. The resources of the procurement priced soybeans have increased compared with last year. Last year the production of soybeans increased which enlarged the sources for collecting soybeans by tens of thousands of tons. This will moderate the conflits between supply and demand this year and is the material foundation for reducing the rising price tide. 2. The limitation of the tolerance of consumers in the selling areas. If the soybean market price in 1993 still rises with the speed of 1992, the price in August will increase to over 2 yuan per jin which will exceed the actual consumer toleance in the selling areas, and restrict the market sales. 3. The adjustment from the imported soybeans. Every year the selling areas need the imported soybeans to adjust the market demands. According to the projection for China's import and export of soybeans from "The Situation and Projection of World Oil Materials" made by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in 1992 and 1993 China will import 100,000 tons of soybeans which will play a decisive role in moderating the conflicts between supply and demand in our country's soybean selling areas, and stablize the prices.
