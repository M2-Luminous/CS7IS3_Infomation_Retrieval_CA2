In the 2-odd months since then, this ozone LIDAR has provided a set of data on the vertical distribution of the ozone concentration in the 15-4O-km altitude range. The results obtained by the researchers so far coincide with those obtained by scientists in the U.S., Japan, and other countries. This ozone LIDAR was developed by CAS Anhui Institute of Optics & Fine Mechanics (AIOFM) Research Fellow Hu Huanling [517O 2970 7117], supported by grants from the 863 Program and the NSFC. Researcher Hu used AIOFM's independently developed excimer laser and a double-wavelength operating system with a YAG [yttrium-aluminum garnet] frequency tripled output to conduct differential absorption LIDAR (DIAL) measurements of the ozone.
