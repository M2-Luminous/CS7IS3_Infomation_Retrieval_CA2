Full Text follows: Since the CPC Central Committee and the State Council announced an arrangement for anticorruption struggle in the near future, various localities and departments have, by taking their own reality into consideration, speedily adopted measures to implement the arrangement. The momentum for the anticorruption drive as a whole has been excellent and the development of the anticorruption struggle has been healthy. Some results have been achieved in the anticorruption struggle; varying degrees of progress have been made in the three areas of anticorruption work as set forth by the CPC Central Committee; and negative and corrupt phenomena have been checked. But one must see to the fact that a lack of balance has so far characterized localities' and departments' progress in the anticorruption work; some leading cadres have not been serious enough to tackle issues of clean administration and to impose self-discipline on themselves; some problems that have been exposed during in-house checks have not been rectified; more force should be applied in the work of investigating major and important cases; the results of the drive to rectify unhealthy tendencies are not solid enough; and some forms of unhealthy tendencies have not been stopped. As the current task of anticorruption struggle remains arduous, we should never slacken our vigilance. To further step up and do an even better job in the three areas of anticorruption work as demanded by the CPC Central Committee and to achieve marked results in various stages, all levels of party and government leading bodies, discipline inspection, and supervision organs should review and check the earlier stage of anticorruption work so as to discover remaining shortcomings and weaknesses in the work, and to see if the results so far achieved have met with the demands of the CPC Central Committee and of the masses. They should, on that basis, proceed with defining responsibility and adopting measures to specifically implement the three areas of anticorruption work. As the period between the present and next year's Spring Festival is critical in achieving marked results in the anticorruption struggle, localities and departments must step up their work. It is necessary for leading cadres to further consolidate and expand the results that they have achieved in conducting clean administration and in imposing self-discipline on themselves. Meetings to discuss democratic life of leading bodies at and above county and bureau levels should be appropriately reported and leading bodies should accept the masses' evaluation and supervision. Problems discovered through in-house checks should be properly handled according to relevant stipulations. If departments and units are found to have not properly done their in-house check and self-rectification, or if the masses are not satisfied with the results of their in-house check and self-rectification, they must seriously make up for it. Verification and investigation into the wrong-doing of a very small number of cadres, who incur the wrath of the masses and who refuse to conduct self-examination and self- rectification, should be conducted and handled strictly if their wrong-doings are verified. More efforts should be concentrated on investigating major and important cases. It is necessary to speedily bring to a close self-evident and irrefutable cases, particularly those involving leading cadres. Cases which could have a major social impact should be selectively made known to the public. It is necessary to resolutely deal with those who obstruct investigation of cases. We should resolutely stop unhealthy tendencies. Continued efforts should be made to deal with problems related to illegal collection of fees, and with cases involving those who make overseas sightseeing tours at public expense. It is important to make timely announcements on cancellation of illegal fees collection. Personnel should be organized to check and ensure that illegal fees that had been canceled are not reintroduced. Leading organs responsible for management of professions and trades should do a good job in rectifying unhealthy tendencies in various professions and trades. The current stage of anticorruption struggle happens to fall during the two holidays of New Year and the Spring Festival. The General Office of the CPC Central Committee issued "A Circular on the Strict Banning of Feasting, Gift-Giving at Public Expense and Waste and Extravagances During the Period of 1994 New Year and Spring Festival" and reiterated five stipulations, which will greatly help promote the implementation of the CPC Central Committee's three areas of anticorruption work in the near future. All levels of party committees, and government, discipline inspection, and supervision organs should implement the circular by taking into consideration the reality of various localities and various departments. The results of the present stage of party- style and clean-administration building and of the anticorruption struggle will put our ability to spend a clean, joyous, and happy New Year and Spring Festival to a real test. It is necessary for discipline inspection and supervision organs to do a good job of publicizing the "circular," enhancing supervision, and checking on enforcement. Discipline must be strictly enforced on those who violate discipline, and there should be no appeasement and leniency for them. The deeds of those who seriously violate discipline and have a very bad influence should be publicized. It is necessary to closely integrate the implementation of the "circular's" five stipulations with the implementation of the CPC Central Committee's three areas of anticorruption work in the near future. We must produce marked results in this stage of the anticorruption struggle. In addition to doing a good job of the above work, all levels of party committees and government discipline inspection and supervision organs should, following the Spring Festival, organize personnel to conduct investigation, study, and work out plans for the next stage of the anticorruption work. Following the Spring Festival, the Discipline Inspection Commission under the CPC Central Committee and the Ministry of Supervision plan to work out arrangements for the next stage of the anticorruption struggle.
