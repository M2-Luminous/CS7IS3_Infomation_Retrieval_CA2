These inscriptions demonstrate the great emphasis leading comrades of the party Central Committee and the State Council place on secrecy work during the new era of reform and opening up, chart the tasks and direction of this work for our near future, reflect the earnest hopes those comrades place in cadres involved in secrecy work and in public security personnel, and will provide tremendous impetus to this work during the new era. Secrecy Work Has Always Formed an Important Component of Public Security Work Secrecy work has always been important to the entire party. As early as the revolutionary war, Mao Zaodong, Zhou Enlai, and other leaders of that era repeatedly emphasized the importance of strictly safeguarding secrets. Comrade Mao in 1941 dedicated the inscription "One Can Never Be Too Careful in Protecting Party Secrets" for the Confidential Affairs Office of the Military Commission and reiterated at a meeting of the Politburo just after Liberation: "We must be extremely attentive to secrecy work; 95 or even 99 percent will not do; we must be 100 percent." On 14 July 1950 Comrade Deng Xiaoping stated in a preface to the inaugural issue of JIYAO GONGZUO [CONFIDENTIAL WORK]--an armed forces publication: "The situation today is even more complicated than before, and protecting our party's secrets is even more important now than at any time in the past." The victory of the revolution is liable to make us careless and lower our guard, giving the enemy opportunity to exploit us. This warrants vigilance by all responsible comrades and cadres engaged in sensitive work. Public security organs are vital components of party and state, so secrecy is especially important for them. From the outset, we established a strict system and discipline for and viewed secrecy as the key to and lifeblood of national security work and vital to the fate of the party and the revolutionary regime. Following the founding of the PRC, party and state leaders continued to attach great importance to secrecy and continually instructed us to stress this in public security work. With everyone's political vigilance so high, we developed the habit of consciously protecting secrets and good practice in this work. In 1958 we incorporated this issue into the Eight Great Disciplines for and Ten Points Requiring Attention by public security personnel. Public security organs' fine tradition of keeping secrets played an important role in ensuring smooth implementation of public security work and in winning victory for the revolution. The New Situation Created by Reform, Opening Up Presents New Needs Regarding Secrecy in Public Security Work After the 3d Plenum of the 11th Central Committee, a strategic shift occurred in the focus of the entire party's work, and seizing the moment to accelerate China's socialist modernization became the party's overriding task. The new situation created by reform, opening up, and the establishment of a socialist market economy created new and even greater requirements regarding secrecy in public security work. First, there has been readjustment in the guiding ideology thereof. In the decades preceding the plenum, "class struggle" was the guiding principle for all our effort, and secrecy work inclined toward mysticism and conservatism, which developments were concretely manifested in the tendencies to broaden the scope of secrecy, raising its degree, making it perpetual, and so on. This shackled people's thinking, exchange and dissemination of advanced science and technology, and improvement in productivity. Today secrecy work must pursue economic development and make the "three facilitations" its criteria. Second, there has been major change in the environment surrounding secrecy work. China's external contacts have expanded greatly since reform and opening up began. The figure for exits and entries alone shows how widely our door has opened, as the figure rose nearly ten-fold between 1979 and 1992. Domestically, while pursuing development rooted in public ownership, we allowed all sorts of wholly foreign-owned enterprises, joint ventures, and foreign capitalized firms to burgeon, change has occurred in the operational mechanisms of state enterprises, and economic entities of all stripes have mushroomed. After peasants undertook responsibility contracting, surplus labor flooded cities and formed the bulk of the floating population, which, according to statistics, has reached 50 million nationally. Literary and artistic output is booming as "a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend": Registered publications alone number over 1,000 nationally. Thus the environment secrecy work confronts is much more complicated than it was before reform and opening up began, and this makes the work more difficult. Third, change has occurred in the administrative mechanism for secrecy work. Public security organs used to be responsible for handling most routine secrecy work throughout the country. Once the State Secrecy Bureau was established, that agency assumed charge of the work and has discharged the functions accorded it by law, subject to unified guidance provided by the Central Secrecy Commission. In the areas of preventing, investigating, and handling leaks and in combatting theft of state secrets, various administrative, legal, and other related agencies perform their respective duties in cooperation with the bureau and each other. Thus a new administrative mechanism for secrecy work has begun to emerge. Fourth, there has been change in the focus of this work. With the conclusion of the cold war, the prolonged stress on stealing military secrets began to change; more and more countries now recognize that science and technology form the most important productive force; and intelligence agencies in various countries, especially Western industrialized ones, have begun to emphasize collection and theft of economic, scientific, technological, and trade intelligence. To respond to the international situation and struggle, departments engaged in secrecy work must make appropriate readjustments in their thinking, work assignments, organizational structures, and staffing, and place greater emphasis on economics, science, and technology. Fifth, there has been marked change in the way in which secrecy work is conducted. On 5 September 1988 China promulgated her first relatively complete law on secrecy, the PRC Law Governing Safeguarding of State Secrets, development of which signified that her secrecy work had reached a new stage in which that effort is conducted according to law. The Enforcement Regulations for that law were issued a year later, and another 10-odd supplementary measures have since followed, thereby progressively completing legislation on secrecy and enabling all such work to be conducted in accordance with law. Public Security Organs Must Continue To Serve as Exemplars of Strict Safeguarding of State Secrets Our ability to carry on and enhance the party's fine tradition and to strengthen secrecy work during this new era will affect overall performance in reform, opening up, and the four modernizations. Public security organs, the mainstay of the people's democratic dictatorship, and the people's police, staunch defenders of the party and state, play roles in the protection of state secrets that no other agencies or individuals can match. Thus, conscientious emulation of the dedications presented by Jiang Zemin and Li Peng and further strengthening of secrecy work are important tasks for public security organs and personnel at all levels and will enable this effort better to serve maintenance of social order and economic development. We must conscientiously summarize and carry forward public security organs' fine tradition of strictly protecting state secrets; perfect the legal system for this work; stop all leaks; maintain appropriate vigilance in external relations; make combatting theft of secrets an important component of crime fighting; closely cooperate with state agencies administering secrecy work, national security organs, and other related departments; and conscientiously protect state secrets. We must constantly study and strictly enforce all laws and regulations concerning secrecy. It is especially important that we go down and initiate study and enforcement of the Secrecy Law and its Enforcement Regulations among public security personnel so that they learn the basic provisions of these important pieces of legislation and act in strict accordance with law; that we overcome arbitrariness and old habit in secrecy work; and that we strive to ensure that in this work we have laws to follow, abide by those laws, enforce them strictly, and punish violations thereof so that this work is conducted in legalized fashion and public security organs continue to serve as exemplary protectors of state secrets.
