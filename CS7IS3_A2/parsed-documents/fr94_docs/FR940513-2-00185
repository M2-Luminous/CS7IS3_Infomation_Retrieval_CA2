FR940513-2-00185 FR940513-2-00088 Coast Guard [CGD 94&hyph;046] Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) Subcommittee on Marine Vapor Control Systems AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Notice of meeting. SUMMARY: The Subcommittee on Marine Vapor Control Systems of the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee will meet to continue reviewing tank vessel cleaning facility operations and evaluate the technical and safety aspects of potential control technologies which will allow these facilities to meet air quality emissions standards. The meeting will be open to the public. DATES: The meeting will be held on June 15, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Written material should be submitted no later than June 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: The meeting will be held in Room 4315, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street, SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001. Written material should be submitted to LCDR Robert F. Corbin, Commandant (G&hyph;MTH&hyph;1), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street, SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LCDR Robert F. Corbin, Commandant (G&hyph;MTH&hyph;1), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street, SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001, telephone (202) 267&hyph;1217. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice of this meeting is given pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. App. 2 sec. 1 et seq. One section of the 1990 Amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) requires States to achieve and maintain a 15% reduction in their Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions level below the 1990 base year level by 1996 in non-attainment areas within the individual States. States are presently developing methods to achieve required compliance levels. One State recently passed state regulations that will require vessels that have carried certain VOC cargoes and are being gas-freed and/or cleaned to utilize a marine vapor control system or an alternate means of control approved by the State at the tank vessel cleaning facility. It is anticipated other States will develop similar regulations as a means of complying with the CAA Amendments for their States. The purpose of this meeting is to continue reviewing tank vessel cleaning facility gas-freeing and tank cleaning operations in order to evaluate potential control technologies that will allow these facilities to meet air quality emissions standards while ensuring a high level of safety for facility and vessel personnel is maintained. As a result of this review, the Subcommittee will develop recommendations for revising existing safety guidelines for tank vessel cleaning facilities. Dated: May 3, 1994. A.E. Henn, Rear Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard, Chief, Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11708 Filed 5&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 491014&hyph;M
