FR940711-2-00045 FR940711-2-00025 All of the Water Users' comments are concerned with their claim to a contractual obligation that surplus revenue from the sale of power be applied toward the repayment obligation of the Water Users for the PRP. Western has stated that it will consider $1.623 million by 2008 as a repayment assistance to the PRP. The Water Users assert that there is an obligation to develop surplus revenue from power sales that can be applied to the repayment obligation of the Water Users beyond 2008 until all repayment obligations have been met. Western knows of no legal basis for the Water Users' position. Resolution of these issues are outside the scope of this proposed action. These issues have been the focus of several meetings between the Water Users, Western, and Reclamation. Western's proposal would provide a means to ensure that the balance of the $1.623 million commitment is paid in annual increments by 2008. Other Issues UMPA states that use of PRP energy in Utah County, Utah, will result in reduced reliance on fossil fuels and will enhance the environment, especially air quality. This issue will be addressed in the environmental assessment which will be done on the proposed action. However, because of the quantities of energy involved in the proposal, it is unlikely that the action will have a significant impact on air quality in Utah County. The Stonefly Society (Society), a local environmental organization, commented that operation of the PRP on the Provo, Duchesne, and Weber Rivers has produced devastating impacts on these river systems. Among these are: (1) Destruction of the Provo's natural channel and riparian areas, (2) anoxic water discharge from Deer Creek Reservoir, (3) dewatering of the Weber River, and (4) dewatering of the Duchesne River. They state that three actions should be taken: (1) studies of the environmental impacts of the PRP should be conducted immediately; (2) funds should be allocated from Deer Creek Power revenues to correct these serious problems; and (3) no funds should be allocated to the PRP until these environmental impacts have been both assessed and corrected. Western's proposal is to only change the way power from the PRP is marketed. It will have no effect on how the PRP is operated. The Society's issues are concerned with the way the project is operated and not on how power is marketed. Therefore, their comments are outside the scope of this proposal. The Society asked ``if the PRP were included in the Integrated Projects, will the powerplant at Deer Creek Reservoir be operated independently or will the operation be integrated with other Western generating facilities? If its operation is integrated, will there be environmental impacts at these other facilities?'' Western's proposal is to market the PRP independently of the Integrated Projects. There would be no operation connection between the projects. Furthermore, since Deer Creek Powerplant is not controlled by Western, delivery of power and energy to the customer would be, as always, on a run-of-the-river basis. Marketing Criteria a. Applicability Congress granted to the Secretary of Energy acting by and through Western's Administrator the authority to market Federal power. In response to requests from UMPA and ICPA to receive power produced by the PRP, Western has examined the merits of reorganizing the marketing of the PRP resource. Western believes these proposed marketing changes will benefit both the potential contractors and the Water Users.
