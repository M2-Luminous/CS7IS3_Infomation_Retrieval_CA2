The first deals with the many safety improvements already proposed for the next generation of reactors. In all leading nuclear power countries, evolutionary plants are being developed for large scale implementation around the turn of the century. They contain numerous safety improvements based on the vast accumulated operational experience and include new design features as well as design simplifications. Already high safety levels continue to increase. The increase in safety by any measure is impressive. Estimates of severe core damage likelihood for the evolutionary designs are below 1 in 10,000 per reactor per year and are now comparable to natural disaster frequencies. The future will call for a continued process of evolutionary safety development along with designs with greater inherent safety and more passive systems requiring less mechanical and human actions. The many improvements already made are closely involved with human performance. While operational incidents are often due to design errors and mechanical failures, the real root causes can lie in organizational and individual deficiencies due to failings in what is termed Safety Culture. Safety culture is a new concept which has only evolved over the past several years. It is the aggregate qualities, both in organizations and in individuals, which make safety an overriding priority. It has two major components. One is concerned with the individuals' attitudes and responses, and the other is the organizational framework in which they work. Attitudes can be influenced by education and training and perhaps more so by psychological and environmental factors. Organizational styles can also be influenced so as to promote policies which encourage attitudes favorable to safety. Safety culture is necessary not only at the operational level, that is at the utility and the plant, but also at the governmental level, in the regulatory body and as well in design, construction and research organizations. An introduction to this important subject, is the second theme of this talk. The global nature of nuclear safety leads to the concluding theme. This is a discussion of the preparatory efforts underway for an International Nuclear Safety Convention, an agreement which could be the cornerstone of improving nuclear safety worldwide. Although contentious points remain, the preparatory work has advanced to the point where an agreed text should soon be ready with adoption by a Diplomatic Conference likely next year. In general the difficulty in formulating an agreed text has arisen from the difference in approach between those countries desiring a very detailed and strict convention and those wishing a less demanding one. The former wishes to see binding internationally agreed upon safety codes, mandatory safety reviews, detailed reporting, and emergency plans involving neighboring countries. The latter desires a convention based on more general safety fundamentals and on safety culture principles. It has been agreed that the convention will be limited to civil nuclear power plants, but there will likely be a commitment to begin negotiations on an international instrument on the safety of waste management. Safety Issues in Russia's Nuclear Power [A. Abagyan, Director General, VNIIAES, Russian Federation] The safety of Russia's operating NPPs is on the one hand determined by today's status of its nuclear power industry and on the other hand -- by the modern international safety requirements. The nuclear power is characterized by the existence of different types of nuclear units (mainly VVER and RBMK type) of different generations. Presently nine NPPs are in operation in Russia which incorporate 29 units with the total capacity of 21,242 MW. The operating units can be conditionally broken down into two generations: -- First generation units (``older'' units). These were designed prior to the development and enforcement of the basic Safety Codes and Guides in the former USSR. -- Second generation units. These were developed in accordance with the Safety Codes developed with account for operational experience with the units of the first generation. In total there are 13 units of the first generation. These include four VVER-440/230 units and four RBMK-1000 units constructed before 1978. These ``older'' units from the viewpoint of modern international safety requirements are the most seriously criticized ones. The paper addresses the safety issues of these units and conditions of their operation up to expiration of the design lifetime -- up to 2000-2005. Improvement of the safety level of the units of second generation is to a great extent associated with improvement of their instrumentation of diagnostic and information system. Further expansion of nuclear program in Russia is related with the use of VVER-1000 reactors of the third generation and also of the new generation of light water reactors based on the modern international criteria of inherent fault immunity and use of passive safety systems. IAEA's Nuclear Power Plant Safety Programs in Eastern Europe and Countries of the Former Soviet Union [L. Lederman, IAEA, Division of Nuclear Safety] The safety on nuclear power plants in operation in Eastern Europe and in countries of the former Soviet Union is a matter of great international concern. However, the current energy supply and demand in these countries allows little scope for immediately closing down less safe plants. A realistic approach must deal with urgent short term improvements to reduce safety risks pending a feasible long term solution. This long term solution could combine alternative energy supply, improvements towards a more efficient use of energy and safety upgradings and reconstruction of the nuclear power plants. There are currently 57 NPP of the WWER and RBMK types in operation and 16 under construction in these countries. Efforts have been underway to deal with the problem. The IAEA has initiated in 1990 new and major activities to supplement its ongoing safety services. Significant bilateral and multilateral assistance activities have been initiated by the USA, Japan and other OECD countries. There are projects funded by the Commission of the European Communities. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London, the European Investment Bank in Luxembourg, and the World Bank are also considering financing safety improvements. Implementing a mechanism for effective co-ordination of current international efforts has not been an easy task. One should however recognize that the difficulties encountered so far in producing effective co-ordination are not very different from those associated with past assistance efforts of such magnitude and complexity. Since the beginning of 1992 a mechanism for co-ordination, established through a G-24 Working Group which meets in Brussels, has been in place. It has been chaired by the CEC with IAEA participation in a technical advisory capacity. In December 1991 the Agency completed the first phase of the extrabudgetary programme on the safety of WWER-440/230 plants and issued a technical document (IAEA-TECDOC-640) containing -- inter alia -- the results of safety review missions to all WWER-440/230 plants. The document evaluates the significance of the identified safety issues and provides a basis for the short and long-term activities required in order to improve plant safety. Early in 1992 the IAEA published ``An overview and major findings of the extrabudgetary programme on the safety of WWER-440 model 230 nuclear power plants'' (STI/PUB/912). The second phase of the programme, currently in progress, focuses on assisting Member States to plan and evaluate modifications (as regards both hardware and the conduct of operations) and to verify that proposed modifications respond to concerns identified during the programme's first phase. There is an international consensus that, together with WWER-440/230 plants, RBMK plants are the ones requiring most urgent attention and safety improvements. The Agency has started in 1992 an ``International Programme on Safety Assessment of RBMK Reactors.'' The objective of the programme is to review the scope and results of safety evaluations performed, the technical basis for the safety improvements implemented or planned and to establish international consensus on priority actions. The results of this programme will contribute to establishing a basis for decisions on technical and financial support for implementation of measures to improve safety. In December 1992, an Advisory Group with participants from 21 countries and five international organizations reviewed the progress of the Agency's nuclear safety programmes for Eastern Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union and advised on future activities and necessary co-ordination. In general it was agreed that the Agency's programmes had been very useful and that the planned future activities responded to the needs of countries constructing and/or operating WWER and RBMK plants. The IAEA programme was then extended to include other types of WWERs namely 440 model 213 and 1000 NPPs. The full paper reports on the major results reached in the frame of the IAEA programmes and future activities. Issues Related to the Safety of Nuclear Power Reactors in the Former Eastern-Bloc Countries -- A Western Viewpoint [S. Chakraborty, Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate, CH-5232 Villigen-HSK, Switzerland] Abstract Reviews performed by several international organizations, including those of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, and several other countries have identified many concerns related to design, siting (i.e., plant sites near major tectonic faults), operation, maintenance, management, safety culture, and regulatory mechanisms in the nuclear power industries of the former Eastern bloc countries. This situation is now compounded with the economic and political problems that have ensued since the break-up of the former Eastern bloc. The objective of this paper is to discuss the safety concerns with the Eastern nuclear power plants and ways to address the current debacle, based on the experience with the Western nuclear power development programs and current safety and regulatory standards and practices. Finally, the approach to improving the safety of nuclear power reactors in the former Eastern-bloc countries is proposed based on the lessons learned from the Western nuclear power development, construction and operation over the past 40 years. A multi-pronged safety resolution approach consisting of the following is needed: 1. A rehabilitation of safety culture within the Eastern nuclear operations and regulatory process; 2. Development of a comprehensive nuclear regulatory process and safety acceptability criteria; 3. Assessment of plant vulnerabilities and most cost-effective ways of plant modifications; 4. Development of programs for operational training, testing procedures, and maintenance; and 5. Development of revised design standards and licensing procedures for modernization of the Eastern nuclear power industries. The safety improvements that are a prerequisite for the faith in nuclear power encompass not only reduction of risk from severe accidents but also reduction of economic risk (which could threaten the national economy of less developed countries) and improvements in operational reliability. Japanese Assistance and Cooperation to the Former Soviet Union and Central and East European Countries To Improve Nuclear Safety [Toshio Okazaki, Deputy Director General, Atomic Energy Bureau, Science and Technology Agency] Background At the July, 1992, summit meeting in Munich, nuclear safety in the former Soviet Union and other Central and East European countries was recognized to give cause for great concern requiring urgent solutions, and the summit participants agreed on a set of multilateral assistance measures, which were included in the summit's economic declaration. Accordingly, the Japanese government had already been implementing bilateral assistance (coordinated with that of the Western nations) and it now also takes part in multilateral efforts, for example, through contributions to the Nuclear Safety Account, which was established to supplement bilateral measures by bilateral programs. At the Tokyo Summit in July of this year, the same issue was addressed again, and the importance of immediate action to ensure safety was reiterated. Nature of Japanese Assistance Starting with measures requiring immediate implementation, efforts to improve the safety of Soviet-designed NPP's are focused on operational safety improvements, near-term technical improvements to plants based on safety assessments, and enhancing regulatory regimes. The following types of assistance are being rendered: (1) Multilateral Programs The IAEA dispatches experts and conducts study meetings to assess the safety of Soviet-designed nuclear NPP's. The Japanese government participates in those safety-assessment meetings, and cooperates with the IAEA, including with extra-budgetary contributions to the program. For near-term improvements in the technical aspects of nuclear safety, the government makes financial contributions to the Nuclear Safety Account. Contributions will also be made to the OECD-NEA, specifically for their efforts to increase safety from a long-term point of view. (2) Bilateral Programs The Japanese government conducts safety-related international training programs for experts including nuclear safety regulators, operators and engineers of the nuclear power plants in the former Soviet Union and Central and East European States. In addition to this, the government has launched other cooperative efforts, including installation of Leak Detection System with High Temperature Resistant Microphones in Nuclear Power Plant to detect leakage from the reactor pipelines; training for those responsible for operational management, using simulators installed at the Nuclear Power Plant Safety Operation Training Center in Russia; and others. Japan is also planning to send specialists to exchange information on nuclear power safety with their counterparts in the various countries.
