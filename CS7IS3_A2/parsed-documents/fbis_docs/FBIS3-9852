Summing up the impressions and conclusions of the several days long visit of the Russian parliamentary delegation, Vengerovskiy told a press conference that the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are not necessary. If Europe does not understand this, we can do the same thing, already tomorrow Europe might be left without Russian gas, Vengerovskiy threatened. Vengerovskiy told reporters that he had not had the chance to find out the official stand of Belgrade on the conclusions reached by the Russian delegation during their visit to Yugoslavia. Official stands, he added, are interpreted through official statements by state organs. When we return to Moscow, we shall make a list of proposals, on the basis of what our impressions, for further actions which will be assessed not only here but also in New York, Vengerovski said in the familiar style of the controversial leaders of this Russian party, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. The Russian delegation arrived in Yugoslavia last week at the invitation of the extra-parliamentrary rightist party, the Serbian National Renewal Party. Member of the Committee for Security and Defence, independent deputy Yevgeniy Fedorov said that serious changes had taken place in the Russian Army now, which voted for the Liberal-Democratic Party practically 100 percent at the last elections. In spirit the army is ready for changes in the country's foreign policy, he said, and for military cooperation with Yugoslavia. Deputy President of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia Valentin Minakhov assessed that the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in former Yugoslavia were there only for appearances' sake and were protecting the interests of only one side. Minakhov announced that they would raise the question of the deployment of Russian troops in Prevlaka, a controversial peninsula on the border between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia where UNPROFOR are deployed, because the U.N. peace-keepers did not permit the Russian parliamentarians to visit Prevlaka. Minakhov also announced that Zhirinovskiy would visit Belgrade again in mid-May this year. Serbian National Renewal Leader Mirko Jovic, who is host to the Russian delegation, said that the main objective of the visit and cooperation with Russian parties was to renew old friendships and the military alliance with Russia.
