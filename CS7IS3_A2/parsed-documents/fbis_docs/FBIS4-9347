The UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] command asked permission for the passage of an Ukrainian aircraft carrying Finnish blue helmets in connection with the rotation of UNPROFOR units along the air route Skopje-Helsinki-Skopje. According to unofficial information published in the private daily STANDART NEWS, the question was not about Finnish peacekeepers, but about the replacement of the Swedish contingent recently transferred from Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] to Gorazde. The private paper KONTINENT reports that the request for using Bulgaria's airspace was received at the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry's Consular Department on April 15, the day when the National Assembly allowed a single passage of a UN convoy to from Romania to Macedonia. The letter from Zagreb is said to have requested a permanent permission for using the route, KONTINENT says. According to TRUD, the daily of one of the major trade union amalgamations in Bulgaria, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov was told about the letter as late as on Tuesday [19 April]; it took the Foreign and the Defence Ministries three days to formulate their positions. The prime minister is said to have authorized the Minister of Justice Petur Kornazhev to notify the Presidium of the National Assembly (comprising the Chairman, the three deputy chairmen, the chairman of the parliamentary Legislative Committee and the floor leaders of the parliamentary groups) about the overflight request. DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), accuses Prime Minister Prof. Berov of being five days late in notifying parliament about the letter. DUMA, the daily of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), cites the declaration which the BSP leadership and its parliamentary group circulated yesterday [20 April] on the same issue. The declaration insists that the Consultative Council for National Security be urgently convened and reproaches President Zhelev for being "inactive when vital issues of the national security are concerned". The private daily OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK quotes SDS MP's whose names are not specified as saying that "Bulgaria is a member of the UN, therefore it have got to meet certain specific commitments; refusing to do so would be taken to mean that this country supports the aggressor". "The ever more persistent attempts to use the territory of Bulgaria and its airspace reveal a simple tendency towards this country's close involvement with the actions of the world organization in the explosive regions of its western neighbours", the KONTINENT editor-in-chief writes. He wonders if it has ever come to the mind of any statesman or politician to ask what happened with Bulgaria's request for a transport corridor across Serbia to ship its tomatoes and fruit, which is quite different from the request for transporting armoured personnel carriers. "The settlement of this problem also depends on the United Nations. All we have heard from them so far is mumble and requests," he notes. [passage omitted]
