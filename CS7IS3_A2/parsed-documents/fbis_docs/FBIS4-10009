FBIS4-10009 "drlat066_s_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-066 Daily Report 2 Apr 1994 Uruguay Cuba's Robaina Arrives on Official Visit Cuba's Robaina Arrives on Official Visit Leftist Broad Front Views Visit PY0404224694 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1957 GMT 2 Apr 94 PY0404224694 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Article by Jorge Figueroa] [Text] Montevideo, 2 Apr (EFE) -- The visit by Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to Montevideo on 4 April has divided the Broad Front leftist coalition--the country's third-largest political force--and is threatening to cause an internal crisis just eight months before the general elections. Diplomatic spokespersons have said that Robaina begins his tour in Montevideo that will include Argentina, Paraguay, and Peru "seeking to re-insert Cuba into the Latin American framework." Francisco Rodriguez Camusso is a veteran Uruguayan legislator with several decades in Congress who in 1989 was elected deputy to represent a group that includes, among others, the communists. He said he will not participate in the session of the International Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies which will receive Robaina on 4 April. The committee comprises seven members; Rodriguez Camusso is the only representative of the Broad Front Coalition. He said: "I represent the Broad Front bloc on this committee, which fully supports the Leninist regime of Fidel Castro." "I totally disagree with this and I would like to strongly discuss with Mr. Robaina the violations currently occurring in Cuba. This would mean contradicting the majority of my sector and for the sake of party discipline I will not participate in that session," the congressman added. During the past few months he has been criticized by the most radical sectors of the Broad Front, which includes socialists, communists, Trotskyists, Leninists, independents, and former Tupamaro guerrillas, among others. The decision not to participate in the session to honor the Cuban foreign minister and the congressman's harsh criticism of Castro's regime may provoke an internal crisis within the leftist coalition. For the first time ever, the Broad Front in 1989 won the municipality of Montevideo where half the Uruguayan population live. Mayor Tabare Vazquez, a socialist and doctor, will be a presidential candidate in the 27 November elections. The latest polls show the Broad Front currently in second place after the Colorado Party, which has traditionally governed and which is now the main opposition party ahead of the Blanco Party. Robaina, 38, is the youngest foreign minister in Cuba's history. He will meet in Montevideo with Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle and with Tabare Vazquez. He will not meet with former Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti--the leader of the Colorado Party who, according to the polls, is most likely to win the elections--because he is currently abroad. During Sanguinetti's presidency (1985-1990), Uruguay renewed diplomatic relations with Cuba in October 1985, after a 20-year rupture.
