Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, who left Manila yesterday after concluding a six day visit, disagreed with the Philippines' views that the EAEC will be a "meaningful bridge" between ASEAN and the developed countries. Evans stressed the EAEC, a sub-regional grouping within Asia, was "potentially divisive." "I think it's very dangerous to the region to develop into splits or fissures down the Pacific, as between the North American and East Asian economies. We've seen the dangers that may be involved in that," Evans explained. Evans cited the recent trade disagreements between the United States and Japan and the United States and China. He said these potential splits within the Asia-Pacific may be transformed into wide divisions in the world trade areas if the EAEC pushes through. He said that it would be more conducive and productive to develop the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum which brings together trade powers from both sides of the Pacific including the United States, China and Japan. Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo disagreed with Evans' position, stressing that the EAEC, a concept spearheaded by Malaysia, was a "value-added" item to APEC-member countries. Romulo said Evans needs to be educated on the EAEC concept so that he would understand the positive effects of the forum within APEC. The EAEC was conceived as a loose forum for APEC-member countries in Asia to discuss achievements gained and informal agreements arrived at during the APEC meeting last November in Seattle. The EAEC has the support in the ASEAN which groups the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. It has invited Japan to the forum but shut its doors to the United States and other North American countries . "I guess we need to enlighten (Evans) further," adding he was informing other EAEC members of Australia's position on the issue. Evans, however, supported the Philippines' stand in opposing the use of non-trade issues such as human rights and labor conditions on developing countries as prerequisites to trade relations with rich nations. He stressed that while Australia puts priority in its human rights campaign, it shuns the use of this issue as a protectionist tool by developed countries such as the United States. The United States recently granted its most favored nation status on trade to China, although earlier it had contemplated tying up the issue with China's human rights record .
