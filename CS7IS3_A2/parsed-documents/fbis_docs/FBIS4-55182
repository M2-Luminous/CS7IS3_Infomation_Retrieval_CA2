He told this to the Yugoslav Minister for Transport and Communications Blagoje Lucic, the Yugoslav Information Ministry reported. The question of the establishment of direct telecommunication links between Belgrade and Zagreb was also examined during the talks as well as the normalisation of road and rail traffic, following an agreement with the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK). The RSK was declared by the Serbs on their ethnic ancestral lands in Croatia in response to Croatia's forcible secession from the former Yugoslavia and the downgrading of the Serb people to a national minority. The head of the Yugoslav Bureau in Zagreb Veljko Knezevic said Monday that the Yugoslav Vice Premier Zeljko Simic and the Croatian Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Mate Granic would most probably meet at the end of May in Belgrade to discuss the possibility of the opening of the Belgrade-Zagreb highway, the establishment of rail and telecommonuciations links and the linking of Yugoslav and Croatian power systems. All economic and political relations between Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) and Croatia were cut off in 1991 because of Zagreb's unilateral forcible secession from the Yugoslav Federation. The normalisation of political relations between the two countries began in March this year with the opening of the Yugoslav and Croatian bureaus in Zagreb and Belgrade respectively, which had been agreed in Geneva in January by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic and his Croatian counterpart Granic. According to the Yugoslav interpretation the normalisation of relations between Belgrade and Zagreb in no way presupposes a political settlement in the RSK, which should be reached bilaterally by the Croatian and Krajina sides.
