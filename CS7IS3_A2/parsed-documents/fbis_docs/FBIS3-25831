Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor of the province, presided over the conference. Leading Comrades Li Zhen, Lu Maozeng, and Tan Fude attended the conference. Jiang Chunyun made an important speech. Jiang Chunyun said: Struggling against corruption is one of the three major events emphatically grasped by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council last year. Over the past five months, party and government organizations at all levels in the province have conscientiously implemented the important speeches of Comrade Jiang Zemin and the guidelines of the second plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, have exerted great efforts in doing a lot of work for struggling against corruption. In general terms, the central authorities' target of achieving marked results in anticorruption campaign at the present stage has already been fulfilled basically. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: This year, the general demand on the provincial discipline inspection and supervisory work is to continuously carry out the CPC Central Committee's decision on waging the struggle against corruption, closely around the central task of economic construction, by implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building the socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, in order to carry on the anticorruption campaign in a penetrating manner with even greater results on the basis of consolidating the already achieved results. Jiang Chunyun stressed that attention should be paid to the issues in the following four aspects: First, we should pay attention to the focus and continue to make leading cadres clean, honest, and strict with themselves. This year, the focus of the anticorruption campaign should be still placed on the leading cadres at or above the county and city levels. Leading party and government organizations at all levels in the province should further maintain administrative honesty in combination with their respective realities in line with the five stipulations and new demands set by the central authorities. Leading comrades of all localities must take a lead and set an example for their subordinates. Lower levels should also positively help leading organs in struggling against corruption rather than interfering with it. Second, we should grasp [words indistinct] to safeguard the seriousness of party and administrative discipline. In investigating and handling cases, we should place emphasis on leading party and government organs, judicial departments, law enforcing administrative departments, and economic management departments. Party and government organizations at all levels should further strengthen leadership and support discipline and law enforcing departments to handle cases. Those who obstruct and interfere with the handling of cases, who conceal and refuse to report cases, who pigeonholed cases and refuse to investigate them, and who investigate cases but refuse to pose punishment should be [words indistinct] immediately. We should persist in the system of making party and government leaders assume the responsibility for handling cases, and the cases that are difficult to be handled should be taken on by first and second top leaders of party committees. Discipline and law enforcing organizations should persist in principles and [words indistinct] Once major clues for solving cases are discovered, they should be seized firmly. No matter who is involved, all cases should be investigated thoroughly and dealt with resolutely without any tolerance. Severe punishment should be given to those who indulge in the practice of higher authorities having policies and the localities having their countermeasures and to those who infringe upon the overall interests for the sake of the immediate, partial, and small groups' interests. Third, we should pay attention to checking the unhealthy trends strongly commented by the masses. In correcting the unhealthy trends of various trades, we should proceed from the heads of trades and from the sources. By adopting the method of clearing up higher levels first and lower levels then and combining higher levels with lower ones, leading organs should take the lead in clearing up unhealthy trends and solving problems. Organizational departments, in particular, must set an example for the whole province. Fourth, we should grasp systems and gradually bring the work of opposing corruption and advocating administrative honesty to the orbit of institutionalization and standardization. The most important thing to solve the corruption problem is to depend on laws and systems. We should study the laws and characteristics of market economy, unite them with reform and development, and gradually set up a supervisory and restriction mechanism that is suitable for the socialist market economic system. Jiang Chunyun stressed: We should actually strengthen leadership over the anticorruption campaign. The campaign has now entered the stage of tackling the most difficult problems. Success or failure in achieving substantive progress in this campaign has a bearing on the prestige of the party among the masses and on reform, development, and stability. Party and government organizations at all levels must actually strengthen leadership, be meticulous in organization, and firmly grasp the anticorruption campaign. We should strictly grasp policies and principles to promote the sound and effective progress of the anticorruption campaign.
