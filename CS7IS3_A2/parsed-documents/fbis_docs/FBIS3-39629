Agriculture Minister Yeoryios Moraitis said in Helsinki yesterday that in the membership negotiations there are still open questions of this type that need bold political decisions. Greece currently holds the EU presidency, and Moraitis will therefore play a central role when the EU reaches a decision on its agricultural goals in the membership negotiations. Yesterday Moraitis held five hours of talks with Agriculture and Forestry Minister Martti Pura, and he also met Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto and Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen. After the meeting Pura said that there had been no negotiations, but that Moraitis had been briefed on Finland's goals. No new issues emerged in the negotiations, Pura said. Moraitis was tight-lipped when it came to answering questions -- for example, about Spain's proposal that the new member countries' net contributions should be targeted in support to the poorest member countries. As the holder of the presidency, Greece must be cautious and not comment on something that will perhaps not happen, Moraitis said.
