These questions are not being widely discussed due to the prevailing political crisis in the country. The visit of the governor of the Tripura state of India, Romesh Bhandari, to Dhaka in the third week of April and the subsequent six-day long visit of the Chief of Staff of the Indian Armed Forces, General Bipin Chandra Joshi, to Bangladesh has had an impact on the politics of the country. Earlier, a review was made regarding the tour of Bhandari to Bangladesh, but one aspect of his visit was not discussed. Bhandari made this visit as a special envoy of New Delhi. It is needless to say that some changes have been observed in New Delhi's policy towards Dhaka, but these changes are in the interest of India. During this visit, talks were held with Bhandari regarding the sharing of the waters of the Ganges River. Bangladesh has identified this water sharing issue as the main impediment towards the solution of other problems with India. It is understood that India is now giving a fresh thought on the water sharing issue. Apart from this, India wants to improve its ties with Bangladesh to maintain its dominance in South Asia. Let us see how India wants to achieve this objective. For instance, India has softened its stand on the water sharing issue after Bangladesh started taking the necessary preparations to raise this matter at the United Nations. At this stage it is necessary that Bangladesh should be more cautious. Asafuddowla -- the official -- who strongly advocated the cause of raising this issue at the United Nations has now deviated from his earlier stand. Does this indicate that there is a possibility of resolving this water sharing issue with India through bilateral means? Asafuddowla is not acceptable to the Indians. Did the government make a different evaluation of him with India? People have a question in this regard. India does not want to restrict the forging of better ties only to the spheres of water sharing and market economy. It also wants to expand ties in the area of regional security. Many people think that this was one of the objectives behind the visit of General Joshi to Bangladesh. Official sources however described it as a routine visit. Actually, this visit had an important aim. It is understood that India wants to capture Bangladesh's military market. Though India has always opposed the military development of Bangladesh, they now want to "dump" the military equipment built in their country on Bangladesh. It is understood that during his visit, General Joshi not only talked about military cooperation but also mentioned the export of military hardware to Bangladesh. At present, Bangladesh receives a large chunk of its military equipment from China in the form of grants. Later, these grants are waived. If new spare parts are needed then Bangladesh imports them from China. India has said that China is providing old equipment to Bangladesh, but it [India] will provide her with new equipment. Hence, Bangladesh will not need to import any spare parts. Earlier, India had proposed to Bangladesh the holding of joint military and naval exercises. Bangladesh has not yet conveyed its decision to India. Many people believe that if joint military exercises are held then India will be able to develop contacts in the Bangladesh Army. Others say that if joint exercises are held then Bangladesh will be able to acquaint herself with the techniques of the Indian Army and also become aware of their motives. Joint military exercises between India and Bangladesh will create a new wave in regional politics. It is believed that this may have a negative impact. At present, Bangladesh is in need of an Armed Personnel Carrier, APC. This carrier is used in different parts of the world by the UN peacekeeping forces. The soldiers of Bangladesh are not very familiar with these carriers. To ensure Bangladesh's future participation in UN peacekeeping operations, its army should learn how to use these carriers. At present, India wants to supply these APC's to Bangladesh but a political decision has to be taken in Bangladesh whether or not to bring these from India. General Joshi held talks on this issue during his visit to Dhaka. India is also concerned about the tribal insurgency in the northeastern parts of that country, which is being aided by Pakistan. India believes that the Inter Services Intelligence of Pakistan is abetting these rebellions and it [New Delhi] is seeking the assistance of Bangladesh to curb these activities. India also believes that these terrorists are being trained in Bangladesh, but the latter has repeatedly refuted this allegation. Despite this, India is not willing to accept the denial of Bangladesh. A report published by the Indian Army in April 1993 alleged that Bangladesh is supporting the rebels in the northeastern states of India. India believes that the tribal insurgents are using Bangladeshi soil to carry on their activities in India. It has been learnt from reliable sources that these issues came up for discussion during the visit of General Joshi. During the visit of General Joshi to Bangladesh, Indian planes violated Bangladeshi airspace and India massed its troops along the border of Lalmonirhat District while Bangladesh was conducting excavation work along two of its rivers -- the Feni River and the Dharala River. The foreign secretary of Bangladesh once said that the government is observing the situation along the border. He also questioned newsmen about the veracity of newspaper reports published in this connection. However, after this the Home Ministry lodged a strong protest with India centering the tension along the border. It is now known that Bangladesh apprised the visiting Indian Army chief about these incidents. People want to know about these issues. It is known to all that India had always opposed Bangladesh for moving in an independent direction.
