Our colleague has arrived back with the interview she had with Gabor Kuncze [SZDSZ candidate for prime minister]. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Eighty percent of the delegates at the convention voted for starting coalition negotiations with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. How do you see this? [Kuncze] The convention of the SZDSZ has authorized the executive body to accept the MSZP's invitation to start coalition negotiations. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] During the course of the afternoon there was discussion about the conditions that the SZDSZ would demand. [Kuncze] [passage omitted] I think that one must not give details about the conditions now because the negotiating sides will have to decide in the knowledge of their respective terms. What I consider to be important at this point is that in view of the understanding by both sides that this is not going to be a coalition formed on the basis of sentiments, it is not a coalition to be formed between natural allies, both parties must endeavor to reach compromises, to understand and take account of the other side's position, and to work to conclude a coalition agreement acceptable for the country. If this is achieved, then it will be possible to sign this agreement and the convention will be able to give its consent. At the same time, it must be understood that if it were to prove impossible for either side to take into account the other side's concerns, then this coalition agreement will not be reached. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] There have been views expressed within the party -- and I am talking about the opinion of the membership -- that with this potential coalition agreement the SZDSZ might reach a compromise that will allow it to gain power within the coalition but which will endanger its base because a large proportion or a proportion of the membership does not quite agree to a coalition with the Socialists. [Kuncze] I, on the other hand, think that this coalition agreement can be reached only by the voting support of the majority of the delegates who themselves had been mandated by the membership. If this supporting vote is there, then in a democratic party the minority universally accepts the majority view. Today I do not see such dangers. [end recording]
