He told reporters that as of the end of May the defence industry received from the state only 5 of [as received] the amount meant for fulfilling this year's state order, with four trillion rubles still due to it. If the current rate of recession in production persists (48.7 last April), defence-industry plants will have turned out this year five times fewer military and two times fewer civilian products than in 1991. Nevertheless, Zinovyev believes, the military-industrial complex has possibilities of overcoming the crisis. It is essential to modify the military budget, bringing it into line with the state order. The slender means available to the defence industry can be substantially boosted by stepping up the export of military equipment. Zinovyev reaffirmed the readiness of defence-industry workers to take on June 9 a collective action of protest against the industry's disintegration. Many enterprises of the military-industrial complex are to stop work for 10 to 15 minutes, accompanying such a mini- strike by hooting.
