FR940202-1-00052 FR940202-1-00015 For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 50 CFR part 661 is proposed to be amended as follows: PART 661_OCEAN SALMON FISHERIES OFF THE COASTS OF WASHINGTON, OREGON, AND CALIFORNIA 1. The authority citation for part 661 continues to read as follows: Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. 2. In the Appendix to part 661, in section II.B., a new sentence is added to the end of paragraph 2(b)(i), and a new paragraph 2(b)(v) is added to read as follows: Appendix * * * * * II. Annual Changes to Management Specifications * * * * * B. Procedures for Establishing and Adjusting Annual Management Measures * * * * * 2. Allocation of ocean harvest levels. * * * * * (b) Coho south of Cape Falcon. (i) *␣*␣*␣The recreational allowable ocean harvest will be distributed between the two major recreational subareas when the recreational allocation is equal to or less than 167,000 fish in accordance with paragraph 2(b)(v) of this section. * * * * * (v) When the recreational allocation is at 167,000 fish or less, the total recreational allowable ocean harvest of coho will be divided between two major subareas with independent impact quotas. The initial allocation will be 70 percent from Cape Falcon to Humbug Mountain and 30 percent south of Humbug Mountain. Coho transfers between the two impact quotas may be permitted on a one-for-one basis, if chinook constraints preclude access to coho. Horse Mountain to Point Arena will be managed for an impact guideline of 3 percent of the south of Cape Falcon recreational allocation. The recreational coho fishery between Humbug Mountain and Point Arena may be closed when it is projected that the harvest impact between Humbug Mountain and Point Arena, combined with the projected harvest impact that will be taken south of Point Arena to the end of the season, equals the impact quota for south of Humbug Mountain. The recreational fishery for coho salmon south of Point Arena will not close upon attainment of the south of Humbug Mountain impact quota. * * * * * 3. In the Appendix to part 661, in section IV.A., the table ``Summary of Specific Management Goals for Stocks in the Salmon Management Unit'' is amended by revising the entry for Columbia River and Oregon Coastal Coho and its footnote 4 to read as follows: * * * * * Summary of Specific Management Goals for Stocks in the Salmon Management Unit 1System 1Spawning1 escapement goal ␣ *␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣* Columbia River and Oregon Coastal Coho Oregon coastal natural (OCN) coho spawning escapement is based on an aggregate density of 42 naturally spawning adults per mile in standard index survey areas.4 ␣ *␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣* 1Represents adult natural spawning escapement goal for viable natural stocks or adult hatchery return goal for stocks managed for artificial production. *␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣* 4At OCN stock sizes below 125 percent of the annual numerical escapement goal, an exploitation rate of up to 20 percent will be allowed for incidental impacts of the combined ocean troll, sport, and freshwater fisheries. At OCN spawning escapements of 28 or fewer adults per mile, an exploitation rate of up to 20 percent may be allowed to provide only minimum incidental harvest to prosecute other fisheries, provided the rate chosen will cause no irreparable harm to the OCN stock. *␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣* [FR Doc. 94&hyph;2274 Filed 1&hyph;28&hyph;94; 9:55 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;M
