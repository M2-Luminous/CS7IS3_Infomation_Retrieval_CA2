In future, China's import duties will continue to fall gradually each year until they come to a rationally low level. Current duty deductions and remission policies will also be adjusted accordingly starting this year. It has been learned that China will lower import duties on 2,898 commodities this year. Last year, import duties on 3,371 commodities were lowered. These two measures have brought down China's overall import duty rate by 15 percent. At the moment, China's duty rate is 36.4 percent, 8.8 percent lower than last year. At an international economic and trade situation seminar, co- sponsored by the International Economic Information and Development Center of the ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE and the publisher of GUOJI JINGMAO BAO [INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS AND TRADE POST], Wu Jiahuang said: In the past, when China's duty rate was relatively high, many duty deduction and remission policies were introduced, which contributed much to reform, opening up, and the absorption of foreign capital. According to statistics, by the end of last year, China had utilized a total of $21 billion in loans from foreign governments and international organizations. Goods and materials imported under the many credit projects were duty free. Last year, equipment imported duty free for wholly and partially foreign-funded enterprises in China was worth $16.6 billion. Wu Jiahuang pointed out: Duty deduction and remission policies are now more and more out of tune with the situation as China's reform and opening up moves ahead. They have caused problems such as regions and trades competing with each other in a negative way and have become an obstacle to fair competition. Wu revealed that starting this year, according to the principle of nondiscrimination and fair treatment, China will gradually adjust its duty deduction and remission policies and a number will be canceled.
