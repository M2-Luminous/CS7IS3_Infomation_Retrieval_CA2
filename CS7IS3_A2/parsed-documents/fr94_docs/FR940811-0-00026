FR940811-0-00026 FR940811-0-00011 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;13&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8969; AD 94&hyph;14&hyph;20] Airworthiness Directives; Sikorsky Aircraft Model S&hyph;76A Series Helicopters AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S&hyph;76A series helicopters, that currently requires an initial and repetitive inspections of the tail rotor (T/R) blade spar elliptical centering plug (centering plug) for disbonding and adds a retaining pad between the T/R gearbox output shaft and the inboard T/R spar. This amendment requires the same design changes and procedures as the previous AD, except that it would eliminate the 500 hours' time-in-service repetitive inspections for centering plug disbonding. This amendment is prompted by an improved bonding and repair procedure and the lack of reports concerning the movement or disbonding of the centering plug. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent the centering plug from disbonding and moving out of position, which could result in loss of tail rotor control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. DATES: Effective September 15, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of September 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Sikorsky Aircraft, Commercial Customer Support, 6900 Main Street, Stratford, Connecticut 06601&hyph;1381. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Donald F. Thompson, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Section, ANE&hyph;152, FAA, Boston Aircraft Certification Office, New England Region, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, Massachusetts 01803, telephone (617) 238&hyph;7162, fax (617) 238&hyph;7199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by superseding AD 84&hyph;06&hyph;02, Amendment 39&hyph;4829 (49 FR 10922, March 23, 1984) which is applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S&hyph;76A series helicopters, was published in the Federal Register on August 4, 1993 (58 FR 41442). That action proposed to require the same design changes and procedures as the previous AD, except that it would eliminate the 500 hours' time-in-service repetitive inspections for centering plug disbonding. This amendment is prompted by an improved bonding and repair procedure and the lack of reports concerning the movement or disbonding of the centering plug. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. However, for consistency of word usage throughout the AD and to make the language more consistent with the Sikorsky Aircraft Alert Service Bulletin 76&hyph;65&hyph;35A, Revision A, dated February 29, 1984, the word ``pressure'' that describes the part has been changed to ``retaining'' and all forms of the word ``debond'' have been changed to ``disbond.'' Other minor editorial changes were made, also. Therefore, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. There are approximately 190 Sikorsky Aircraft Model S&hyph;76A series helicopters of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 150 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will save approximately 4 work hours per helicopter by discontinuing the current 500 hours' time-in-service repetitive inspections, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the annual cost savings of the proposed elimination of these AD inspections on U.S. operators is estimated to be $33,000 annually. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
