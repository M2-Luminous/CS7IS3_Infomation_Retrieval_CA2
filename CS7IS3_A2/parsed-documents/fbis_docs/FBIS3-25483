In a telephone interview from Ulundi, Dr. Buthelezi accused the media of malicious and irresponsible reporting: [Buthelezi] I would like to say that that is absolutely false. I take this as part and parcel of the propaganda that is being mounted by certain sections of the media against me, against the IFP, and against the Freedom Alliance, because I would be mad to talk like that. Because, after all, even today there was a meeting between my colleagues and members of the government. They were seeking ways of trying to find a way which would make us participate if our concerns, as expressed in the document of the 19th of December which we gave to both the ANC and the government, were met. All I said when one of the journalists was putting the question is that in fact it seems to me that the government and ANC were deliberately stringing us along until we were left without any time to campaign. Dr. Buthelezi was allegedly misquoted after he spoke to local and foreign journalists at Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport following a meeting with Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas.
