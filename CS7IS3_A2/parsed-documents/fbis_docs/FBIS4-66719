FBIS4-66719 "jpnea025___94032" JPRS-NEA-94-025 JPRS Near East & South Asia 2 March 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA Guidelines for Airline Operation Issued Guidelines for Airline Operation Issued 94AS0255M Hyderabad DECCAN CHRONICLE in English 2 Mar 94 p 5 94AS0255M Hyderabad DECCAN CHRONICLE English CSO [Text] New Delhi, March 1. -- Air India [AI] and Indian Airlines [IA] today, formally, began functioning as two public limited companies, paving way for what is widely perceived as a new chapter in better management and more competitive functioning in aviation. While Government control over the two airlines continues, it is believed to be only a matter of time before private participation is invited -- through widening of capital base of IA and A-I -- in running the air carriers. According to an official announcement here, while A-I, IA and Vayudoot will continue to provide scheduled air transport services, air taxi operators (ATO) have been permitted to apply to the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation [DGCA] for permission to operate private scheduled airlines. The ATOs would, however, have to first comply with certain guidelines and regulations laid down by the Ministry of Civil Aviation for obtaining permission. The guidelines, according to officials, have been given the official seal after subjecting them to discussion with the key player of the domestic aviation industry last month. The rules of operation are: - A fleet strength of at least three aircraft registered in India with an all-up-weight of more than 5700 kg each - Not less than Rs 15 crores subscribed equity capital in respect of operators having aircraft of all-up-weight exceeding 40,000 kg, and not less than Rs 5 crores for operators having aircraft of all-up-weight not exceeding 40,000 kg - Not less than three sets of flight crew and cabin crew per aircraft. - An approved maintenance organization and facilities to carry out maintenance of aircraft up to 500 hours inspection or Check "B" for Boeing 737 aircraft. - Approved manuals for operations, training and quality control-cum-maintenance. - Cells for pre-flight medical examination of crew, flight planning and despatch, reliability, analysis of aircraft components and systems, detect investigation, compliance of service bulletins and modifications and records of major components. - Security programme approved by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security and trained security personnel at all operating stations. The Ministry has also laid down certain conditions for operating on different sectors. (a) Those operating scheduled air transport service on any route specified under Category - 1, will be required to provide a minimum scheduled service in Category II and Category III sectors. For rendering the prescribed minimum service on routes in Categories II and III, an operator may have the option to provide the service either by aircraft in his fleet or in another operator's fleet on mutually agreed terms. In the latter case, the arrangements should have prior approval of the DGCA. (b) Operators shall abide by any further conditions which the DGCA may consider necessary for monitoring of scheduled air transport service and operation.
