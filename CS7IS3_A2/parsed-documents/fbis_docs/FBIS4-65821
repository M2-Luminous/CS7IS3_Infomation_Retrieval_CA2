At the news conference following the latest cabinet meeting, held yesterday, the Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] president stressed that "it is these criteria that guide us, because the best thing for the country is that there be stability"; not the results of the European elections, "which will perhaps be important and crucial for the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] and for the government, but not for us." Jordi Pujol, who stated that "we do not know what will happen 13 June, not because of us but because of what the PSOE may do," thus made it clear that the outcome of the European elections will not affect his support for the government, and that, in any event, the initiative for what might happen in Spain's political life the day after 12 June remains in the hands of Felipe Gonzalez himself. Call for Calm Concern about the aspersions that the PSOE and People's Party leaders are exchanging in this framework was also expressed by the Generalitat president, who stated: "I never assess favorably wounding tones from anybody -- neither PSOE people not People's Party people." Jordi Pujol's opinion is that "this is not a good approach," because "the atmosphere of constant threat is not good, nor is that of radical attacks, which seem to show that there is a desire for destruction." In view of this, he showed himself opposed to "everybody's excesses of language," and called for calm and "forgoing aggressive and not always accurate criticism and insults, since, although everybody does what he can, there are sometimes people who use this approach because they really have nothing else to say." The Generalitat president, who specified that CiU [Convergence and Union] will not allow itself to be swept along by this dynamic, finally demanded that "everybody restrain themselves," although he expressed his doubts about achieving this in view of the "insults and slanders" that are being leveled, and when "there are rallies such as last weekend's," referring to the Socialist Party of Catalonia meeting in Barcelona, at which Narcis Serra severely criticized Jose Maria Aznar, and the People's Party meeting in Moron de la Frontera (Seville), at which both the PSOE and CiU were very harshly attacked. For his part, Miquel Roca also condemned yesterday the aspersions that the PSOE and the People's Party are exchanging, and, referring to the People's Party rally, stated that "to say that Felipe Gonzalez is selling Spain out to Jordi Pujol is unfair, offensive, and very unpleasant nonsense, aimed solely at stirring up an anti-Catalan message based on demagoguery; and demagoguery only creates problems that are difficult to resolve."
