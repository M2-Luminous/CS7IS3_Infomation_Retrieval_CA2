On Wednesday, the secretary general also discussed German representation in the United Nations and, above all, the transfer of UN offices to Bonn with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. During his talks in Bonn it was clearly stated that Germany wants more transfers of UN offices. At a joint press conference with FRG foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Butrus-Ghali limited his support for Germany's application for a new seat on the Security Council by pointing to the UN Charter, which says that he is not responsible for that. He indicated a longer waiting period by referring to the necessary discussions among the 184 UN members. In contrast, he declared his readiness to again suggest a German for the high-ranking post of UN undersecretary general, after UN legal adviser "Undersecretary General" Carl Fleischhauer was appointed a judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague in 1993. Kinkel stressed the FRG's claim to greater participation by pointing to its status as the third-largest payer of contributions. He thanked Butrus-Ghali for the promise to try to evacuate the surrounded 11 German employees of Deutsche Welle in the Rwandan capital of Kigali as soon as possible by means of UN helicopters. As during his previous two visits to Bonn, Butrus-Ghali stressed that he understands Germany's constitutional problems, which have so far prevented the participation of armed German blue helmets in peacemaking missions. He will welcome any German contribution, Butrus-Ghali said. Regarding the situation in Bosnia and, above all, around Gorazde, the UN secretary general expressed optimism that solutions like the one in Sarajevo will get the upper hand in continued negotiations. Butrus-Ghali did not refer to the Serbian threats, which have also been directed against UN personnel. He hopes for appropriate participation by Russia. Kinkel once again defended the quick decision for NATO air raids against Serbian positions, which did not permit informing Moscow immediately. In addition, Russia did, after all, also sign the UN resolution. After his visit to Bonn, Butrus-Ghali was expected to go to the Spanish capital of Madrid.
