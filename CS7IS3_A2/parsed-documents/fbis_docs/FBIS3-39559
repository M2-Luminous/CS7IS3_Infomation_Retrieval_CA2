However, a decision on their implementation will not be made before the weekend [19-20 February], diplomatic circles announced in Bonn today. The Foreign Ministry refrained from commenting publicly. In a radio interview, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel recommended great reservation, and stressed that one should wait and see whether the Russian initiative will be successful. A NATO air strike could be prevented in that case. Contrary to speculation in Belgrade, the visa office, but not the entire consulate, is to be closed. The closure and the departure for Hungary of part of the consular staff, including dependents, would probably not be ordered before Sunday if no peaceful solution becomes visible in the Bosnian war. The NATO ultimatum will expire one minute after midnight on Sunday night. The German Embassy will not be affected by the evacuation and will continue its work, diplomatic circles stressed.
