Addressing newsmen in Lagos today, the acting Group Public Affairs General Manager, Mr. Edem Duke, said investigations have proved that the products were not delivered at the approved stations and that the marketing companies could not officially account for the products. [Begin Duke recording] That in our efforts to ensure that petroleum products are readily available for Nigerians, Nigerians are involved in subverting the efforts of this corporation in realizing that objective. You are all aware of the fact that there has been accusation and counteraccusation in the past. But today we will make bold to provide details to you that we have here, a list of 500 tankers carrying petrol which is needed by everyone of us -- tankers that are supposed to deliver products to all parts of the country. But these tankers have been diverted by people who cannot take responsibility for them. It is unfortunate that today, most of the major marketers have tankers that they employed, or in their employment, diverted to God knows where. And everybody sits by and passes the buck. There is a list here showing Elf Oil, APPLC [expansion unknown], Unipetrol, Mobil Oil, Agip, Total PLC, National, and so many independent marketers and this is just the first set of 500 tankers that are missing and we would like Nigerians to call those who should be asked questions to render and account of where these tankers are.
