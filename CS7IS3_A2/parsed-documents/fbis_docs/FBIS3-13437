Interim UN special envoy to Somalia Lansana Kouyate said factional leader Mohamed Farah Aidid was taking part in the UN-sponsored talks with several other warlords including his ally Omar Jess. Kismaayo is claimed by Jess and Mohamed Said Hersi, known as General Morgan, son-in-law of ousted ruler Mohamed Siad Barre. Fighting between their militiamen killed at least nine people in the city last month. Kouyate said Morgan was expected in the Kenyan capital Nairobi within days to join the talks. "These are informal consultations and I expect them to last from five days to a week," Kouyate told AFP. "I am optimistic, not only about Kismaayo but about Somalia in general, because I detect a new willingness on all sides to make peace." Aidid aides confirmed that "informal talks" were under way. But sources close to the warlord said he was still distrustful of the UN and would prefer to launch his own initiative to restore peace. Kouyate declined to speculate about face-to-face talks between Aidid and his arch-enemy self-styled Interim President Ali Mahdi Mohamed. Both warlords are currently in Nairobi, staying in different luxury hotels in the centre of the Kenyan capital. Ali Mahdi arrived here this week from Cairo where he attended a meeting of leaders of 12 Somali factions opposed to Aidid. Aidid has strongly condemned plans by the factions to form a National Salvation Committee as a first step towards setting up a government by the end of this month, when US troops are scheduled to complete their pullout from Somalia. Ali Mahdi was not taking part in the Kismaayo talks because he has no forces in the city, Kouyate said. Kouyate dismissed predictions that civil war will again engulf Somalia after the US withdrawal. "The general situation has improved," he said. "Even the upsurge in banditry is a positive sign, because it shows two things. Firstly, the bandits realise that there will be less money around after the Americans leave, and secondly even they know that the political signals point towards a possible settlement, so they are looting while they still can." Aid agencies have borne the brunt of a wave of attacks this year presumed to be the work of bandits.
