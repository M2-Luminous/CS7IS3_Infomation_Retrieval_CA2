This delay not only demands a satisfactory explanation but also leads to the issue -- which seems to be taking forever to settle -- of the necessary reform of the Armed Forces. The promotion of a considerable number of generals without there being a single retirement only worsens the old problem of an excess number of officers in our Armed Forces. Granted, sending officers into retirement does not ease the burden on the state, but at least the number of officers on active duty does not continue to grow and, ultimately, the budget will tend to be divided among fewer officers. To the contrary, the overpopulation of officers has an immediate effect on the efficiency of institutes and on costs and wages. The fact that officers do not earn a decent salary is due, to a certain extent, to their being too many of them. Low wages, in turn, are a hotbed for all sorts of corrupt practices that undermine the Armed Forces' morale. In the end, only those who manage to accommodate those practices or who have a family fortune tend to survive, and not necessarily the upright and talented ones. Therefore, it is a matter of national security to implement an important reform within the Armed Forces. It should not only include the number of officers but also the equipment it has and the purchases made. The lack of openness in military purchases -- reportedly justified by the very nature of the issues linked to national defense -- prevalent for such a long time has given rise to a stifling atmosphere that has bred corruption. The embezzlement committed against the Navy, for example, is a case in which the country will not back off from its determination to find the culprits. The subject of the Armed Forces and the necessary openness on its main issues has not been properly approached yet. And it should be approached properly just as much as the rest of the main national subjects. The armed institutions must not remain aside in the reform that is being carried out in all sectors of society, the economy, and the state, and that is making our national recovery possible.
