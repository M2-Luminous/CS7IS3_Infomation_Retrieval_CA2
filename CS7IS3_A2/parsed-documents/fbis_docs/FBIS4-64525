Yesterday morning, Francois Ngarukiyintwali, the Rwandan ambassador in Brussels, was called to the Foreign Ministry. After announcing Belgium's "vigorous" protests at the statements made by the Rwandan ambassador in Zaire, in particular, and by the Rwandan foreign minister, the Foreign Ministry's Secretary General Roelants repeated that Belgium had nothing to do with this tragedy, either through the Belgian units which are part of UNAMIR (UN Mission in Rwanda) or through any Belgian authority. Consequently, the Rwandan ambassador was informed that the Belgian Government is demanding the interim Rwandan Government to formally and unequivocally withdraw the statements that Belgium was an accomplice, an instigator, or the perpetrator of the assassination of Juvenal Habyarimana, as well as the statements claiming that the Rwandan Patriotic Front (FPR) received support from Brussels. As long as these statements have not been withdrawn, neither the Rwandan foreign minister nor any member of the interim Rwandan Government will be allowed into Belgium. This does not mean a breakdown in diplomatic relations between Brussels and Kigali. To put it plainly, any future contact between Belgium and Rwanda at the highest level will be subject to an apology from Rwanda. [passage omitted]
