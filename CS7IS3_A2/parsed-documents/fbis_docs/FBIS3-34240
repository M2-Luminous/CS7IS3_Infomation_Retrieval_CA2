In a hard hitting statement in Geneva, the finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh said discrimination against the minorities is in-built in Pakistan's Constitution. Terming Islamabad's record on human rights as abysmal, he observed that Pakistan's championship of the cause of Kashmiris lacks credibility. Dr. Manmohan Singh said Pakistan continues to remain in illegal occupation of one-third of Jammu and Kashmir in flagrant violation of UN resolutions. The finance minister reaffirmed India's commitment to peace and stability in the region. It is in this spirit, he said, that New Delhi made six proposals, including a draft agreement on peace and tranquility along the Line of Control. The Congress-I says Jammu and Kashmir cannot revert back to the 1953 status. The party spokesman, Mr. Chandulal Chandrarkar, told reporters in New Delhi today that the clock cannot be put back. He said the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India is final and irreversible. The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader, Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, has welcomed the prime minister's suggestion to freeze the Kashmir issue for the time being and to hold talks with Pakistan to improve relations. Talking to newspersons in Lucknow today, he said Pakistani propaganda against India should be countered effectively. Mr. Vajpayee said the people in the Kashmir valley are fed up with terrorist activities.
