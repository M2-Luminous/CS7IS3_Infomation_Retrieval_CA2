Why did your bloc receive fewer votes than Zhirinovskiy's ultra-rightists? [Shumeyko] We were only barely defeated. This was mainly attributable to preparation for the elections. Zhirinovskiy had set the goal for himself to win in any case. Russia's Choice failed to do so. Our election bloc did not make any promises, but instead continued to implement the government program. [Urban] Most people apparently did not agree to such an approach. [Shumeyko] It is a well-known fact that people currently have to put up with a decreasing living standard. This is an unavoidable part of this program. An estimated 30 to 40 million people are affected by it. Under socialism, most people got used to the fact that everything was settled for them for the future. It was simply enough to turn up at one's job to get paid. [Urban] What, precisely, is different today? [Shumeyko] The old ideology called Marxism-Leninism was defective. But it offered the people an orientation in life. Today we have an ideological pluralism that is also guaranteed by the Constitution. This means an ideological vacuum. However, the recent elections have shown that the notion of a powerful, strong state is alive. [Urban] It was, above all, Zhirinovskiy who profited from this fact. [Shumeyko] Whenever Zhirinovskiy appeared, he treated his audience like 12-year-old children, whereas others expounded their position at an academic level. Not everyone saw this. [Urban] Is Zhirinovskiy dangerous? [Shumeyko] His popularity is based solely on the way he talks with his voters. I have known him from two angles. As a member of the constitutional assembly called by the president he was silent, not talkative. When he did speak, it was mostly constructive. The communists are much more dangerous. [Urban] Doesn't the failure of Russia's Choice mean a move away from the market economy? [Shumeyko] According to Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the new Constitution, the government cannot stop the reform process. The government will not change its course, which is aimed at the market economy, but will continue it in accordance with the Constitution and the Federation Treaty. It agreed on a program for 1993 to 1995. [Urban] What will the new government look like? [Shumeyko] There will probably be structural changes. The apparatus will be streamlined, and the number of ministries reduced to 26 or 27; state committees that were independent in the past will be integrated into the ministries. [Urban] Will the president continue to pursue his course, irrespective of the parliament and its majority of communists and nationalists? [Shumeyko] The parliament consists of two chambers. The Federation Council consists of approximately 170 members. Two-thirds of them are regional administrative chiefs; they are the people who carry out the president's decrees and push reforms. However, the Duma with its different majorities can, under the Constitution, only make decisions in a very limited number of cases--as opposed to the former Supreme Soviet, which could deal with everything and decide on everything. This does not mean, however, that government work has become easier, since both chambers also have to get along with each other. [Urban] You are one of the advocates of presidential democracy as defined by the new constitution. Boris Yeltsin will be head of state for another two years. What will come after him? [Shumeyko] There is currently much talk about a presidential party. This is not Yeltsin's party, but an association of people advocating a strong state. This is the first time in Russia's 1,000-year history that there is a president, and Yeltsin is the first to hold this office. So the definition of the office depends on him. The fact that Zhirinovskiy is mentioned as a possible president shows that the office does not yet carry the weight and prestige due to it. Everyone must acknowledge that only someone who has a constructive attitude in every respect should be the head of state. Therefore, the development of this office must not be interrupted. Boris Yeltsin should be at the helm of the state for another term. [Urban] But he has said that he does not want to and is not going to continue in office. [Shumeyko] True. But he is strong enough and in good health. There is still a long time to go until 1996. [Urban] How are you going to prevent a nationalist from becoming president in two years? [Shumeyko] A president's party must emerge. I see the people advocating the notion of a strong and powerful state. The Russian nation, in a historic-philosophical sense, has always been expansive. Yet Russia has never conquered other states, only absorbed them. The Bolsheviks took over this empire. The people here and in the West always saw Russia in the Soviet Union. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia lost some of its territory for the first time in history. Russians became a minority in other states. This is a psychological shock for the whole nation. Zhirinovskiy's campaign was focused on this fact, and a presidential party must also focus on it. [Urban] What would be the difference, then, to Zhirinovskiy? [Shumeyko] The democratic grassroots. I hope there will be a president's party in two years. Then the person will win who has an idea -- the idea of a democratic Russia led by a president, but a state in which the people are proud of being its citizens. [Urban] Who will be the first to succeed in conveying such an idea? [Shumeyko] Perhaps the communists will be strong in this field, but the fascists will not. Everyone says that Zhirinovskiy's election success spells the rise of neofascism. But we must not ignore the fact that elderly people, above all, were the ones who voted. There is not a single family in our country that did not lose someone in the war. These people, of course, did not vote for fascism, but protested against their current living conditions. They voted for politicians who made promises. [Urban] So will Russia in the future bank on its own way and put the West last? [Shumeyko] We must differentiate between policy and the economy. Russia will also seek mutually beneficial economic cooperation, but it will never neglect its political interests. There is currently much talk about the Kaliningrad (Koenigsberg) area. The president has now created the option by decree that the area become a free economic zone. A small army contingent that will continue to be deployed there cannot interfere with this plan. But it means that Kaliningrad is Russian, and Russia will never leave the area. Russia is a sovereign state and can deploy its armed forces wherever it likes.
