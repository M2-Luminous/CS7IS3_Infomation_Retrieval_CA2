There is no plan to this end, and still less to (violate) the specific rights of Bolivian people living in democracy. An authorization issued by a prosecutor or a judge is necessary to do this. Speaking about the militarization of the Chapare zone, the president said: There is no intention of militarizing the struggle against drug trafficking. I was never in favor of that when I was a member of the opposition, and still less so now that I am in government.
