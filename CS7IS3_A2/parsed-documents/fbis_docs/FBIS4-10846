FBIS4-10846 "drlat075_k_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-075 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 SOUTH AMERICA Argentina Journalists `Categorically' Reject All Controls Journalists `Categorically' Reject All Controls PY1804205194 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 2059 GMT 15 Apr 94 PY1804205194 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS Spanish BFN [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 15 Apr (NA) -- The Argentine Association of Newspaper Owners (ADEPA) today warned that "the main problem facing journalists in Argentina is: the threat that an eventual law excessively increasing penalties for slander might be left at the disposal of officials wanting to silence reports on corruption, which have regularly involved Argentine public figures." The institution's concern is included in a report issued by the Freedom of the Press and Information Commission presided over by Jose Claudio Escribano that was unanimously approved during the deliberations of the 94th ADEPA semi-annual board of directors meeting that ended today. The editors also unanimously and categorically rejected the "ethic tribunals imposed or suggested from the highest government levels. We reiterate that no journalism is possible without solid moral bases and the implacable daily judgment passed by readers and clients who do not hesitate to be categorical." The report also discusses "the confusion over the meaning of journalistic criticism, the theory of real malice, Santiago del Estero's inadmissible situation in the distribution and sale of newspapers, the figure of the ombudsman, so-called contempt of court, and the investigation of attacks against journalists," among other things. ADEPA recognized that "independent journalists are not necessarily against governments, but neither will they place themselves at their service, for they serve society." ADEPA's board of directors started their meeting on 14 April. On that occasion President Guillermo Ignacio offered his report and gave details on ADEPA activities since the Salta assembly in September 1993. Ignacio's report includes details of his meetings with President Carlos Menem in October 1993 and January 1994. He also referred to meetings with special fiscal prosecutor Luis Gonzalez Warcalde to learn about the progress of investigations into the attacks against journalists. The report gave details on steps taken with the Brazilian Newspaper Association to invite other Latin American press associations to form an association to represent them. [passage omitted]
