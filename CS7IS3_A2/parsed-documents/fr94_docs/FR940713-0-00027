FR940713-0-00027 FR940713-0-00011 (iv) The requirements of subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) do not apply because this system is exempt from the individual access and amendment provisions of subsection (d). Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of its notification, access, and contest procedures because access is appropriate in some cases. (v) Application of subsection (e)(8) could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the subject of the investigation. (vi) The provisions of subsection (g) do not apply because exemption from the provisions of subsection (d) renders the provisions on suits to enforce subsection (d) inapplicable. (vii) If one of these systems of records is operated in whole or in part by a contractor, the exemptions claimed herein shall remain applicable to it (subsection (m)). (3) Personnel Records_Preemployment Investigation Records, USPS 120.110; Personnel Records_Postmaster Selection Program Records, USPS 120.130. These systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1)&hyph;(4) and (e)(1) to the extent that information in the system is subject to exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) as relating to the identity of a source who furnished information to the government in confidence as a part of an investigation conducted solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications of an individual for employment. The reasons for exemption follow: (i) During its investigation and evaluation of an applicant for a position, the Postal Service contacts individuals who, without an assurance of anonymity, would refuse to provide information concerning the subject of the investigation. If a record subject were given access pursuant to subsection (d)(1)&hyph;(4), the promised confidentiality would be breached and the confidential source would be identified. The result would be restriction of the free flow of information vital to a determination of an individual's qualifications and suitability for appointment to or continued occupancy of his position. (ii) In collecting information for investigative and evaluative purposes, it is impossible to determine in advance what information might be of assistance in determining the qualifications and suitability of an individual for appointment. Information that seems irrelevant, when linked with other information, can sometimes provide a composite picture of an individual that assists in determining whether that individual should be appointed to or retained in a position. For this reason, exemption from subsection (e)(1) is claimed. (4) Personnel Records_Personnel Research and Test Validation Records, USPS 120.120; Personnel Records_Career Development and Training Records, USPS 120.152. These systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1)&hyph;(4), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) to the extent that information in the system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) as relating to the compromise of the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process. The reasons for exemption follow: (i) These systems contain questions and answers to standard testing materials, the disclosure of which would compromise the fairness of the future use of these materials. It is not feasible to develop entirely new examinations after each administration as would be necessary if questions or answers were available for inspection and copying. Consequently, exemption from subsection (d) is claimed. (ii) The requirements of subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) do not apply to these systems for which exemption from subsection (d) of the Act has been claimed. Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of its notification, access, and contest procedures because access to system records that do not compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing examination process is appropriate in some cases. (5) Personnel Records_Recruiting, Examining, and Appointment Records, USPS 120.151. This system is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1)&hyph;(4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) to the extent that information in the system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) as relating to the identity of a source who has furnished information to the government in confidence as part of an investigation conducted solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications of an individual for employment; and to exemption pursuant to subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) as relating to the compromise of the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process. The reasons for exemption follow: (i) To the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), application of the provisions at subsection (d)(1)&hyph;(4) would reveal to the applicant whose suitability is being investigated the identity of individuals who supplied information under a promise of anonymity. As a result, the Postal Service's promise of confidentiality would be breached, its ability to obtain information in the future would be diminished, and the information source could be subjected to harassment by the applicant. To the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6), the requirements of the exemption at subsection (d)(1)&hyph;(4) and the reasons for exempting information relating to the compromise of the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process are the same as those given in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.
