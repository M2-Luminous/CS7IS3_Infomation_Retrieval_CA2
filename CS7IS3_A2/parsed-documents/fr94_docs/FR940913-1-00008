SUMMARY: This proposed rule would amend the regulations to set forth the acreage reduction percentage, if any, and the national average price support rate for the 1995 crop of rice. This action is required by section 101B of the Agricultural Act of 1949 (1949 Act), as amended. This proposed rule outlines a range of acreage reduction percentage options proposed for the 1995 crop of rice and requests comments regarding price support rate adjustments for different types and grades of rice. DATES: Comments must be received on or before October 24, 1994 in order to be assured of consideration. ADDRESSES: Comments must be mailed to Director, Fibers and Rice Analysis Division (FRAD), Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), P.O. Box 2415, room 3090-S, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;2415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gene S. Rosera, Agricultural Economist, FRAD, ASCS, USDA, room 3758&hyph;S, P.O.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 This proposed rule has been determined to be economically significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866. Regulatory Flexibility Act It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is applicable to this proposed rule since the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is required by section 105B(o) of the 1949 Act to request comments with respect to the subject matter of this rule. A Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis was prepared that determined that this regulation will have no significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because the particular acreage reduction percentages considered will not affect the paperwork, reporting, or compliance burdens of the small entities in the program. CCC thus certifies that the rule will have no significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis describing the options considered in developing this proposed rule and the impact of the implementation of each option is available on request from the above-named individual. Environmental Evaluation It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed. Federal Assistance Program The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to which this proposed rule applies, are: Rice Production Stabilization_10.065. Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this proposed rule do not preempt State laws, are not retroactive, and do not require the exhaustion of any administrative appeal remedies. Executive Order 12372 This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983). Paperwork Reduction Act The amendments to 7 CFR part 1413 set forth in this proposed rule do not contain information collections that require clearance by OMB under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 35. Request for Public Comment Comments are requested with respect to this proposed rule and such comments shall be considered in developing the final rule. Background In accordance with section 101B of the 1949 Act, an acreage reduction program (ARP) may be implemented for the 1995 rice crop if it is determined that the total supply of rice, in the absence of such a program, would be excessive taking into account the need for an adequate carryover to maintain reasonable and stable supplies and prices, and to meet a national emergency. Land diversion payments also may be made to producers if needed to adjust the total national acreage of rice to desirable goals. A paid land diversion program is not considered because, given the considered program options, it is not needed to achieve the statutory stocks-to-use levels of rice. If an ARP is announced, the reduction shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction (from 0 to 35 percent) to the rice crop acreage base for the crop for each rice producing farm. In making such a determination, the number of acres placed into the agricultural resources conservation program established under subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, must be taken into consideration. Producers who knowingly produce rice in excess of the permitted acreage for the farm plus any rice acreage planted in accordance with the flexibility provisions are ineligible for loans and purchases and all payments with respect to that crop on the farm.
