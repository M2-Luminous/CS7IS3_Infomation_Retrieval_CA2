Sources say powerful explosions were heard inside the city. Although the situation is worrisome, sources in Huambo told our correspondent that World Food Program aircraft managed to land in Bie with foodstuffs on board. The sources added that UNITA armed forces in Bie have been instructed to remain calm, but if Luanda continues with its bombardments, the situation could worsen. Meanwhile, our Cuanza Norte correspondent reported today that the MPLA-PT air force continued with its attacks on N'Dalatando and nearby locations. The source said the MPLA-PT air force has been carrying out two attacks daily. Civilians are the preferred targets for the air force [words indistinct] and Lucala villages. The source added that bombardments by artillery units have been stepped up. The command of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola in the region said this afternoon that N'Dalatando will never be occupied by neither [words indistinct] let alone aircraft.
