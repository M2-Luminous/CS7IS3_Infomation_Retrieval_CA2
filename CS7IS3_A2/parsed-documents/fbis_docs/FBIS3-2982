The two sides announced after the meeting that Russia and the United States are still partners, although they will have differences forever. The statement indicates the U.S.-Russian relations of partnership will go ahead on a road full of zigzags. In a world characterized by multi-polarity instead of the bi-polarity structure, both the United States and Russia are paying great attention to their mutual relations. The two heads of state met thrice last year in an effort to establish a new-type relationship marked by mutual interests, cooperation and mutual restraint. At the January Moscow summit this year between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton, the two countries announced that they have "entered a new phase of mature strategic relations of partnership." However, as the situation in Russia and the international situation evolve, the two countries have neither solved their old differences nor prevented new ones from erupting. This has resulted in repeated bumping and frictions between the two countries over the past several weeks. "A number of gaps have been appearing in the mansion of Russo-U.S. partnership" and "Russo-U.S. relations have experienced some of the most serious crises for the past few years," local media reports said. It is not accidental that great ups-and-downs have occurred in Russo-U.S. relations only months after the Moscow summit. Local media reports summed up the causes for this change as follows: -- Russia is constantly adjusting its own foreign policy, and is putting a particular emphasis on an independent policy in dealing with international affairs; -- Russia is trying to strengthen its impact and role in other former Soviet republics to check the expansion of the United States in those areas; and -- The evolution of the situation in Russia has aroused worries in the United States and other Western countries. Russia's effort to resume its big-power status in the post-cold war world conflicts with the role of the U.S. as the only remaining superpower on earth. Russia has tried to adopt a pro-West foreign policy in order to win Western aid. However, the policy has not helped Russia tide over its economic crisis or establish a market economy that would help the country integrate with the Western world. Instead, the policy has greatly weakened Russia's impact and role in the international scene and, to the dismay of many Russians, the country has lost some of its traditional spheres of influence. Yeltsin pointed out recently that Russia's foreign policy is mainly aimed at "realizing its national interests" and its diplomatic ideas should always "conform with the supreme standard of big-power status." He called for an end to "the situation of faulty and unilateral concessions" by Russia when it deals with Western countries. The Russian foreign minister also said recently that it is a "fanatical illusion" to wish that the world will be ruled by only one power -- the United States. The differences between Russia and the United States were fully shown in the course of the Bosnia crisis. Russia, as an active mediator in the Bosnia war and as a traditional friend of the Serbs, was kept out of the door when NATO decided in mid-February to press the Serbs to withdraw heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo with threats of air strikes. Russia countered the NATO decision by persuading the Serbs to withdraw the weaponry on time and sending several hundred Russian soldiers to Sarajevo. This foiled NATO's plan for air strikes and increased Russia's confidence in resuming its role in solving major international crises. Washington, furious with Russia's action on Bosnia, retaliated by arresting a senior CIA officer for spying for Russia, and by expelling a Russian diplomat. The United States has also been active in expanding into former Soviet republics ranging from the Baltic nations to Kazakhstan. The U.S. secretary of state visited almost all the former Soviet republics, promising things from aid in the removal of nuclear warheads to "democratic partnership" pacts. The U.S. supported the Baltic states' call for Russian troops withdrawal, provided aid to Ukraine at a time when Kiev was quarreling with Russia over the natural gas supply, invited Kazakhstan and some other Central Asia republics to cooperate with NATO, and supported Georgia's call for sending international peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia. Russia, which regards these areas as its spheres of special interests and responsibility, apparently considers the U.S. move as a kind of threat to its own security. Meanwhile, Russia's ever-changing domestic situation has been marked since last December by the victory of the right-wing nationalists in parliamentary elections, the resigning of pro-West economists from the government, and the amnesty by the state Duma to free former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy and former parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov. All this has aroused worries and scepticism in the West over the future of Russia's "democratic and market economic reforms." Former U.S. President Richard Nixon, who has been on a trip in Moscow since early March, was turned down a meeting request [as received] with Yeltsin. Nixon's mission is clearly to see for himself what's really going on in Russia and to report his "data-collection" to Clinton. Kozyrev and Christopher agreed to further cooperation between their countries in dealing with crises like those in Bosnia and the Middle East, and expressed satisfaction over the meeting. They also agreed that the two sides would establish specific organs for guaranteeing their relations of partnership in dealing with international affairs. But local media reports have expressed pessimism over whether such specific organs can be set up without difficulty.
