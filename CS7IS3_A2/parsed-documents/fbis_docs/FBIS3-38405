[Uhrlau] No, your impression is correct. Right-wing extremism in Germany is about to assume the character of a movement. [FOCUS] What does that mean? [Uhrlau] The point is the networking of right-wing extremist activities. Until the early nineties, we only knew this phenomenon on the left-wing extremist scene. Networking means that the individual groups remain independent and that political hierarchies are avoided. Politically active right-wing extremists hitherto longed for hierarchy and leadership. Now they are taking advantage of state-of-the-art communications technologies to mobilize people from different groups for action. [FOCUS] Has your office underestimated the neo-Nazi who is equipped with a personal computer [PC], fax, and mobile telephone? [Uhrlau] No, we have not underestimated him. However their position is different today and will continue to change. The traditional right-wing extremists of the eighties were much more at variance. Comprehensive media such as mail boxes and information telephone lines have sprouted tremendously over the past two years. While the "old" right-wing extremism remained static, so to speak, the protagonists of the new right-wing extremist tendencies, tactics, and strategies are using inexpensive modern communications technologies. After all, one can not forbid anybody the use of a fax, a PC, or mobile telephone. [FOCUS] Can you give us an example? [Uhrlau] It was only through mobile communications that the right-wing extremists were able -- as they had successfully done before in 1992 -- to redirect a demonstration on the occasion of the death day of "Deputy Fuehrer" Hess to the city of Fulda, in Hesse, in August 1993. [FOCUS] Which ended in a political and a media spectacle. [Uhrlau] The right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis are deliberately banking on the media to transmit their message. What is actually conveyed is of secondary importance -- the point is that they are present. I am greatly worried to see that some neo-Nazis have been idolized as "personalities of modern history" via the media. The media bear a special responsibility in this connection. [FOCUS] After right-wing tumults, let us now talk about the intellectualization at the right margin. What about the Deutsches Rechtsbuero [German Legal Office], which offers legal advice to neo-Nazis? [Uhrlau] That is part of the network. Via mail boxes one can also access court decisions, appeals for demonstrations and actions or the banning of such actions. The activities by right-wing extremist students are gaining in importance in this connection. [FOCUS] Are right-wing extremist graduates getting ready for a march through the institutions? [Uhrlau] We know that such plans exist in individual right- leaning fraternities. The difference is that such groups do not resort to Nazi patterns of justification but to the classic models of anti-democratic thinking such as Carl Schmitt and the Italian elite theorists. This can be found, for example in JUNGE FREIHEIT [YOUNG FREEDOM], which has set out to become a "TAGESZEITUNG [far left Berlin daily] of the right." This development is also a result of the fact that right-leaning high-school leavers entering the universities are finding the political field there lying fallow. [FOCUS] And their objective is to march through the institutions? [Uhrlau] If one understands oneself as a movement, there is either the parliamentary or the extra-parliamentary approach. The path into the institutions requires a strong representation in parliament. According to this concept, it is necessary to go into the institutions -- just as was tried by the generation of '68. [FOCUS] Are you in favor of a new radicals decree? [Uhrlau] No, the existing instruments are sufficient.
