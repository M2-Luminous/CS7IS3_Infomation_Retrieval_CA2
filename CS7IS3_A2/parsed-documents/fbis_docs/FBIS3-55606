There is no doubt that these issues also concern you as president, the first president of independent Ukraine. Today, you, Mr. President, are bitterly assailed from all sides -- by National Democrats, Social Communists, and so-called Centrists. The common people also criticize you (and not without reason). They have become disillusioned by the present leadership and present government due to the catastrophically declining standard of living. Let us, Leonid Makarovych, speak openly. [Kravchuk] Okay. [Zholdak] UKRAYINSKA HAZETA also has and does criticize you, if you have read its publications. [Kravchuk] I have. I follow your newspaper's activity. I like it. [Zholdak] This is probably why you agreed to hold this meeting, because our attacks on you do not involve insults or pinning on labels. Our columnists, among whom, as you know, there is one of the most authoritative, decent, and integral Ukrainian figures -- Ihor Yukhnovskyy.... [Kravchuk] Yes. [Zholdak] Our columnists assess what you are doing for Ukraine's good and where you are failing.... [Kravchuk] You have a subjective view of things. [Zholdak] No, Leonid Makarovych, we have an independent point of view. We are not inclined to support a single party or a single political force and, of course, we do not support the opposition for that matter. Our position is as follows: Assist the president, Supreme Council, government, and leaders of institutions in their best deeds and be objective in assessing their mistakes, failures, or even anti-Ukrainian actions. UKRAYINSKA HAZETA only depends upon one thing -- Ukraine, its independence, and the prosperity and well- being of the Ukrainian people. All of our publications focus on two topics: Who are we? Who leads us? [Kravchuk] I share your aspirations. [Zholdak] In order to keep this conversation to the point and make it as frank as possible, I will tell you about my attitude toward you, Leonid Makarovych. I have mixed feelings. I feel primarily, gratitude. If you remember the year 1988 when the Kiev Ivan Franko Theater was preparing the performance "Moment," the first in Ukraine based upon the works by the "bourgeois" and, not very long ago, also nationalist, prominent writer Volodymyr Vynnychenko. At that time you, as head of the ideological department at Ukraine's Communist Party Central Committee, were the only one to rescue the first show. [Passage omitted on cultural issues] [Zholdak] Let us start with what is particularly important for the fate of Ukrainian independence -- its national security. The preceding issue of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA, if you read it, carried an interview with Yuriy Kostenko, head of the working deputies' group on preparing for the ratification of START I and Ukraine's nuclear-free status. Yuriy Kostenko is Ukraine's people's deputy and Ukraine's minister of environmental protection. [Kravchuk] I read it thoroughly. [Zholdak] In particular, it expresses disagreement, Mr. President, with your position regarding the immediate transfer of all the nuclear weapons to Russia. [Kravchuk] My position on this point is final and invariable. [Zholdak] In our interview with Kostenko, we quoted your letter to U.S. President George Bush of 7 May 1992 in which you informed the American president that you were trying to urgently transfer to Russia all the nuclear weapons from Ukraine -- tactical in 1992 and strategic -- by 1994. Did you make such a commitment? [Kravchuk] In that letter nobody made such a commitment. The entire letter should have been read. I wrote something else. I wrote that Ukraine would do what is envisaged by START and by the Statement on Ukraine's Nuclear-Free Statement, which was adopted by our Supreme Council. [Zholdak] Why are you in such a hurry to transfer everything at one go? Russia has not paid us a cent for the tactical weapons that have already been transferred there. [Kravchuk] The point is that even now I believe that we must transfer our nuclear weapons as soon as possible. However, of course, you are right, we must get compensation for our expenses. [Zholdak] They [Russia] will not give compensation for anything! [Kravchuk] Why not? We have already reached an agreement with Russia on strategic weapons. We have signed an agreement. [Zholdak] However, that agreement applies to strategic weapons. We have received nothing for tactical ones. In the opinion of our and foreign specialists, they are worth billions of U.S. dollars. [Kravchuk] Negotiations are now under way on the tactical weapons as well. There is an agreement in principle on compensation for those weapons, too. [Zholdak] Cannot you, like Russia, also put pressure upon them and fight for our good? [Kravchuk] We are fighting within the limits of our possibilities and law. However, you see, the oil- and gas tap is on the other side. So far, we are deeply in debt. Generally speaking, putting pressure means a policy from a position of strength. [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, you received the belated telegram from Yeltsin regarding the ratification of START I by Ukraine. [Kravchuk] Yes, I did. [Zholdak] Our press wrote much about it. One newspaper even quoted the telegram and asserted that Mr. Yeltsin humiliated you and set an ultimatum to the effect that all the strategic weapons be transferred to Russia within two years. Can you read this telegram to me or give it to me to publish in UKRAYINSKA HAZETA? Or is it a secret? [Kravchuk] No, there is nothing secret about it. However, it is a personal letter. Why make it public? It is not for publishing. [Zholdak] However, the Ukrainian people must know that the Ukrainian president is bound hand and foot. Here, I take your side and do not want you to be humiliated. [Kravchuk] Nobody is bound. Let us analyze the situation soberly. Yeltsin's letter deals with two aspects. [Zholdak] Is it a letter or a telegram? [Kravchuk] A letter telegram. It was meant as a telegram, but arrived as a letter. [Zholdak] Excuse me, Leonid Makarovych, how does this letter telegram start? Esteemed Comrade President? Highly esteemed Mr. President? [Kravchuk] What difference does it make? [Zholdak] It is very interesting. [Kravchuk] He writes: "Dear Leonid Makarovich." [Zholdak] Oh, this is good! [Kravchuk] No, this does not mean that this word determines the policy. [Zholdak] Well, there are two aspects in the letter. [Kravchuk] Two aspects. First. He analyzes the situation that has taken shape after the ratification of START I by the Supreme Council and thinks that this cannot be considered as a ratification. [Zholdak] Whose situation does he analyze? The one that has taken shape in Ukraine or in Russia? [Kravchuk] In the world. [Zholdak] Why does he consider our parliament's decision wrong? [Kravchuk] Because it deviates from the promises that were previously made by Ukraine's Supreme Council and by Ukraine in signing the Lisbon Protocol. It is true. We did deviate from our promises. Here, we must call a spade a spade. It was not my decision to deviate. I insist that we must be consistent. In my opinion, the Supreme Council did things that I consider to be short-sighted for Ukraine. Our state's international prestige has been seriously undermined. [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, the Lisbon Protocol was not signed by you as president and head of our state responsible for Ukraine's well-being, but by Mr. Zlenko, the country's minister of foreign affairs. [Kravchuk] This does not matter, because we are dealing with a certain status of the document. [Zholdak] How come it does not matter? Why, in that case, is there any need for the Supreme Council's decision? It must ratify or refuse to ratify that protocol. This is world practice. I believe that the minister's signature is legally not valid. The Supreme Council has the right to either ratify or not ratify, to do either one or the other. [Kravchuk] The right must be used in the interests of the state. [Zholdak] Was it not ratified in the interests of the state, with demands that we must receive compensation for different things? That we must get international security guarantees? Was that a bad thing to do, Mr. President? [Kravchuk] Am I saying anything against it? However, it was also necessary to ratify the NNT. [Zholdak] The what? [Kravchuk] NNT -- that we join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. [Zholdak] Is this the fifth item? [Kravchuk] Yes. I am not saying that the Supreme Council was wrong to make those reservations. However, it depends on which of them. I agree with some of them, while others are fundamentally at variance with our previously determined position. [Zholdak] However, if we had endorsed that fifth item of the Lisbon Protocol, we would have agreed juridically that we did not possess nuclear weapons, and then we would have been rejected like worn-out horses. [Kravchuk] How do you mean we do not possess nuclear weapons? [Zholdak] This is what is written there. [Kravchuk] It is written there that we do not spread nuclear weapons. [Zholdak] If we sign it, Russia will get the right to remove anything it wants from our territory. Knowledgeable specialists told me about this. [Kravchuk] That is what they are saying. You had better listen to what I tell you. [Zholdak] Yes. [Kravchuk] Has Russia joined the protocol? [Zholdak] It has. [Kravchuk] It has joined the protocol. Have Belarus and Kazakhstan joined it? Yes, they have. All states have joined, and Ukraine has not done so. Why? How will you explain this to people? That you are in favor of the proliferation of nuclear weapons? Tell me how you are going to spread them. Or explain to me that nonsense one hears from the lips of both ultra-left-wing and ultra-right-wing chatterboxes to the effect that we can change the codes of our warheads. I want to ask you my first and main question. These are not abstract notions. Do you want to retarget them against the United States, or Russia, or France? There is no such thing as abstract coding. The missiles are presently targeted against the United States. [Zholdak] Yes. [Kravchuk] However, the button is in Russia. Do you understand? [Zholdak] Yes. [Kravchuk] This means that, today, I, as president, have nuclear weapons, but I do not control them. [Zholdak] We have them as a dangerous tenant? [Kravchuk] For me, they only constitute danger. I know that the button is "there." That is why I am saying: Why don't we deactivate these weapons, and demand compensation for them, and give them away? We will never use them. Everybody must realize this. [Zholdak] At the same time, Mrs. Thatcher said that this is protection and that this is deterrence against attacks. [Kravchuk] In what way? [Zholdak] If we have these formidable weapons, we will not be attacked. [Kravchuk] But I told her. Suppose, you have a stick. [Zholdak] Yes. [Kravchuk] A cue. It is yours. At present, a person who sits there in the reception room holds it. Tell me, will you be able to use it? [Zholdak] No. [Kravchuk] Then why prattle, excuse me for the word? I have missiles that I cannot use. [Zholdak] What can we do to make them usable for us? [Kravchuk] It is un-re-a-lis-tic! [hyphens as published]. [Zholdak] That is why you did not want the Supreme Council's decision not [as published] to specify 36 and 42 percent of the initial reduction of nuclear weapons? [Kravchuk] This is all nonsense, because when the service life of the warheads expires, we will transfer them irrespective of decrees or edicts. Nobody will allow a tragedy to happen. When I gathered all scientists that could be found in this sphere and we discussed this question twice at the Security Council, the scientists proved in detail that it is the manufacturer alone who can change anything. We in Ukraine do not manufacture the warheads. Russia does. The manufacturing plant installs a code and nobody else in the world knows it. [Zholdak] I see. [Kravchuk] We can remove the warhead and put it aside "for storage." [Zholdak] And launch.... [Kravchuk] Never. A missile may be launched, but there will be no nuclear explosion. Because this is encoded and the codes are in Moscow. Well, this is common knowledge. Moreover, every part has its own service life. The fact that the Supreme Council did not ratify.... I reiterate, suppose that tomorrow the period of safe physical life of a missile expires.... They may refuse to ratify, I do not care. I will remove these warheads! I am making this statement through UKRAYINSKA HAZETA. Because, tomorrow, it may be too late and, tomorrow, something irreparable may happen. It will not be your responsibility and not the responsibility of the Supreme Council as a legislative organ, but of the president who allowed this to happen. [Zholdak] You have made very strong statements, Leonid Makarovych.... I am already inclined to believe that this is what should be done.... [Kravchuk] I am telling you how things really are. By comparison with what may happen in connection with the nuclear weapons, Chernobyl was child's play. I do not want to intimidate anybody. We have 176 missiles, and every warhead is such a terrible force that is hard to imagine. [Zholdak] As you are saying, one of them may explode on its own if its "death" comes? [Kravchuk] Well, we will not allow this to happen, because we will ensure technological supervision. However, there are time limits beyond which the warheads acquire a difficult state. Then I will turn to Russia: "Take them away!" To this, specialists may say: "We will not go there. It is already dangerous." That's it! Do anything you want with them. Then you will give them away and beg to have them taken, but they will not be taken. [Zholdak] I see. [Kravchuk) These are such complicated things, and should not be resolved through emotions or in an unprofessional manner. One can declare with pride: "We have nuclear weapons, and we are strong!" Those who say so realize that, today, Ukraine cannot use its nuclear weapons. [Zholdak] It appears then that it is pointless to hope that we may leave at least one missile to intimidate somebody? [Kravchuk] Absolutely! There is, however, one thing, if we approach this problem realistically. We can see how we can use the launchers for peaceful purposes. I reiterate that nuclear weapons cannot be used by our country. We are driving ourselves into a deadlock. Why? I will tell you. Every nuclear state manufactures its own nuclear weapons. [Zholdak] We cannot manufacture them on our own? [Kravchuk] No, we cannot, because we do not have a nuclear industry. In order to create a nuclear industry, we need many years and tens of billions of karbovantsi. [Zholdak] In order to manufacture them and to build a plant? [Kravchuk] A plant. [Zholdak] Tens of billions.... This.... This is, so far, unrealistic for us.... [Kravchuk] This may be achieved in 15 years. [Zholdak] We will have this much money? [Kravchuk] No, if this question arises and the entire economy is aimed at this, as well as the resources and the people's efforts.... And if there is also money, then we could handle this.... The enrichment of uranium.... Control.... In that case, the state does everything on its own. Nobody sells nuclear weapons to anybody. It is not a rifle. A state that proclaims itself as nuclear, must have the entire nuclear cycle. By its decree, the Supreme Council has, in fact, proclaimed Ukraine's nuclear status. On what grounds? We are not a nuclear power. We only have the nuclear weapons that we have inherited. The world and Yeltsin are saying: Once you have proclaimed yourselves as a nuclear power, take upon yourselves all the relevant responsibilities. Can you service your nuclear weapons? No. Can you create them? No. Do you have technological provision or spare parts? No. What do you want then? What can I say to that? Nothing. [Zholdak] Is this what Yeltsin wrote to you? [Kravchuk] Not in these words, but this is the meaning. Another thing. He wrote about the consequences of all of this for Russia. If you are a nuclear power, then why should we service your nuclear complexes? You must do that on your own. What do we need all those intricacies for? You have not joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, whereas Russia has. By helping you, we will be in violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. For my part, I am telling him: We want compensation. For us, this is the main issue. So that there is no recurrence of our transferring our weapons for free. After all, it is the people's work. Both tactical and strategic weapons cost something. Let us resolve these issues: One -- compensation, and the other -- security for our statehood.... [Zholdak] They will agree and then deceive us. [Kravchuk] Well, if we proceed from this, then not a single document can be signed. This is not serious. The third condition is financial and technological assistance. Three aspects. Shall we resolve them? Then we will proceed further, and the Supreme Council will return to this question. I am sure of it. [Zholdak] Did you say that to him? [Kravchuk) To him and to Clinton. [Zholdak] You have already answered his [Yeltsin's] letter? [Kravchuk] Of course. I wrote and also said this in a conversation. [Zholdak] What kind of letter was that of Yeltsin's? Benevolent? Without any ultimatums? [Kravchuk] There were no ultimatums. He reasons what and how could be done. That he is concerned. That the world may look upon Ukraine as a state that may be blamed for halting nuclear disarmament. You know what they say and write abroad: You have not joined the treaty, you have, in fact, failed to ratify the treaty, and, therefore, you stand in the way of total nuclear disarmament. START I is followed by START II. If historians start analyzing, believe me, we will be accused of causing political and military tension on our planet. You will not be able to prove anything to hi-sto-ry. [Zholdak] It is, however, suspicious that America is so keen on our disarmament. It does not disarm itself and, while being, perhaps, the strongest nuclear power, it puts pressure upon us not to allow us to be a nuclear power. Even though we are now economically weak, our military armor and guns are powerful. That is why they [the Americans] are preoccupied with us like big dogs with a nice little cat. The cat has sharp claws. If these claws are cut off, we will do what they want us to do or else we will be punished. We also want to be a strong state. We deserve it. [Kravchuk] There is also much I would like to have. However, we must think soberly. The missiles deployed in Ukraine are targeted against America. [Zholdak] That is so. [Kravchuk] They know that the button is in Moscow. There is economic chaos both here and there. There is also political chaos. The Americans fear that this chaos may be dangerous for the world and for peace. It may occur to somebody.... When there is stability, order, discipline, and scientific supervision, it is a different matter. They are afraid. I understand them. I told Clinton that we are ready to deactivate our warheads and leave them in Ukraine. Not to transfer, but to store them here. [Zholdak] Will they be safer then? [Kravchuk] To begin with, safer, and I will know that the button will not be used by somebody somewhere to launch these missiles from the territory of Ukraine. I am responsible before the world. These are ideas and assumptions. We will do everything to prevent this from ever happening, but we must take into account other countries' fears. [Zholdak] This is not bad. We can arrive at such a decision: Either you or the Supreme Council? [Kravchuk] Yes, we can! However, we want some steps to be made toward us. We want other countries to trust us, and I will do everything I can to achieve this trust and get some normal assistance without humiliating conditions, an economic assistance and normal attitude not only because we possess nuclear weapons. We must see to it that Ukraine is looked upon as a country with high culture, science, and a large economic potential, which may be put into effect. To make first steps. We will make them, too. We will start working in a civilized manner and with respect for one another. [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, they [the Americans] do not really want to help us. They promise us $175 million. According to estimates made by specialists, up to 2 billion is necessary for disarmament. Nobody will give us that much money. Our state treasury is empty. What difference will it make if the Supreme Council does adopt a decision, which you, Yeltsin, Clinton, and the whole world expect? [Kravchuk] After adopting such a decision, we could raise the question of money. We want it like in [Ilf and Petrov's] "Twelve Chairs" [on a blue-bordered plate -- without any effort on our part]. I already said this at the Supreme Council session: If chairs are handed over in the morning, then money must be paid [the previous] evening, or, if the chairs are handed over in the evening, then money is received [the previous] morning, but money first. [Zholdak] Did you speak to Clinton here, from your office? [Kravchuk] This is the telephone through which I spoke to Clinton. [Zholdak] How did he talk to you? Politely or as a dictator? [Editorial note] To be continued in the next issue.
