But the meeting was closed for a different reason--the government was beginning to prepare for the "economic" meeting with Boris Yeltsin. According to the authorized representative of the prime minister, Valentin Sergeyev, at the meeting reports were heard from several ministers on progress in fulfilling the government's March decree. This document is essentially the Chernomyrdin cabinet's program of action. As was expected, the ministries in fact failed to fulfill the decree and the premier expressed "dissatisfaction" with his subordinates' work. His discontent is even more justified since the top government officials are to meet with Boris Yeltsin in the near future. At that time the government is supposed to present its plan of action for the future. In a talk with the KOMMERSANT correspondent, the leader of the analytical group under the president, Aleksandr Livshits, noted: "The government holds meetings and discusses some matters, but the main thing is still lacking--reforms." He promised to "complain" about the government to the president. Thus, from Chernomyrdin's viewpoint, examining the concept of post-voucher privatization becomes crucial--some of the president's complaints regarding the lack of an overall concept in the work of the executive branch of power can be eliminated in that way. The concept of the second stage of privatization prepared by Goskomimushchestvo [State Property Committee--GKI] specialists illustrates that the ideologues of denationalization are prepared not only to promote but even to defend the new priorities related above all to creating conditions needed to adapt to the market during an enterprise's privatization. Basic attention will now be devoted to selling large blocks of stock to those investors who are prepared to invest the most capital as soon as possible. Small investors will acquire stock at specialized auctions. All this differs fundamentally from the idea of voucher privatization, the essence of which is achieving social accord while implementing destatization ["razgosudarstvleniye"] of enterprises by using checks as the main means of payment and granting preferences to the employees of the enterprises. But now GKI specialists acknowledge that voucher privatization has exhausted its social role (of the 20,000 medium-sized and large enterprises subject to privatization, 80 percent have been made joint stock companies, and about 40 million citizens have become owners). The nature of the privatization procedures must also take into account the nonpayment crisis and the drop in production--standardized methods are unacceptable here. And the new concept is based on liberalizing those methods and individualizing the approach to each enterprise (bankrupt enterprises in particular), as well as extensively enlisting local authorities and interested ministries in the privatization process. This obviously gives a chance that not just the government will approve of the new concept. At the same time, however, the change in the tactics of privatization gives the GKI ideologues reason to expect that this process will remain under their department's control. [First Box] Basic Economic Indicators in the First Quarter --volume of industrial production declined by 23 percent as compared to the average 1993 value --inflation level--36 percent [Second Box] Basic Mechanisms of Privatization in the Post-Check Stage --specially organized sale at investment competitions of blocks of stock owned by the government --preferential sale of enterprises to large strategic investors (as a rule blocks of stock which make up more than 51 percent of the capital stock) at auction or at an investment competition --sale of at least 30 percent of the stock of any joint stock company to investors --post-privatization support of enterprises Criteria for Providing State Support --more than 90 percent of the enterprise's stock is privately owned --corporate management requirements are fulfilled --no restrictions on buying and selling the stock of this enterprise --existence of an independent registrar that keeps the register of this enterprise's stockholders.
