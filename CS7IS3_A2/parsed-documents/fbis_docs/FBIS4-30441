Not just those printed in the West, even the Thai newspapers have spread so much divisive news to sow dissension among Cambodians without even an iota of truth. For example, they have claimed that Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut and His Excellency Sam Rangsi would resign their government portfolios if the Khmer Rouge were declared outlaws. Are the Khmer Rouge related in any way to His Highness Norodom Sirivut and His Excellency Sam Rangsi? Are they their fathers-in-law or what? Although they have published such a blatant falsehood, no buck-toothed people dare accuse them of day-dreaming. Maybe these buck-toothed guys are too buck-toothed to do something normal persons would do.
