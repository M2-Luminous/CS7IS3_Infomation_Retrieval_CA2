The effectiveness of Subpart I is presently stayed for commercial nuclear power reactors. The previous stay of Subpart I for NRC and Agreement State licensees other than nuclear power reactors expired on November 15, 1992, and has not been extended or renewed. All NRC and Agreement State licensees other than nuclear power reactors, as well as federal facilities not operated by DOE, are now subject to all applicable provisions of subpart I. Each affected facility must demonstrate compliance for calendar year 1993 with the annual emission standard set forth in 40 CFR 61.102, utilizing the procedures specified in 40 CFR 61.103. Those facilities which are not exempt from reporting requirements under 40 CFR 61.104(b) must submit the annual report concerning emissions for calendar year 1993 required by 40 CFR 61.104(a) to EPA by March 31, 1994. Facilities that are unable to gather the necessary information and report to EPA by March 31, 1994 should request an extension from the appropriate EPA regional office. EPA will consider extensions of up to 60 days.
