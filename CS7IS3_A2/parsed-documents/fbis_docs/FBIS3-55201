Representatives of a number of opposition movements -- the "Russian National Union," the "National Salvation Front," and "Working Moscow" -- have stated their intention to hold mass protest actions 9, 11, and 12 January "against the 21 September-4 October coup d'etat" and also to show their negative attitude toward the start of the new parliament's work. Your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent was told at the Moscow city hall state and law administration that whether the demonstrations will take place will be decided 5 January at 1200 hours at a meeting between the city's executive power and the opposition leaders. Will these politicians not turn the 1994 Christmas holidays into a 1905 "bloody Sunday?"
