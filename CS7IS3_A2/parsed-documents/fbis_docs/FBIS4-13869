The people will not accept living under this law when terrorism is over. This law is dubious and of ill-repute, and the people dub it martial law. The prime minister's statement urges people to increase their resistance to terrorism, because the country does not need more problems and the people do not want their movements restricted for three years. Why three years? Does this mean the government expects terrorism to continue for three more years? Egypt is the first country to have an emergency law in force for 13 years. Other countries have declared states of emergency for one month. Emergency laws have neither curbed nor prevented terrorism. Terrorism has been on the rise. People have started to forget what normal life is like, the days when they were never tried before military courts or state security courts and when the government never detained anyone for more than three days. I always believed that freedom, not the emergency law, could eliminate terrorism. I recall that all the assassinations in Egypt took place under martial law and the emergency law. True, people are aware of the prevailing serious situation, but at the same time the people believe they can eliminate terrorism while they enjoy freedom and a normal life free from oppression and despotism. Other countries have been seen more terrorist operations than our country. Britain, for example, has not declared emergency law although bombs explode in London daily. Germany has not passed an emergency law despite the daily demonstrations and the burning of foreigners' houses. The government claims that it will not repress writers or opinions. At the same time, however, we see many journalists being tried before the criminal court and other journalists being persecuted at dawn, which is reminiscent of the sixties. The prime minister has, however, assured us that the emergency law is temporary, not permanent. This would be a consolation if true. Let us remember that emergency law was never declared for even a day in the United States when President Kennedy was assassinated.
