This will involve the discussion of material in individual tax returns made confidential by the provisions of section 6103 of Title 26 of the United States Code. A determination as required by section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act has been made that this meeting is concerned with matters listed in section 552b(c) (3), (4), (6), and (7) of Title 5 of the United States Code, and that the meeting will not be open to the public. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has determined that this document is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866 and that a regulatory impact analysis therefore is not required. Neither does this document constitute a rule subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. Chapter 6). Margaret Milner Richardson, Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
