ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule replaces the Interim Rule dated April 26, 1991, and implements the provisions of section 6 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). Most recently, the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 provides alternate methods for disclosure of mortgage servicing history. Section 6 also sets forth procedures regarding the transfer of mortgage servicing for any federally related mortgage loan, as defined in section 3 of RESPA and the definition is refined in the implementing regulation for RESPA and 24 CFR 3500.2. Although RESPA was extended by section 908 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 to subordinate liens, in this rule the Secretary has exempted from RESPA's mortgage servicing coverage all federally related mortgage loans that are not secured by a first lien. In addition, the Department has adopted conforming amendments to 24 CFR part 203, the FHA Single Family Mortgage Insurance program. The Department is also publishing a conforming amendment to its final rule on escrow accounting procedures, published on October 26, 1994 (59 FR 53890). This amendment will update a cross-reference in another section of part 3500 that references enforcement of escrow accounting provisions. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 19, 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act Statement The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)), and assigned OMB control number 2502&hyph;0458. Justification for Final Rulemaking_Part 203 In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from that general rule where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1) The Department finds that good cause exists to publish for effect without first soliciting public comment the sections of this rule that pertain to 24 CFR part 203, and that prior public procedure is unnecessary because those portions of this rule merely conform part 203 to the provisions of Section 6 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2605) that have been developed through notice and comment rulemaking.
