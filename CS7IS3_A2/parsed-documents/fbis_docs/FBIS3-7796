He described it is a sign of resoluteness by the international community to oppose Serb aggression and Russian interference in the Balkans. We completely agree with international factors, the United States, the EU, and NATO showing greater resolve in suppressing aggression. We interpret this as a signal that the international community will continue to take resolute steps to end the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and create preconditions for peace, the Croatian president said. In reply to Albanian journalists' questions, the Croatian president said NATO's latest move also demonstrated the resoluteness of the world's greatest super-power, the United States, to oppose Russian interference in the Balkans. As I have already said, I see this as a display of the resolve of the main European countries and the biggest world super-power, the United States, to oppose the Serb aggression, and, I would also say, Russian interference in the Balkans, Tudjman replied.
