In accordance with these procedures, oral or written statements may be presented by members of the public, electric recordings will be permitted only during the open portions of the meeting, and questions may be asked only by members of the Committee, its consultants, and staff. Persons desiring to make oral statements should notify the ACRS Executive Director, Dr. John T.

Use of still, motion picture, and television cameras during this meeting may be limited to selected portions of the meeting as determined by the Chairman. Information regarding the time to be set aside for this purpose may be obtained by contacting the ACRS Executive Director prior to the meeting. In view of the possibility that the schedule of ACRS meetings may be adjusted by the Chairman as necessary to facilitate the conduct of the meeting, persons planning to attend should check with the ACRS Executive Director if such rescheduling would result in major inconvenience. I have determined in accordance with Subsection 10(d) P.L. 92&hyph;463 that it is necessary to close portions of this meeting noted above to discuss proprietary information provided in confidence by a foreign source per 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(4) and 10 CFR 2.790(d)(2); information that involves the internal personnel rules and practices of this Advisory Committee per 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(2); and to discuss information the release of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy per 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(6).
