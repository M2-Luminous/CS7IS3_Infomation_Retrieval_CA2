At the outset of the meeting, Brother Dr. Qasim Sallam, secretary of the Yemen Regional Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, acting on his own behalf and on behalf of Yemeni party leaders, welcomed Brother Lakhdar Brahimi as a representative of international legitimacy, which our country and government welcome. He said: Undoubtedly, events in our country are of interest to the entire world because the Yemeni people now find themselves in a difficult situation brought about by a small group that rebelled against constitutional legitimacy and the Yemeni people's will, as well as the will of history. On his part, Brother Lakhdar Brahimi said he hopes the Republic of Yemen will be able to overcome the current state. He noted the importance of dialogue to establish peace. The brother party leaders spoke during the meeting, stressing that Yemeni unity is the Yemeni people's fate and future. They will not relinquish it because it was a great achievement of our people on 22 May 1990, following a long struggle by the Yemeni people through the various stages of the Yemeni national movement. They kept that dream, which lived in the mind of the people for scores of years, until they achieved it by the establishment of the Yemeni Republic on 22 May 1990, the Yemeni people's plebiscite on the Constitution, and the general elections on 27 April 1993 within the context of political and party pluralism. The party leaders noted that what is going on in Yemen is not a war between the north and south as portrayed by hostile media, but, rather, a war between the Yemeni people and the secessionist clique in the Socialist Party that rebelled against legitimacy and the constitutional institutions, fabricated the political crisis, and imposed a war on the people. The brother party leaders then engaged in a lengthy discussion on the situations in our country and their dimensions.
