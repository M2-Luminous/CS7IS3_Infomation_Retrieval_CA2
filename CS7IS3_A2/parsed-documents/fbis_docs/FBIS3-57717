Well-known Russian business executive and entrepeneur and parliament member Aleksandr Titkin is sure that Belarus's foreign economic policy will remain unchanged as long as the republic's government is headed by common-sensed Vyacheslav Kebich. Although Titkin could not foresee what would happen if Kebich were to be forced out of his job, he hopes that common sense will carry the day in the Belarusian government. Titkin said Belarus is less subject to nationalist passions than many of its neighbors. Titkin expressed the opinion that the merging of the Belarusian and Russian economies should be carried out carefully, without haste, in order to shield the Russian economy from additional problems. In particular, he said it is essential for Russia to avoid handing out hidden subsidies to its western neighbor, and to avoid pressure from the "Belarusian" roubles on the internal Russian market (in case the two states' monetary systems are merged). "I even think it would be better if the Belarusian "rabbit" notes remained in circulation for the initial stage, until we come to complete agreement on tax, pricing, and tariff policy", Titkin announced. 45-year old Titkin was head of a financial investment company, Russian investment technologies, until the December 12 elections. As deputy in the federation council, he has begun to work on the finances committee, which is responsible for the budget, financial, currency, credit and tax policy, monetary emission, and customs regulations.
