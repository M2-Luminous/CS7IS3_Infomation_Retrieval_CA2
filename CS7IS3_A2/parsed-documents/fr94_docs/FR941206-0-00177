FR941206-0-00177 FR941206-0-00019 k = Slope of the linear regression line. P bar = Atmospheric pressure at analysis conditions, mm Hg (in. Hg). P* = Organic vapor pressure in the sample, kPa (psi). = 1.333 X 10 ^7 kPa/[(mm Hg)(ppm)], (4.91 X 10 ^7 psi/[(in. Hg)(ppm)]) 7.2␣Linearity. Use the following equation to calculate the measured standard concentration for each standard vial. C m = k A + b␣␣Eq. 25E&hyph;1 7.2.1␣Calculate the average measured standard concentration (C ma ) for each set of triplicate standards and use the following equation to calculate the percent difference (PD) between C ma and C s . E:GRAPHICSER06DE94.001 The instrument linearity is acceptable if the percent difference is within five for each standard. 7.3␣Relative Standard Deviation (RSD). Use the following equation to calculate the RSD for each triplicate set of standards. E:GRAPHICSER06DE94.002 The calibration is acceptable if the RSD is within five for each standard concentration. 7.4␣Concentration of organics in the headspace. Use the following equation to calculate the concentration of vapor phase organics in each sample. C a = k A + b␣␣Eq. 25E&hyph;4 7.5␣Vapor Pressure of Organics in the Headspace Sample. Use the following equation to calculate the vapor pressure of organics in the sample. P* = P bar C a ␣␣Eq. 25E&hyph;5 * * * * * PART 260_HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM: GENERAL 5.
