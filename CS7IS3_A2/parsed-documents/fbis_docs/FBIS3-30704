The daily denies the statistics which inspired representatives of Slovakia's ethnic Hungarians to call for establishing their own regions, which REPUBLIKA calls "Bantustans," at their meeting in Komarno, South Slovakia, on January 8. The daily challenges the Komarno meeting's statement that 600,000 people with Hungarian as their mother tongue are living in Slovakia. "only 556,447 citizens (10.5 percent of the country's inhabitants) claimed Hungarian as their mother tongue during the last census in 1991," REPUBLIKA states. It also casts doubt on the statement that the 522 Slovakia's towns and villages where Hungarians form a majority are located in a belt along Slovakia's southern border, and that this territory is inhabited by 98 percent of all the country's ethnic Hungarians, who make up a 70-percent majority here. There are such towns on the territory as Levice, Lucenec, Sala, Roznava and others, where only 10 to 31 percent are ethnic Hungarians, the daily stresses. The figure of 98 percent is controversial as well because in Bratislava and Kosice alone, which are not lying in the mentioned belt, there live 5.48 percent of all Slovakia's ethnic Hungarians, it adds. It criticises the "demagogic distortion of facts" the arrogance and chauvinist feelings of superiority of the protagonists of the ethnic Hungarian Egyutteles movement, which, however, cannot be blamed on all Slovakia's ethnic Hungarians. "But the "Henleinisation" of the situation of Slovakia's Hungarian ethnic minority cannot be ignored," REPUBLIKA says. Hungarian politicians are "calling for democracy but continue in perceiving, thinking and acting like their Greater Hungarian predecessors, members of the `dominating' nation, the `dominating moral' of which allows the chauvinist supra-people to do everything, including establishing Bantustans in the centre of Europe," the daily states.
