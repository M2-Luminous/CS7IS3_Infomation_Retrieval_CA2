A leading official of the provincial commodity inspection bureau said that the regulations are intended to protect the legitimate rights and interests of both Chinese and overseas investors, and meet the needs of opening Fujian wider to the outside world and deepening the reforms. He said that, in accordance with the regulations, his bureau and its subsidiaries are in charge of evaluating assets of foreign investment, primarily machinery and equipment. Meanwhile, the provincial departments of foreign trade and economic cooperation, planning, finance, industry and commerce, and taxation will assist the provincial commodity inspectors in evaluating such assets, he added. In accordance with the regulations, a contract on the establishment of an overseas-funded enterprise must contain an article stating that imported assets of foreign investment are subject to evaluation by the provincial commodity inspection bureau and other government departments. The authorities will not approve the establishment of any overseas-funded enterprise if its contract does not contain such an article, the official said. He explained that in recent years more overseas companies have put machinery and equipment as investment in co-production projects with Chinese firms. Machinery and equipment currently account for at least 90 percent of investment by overseas partners in overseas-funded companies in Fujian, he said. He criticized some overseas business people for resorting to fraud in this regard.
