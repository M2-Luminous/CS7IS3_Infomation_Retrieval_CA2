He pointed out that the results in domestic and foreign borrowing, budget deficits, the foreign trade balance, and inflation are in line with the targets of the program. In a statement he issued today, Dogan said that the tax revenues and domestic borrowing levels in April were in line with the program and that public expenditures were kept within the limits of the program. There was no delay in the repayment of foreign debts or of their interest, he said, adding that the positive results of the efforts to collect public revenues were observed in April. Dogan stressed that the restriction of public expenditures will continue vigorously, as envisaged by the 5 April decisions. He pointed out that the monthly average of the January-February-March public deficit was 17.3 trillion Turkish lira [TL], while in April this figure dropped to TL5.2 trillion. The consolidated budget deficit for April-May-June has been estimated at TL10 trillion, he said, and this target will be reached if the balance in the planned budget revenues and expenditures is maintained in May. Aykon Dogan pointed out that the IMF's complete approval of the program was an important development. This has created resources of up to $600 million in 1994, he said, as well as World Bank project loans of up to $1.2 billion. Furthermore, he added, this creates the possibility of private foreign credit channels. The state minister explained that as a result of the measures and of the realistic foreign exchange rate policy, imports became expensive and exports attractive. The exporters now work on the basis of insured guarantees, which is a modern practice, he said. Dogan announced that exports in April rose to $1.4 billion while imports dropped to $2.1 billion. He added: In April, the ratio of exports to imports rose to 65 percent. Dogan further said that a drop in the monthly rate of inflation will be observed in May. He said that an increase of less than 10 percent is expected both in the consumer price index and in the wholesale price index. This is an important sign of a healthy economy, he said. Dogan said: Obviously, the program is difficult and calls for sacrifice. However, the sacrifice is being made by all sectors of the community. He pointed out if implemented without concessions, the program will reduce the dimensions of the sacrifice in the coming months. Then the economy will surely recover and develop, he stressed.
