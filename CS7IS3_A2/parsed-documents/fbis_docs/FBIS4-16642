Shevardnadze in Moscow "prior to his departure for Tbilisi": "Shevardnadze Believes that It Is Impossible to Revive the Empire"] [Text] Verbal political creativity as a result of a shortage of information indubitably promotes meetings behind closed doors. Behind the scenes at the Moscow CIS summit, the fireworks of political neologisms have been blazing. Unsuccessful attempts to bring together the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia for the long-awaited direct dialogue, the loud echoes of the "Odessa incident" in the poorly veiled squabble between the Russian and Ukrainian ministers of defense, and certain leaders' clear dissatisfaction with the Russian-Belorussian [Belarusian] agreement, which became an accomplished fact without their knowledge, provided grounds for one high-ranking figure to put into circulation a new name for the CIS -- "the enmity of independent states." He did not get any applause, however. According to sources close to the delegations of the Commonwealth states, the atmosphere at the Moscow meeting differed in many ways from the previous ones -- for the better. Everything went without a hitch, they reported, if you did not count several critical utterances about some of the proposed documents. But looking at the content side of the meeting -- and this is naturally the main side -- then, according to common opinion, the CIS has made a significant step toward becoming a Commonwealth of Independent States in reality. "Is this true?" I asked Georgian head of state E. Shevardnadze before he flew back to Tbilisi. "Our meeting in Moscow," he answered, "has undoubtedly revealed an increasingly deepening trend toward the formation of new integrational ties between the independent states within the framework of the Commonwealth, accompanied by strict consideration of and respect for their national and state interests. In this context, I would mention the entire package of economic documents and the Declaration on the Observance of Sovereignty, Territorial Integrity, and the Inviolability of the Borders of the Commonwealth States." "In the prevailing historical circumstances," E. Shevardnadze stressed, "the CIS is a necessity. Its flag is in no way reminiscent of the state symbols of the Soviet Union, nor is the Council of Heads of State reminiscent of the Politburo, or, as the Russian president expressed himself, some kind of enterprise board with an all-powerful, harsh director in charge. It must be borne in mind that we adopt all decisions by consensus, without any kind of pressure. As for contradictions, then these have appeared in the past and they will appear in the future. The main thing is what methods will be used to resolve them. According to my observations, Yeltsin does not use them to confirm Russia in the role of that 'director.' And to speak of any revival of the empire in the current conditions is simply frivolous. "The main problem of the Commonwealth and its present and future," the Georgian leader believes, "is its present unpredictability, which in many respects stems from the political instability in a number of Commonwealth countries, not least in Russia, and also from persistent conflicts and friction in interstate relations. Analogies with the European Union end here: Its participants have also voluntarily given up part of their sovereignty. A powerful strengthening force is in operation in the European Union -- trust. The quicker this component is implanted in our procedures, the higher the international authority and prestige of the Commonwealth will be. "The leaders of the states have agreed that the CIS should strive for international recognition, and this, apart from the appropriate status, also means respect for the Commonwealth as a real factor of peace and security. The CIS will only survive as an internationally recognized organization guided in its activity by modern norms of interstate relations."
