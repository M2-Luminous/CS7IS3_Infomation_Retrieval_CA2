In a statement to MENA today, Sha'th said the Davos document is considered to be an integrated deal, stressing that the Palestinian party will not commit itself to implementing its obligations in the document unless the Israelis implement the articles relating to them. Dr. Sha'th pointed out that the Palestinian-Israeli meetings were scheduled to continue in Cairo after the 'Arafat-Peres meeting in Davos but the Israeli party suspended them until after 'Arafat and Peres meet in Cairo. He noted that the Palestinian-Israeli committee meetings are expected to resume in Cairo directly after the 'Arafat-Peres meeting in Cairo. Dr. Sha'th highlighted that the Palestinian party can perform its tasks in running the self-rule administration in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area immediately after the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. MENA has learned that differences occurred between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres over the Davos document. Palestinian sources told MENA that the main dispute within the Israeli leadership focuses mainly on who should take the credit for achieving tangible results and reaching an agreement with the Palestinian party.
