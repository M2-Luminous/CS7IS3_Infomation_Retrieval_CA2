A day of reprieve. Lambese experiences an extraordinary morning. Or rather, it would be an extraordinary day. An extraordinary morning for those who will be with their loved ones on the day of Aid El-Fitr. They are pleased even if they are not happy. An extraordinary day for the others. For the prison guards. For the director of the Lambese prison. For the people of the "village" of Tazoult. For everyone. Except the dead: one guard dead, three wounded, another about whom there is no word. Regarding the attackers, no one can come up with a figure for dead and wounded. Extraordinary too because the main gate of the most famous and feared prison in Algeria will once again close behind behind the approximately 50 pardoned prisoners only to be reopened with fire and blood a few hours later thanks to the help from accomplices. Five Accomplices? Presumably the escape plan was based--at a minimum--on five prison guard accomplices. Who are they? They were guards who had recently been transferred. Three came from Barika. Two of them were reported to be closely linked to the main organizer of the breakout from the Barika prison. They were reported to have asked to be transferred before it happened. At the time of the attack, according to testimony given and statements made, the five accomplices were situated as follows. The first--who was not on duty at the time of the events and was supposed to be in the dining hall to break the fast--went to main gate No. 1 to kill his colleague in order to take the keys away from him and open the gate. Two others--on duty--were several meters above, i.e., at main gate No. 2, which provides access to the detention areas. One was beside this gate, the other on the enclosure wall was talking and perhaps waiting for the signal. Last, two others were on duty in the corridor leading directly to the cells of prisoners sentenced to die, the cell blocks, and the common rooms. The possibility cannot be excluded that there were even more accomplices because certain guards--who were on leave or on duty--have not returned to their posts. A sixth--who was at the observation post to the right of the main gate-- was kidnapped or taken hostage. He put up courageous resistance until he had no more ammunition. What was the attackers' main objective? It would seem that the objective was--mainly--freeing the death row inmates who were transported by truck and vehicle. Next the other prisoners who had been sentenced by the special courts and those common criminals were sent in the direction of the moutains--a road different from the one taken by the death row inmates. Some of the escapees did not even see these vehicles. That is to say that special treatment had been anticipated for the death row inmates. Tracer bullets were fired at the time of the attack and at the end of the breakout to allow the armed groups that had taken over Tazoult's streets to regroup. There were also tracer bullets, several local residents emphasized, at the time the police arrived and at whom one group of attackers fired several kilometers away from the prison. Let us remind our readers that security forces were prevented from intervening by vehicles (with their tires blown out) placed in two different locations located on two arteries leading to the prison. These were private passenger cars, one bulldozer, and triangular nails. One reeducation guard stated: "One member of my family was accompanying me to the prison where I was supposed to go on duty. I was dressed in civilian clothes. As we were driving there, we were stopped by a false roadblock. Some armed men made us get out. They put the car in the middle of the road after blowing out its tires. I do not know if I would be alive if they had asked to see my identification papers. They sent us away... I was supposed to go to work. I took a path through the fields. As I was walking, I saw about 50 armed men talking... This was before the call to prayer. They were at the valley. They didn't say anything to me... Yes, the vehicle was recovered by the member of my family." On the side of Tazoult that local residents reached in vehicles, it was the same story except that the vehicles were used to transport the prison escapees in the direction of the edge of the forest. Drivers did not hand them over willingly. "There was a gun to my head," one of them said. Some are reported to have found a thank-you note at the end of the operation for "assistance rendered" to the attackers! How was the most spectacular attack and breakout in our country organized? Was there passivity? Negligence? The commission of inquiry will certainly reveal this. But "when you smell a rat," as the popular saying goes, nothing is impossible. How did the prison guards react? Let us say only that the law prohibits them from taking action outside the prison. Let us also say that inside the prison, they are really and truly...unarmed. Some time ago certain foreign voices thought that Algerian prisons were places of torture and extortion. And to think that the guards are not even armed! What is more: the guards who have to ensure security on the enclosure wall and warn of any revolt had...10 bullets each. Was this negligence? Sloppiness? Complicity? Not at all. "A quantity of munitions only to maintain order," we were told. "Events" that have taken place in the prisons of other countries have left hundreds of fatalities. Even though they are not attacks! At Lambese, there were no reports of wounded or dead among the prisoners. There is no end of questions. It is hard to answer. Except if you opt for suppositions. Still, a trustworthy source from outside the prison who asked to remain anonymous stated the following, among other things: "Information circulated that the strike would happen a year ago. Fortunately the prison administration changed certain members of the staff who were suspect. District police and the gendarmerie brigade were looked at. The prison, too. We learned that the movement began in the cells and ended outside, contrary to what has been said, namely that the gate was opened. That is not true. It might be that there was a signal from the prison, you can see the mountains.... There are signs...some very serious negligence. There was passivity involved, not to mention complicity..." What was happening outside before, during, and after the breakout? Armed men had encircled Tazoult, which was completely under their control. One prison guard reported as follows: "These were strangers. With guns in their hands, they ordered us not to move. People everywhere were taken by surprise. They told us: `Stop,' 'Hands up,' `What's your profession?,' `On the ground,' `Crouch,' `Lie down flat, stomach down.' We stayed that way about two hours. None of us could say a single word. `We're brothers, Mujahadeen,' `Pray for us' they said to old women who were going to the mosque. People didn't understand a thing. It was a surprise. There were rounds of shots a bit further away. Everywhere there was something odd. We hadn't understood anything about what they wanted." After a moment the guard went on as follows: "It was terrible. I cannot sleep any more... If one of them had searched me, he would have found my professional card, then shot. No one could say a word. We were crouched down, we had our hands up or we were lying on the ground... Ever since we have not eaten, we cannot sleep any more, we are anxious. The colonial enemy did not do this." During this time, "most of the troop" was in the vicinity of the prison. At exactly the same time the prison guards broke their fast. The door to the place where the Management entrance.
