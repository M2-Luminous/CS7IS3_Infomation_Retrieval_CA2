At the same time of course -- that is less expensive -- command and staff exercises will be taking place, and also joint training, and computer-simulated war and political games. I hope these measures, which are very significant -- I hope we will manage to implement these measures since they do not require as huge expenditures as in the case, for instance, of an exchange or participation in maneuvers abroad by an entire brigade or division -- that is out of the question for this year. The most urgent need for Europe -- and not just Europe -- is the issue of establishing efficient peacekeeping forces. Poland has had considerable experience in that regard; it has a well-prepared center for training troops for peacekeeping missions. Quite an intensive exchange is already going on in that area, and I think that direction should definitely be maintained, while taking advantage of experiences of, for instance, the Dutch, Great Britain, or other countries that are involved in such peacekeeping missions. But that is not the whole of the offer, and the path of getting closer to European structures and to NATO should also consist of many other types of measures. The biggest problem is introducing NATO's technical standards into our Army, with particular emphasis paid to communications as the Army's nerve -- that problem should be resolved as a priority. A few other problems should also be resolved immediately after that. There exists such a plan in the Army -- it has been prepared. But what we do not quite know, is how to finance these investments which -- there is no getting away from that -- are very expensive. [passage omitted] As for right now, I can see no alternative whatsoever. Simply put, the Partnership for Peace initiative constitutes a realistic way to build continental or even Euro-Atlantic security structures -- after all, NATO also includes the United States. Right now, there is the problem of to what extent and how willingly the other European countries will decide to get involved in the initiative, I mean in particular those countries not included in the Visegrad Group.
