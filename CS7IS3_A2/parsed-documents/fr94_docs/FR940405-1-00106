(b) IAQ Operation and Maintenance Program. The proposed standard requires maintenance and inspection of the building system components that directly affect IAQ. Specifically, the HVAC system should provide at least the outside air ventilation rate based on actual occupancy, building code, mechanical code or ventilation code and that carbon dioxide concentration does not exceed 800 parts per million. In approximately 500 indoor air quality investigations, NIOSH found that the primary cause of indoor air quality problems is inadequate ventilation (52 percent). Other actions required include: (1) Control of humidity in buildings with mechanical cooling systems, (2) implementing the use of general or local exhaust ventilation where maintenance and housekeeping activities involve use of equipment or products which emit air contaminants in other areas of the facility, (3) maintain mechanical equipment rooms and any non-ducted air plenums or chases in a clean condition. OSHA recognizes that not every building will have to make all recommended changes to improve operation and maintenance of the HVAC system. In the majority of the cases, some improvements can be accomplished by changing the setting on a control device or centralized control system. Depending on the condition of the HVAC equipment, inspection and maintenance may include simple housekeeping of equipment and air transport pathways and/or catastrophic failure maintenance to repair/replace failed equipment. Also, there may be cases where a number of buildings will require major changes in the HVAC system such as enlarging the size of the outside air intake.
