This is what FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic stated in Minsk today after meeting with Belaraus Foreign Minister Petr Kravchanka. Jovanovic also briefed the Belarus minister on our view of the Yugoslav crisis and how the situation is developing, especially in Bosnia. Kravchanka said it was of the utmost importance to establish peace, make efforts to end the conflict in Bosnia as quickly as possible, and abolish the sanctions against Yugoslavia. Both sides agreed that the sanctions are unjust and counterproductive. The Belarus minister stated that the visit by Vladislav Jovanovic will contribute to the development of bilateral relations. He voiced expectations that Belarus will soon pass a decision to establish diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia at the embassy level. Vladislav Jovanovic in this way ended a series of talks with Belarus officials. He previously held talks with Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich and the deputy president of the Supreme Soviet, Vladimir (Rusiakov). Both sides stressed the significance of this visit and its contribution to the development of cooperation between the two friendly nations now and especially after the abolition of sanctions against Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav minister visited Belarus at the invitation of the country's leadership. This fact also suggests a desire by both sides to promote cooperation. It is also worth mentioning that Belarus partners expressed support and solidarity with Yugoslavia, as well as their disapproval of the sanctions and their tightening and the international isolation of Yugoslavia.
