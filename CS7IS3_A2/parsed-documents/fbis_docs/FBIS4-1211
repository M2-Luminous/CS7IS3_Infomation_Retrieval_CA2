Among these errors is that which the commission drew to the attention of editors yesterday concerning the listing of the African Christian Democratic Party [ACDP] under the provincial list. In column one of page 7, due to a typographical error, the name of the ACDP was rendered as the Democratic Party, and its leading candidate in the Eastern Cape, Mr Brian Court, was listed above the party name, not below as it should have been. We reiterate our apology for this error. Additional anxiety was created for some voters because the list appeared to leave the National Party out of the national component of the list for the national assembly. This is not an error. The National Party chose to place all its candidates on regional lists, as it was permitted to do in terms of Schedule 2 to the Electoral Act, and this decision has no outcome on the apportionment of seats to that party. The National Party announced this decision at its federal congress earlier this year. It is therefore asked to convey the motivation for this decision to its supporters and others who might enquire. The commission points out that several parties asked for postponements for the submission of their lists, and that in many instances, parties were late in providing accurate information to the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] regarding the identification and eligibility of candidates. This required necessitated extensive re-checking by officials of the election administration directorate, further delaying the process of publication. The list that was presented for publication was thus compiled under extreme pressure of time, and within hours of the production deadlines that would enable the commission to provide the list to the electorate via publication in newspapers throughout the country. Had we delayed any longer, we might have risked not being able to provide lists before the election. The commission apologises for errors, asks both political parties and votes to consider the difficult circumstances under which errors happen, and wishes to make clear that these are not the responsibility of the newspapers. The newspapers themselves have performed an admirable task in printing the information provided to them under great pressure of time, and serving as carriers of the information to the electorate.
