The Japanese Government is refuting the IMF's estimate, arguing "The IMF has underestimated the effects generated by the package." Commenting on the IMF's estimate that the February package generated the effect of cutting Japan's current account surplus by only $2 billion, the Japanese Government is expressing discontent with the estimate made by the international monetary organization, asserting, "The package is supposed to have generated the effect of reducing Japan's current account surplus more than the IMF has estimated it has." The Finance Ministry is wary of the possibility that the United States will ask Japan to map out an additional package of measures to spur its economy. At the time of formulating the February package of economic stimulus measures, the Japanese Government announced that the package would cause Japan's GDP to increase by about 2.2 percent within one year. The IMF has estimated, however, that the February package generated only one-third of the desired effect for stimulating Japan's economy. The Economic Planning Agency [EPA], which was in charge of formulating the package, assumes that the IMF has probably underestimated the role of the income tax cut and financial investments and loans in stimulating Japan's economy. The Japanese Government has not made public how the package of economic stimulus measures has generated the effect of reducing Japan's current account surplus out of the fear that "the U.S. Government may use the effect as numerical targets." Commenting on the IMF's estimate that the February package generated the effect of reducing Japan's current account surplus by only $2 billion, the EPA argues, "The package generated the effect of expanding domestic demand to a greater degree than the IMF has estimated occurred." The EPA anticipates that the package will further reduce Japan's current account surplus. The IMF has estimated that Japan will achieve 0.7-percent real growth in 1994. A senior EPA official says: "In September 1993, the IMF announced that Japan would achieve 2.0-percent real growth in 1994. We cannot understand why the IMF has lowered its original prediction of 2.0-percent real growth for Japan by 1.3 percentage point despite the fact that personal spending has shown signs of recovering since late last year and Japan's economy is moving toward a recovery."
