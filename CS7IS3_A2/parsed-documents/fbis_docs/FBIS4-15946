According to Mr. Melikyan and Mr. Prokopov, as of today employment services have registered 1 million unemployed while another 3 million people did not wish to solve the problems of their employment with the aid of official structures and are looking for jobs on their own. The number of partially employed is approximately 4 million people, but Mr. Melikyan underlined that it was virtually impossible to do a precise count of those affected by "hidden" unemployment. Speaking about prospects of unemployment's growth, Mr. Melikyan and Mr. Prokopov differed somewhat in their assessments. According to the minister, the number of unemployed will amount to around 3 million by the end of 1994, while the employment service head thought that as many as 3 million would apply to his agency alone with the total number of unemployed being considerably higher. As for "hidden" unemployment, according to the Ministry of Labor's rough estimates, it will amount to between 4-8 million people by the end of 1994. Explaining the reasons for such a wide spread in the forecast figures, Mr. Prokopov pointed out that the Ministry of Labor and the Employment Service are to a certain degree "hostage to the government course," and that if a "tough" financial policy is followed, the number of evident and hidden unemployed may exceed the projected figures. Gennadiy Melikyan also stated that unlike many Western European countries, Russia would not be able to bear a 25-percent unemployment level "owing to peculiarities of the national character." According to Mr. Prokopov, the unemployment problem is especially acute in Ivanovo Oblast, Ingushetia, and in the Far North. As for hidden unemployment, this ailment affects most regions where the defense industry is predominant. Speaking about measures the Labor Ministry is taking regarding retraining of the unemployed, Mr. Prokopov stated that the structures that had done that in the past are in ruins and that "serious financial injections" are necessary to restore them. At the same time, in Mr. Prokopov's opinion, finding a job is not that difficult, but the existing vacancies mainly offer a stable job at low pay (working in the state sector), or high pay in the absence of the usual labor guarantees (new economy). Touching on the question of possible competition for jobs from refugees and economic immigrants to those who live in Russia, Mr. Prokopov pointed to the fact that their pressure on the labor market is insignificant. Speaking about current migration processes, Mr. Melikyan pointed out the existence of two main processes: an outflow of the population from the Far North to the European part of Russia, and a partial outflow of the urban population to rural areas. Having noted the irreversibility of the depolicization process, the minister recognized the economic objectivity of mass migration from the areas of the Far North and stated that his agency is preparing a federal program designed to facilitate social adaptation of resettlers.
