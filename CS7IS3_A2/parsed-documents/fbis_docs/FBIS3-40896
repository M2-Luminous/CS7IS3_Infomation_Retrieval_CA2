Following is the text of the statement: Western and American news media have attributed a statement to Dieter Vogel, a German Government official, in which he said that German intelligence services have had access to information from Saudi Arabia to the effect that a search of a German freighter, docked at the Port of Jeddah, by Saudi and German inspectors turned up two containers including hundreds of tonnes of a chemical stuff, used in the manufacture of fuels for missiles. [word indistinct] this ship [words indistinct] chemicals [word indistinct] from China and then [words indistinct] of its freight in Hong Kong. The vessel's travel plan called for it to dock in Cyprus before proceeding to Beirut, its final destination. The ship owners then claimed that the chemicals consignment was to have been transported from Beirut to Iraq. The Foreign Ministry hereby categorically denies these allegations. The fabrication of lies has become a hackneyed tactic resorted to by certain quarters known for their hostility toward Iraq and the Iraqi people, among them the Saudi regime. The idea is to level baseless accusations against Iraq, spread lies, and cast doubt with the object of keeping the wicked blockade in place. This is because more and more circles and nations within and outside the UN Security Council are demanding the removal of the blockade. The Foreign Ministry hereby condemns these groundless allegations and the role of the guileful Saudi regime in making up such lies.
