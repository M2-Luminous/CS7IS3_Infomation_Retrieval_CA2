This is because he feels that 1994 will be quite a difficult year as far as interethnic relations are concerned. He voiced confidence that he would be able "to at least minimize" the consequences of interethnic conflicts and help resolve them. Sergey Shakhray expressed the wish that, even if he does lose the post of deputy prime minister, he should at least be able to have direct access to the prime minister and deputy prime minister. Asked by an ITAR-TASS correspondent about the prospects for his joining the new government, Deputy Aleksandr Shokhin said: "I cannot tell you anything new. I have not yet decided. The number of offers I am getting is increasing."
