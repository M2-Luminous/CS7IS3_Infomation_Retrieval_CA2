FR940527-1-00043 FR940527-1-00014 This deadline is necessary to allow sufficient time to download and edit the data so that the final wage index calculation can be completed for development of the final prospective payment rates to be published by September 1, 1994. We cannot guarantee that corrections transmitted to HCFA after June 15, 1994, will be reflected in the final wage index. Therefore, we suggest that hospitals wishing to submit corrected data do so as soon as possible and follow up with their intermediaries to ensure inclusion of the corrected data in the final FY 1995 wage index. After reviewing requested changes submitted by hospitals, intermediaries will transmit any revised cost reports to HCRIS and will forward to the hospitals a copy of the revised Worksheet S&hyph;3, Part II. If requested changes are not accepted, fiscal intermediaries will notify hospitals in writing of reasons why the changes were not accepted. This procedure will ensure that hospitals have an opportunity to verify the data that will be used to construct their wage index values. We believe that fiscal intermediaries are in the best position to make evaluations regarding the appropriateness of a particular cost and whether it should be included in the wage index data. However, in the event that a hospital disagrees with the intermediary's resolution of a requested change, the hospital may contact HCFA to attempt to resolve the dispute. We have created the above-described process to resolve all substantive wage data correction disputes before we finalize the raw wage data for the FY 1995 payment rates, Accordingly, hospitals that do not meet the procedural deadlines described above will not be afforded a later opportunity to submit wage corrections or to dispute the intermediary's decision with respect to requested changes. We note that we intend to make a diskette available in mid-August that will contain the finalized raw wage data that will be used to construct the wage index values in the final rule. As with the diskette made available in March 1994, HCFA will make the August diskette available to hospital associations and the public. This August diskette, however, is being made available only for the limited purpose of identifying any potential errors made by HCFA or the intermediary in the entry of the finalized wage data, not for the initiation of new wage data correction requests. Hospitals are encouraged to review their hospital wage data promptly after the release of the second diskette. If after reviewing the August diskette, a hospital believes that its wage data is incorrect due to a fiscal intermediary or HCFA error, it should send a letter to both its fiscal intermediary and HCFA. The letters to the intermediary and HCFA should outline why the hospital believes an error exists. These requests must be received by HCFA no later than September 23. Requests should be sent to: Charles R. Booth, Director; Office of Payment Policy; 181 East High Rise; 6325 Security Boulevard; Baltimore, Maryland 21207. The intermediary will review requests upon receipt and, if it is determined that an intermediary or HCFA error exists, the fiscal intermediary will notify HCFA immediately. As indicated above, after mid-August, we will make changes to the hospital wage data only in those very limited situations involving an error by the intermediary or HCFA that the hospital could not have known about before its review of the August diskette. Specifically, neither the intermediary nor HCFA will accept the following types of requests in conjunction with this mid-August process: requests for wage data correction that were submitted too late to be included in the data transmitted to the HCRIS system on or before June 15, 1994, requests for correction of errors made by the hospital not identified during the hospital's review of the March 1994 data, or requests to revisit factual determinations or policy interpretations made by the intermediary or HCFA during the wage data correction process. Verified corrections to the wage index made as a result of an intermediary or HCFA error received timely (that is, by September 23, 1994) will be effective October 1, 1994. We continue to believe, as outlined in the final rule published September 1, 1992 (57 FR 39765), that midyear corrections should not be made in most cases. We believe the wage data correction process described above provides hospitals with sufficient opportunity to bring errors made during the preparation of Worksheet S&hyph;3 to the intermediary's attention. Moreover, because hospitals will have access to the raw wage data in mid-August, they will have the opportunity to detect any ministerial data tabulation errors made by the intermediary or HCFA before the implementation of the prospective payment rates on October 1. We believe that if hospitals avail themselves of this opportunity, the wage index implemented on October 1 should be free of such errors. Nevertheless, in the unlikely event that such errors should occur, we do not believe a hospital should be disadvantaged because actions taken by its intermediary or HCFA in the tabulation of its data resulted in an error of which the hospital could not have been aware. Since the current regulations do not provide for midyear corrections in these situations, we are proposing to revise the regulations to specify that the Secretary retains the right to make midyear changes to the wage index under very limited circumstances. Again, we believe that it is appropriate to reserve the right to make midyear changes to the wage index in those limited circumstances where the hospital can show that an error was made, and the hospital could not have known about, or sought to correct, the error by September 23, 1994.
