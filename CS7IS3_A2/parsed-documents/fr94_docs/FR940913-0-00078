FR940913-0-00078 FR940913-0-00027 (i) HUD requires recipients to use the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. HUD has the option of not requiring the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A when the SF&hyph;270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF&hyph;272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs, except that a final SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF&hyph;270 is used only for advances. (ii) HUD shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If HUD requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis of the documentation on hand. (iii) HUD shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement. (iv) HUD requires recipients to submit the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A (an original and no more than two copies) no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and semi-annual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by HUD upon request of the recipient. (2) SF&hyph;272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions. (i) When funds are advanced to recipients HUD shall require each recipient to submit the SF&hyph;272 and, when necessary, its continuation sheet, SF&hyph;272a. HUD shall use this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement information for each agreement with the recipients. (ii) HUD may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of the report. (iii) When practical and deemed necessary, HUD may require recipients to report in the ``Remarks'' section the amount of cash advances received and retained in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations of actions taken to reduce the excess balances. (iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF&hyph;272 15 calendar days following the end of each quarter. HUD may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving advances totaling $1 million or more per year. (v) HUD may waive the requirement for submission of the SF&hyph;272 for any one of the following reasons: (A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through other forms contained in this section; (B) If, in HUD's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances; or (C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data. (b) When HUD needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall be observed.
