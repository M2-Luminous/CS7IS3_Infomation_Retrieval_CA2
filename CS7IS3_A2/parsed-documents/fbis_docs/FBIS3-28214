A relevant government official on that day said, "The provisions of the constitution and the North-South Agreement define the inter-Korean transactions as transactions within the nation, which is an expression of the right to self-determination. Therefore, we need not separately obtain an official recognition for an exceptional treatment of the inter-Korean transactions in the Uruguay Round Treaty. The government official added, "If we apply for the recognition for an exceptional treatment, it could be an action tantamount to admitting that the inter-Korean transactions are in violation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. If a third country demands that we pay a price for such transactions, we may fall into a position of having to do so."
