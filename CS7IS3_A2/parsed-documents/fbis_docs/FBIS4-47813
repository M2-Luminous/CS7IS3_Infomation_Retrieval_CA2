The SAAF said in a statement the occasion could lead to an influx of aircraft wishing to observe the ceremony from the air with "the inherent danger of an accident being ever present". "It should be quite clear that flight safety is of utmost importance and cannot be compromised in any way. It has therefore been deemed appropriate to keep the skies over Pretoria as uncluttered as possible." At the request of the national inaugural committee's sub- committee on security, the air space over Pretoria would be strictly controlled during the inauguration. Only flights specifically authorised by the Air Force would be allowed to enter Waterkloof air space or operate South of Wonderboom airport during this time. "The necessary co-ordination mechanisms between the SAAF command post and air traffic control at Wonderboom have been established. In addition to static radar installations, a mobile unit will be deployed to ensure unbroken coverage at both high and low level. The SAAF will place its own aircraft on standing air patrols to enforce the measures," the statement said.
