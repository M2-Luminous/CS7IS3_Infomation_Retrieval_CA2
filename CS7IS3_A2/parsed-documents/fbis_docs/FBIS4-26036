Prior to the opening, leading cadres, including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, and Rong Yiren, met cordially all deputies to the congress and posed for group photos. On behalf of the party Central Committee and the State Council, Jiang Zemin extended warm greeting to the congress; wished the vast numbers of returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Chinese nationals living abroad, and Overseas Chinese all the best; and expressed his cordial regards to cadres of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese [ACFOROC] at various levels and to personnel who handle work concerning Overseas Chinese. He said that work on Overseas Chinese has been long-term, policy-oriented, important work for both the party and the state. In the past, returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Chinese nationals living abroad, and Overseas Chinese have made outstanding contributions in terms of nation revitalization and national construction. In this new period when China is accelerating its reform, opening up, and economic construction, conscientiously doing a good job in Overseas Chinese affairs will be important to the smooth realization of China's economic development strategic objectives, to the enhancement of friendly exchanges with other countries, and to the promotion of the peaceful unification of the motherland. Comrade Deng Xiaoping, who terms bringing out the positive role of the broad Overseas Chinese as an unique opportunity for greater development in China, has provided us with important guidance with far-reaching significance to improve our work under the new situation. Let's take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as guidance, seize the opportunity, master the overall situation, work hard in unity, and open up a new work horizon for ACFOROC designed to contribute even more to revitalizing the Chinese nation and unifying the motherland. The congress, which is being attended by 812 deputies and specially invited representatives, will examine ACFOROC's Fourth Committee work report, scrutinize and adopt its draft constitutional amendment, and elect its Fifth Committee. In congratulating the congress on behalf of the party Central Committee and the State Council, Qian Qichen, a member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and State Council vice premier, said: ACFOROC, a CPC-led nationwide people's organization of returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Chinese nationals living abroad, serves as a bridge and a tie linking the party and the government with returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Chinese nationals living abroad, and Overseas Chinese. Under the new situation, ACFOROC at various levels should unfold its work around the economy; give full play to the role of returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Chinese nationals living abroad, and Overseas Chinese in participation in government and discussion as well as democratic supervision; and protect their lawful interests and legitimate rights in China according to the law. It is necessary to fully bring out ACFOROC's superiority in conducting nongovernmental exchanges, to step up foreign liaison work; to enthusiastically help returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Chinese nationals living abroad, and Overseas Chinese in promoting cultural, educational, public health, and other social undertakings in China; and to thoroughly bring out ACFOROC's role in building the socialist spiritual civilization, including promoting the spiritual civilization in areas inhabited by returned Overseas Chinese. Qian Qichen said: The party and the government have all along been attaching importance to work concerning Overseas Chinese. From now on, party committees and governments at various levels should further strengthen and improve leadership in this respect by giving full play to the role of ACFOROC and by showing concern for and lending their support enthusiastically. In presenting a work report entitled "Making New Contributions Toward the Great Undertaking of Revitalizing the Chinese Nation and Unifying the Motherland," ACFOROC President Zhuang Yanlin, after reviewing the work of the past five years, highlighted the federation's major future tasks as following: to closely unite the vast number of returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Chinese nationals living abroad, and Overseas Chinese to ensure greater contributions toward accelerating China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive; to further bring out its role in participation in government and discussion as well as democratic supervision; to promote the full implementation of "The Law for the Protection of Returned Overseas Chinese and Relatives of Chinese Nationals Living Abroad" and its "Implementation Rules"; to further bring out ACFOROC's superiority in conducting nongovernmental exchanges; to open up a new situation in foreign liaison work; to play a positive role in building a socialist spiritual civilization; and to vigorously promote reform within the ACFOROC itself for its improved performance.

Other leading comrades who attended the opening ceremony after meeting all the delegates included Lie Jieqiong, Wang Guangying, Cheng Siyuan, Wang Zhaoguo, and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme.
