They had been taken to Yerevan from Stepanakert, near which an Iranian C-30 [as published] military transport went down. There was a funeral ceremony at the airport attended by Armenian Vice President Gagik Arutyunyan and other ranking republic leaders. Akhmad Sobkhani [name as transliterated], Iranian charge d'affaires in Armenia, expressed gratitude for the sincere condolences. The Armenian side, he said, had proved its good-neighborly relations in practice by actively participating in the investigation into the causes of the crash. Nonetheless, it would be premature to believe that all the ramifications of the incident have been exhausted. As an Armenian Foreign Ministry representative said in a brief conversation with journalists, "it was all far more complicated than we might have thought." A special commission including experts from Iran, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Armenia is still at work in Stepanakert. It is too soon to talk of results, but certain statements by the head of the Iranian experts have sounded a warning. He claimed that the aircraft exploded before coming down, and that it had not malfunctioned. Journalists have not discovered on what this assertion is based. If the aircraft was indeed in proper working order, how could it have been as much as 100 km off course? And why did the aircraft remain at an altitude of 7.5 km for 20-25 minutes over Azerbaijan, but then descend to 3.5 km over the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic? How could the crew have failed to respond to the calls from the air traffic controllers who noticed the course deviation? For his part, Akhmat [as published] Sobkhani rejected the theory that it was an intelligence-gathering flight. The aircraft did not have the necessary equipment for this. Another point is worrying -- in the opinion of certain observers, Iran is inclined to consider Armenia chiefly responsible [glavnym otvetstvennym zvenom], even though the aircraft was not overflying its territory. It is to be hoped that the experts will be able to unravel the true cause of the crash and that this tragic incident will not overshadow Armenian-Iranian relations, which are developing actively.
