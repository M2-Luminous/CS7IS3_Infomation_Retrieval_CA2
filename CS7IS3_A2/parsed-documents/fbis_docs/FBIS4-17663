Plyushch by Serhiy Pravdenko, HOLOS UKRAYINY editor in chief, Eldar Seyidbekirov, and Svitlana Pysarenko for the newspapers HOLOS UKRAYINY and GOLOS KRYMA on 13 April 1994; place not given: "The People Are Looking Forward to Changes and Are Associating These Changes With New Democratic Forces"] [Text] [Question] Ivan Stepanovych, is it possible, already today, to draw some conclusions on the elections. How do you see the new parliament? [Plyushch] I am generally pleased with the elections to the new parliament, although I expected better results. Take, for example, Kiev. The capital has remained as though uninvolved. Only five out of 23 constituencies elected their deputies. Many of the constituencies were 1,000, 1,500, or 2,000 voters short each. This indicates that the elections were not properly organized and that the election campaign was not sufficiently well conducted. I hope that Kievans do strive to create a law-governed state and that they will express this striving at repeat elections by taking part in the voting. Regarding the political forces that came to the parliament, this question is not a simple one. One should not make hasty conclusions as though the "left-wing" or the "right-wing" forces have prevailed. Had our society been structured as "left" and "right" or in terms of parties, then some conclusions could be drawn. More that 100 deputies from the "left-wing" forces have come to the parliament -- representatives of the Communist Party, Socialists Party, and Peasant Party. However, when I went over their election platforms, I did not come across any indication there that they had come to the Supreme Council in order to fight it. They do not cast any aspersions on Ukraine's strategic course. It is only a matter of changing tactics. However, one cannot say that the democratic forces suffered a defeat. Talking about the defeat of Rukh [Ukraine's People's Movement for Perestroyka], the Democratic Party, the Ukrainian Republican Party, or the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party -- it is true that the number of their deputies has dwindled. Well, there are about 100 "left-wingers" and more than 50 "right-wingers." The total is about 150. How about the rest of the elected deputies? I think that they constitute a healthy center. In my opinion, this political force will constitute that backbone to which both "left-wingers" and "right-wingers" will cling. Perhaps, small "wings" of the "radical left" and of the "radical right" will remain. It is a normal phenomenon. Nor do I see a tragedy in the fact that many well-known people's deputies failed to gain a victory at these elections. Objectively, people are looking forward to changes and are associating these changes, at the new stage, with new democratic forces. Those deputies who have not been elected at the recent elections have extensive experience and will be able to put it to use by getting mandates of deputies in local councils as well as in executive structures. I was in favor of holding the elections during the fall of 1993. The level at which the democratic forces were at that time was quite high and strong. We arrived at the elections at a different and a lower level, when the so-called democratic forces retreated from their positions somewhat. Unless elections to the local power structures are held in June, the situation will become further exacerbated. This is one of the factors -- a political one. Here is another factor, just appraise it. If one plans to contend at elections and wants to get a mandate, he will work with double energy. If the time for elections comes and one is not sure that he will be elected, he will primarily resolve his personal problems. Third, people are already looking forward to elections. It is clear that those who want the process of development to be a guided one and who do not want chaos to prevail are looking forward to elections. The opinions became divided: Those who are sure of themselves are in favor of elections, and those who fear elections are against them. I believe that elections of representative and executive bodies from villages to oblasts will take place. Regarding presidential elections, it is not such a burning question as it is presented. If the Supreme Council approves the amendment to the Constitution and the prime minister becomes head of the executive power and forms that power, then is it really necessary to elect a president through nationwide elections, or perhaps the president who is now in office will continue fulfilling his functions? Meanwhile, the Law on Ukrainian Presidential Elections is still in effect.... Unfortunately, the parliamentary elections proceeded against the background of strained relations with Russia. You know, after the first round of voting, I met with representatives of the Russian State Duma and I thought that political forces that realized that Ukraine was in earnest and forever were beginning to prevail and win in Russia. However, for some reason, recently, when gleams of political stability appeared in Ukraine and when changes for the better started taking shape in the economy, as we are already repaying our debt to Russia, despite everything, certain political forces in Russia have made themselves felt. Not only on the territory of the CIS, but also far away from it, they stir up passions and impose upon everybody their opinion that Ukraine cannot exist without Russia and that Russia cannot exist without Ukraine. The Crimean card is being played with increasing fervor. [Question] How do you, Ivan Stepanovych assess the recent events in the Crimea? What is your opinion of the institution of presidency in the Crimea and the first steps taken by [Crimean President] Yu. Meshkov -- the transition to the Moscow time, the directive on the military service for the Crimeans on the Crimean territory, and the dismissal of the Security Service chief and the minister of internal affairs from their posts? [Plyushch] You have formulated your question in a very narrow way. The Crimean problem did not start with electing Yuriy Meshkov as president of the Crimea. It is older than that. Of course, I do not claim to be the only owner of the truth. However, as a citizen and a political figure, I cannot remain silent. My conclusion is as follows: It is a well-planned and coordinated action on the part of certain political forces in Russia that have inherited the aforementioned qualities from the former Soviet Union. I think that it will not be long before we learn the truth about this. Only then will we assess objectively everything that is going on in the Crimea; this is just a fraction of the large-scale operation. Journalists will find a name for it. I recommend that you read the interview with Lieutenant General Lebed in KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. He thoroughly imbibed everything that has been going on in the former Soviet Union during recent years and what is going on now. In my opinion, Lieutenant General Lebed, who was in charge of individual operations, wants the people to know the truth. A reporter asked him why he had started writing (this frontline general writes books), and he replied that he hoped that the people would stop and think of how to put life in order in such a colossally large country as Russia with its 150-million population. If this figure -- 150 million -- had not been mentioned, I would still have doubts as to what country he had in mind.... He was only talking about Russia. First, build life in your own country and then pacify, teach, and improve others. It is not Russia that must unilaterally resolve problems of the former Union. The CIS had to do this. However, nothing has been resolved over more than two years. The Dniester Region, according to him, is the problem for Moldovans and Russians and the Crimea -- for Russia and Ukraine. How about Baykonur? [President of Kazakhstan] Nursultan Nazarbayev is an intelligent person. An agreement for leasing Baykonur was concluded, and billions [monetary unit not specified] were hoped for. Where from? Where can a country that imports much of its foodstuffs get this much money? Well, the CIS had to tackle the problems of the Black Sea Fleet, the Crimea, the Dniester Region, Abkhazia, and so on. Just a few years ago, Gorbachev repeatedly said: "Don't you worry, this will also start in Ukraine." Some people now want this to start. Even in Russia's embassies much is done to shape the opinion in the United States and in developed Western countries to the effect that it is impossible to separate Ukraine from Russia. On the television, they show, close-up, Chernomyrdin and Kebich signing the agreement on common currency. Nobody is saying how they understand it. The ECU in the European Community did not emerge right away, but only after corresponding conditions were created and only for interstate settlements, whereas the states have retained their national currencies. In the CIS, attempts are being made to draw the countries into the ruble zone. This is also one of the fundamental problems that the CIS must resolve. The same applies to the Crimean issue. Who can determine today which of the peoples residing in the Crimea has more right to talk about itself as the people of the Crimea? The Crimean Tatar population is speaking about its autonomy. Undoubtedly, it has every reason for this. Today, hardly anybody would disagree with the fact that 50 years ago, a crime was committed against this people -- a whole people. It took almost half a century for this people to be rehabilitated; apologies were made to them, and they were offered to come and settle [in the Crimea]. However, it was Suslov's ideology. In adopting this decision, they did not think that it needed to be fulfilled. It was simply a political step, like yet another noisy campaign; to say one thing, to write something else, and to do something entirely different. Furthermore, some people say that the Russian-speaking population residing in the Crimea is the troublemaker. In the course of the implementation of the specific Soviet national policy, the Crimea and Sevastopol were specially colonized by Russians. How can these people inhabiting the peninsula be accused of anything, these people who previously served for 15 or 20 years in the cold seas? They knew that, after the service, they would live in warm Sevastopol under the gentle Crimean sun. Or take Tauria, the northern part of the Crimea, where Ukrainians constitute one-third of the population; did they ever think that they would see the times when somebody would try to determine whether or not they are indigenous, whether they have the right to live in the Crimea, and whether they side with Ukraine or with Russia? It never occurred to them. I know the moods of those people. I am sure that the Crimean population understands all of this. Look, Moldova has changed its stand and held elections. There were 75 percent of voters, they elected the parliament, and embarked upon the road toward development. They don't even think about [uniting with] Romania. What should the Dniester Region do? Where to go? Russia does not accept it. Nor does Ukraine. We have an agreement with Moldova, and we cannot violate it. The same may happen to the Crimea -- as is happening in Abkhazia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia. This must be realized by those high-ranking officials, who cannot properly handle their presentation weapons, which go off inside their pockets [an allusion to commander of the Black Sea Fleet Admiral E. Baltin]. [Question] Ivan Stepanovych, in 1991, at an assembly of the Crimean Tatars -- Kurultay -- a Majlis was elected and granted the status of a supreme plenipotentiary representative body. At the recent elections to the Crimean Supreme Council, where the quota was 14 seats, the Majlis actually received all the mandates. Do you find it expedient to recognize the Majlis as a supreme representative body? [Plyushch] I will, perhaps, disappoint you. I have deep respect for Dzhemilev and Chubarov, leaders of the Majlis. However, as an official, I am responsible for maintaining peace and calm in the state -- among the Crimean Tatars, among the Russians, and among the Ukrainians. If, as you are saying, the Majlis is recognized as a representative body of the Crimean Tatar population, this would not do any good either to the Crimean Tatars themselves, to the Russians, or to the Ukrainians. It would lead to hostility and confrontation. A certain protocol must be followed in intrastate and interstate relations. I will quote an example. Before leaving for the celebration of the 72d anniversary of Turkey's Great National Assembly, I included Kurashyk, who was at that time chairman of the Crimean Council of Ministers, in the delegation. However, it was quite embarrassing for me when, among the state delegations that took part in the festivities, I also saw a Crimean delegation with Dzhemilev and Chubarov at the head. It was regarded as a state delegation. They should have officially made proposals on the composition of the Ukrainian delegation, taking into account Dzhemilev's and Chubarov's long-standing and close ties with Turkey. Then everything would have been entirely different. As it were, the situation might be regarded as a challenge to Ukraine. Later, I had a conversation with the president of Turkey. I thanked him for his understanding of the problems of the Crimea and Crimean Tatars, who were settling in the Crimea, and for the intention to provide assistance to Ukraine for resolving urgent and vital issues of the Crimean Tatar population -- the building of housing, reclamation of land, arrival in the homeland, and so on. I would like to thank the peninsula's Crimean Tatar population and the Majlis for the well-balanced policy it has been pursuing over recent years. Believe me, my attitude toward the Crimean Tatar autonomy is precisely the same as toward the Crimean Russian, or, for example, Crimean Ukrainian autonomies. Yuriy Meshkov gives preference to the Crimean Russian autonomy, Chubarov, and Dzhemilev to the Crimean Tatar one. I want an Autonomous Crimean Republic within Ukraine. [Question] They say that Crimean autonomy has become a precursor for Ukraine's federalization. What is your attitude toward this and how do you assess the situation? [Plyushch] The Crimea is one thing and Ukraine's federalization is something different altogether. Do not link the Crimea to federalization. Even though the law "On the Division of Powers Among the State Bodies of Ukraine and the Crimea" with changes and additions to it is the first stage in the development of future federal principles of organizational administration in Ukraine, the division of functions among the Cabinet of Ministers and central power structures, on the one hand, and regional bodies of executive power and self-government, on the other hand, may become the next step. How many years this is going to take will depend upon the course of reforms. How can there be any talk about a federal structure in the conditions when central organs govern 70 percent of property. When people think in the following terms: If we speak Russian, our pension will double and if Ukrainian it will be in coupons [karbovantsi]. Who talks of a federalization here? Our society needs to mature. This is my opinion: If we are in favor of a democratic and law-governed state, then we are in favor of a federal structure. If we advocate an administrative command system -- this means a unitary system. This is largely how things are.
