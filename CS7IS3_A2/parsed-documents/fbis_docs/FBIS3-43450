A source who yesterday morning attended the commanders' meeting, which was aimed at implementing the ceasefire, said it ended after only 30 minutes when commanders from three sections walked out in protest against a call for peace. At the centre of the threatening move was mistrust, sources said. The mistrust element came into being when Hadebe Section's SDU members allegedly murdered the leader, "Commander Mbogani," after he was seen near Kwesine Hostel. A source said while most residents did not walk near the hostel for fear of their lives, Commander Mbogani at one stage boasted to his followers about having been in and out of the hostel unharmed. "Instead of being praised for bravery Commander Mbogani was accused of being an Inkatha Freedom Party spy. He was tried in a kangaroo court, found guilty and sentenced to death," a source who was present at the trial said. Seventeen residents have since been killed in the subsequent internal clashes between the SDUs. The death toll since New Year's Day stood at 17 yesterday. However, ANC regional executive member Mr. Robert McBride told a news conference in Johannesburg that only four of the 17 deaths were as a result of the SDUs' internal fighting. Some of the sections that disagreed on effecting the ceasefire came from the violence-plagued Mavimbela, Radebe, Ncala and Sali sections. A source who attended yesterday's meeting said: "Most of the commanders who walked out were against their boundaries being opened to people not living in them." The source added: "That means if I live in Ncala I cannot enter Mavimbela, otherwise I will be killed." At the time of going to the press McBride was said to be "working very hard" trying to resolve the problem and avert the threat of renewed SDU clashes. In another development, police pounced on the home of slain Monwabisi Mzukwa, alias "Commander Boja," in the early hours yesterday and arrested five suspected SDU members. "We seized one Walther PPK pistol, one magazine and three rounds of ammunition," said Warrant-Officer Michelle Erasmus. She said the five men were expected to appear in court soon on charges of illegal possession of weapons.
