The farm machines produced in the West, they said, are on average two to three times more expensive than ours, and the slightly cheaper machines from the East are two to three times worse than ours. The possibility of importing used machines from the West was forgotten. They are generally much cheaper than the Polish machines, and the quality of materials used in them is equal to ours, as are their operating advantages. What happens, therefore, is that a farmer buys a machine that is already several years old but figures that, on his small farm, the machine will still work for 10 or perhaps even more years. The effects of this kind of thinking are felt most by the producers of combine-harvesters. Last year Polish farmers bought 2,101 used combine-harvesters in the West, while, during this same period, the Plock factory was able to sell only 195 "Bisons." It is said that three times more farm trailers and beet harvesters were imported than were sold domestically. In other types of farm machinery, the effect of import was not as great; nevertheless, it was not looked upon with joy by domestic producers. For example, last year farmers bought the following equipment abroad: 374 spraying machines, 1,800 plows, 247 cultivators, 570 harrows, 229 sowing machines, 186 planters, 199 fertilizer spreaders, 510 presses for gathering hay and straw, 783 combines and diggers for gathering potatoes, 332 root toppers and combines for gathering beets, 14 manure spreaders, 3,023 farm trailers, 468 minitractors, and 3,340 tractors. And, although the above figures include both new and used equipment, one can guess that most of these machines have already done their job for the bauer [German word for farmer] and are now helping the farmer in Poland do his work--because the imported machines come mainly from West Germany. Import from Austria, second on this list, is several times smaller. The import of this used farm machinery is causing Polish producers a great deal of trouble. Union members in the farm equipment factories recently protested against it, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Management is also looking at it with displeasure. In the past, it supported the attempts to protect domestic production of tractors, and today the import of tractors of the type produced by "Ursus" carries a 35-percent duty (on the import of others, the duty is 15 percent). There is only a 6-percent border tax on the import of used farm machines, which is too small an impediment. And so other methods of halting or limiting the import of used machines are being sought. A requirement to obtain a so-called energy certificate has been instituted, and now there are plans to require possession of a "B" symbol, which machines that fulfill Polish work-safety requirements receive. "There is a proposal that the Ministry of Foreign Economic Cooperation request the Tribunal in The Hague to halt the sale to Poland of used combine-harvesters, says Jerzy Szymanski, deputy director of the department of land management and countryside infrastructure in the Ministry, but, after a year, the situation will return to its previous state anyway.
