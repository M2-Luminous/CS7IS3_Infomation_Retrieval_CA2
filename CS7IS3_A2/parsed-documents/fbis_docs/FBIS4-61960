FBIS4-61960 "drsov091_s_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-091 Daily Report 10 May 1994 Georgia Russia Ready To Deploy Troops in Abkhazia Russia Ready To Deploy Troops in Abkhazia LD1005195094 Tbilisi CONTACT INFORMATION AGENCY in Russian 1600 GMT 10 May 94 LD1005195094 Tbilisi CONTACT INFORMATION AGENCY Russian BFN [Text] In the opinion of Butrus Butrus-Ghali, UN secretary general, conditions for deploying UN forces in Abkhazia are not available, but the Security Council could discuss the issue of putting Russian peace-keeping forces there to secure the return of refugees and carry out sowing work. Regulating the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict is possible only by means of resolving three issues which are closely linked with each other: a political settlement, the return of refugees, and creating forces for securing peace. The UN secretary general stressed success in the political sphere will only be possible if refugees start to return to their homes, which, in itself, is connected with carrying out peace-keeping operations. The sowing season is about to start and if it is missed, by the end of the year, the situation will be even harder. However, noted Butrus-Ghali, it has become clear that a wide-scale return of refugees and the forcibly displaced cannot take place until the international military presence in Abkhazia's rayons, where refugees and the displaced will be returning, is secured. Without this international presence, they are not ready to trust in the readiness and the ability of the Abkhaz authorities to secure their safety. That is why, stated Butrus-Ghali, the issue of deployment of international forces is a very urgent one. "The Russian Federation has reported its readiness to deploy an advanced contingent of the United Nations, if the Security Council adopts the decision on creating it. I am proceeding from the fact that this contingent of several hundreds of military servicemen could be put in the rayon during several days after the Security Council adopts the resolution on its deployment," stated Butrus Ghali.
