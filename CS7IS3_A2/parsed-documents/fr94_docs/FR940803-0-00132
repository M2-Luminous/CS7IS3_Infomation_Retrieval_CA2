FR940803-0-00132 FR940803-0-00040 FE adj =FE [((0.55×a g ×c) + (0.45×c) + (0.5556×a g ) + 0.4487)/((0.55×a g ) + 0.45)] + IW g Where: FE adj =Fuel economy value to be used for determination of gas guzzler tax assessment rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg. FE=Combined model type fuel economy calculated in accordance with §600.207, rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mpg. a g =Model type highway fuel economy, calculated in accordance with §600.207, rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mpg divided by the model type city fuel economy calculated in accordance with §600.207, rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mpg. The quotient shall be rounded to 4 decimal places. c=gas guzzler adjustment factor=1.300×10 &hyph;3 for the 1986 and later model years. IW g =(9.2917×10 &hyph;3 ×SF 3IWCG FE 3IWCG ) ^(3.5123×10 &hyph;3 ×SF 4ETWG ×FE 4IWCG ) Note: Any calculated value of IW less than zero shall be set equal to zero. SF 3IWCG =The 3000 lb. inertia weight class sales in the model type divided by the total model type sales; the quotient shall be rounded to 4 decimal places. SF 4ETWG =The 4000 lb. equivalent test weight sales in the model type divided by the total model type sales, the quotient shall be rounded to 4 decimal places. FE 3IWCG =The 3000 lb. inertial weight class base level combined fuel economy used to calculate the model type fuel economy rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mpg. FE 4IWCG =The 4000 lb. inertial weight class base level combined fuel economy used to calculate the model type fuel economy f/rounded to the nearest 0.001 mpg. (b) *␣*␣* (2) *␣*␣* (xii) Less than 12.5 mpg, the Gas Guzzler Tax statement shall show a tax of $7,700.
