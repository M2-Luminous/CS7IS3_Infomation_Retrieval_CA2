The Governments of Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg promised to continue their aid to Nicaragua "at least until I leave office," the leader affirmed. The president signed a letter of intent as an incentive to foreign investment for the Swiss Government. She noted that Nicaragua has become the "focal point" of Swiss foreign aid, which will contribute $3.5 million to the payment balance and technical assistance. The Nicaraguan leader said that Non-Governmental Organizations will contribute funds for local private banks to finance small business projects, although she did not specify the amount. Chamorro said that the Netherlands forgave $3 million of the Nicaraguan debt. According to sources within the delegation, there are $15 million still pending. The Netherlands will also support Nicaragua's efforts at the Paris Club next June to renegotiate the rest of its foreign debt, estimated at $10 billion. The president said that the Netherlanders will also contribute $20 million to the San Jacinto geothermal project. They will also assist Nicaragua in marking its border with Costa Rica. Luxembourg, the last stop on her trip, offered to duplicate its current aid to Nicaragua, which was not specified. Dona Violeta's trip to the old continent was checkered with "incidents" that did manage to cause certain alarm and delays in the itinerary. When she left the country for Europe aboard the Aeronica plane, she was delayed for two and one-half hours when the flight crew found a strange-looking bag on board. Fearing a bomb, the crew ordered the plane evacuated immediately. Reports from Miami indicated that Mrs. Chamorro's American Airlines plane was evacuated just before departing, after a small baggage vehicle hit them as they taxied to the runway. Maria Alicia Talavera, assistant director of the president's public relations office, answering a question from BARRICADA, said the collision between the plane and the baggage car caused a scratch under right-side windows four and five.
