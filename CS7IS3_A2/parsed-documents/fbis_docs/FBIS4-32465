Nedeljkovic told the Belgrade daily POLITIKA EKSPRES on Wednesday [22 June] that, `We are aware that extra-legal exams are being held for ethnic Albanian secondary school pupils, with enrollment probably taking place in private homes.' This is the third year that ethnic Albanians have boycotted state secondary schools, even though classes in Albanian have been organized for 12,500 pupils and in Turkish for 240 pupils, the daily said. There has been a strong separatist movement among ethnic Albanians in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo and Metohija for decades. Leaders of the movement demand the annexation of the province by neighbouring Albania. Ethnic Albanians backing the separatist movement boycott the laws of Serbia and Yugoslavia, refusing to go to school, to work or to pay taxes. They did not vote in the 1990 and 1992 multiparty elections. Ethnic Albanian students boycott school classes and university lectures to avoid the Serbian and Yugoslav school curriculum. They attend illegal classes in private homes and use the curriculum of neighbouring Albania. Yugoslav and Serbian officials have unsuccessfully appealed to ethnic Albanian intellectuals in the provice to oppose the separatists and to support a return to state schools. The result is that generations of ethnic Albanians are unable to find work because they have not obtained secondary school certificates. The Yugoslav Constitution guarantees civil rights regardless of ethnic origin. Ethnic Albanians can attend classes and lectures in Albanian and have newspapers, magazines, radio and tv programmes in Albanian. There are 1,400 schools for ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and Metohija, 60 education centres and university lectures are offered in Albanian.
