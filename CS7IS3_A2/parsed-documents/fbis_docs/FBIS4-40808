He said that after consultations in Pyongyang and a telephone conversation with Washington officials, Carter had unveiled a plan for a U.S. rejection of sanctions against North Korea and the resumption of bilateral talks broken off in March. Simultaneously, Son said, Washington has agreed to provide to North Korea a technology for a nuclear reactor working on light water. If the plan works, North Korea will fully comply with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty though IAEA's inspection of its nuclear installations will be impossible while the negotiations are under way, he said. At the same time, the ambassador warned that his country would take proportionate, but strong measures in response to any international sanctions which would be seen as "a declaration of war and would respond accordingly." On the Russian Foreign Ministry's initiative for an international conference on the issue, Son said his country had "a certain interest" in it. However, "we cannot accept it" if the forum is intended to try to bring pressure on North Korea, the ambassador said. Son spoke of holding a series of talks with the Russian Foreign Ministry to try to get the details of the conference proposal.
