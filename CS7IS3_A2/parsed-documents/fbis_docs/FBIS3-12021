Why is it those who were not invited to the upcoming meeting in Havana on the nation and the emigres were not included? This is the topic Luis Sexto, a reporter for BOHEMIA magazine, and your host, Osvaldo Rodriguez from JUVENTUD REBELDE will discuss. I turn the time over to my colleague. [Sexto] Osvaldo, we must begin by saying that we still do not know who is invited and who is not. We still do not have the names of those who have been invited or of those who have said that they will come to this meeting convened by the revolutionary government to discuss relations between Cuba and its emigres. I believe that by explaining the aim or the goal of the this conference we can explain why there are many people who have emigrated but who will not be able to attend this conference, which will be held in April. As I was saying, by analyzing the goal or the aim, we will be able to understand why some, who lament or oppose the observance of this conference from abroad, will not attend. In other words, this conference will be held to discuss and analyze the relations that exist and the normalization of those relations between Cuba and Cuban emigrants. [Rodriguez] We must specify that it is not a dialogue. That is something....[pauses] Because some people have confused this meeting of Cubans on the island with their relatives who emigrated abroad, to the United States or any other place, with the dialogue that was proposed by opponents to the revolutionary project. We must understand that this is not a dialogue. [Sexto] Well, the word dialogue, in a semantic sense, is one that connotes cordiality. It is a positive word. But in the current political language, the counterrevolution's political language, it is a double-edged word. When you talk about establishing a dialogue with someone, it is because you recognize in that person a belligerency or sufficient power for you to dialogue with him, and even to reconcile yourself with that person. Dialogue implies establishing agreements and it implies a certain reconciliation. That is the reason that in the counterrevolution's political language, the language that is so commonly used in Miami or Madrid, dialogue has that connotation -- as if the Cuban Revolution, the revolutionary government, or socialist Cuba, had to dialogue with its opponents abroad. [Rodriguez] Who do not represent any political force. [Sexto] Exactly. They represent only the forces of their own interests. We will talk about this in a minute. I believe Cuba is not going to dialogue with its enemies. Cuba has called a conference where it will talk with certain emigrants, with certain people, on relations with Cuban emigres. You know very well that Cuban emigration has been a process. The Cuban emigration has been grossly manipulated by the United States of America. We must consider how, from the beginning of this process in 1959 and in the 60's, human feelings and needs have been manipulated to the point that they would serve the political interests of the illegitimate sons [espurios] and bastards -- excuse me for using such harsh words. Therefore, the Cuban emigration process must be looked at with certain objectivity, because emigration is a world phenomenon. It is a phenomenon that characterizes today's world. It has been rarefied by political interests, political interests of interference, ambitious political interests, and illegitimate political interests. [Rodriguez] We are talking to Luis Sexto, a reporter for BOHEMIA magazine on a topic that is being discussed in Havana and other places in the world: the upcoming meeting in Havana of the nation and the emigres. We are discussing why those who were not included were not included. [Sexto] In other words, why it is that those who will not be there will not be there. That would be the appropriate term. Because those who will not be, or those who cannot be, at this conference are those who demand that the Revolution give up its power. It is that group who would like to return to Cuba to impose their vision and class interests. That is very clear. Those who will come will be emigrants who wish to maintain good, stable, and cordial relations with their native country. Just recently I wrote an article in BOHEMIA in which I commented on the phenomenon of emigration and its history in our country and I proposed the hypothesis that emigration generally has two sides, especially the Cuban emigration. First, a political emigration: an emigration of people who oppose the Revolution or who have been affected in a sense by the Revolution. [Rodriguez] In other words, class enemies. [Sexto] Enemies of the Revolution who went abroad to seek support with the intent of returning. What distinguishes political emigration from economic emigration is the urge to return. Then we have the other side, which is the economic emigrant. [Rodriguez] Before you talk about the economic emigrant, these political emigrants want to return to Cuba and occupy the position they once had. [Sexto] Right. [Rodriguez] That is why they ask the Revolution to give up its power. [Sexto] Right. The political emigrant goes abroad to prepare his return and with his return to reimpose his interests, vision, and the supremacy of his class or party. For now, Cuba has nothing to talk about with those who, from abroad, conspire against the nation. Because, obviously, those political groups who, from Miami or Madrid, propose or want a dialogue are combating and harassing Cuba. What they want is to take power from the Revolution. As a matter of fact, what do some of the more moderate members of that political group, that political superstructure, propose for Cuba? To solve Cuba's problems? To solve them in such a way that would benefit the majority of the Cuban people, that would allow the Cuban people to continue enjoying the achievements brought about by the Revolution? No! The least moderate of these groups asks for a multiparty system, private property, general openings and uncontrolled foreign investments, subordination to the United States. Those are their demands. I doubt that any Cuban citizen with a patriotic conscience would be able to consider the most minute possibility of sitting down to discuss those issues with the enemies of Cuba. [Rodriguez] You were going to talk about economic emigrants when I interrupted you. [Sexto] The economic emigrant is the person who leaves to seek better living conditions. He leaves for the purpose of starting a new life. For the economic emigrant, what he leaves behind does not present a conflict. He is leaving to start a new life. He probably does not even want to return because the economic emigrant breaks his connections with the past. He has a different goal. The economic emigrant is sometimes nostalgic for his roots but he does not think about returning. Osvaldo, I am the son and grandson of emigrants. My grandparents came from Spain to Cuba. Part of my family, especially my parents, emigrated after the triumph of the Cuban Revolution; I know the mechanics and the nature of the emigrant because I learned about it from my own family. My grandparents never talked about returning to Spain. I believe that my relatives who left Cuba at the beginning of the Revolution have never expressed the desire to reestablish themselves in Cuba. Therefore, I believe that the majority of Cuban emigres during these 35 years -- because there was emigration in Cuba prior to the Revolution, and in the 50's there was growing emigration -- I believe that in some years, such as 1956, more than 25,000 Cubans went to the U.S. Interests Section to ask for visas to enter the United States, to live and work there. The phenomenon of emigration is a bit old in Cuba. It was not caused by the Cuban Revolution. It reached its peak with the Revolution. Therefore, the majority of economic emigrants who live in the United States and other countries around the world, those who will come to talk with Cuban authorities, will come to converse on how to establish a line of communication with what we could call the Cuban diaspora. How to achieve stable and firm ties, despite the world situation, with their native land. That is what they will come to discuss and that is all that the conference will allow to be discussed. [Rodriguez] Yes, and in the political sense, I believe the United States will no longer be able to use that portion of the emigres as a political weapon or as a hostage to its policy. [Sexto] The United States politicized emigration and we did too, as a reflection or as a rejection. As an imposition of the struggle, we also helped politicize emigration. There was a time when we thought that a person who left the country was taking sides against the Cuban Revolution and the country; that is not true. Practice and experience have demonstrated that that is not true and it is time to refocus and change our point of view. [Rodriguez] Why is it those who were not invited to the upcoming meeting in Havana on the nation and emigration were not invited? Luis Sexto from BOHEMIA magazine has spoken to us on this topic.
