The Egyptian diplomat was told that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) believes the document was one-sided, that it based its conclusions on untruths and that as such aligned the movement with one side in the civil war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. The document blames solely the Serbs for the civil war in Bosnia, and totally exonerates from responsibility the Croats and Moslems. It was unacceptable for a non-aligned conference document to even negate the existence of the F.R.Y. (only Serbia and Montenegro, the the F.R.Y. federal units, are mentioned). It was also unacceptable to urge maintaining of the sanctions against the F.R.Y., although the world was by large discussing and considering modalities of their lifting, said the F.R.Y. note. The Yugoslav side expressed both regret and disappointment that Yugoslavia, as one co-founders of NAM, was prevented from participating in the ministerial conference in Caico. As the Egyptian charge d'affaires was informed, this was interpreted in Belgrade as violation of the democratic practice and tradition of NAM. Also, it was emphasized that the statement of Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman that Yugoslavia had refused to participate in the conference was both unfounded and untrue.
