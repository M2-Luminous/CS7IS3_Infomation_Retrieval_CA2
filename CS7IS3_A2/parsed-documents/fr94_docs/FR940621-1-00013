FR940621-1-00013 FR940621-1-00005 40 CFR Part 266 [FRL&hyph;5002&hyph;3] Proposed Technical Clarification Pertaining to Regulations for Boilers and Industrial Furnaces AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed Technical Amendment. SUMMARY: EPA is proposing a minor amendment to the rules for Boilers and Industrial Furnaces (BIFs). EPA believes that this amounts only to a technical amendment (because it reflects the Agency's intent as expressed either in the BIF rule or preamble), but is soliciting comment to assure opportunity for public participation. The amendment would add certain mercury-bearing wastes to the list of wastes that can be burned in metal-recovery furnaces pursuant to 40 CFR 266.100(c) without triggering the substantive BIF requirements. Because the proposed amendment is minor, the comment period is limited to three weeks. After considering any public comments it receives and revising the amendment accordingly, the EPA may finalize it in the Land Disposal Restrictions Phase II Rule, scheduled for promulgation in July 1994. The Phase II LDR rule was proposed September 14, 1993 (see 58 FR 48092). DATES: Comments must be submitted by July 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: The public must send an original and two copies of their written comments to EPA RCRA Docket (5305), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Place the Docket Number F&hyph;94&hyph;BFTA&hyph;FFFFF on your comments. The RCRA Docket is open from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm Monday through Friday, except for Federal holidays. The public must make an appointment to review docket materials by calling (202) 260&hyph;9327. The public may copy a maximum of 100 pages from any regulatory document at no cost. Additional copies cost $.15 per page. The mailing address is EPA RCRA Docket (5305), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: Contact Robert Holloway (5302W), Chief, Combustion Section, Waste Treatment Branch, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, (703) 803&hyph;8461. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Amendment of Boiler and Industrial Furnace Rules for Certain Mercury-Containing Wastes The final BIF rule conditionally defers regulation of smelting, melting, and refining furnaces that burn hazardous waste solely for legitimate metal recovery. See ยง266.100(c). The rule provides three tests for the determination of burning solely for legitimate metal recovery. The heating value of the waste cannot exceed 5000 Btu/lb (if so, the waste is considered to be burned partially for energy recovery), the concentration of appendix VIII organic constituents in the waste cannot exceed 500 ppm (if so, the waste is considered to be burned partially for destruction), and the waste must have recoverable levels of metal. The Chlorine Institute has informed the Agency that there are certain mercury-bearing wastes that can in fact be processed for mercury recovery but would be inappropriately classified as being burned for the purpose of energy recovery because their fuel value may exceed 5000 Btu/lb. These wastes, proposed to be listed in Appendix XIII to Part 266 by today's notice, are activated carbon, decomposer graphite, wood, paper, and protective clothing from the electrolytic mercury cell process used for the production of chlorine. These wastes can contain from hundreds of parts per million to percent levels (in some cases, as high as 45%) of mercury. (See in the RCRA docket for this notice the letter dated May 13, 1994 from the Chlorine Institute, Inc. to Matthew A. Straus.) The wastes also are already subject to a LDR treatment standard that requires recovery of mercury as the method of treatment. (See Table 2 in 40 CFR 268.42, D001 High Mercury Subcategory.) Under these circumstances, the Agency believes that it would be anomalous to consider these wastes to be burned for a purpose other than metal recovery based on the Btu content. EPA notes that these wastes can only be recovered in devices that are either: (a) subject to the mercury National Emission Standard (NESHAP) found at 40 CFR Part 61 Subpart F; (b) subject to a Best Achievable Control Technology (BACT) or Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) standard for mercury imposed pursuant to a Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permit; or (c) subject to a state permit that establishes emission limitations (within the meaning of section 302 of the Clean Air Act) for mercury. (See Table 2 at 268.42, D001 High Mercury Subcategory, and 55 FR at 22570 (June l, l990).) Thus, air emissions from these devices should already be sufficiently controlled so that further RCRA regulation is unnecessary at this time. 55 FR at 22570. Consequently, this proposed amendment is consistent not only with EPA's intent in promulgating the deferral for metal recovery devices in the BIF rule, but is consistent with the Agency's determination in establishing LDR treatment standards for high mercury wastes that air emissions from mercury recovery devices were adequately controlled provided any of the three conditions set forth above (and in the rules) are satisfied. Dated: June 15, 1994. Elliott P. Laws, Assistant Administrator.
