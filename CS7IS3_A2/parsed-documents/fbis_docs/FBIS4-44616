This circuit overcomes the problem of a drop in sensitivity caused by conventional AGC [automatic gain-control] circuits. This world state-of-the-art PIN-FET receiver, now successfully incorporated into the optical terminal production lines at MPT's communications equipment plants, has a dynamic range of over 40 dB and a sensitivity about 2 dB higher than foreign-made products. For interested manufacturers, equipment investment costs are about 7 million yuan, annual output value is 3 million yuan, and annual profit should be at least 1 million yuan.
