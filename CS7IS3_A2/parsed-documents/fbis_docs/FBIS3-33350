Challu reiterated his warning that if Congress approves the patents law the United States wants, the prices of medicines "will go up 300 percent." He explained that CILFA, the umbrella organization of Argentine pharmaceutical laboratories, disagrees with Ambassador Cheek about this condition he is trying to impose because "first the terms on which Argentina will be able to join NAFTA must be established." Challu was talking about Ambassador Cheek's statement to the effect that congressional approval of the law on pharmaceutical patents was an essential requirement for Argentina to join the trade agreement between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. The pharmaceutical industry leader compared the ambassador's conditions to "a theater where people are asked to buy their ticket first and then it is decided whether they will be admitted and under what conditions." Challu also explained that CILFA "supports the amendment of the law on patents," but the organization disagrees with the U.S. ambassador "on two or three items" of the law. "Cheek wants exclusive rights, that is, a monopoly for companies that develop the products, and we believe it is better to pay them royalties while retaining the freedom to market and produce these products," Challu said. He added that CILFA also disagrees with the length of time the law will be in effect. Challu stressed that the disadvantages consumers of pharmaceutical products would face if the law on patents is approved, such as significant price increases, is "a vital issue." He said: "Unlike the case in the United States, which has a monopolistic system, free competition allows many companies to produce the same goods. If there is only one company that produces certain goods, it will be able to time the marketing of its product to its own advantage." One of CILFA's main arguments against the approval of the law on patents is the marked price increase that medicines will experience if the law goes into effect.
