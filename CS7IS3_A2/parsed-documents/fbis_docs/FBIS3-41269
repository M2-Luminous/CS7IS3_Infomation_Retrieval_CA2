The conference called on all nations to enact municipal legislation against laundering. A year later, the Nigerian authorities promulgated Decree No.48 of 1989 which provides a jail term of not less than 25 years as punishment for anyone convicted of laundering money earned from illegal drug trafficking. The law also stipulates a fine of 2 million naira for a corporate body found guilty of laundering. This was roughly five years ago. But since then no single person has been prosecuted under the decree. The impression which one will get from this is that money laundering has not been going on in Nigeria. But this is most probably a wrong impression. Not many Nigerians are unaware of the establishment of large-scale ventures by proprietors whose sources of income are questionable. But problem really is that most Nigerians do not bother to ask pertinent questions about sources of income. And this is why the society tends to accommodate all sorts of characters who use money from whatever source to procure respectability. With law, however, it should be a different matter altogether. The law enforcement agencies should be encouraged or even compelled to trace the sources of sudden wealth by individuals or groups. The aim in this particular consideration is to prevent or stamp out money laundering which constitutes a serious danger to the economy. There are several ways of laundering drug money. The most prominent is through bank transactions. The proceeds with drug business are lodged in a bank, particularly in a country where the transactions were carried out or in a neighboring state. The money is lodged by using fictitious business names. In most cases, the banks are interested in the economic gains which may accrue from such huge lodgement. Besides, the banks emphasize the need for confidentiality between them and their customers. The launderer then repatriates the money, sometimes through inter-bank transactions or through what looks like a legitimate business venture. That explains why such businesses as boutiques, supermarkets of expensive tastes, and motor companies parading luxury and state of the art vehicles spring up in parts of the country. Some of the drug traffickers import goods with the proceeds and these are brought into the country through the sea port. At the port, there is a syndicate which cuts across all departments which make sure that there is no hitch in clearing the goods and other transactions. As for the economy as a whole, it is believed that the black or autonomous market, through which the naira is traded at very low rate in relations with other currencies, responded largely with proceeds from drug trafficking. Besides, the drug traffickers, through their expensive tastes, have infested the society with strange orientations. In a situation where money can be got through easily or repatriated with little effort, not many people would like to depend on hard work to earn their livelihood. They would rather join the company of drug peddlers to make the easy money. This is a terrible danger to the society. As the need to check the adverse effect of laundering on the nation and its economy becomes imperative, it may be necessary to review the relevant legislations to make it possible for security agents to investigate bank accounts without hindrance. The banks themselves should be compelled to inquire into the sources of huge lodgements and alert the appropriate authorities. In this way, the country would be put in a better position to protect its economy from the effects of money laundering.
