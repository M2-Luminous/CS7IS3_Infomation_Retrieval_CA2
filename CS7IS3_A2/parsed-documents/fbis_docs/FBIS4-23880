[passage omitted] [Correspondent] Concerning the authorities that you met--these included the Rwandan authorities. Does meeting the Rwandan Government authorities mean recognition by Burundi? [Ntibantunganya] Burundi is trying to find ways to bring the warring parties together because we know that the two sides are fighting. What we want is for the two sides to understand one another. We also asked for a meeting with the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], but a meeting was not possible. What we want is to listen to all sides, and then to try to discover what can help them understand one another, in order to end the war. No one can support massacres. The second thing is that if the war in Rwanda continues, it could adversely affect our region. No leader in our region can overlook this. At the meeting of the heads of state of our region we invited all the parties, the RPF and the Rwandan Government, in order to listen to them. Even at the OAU level, there are heads of state who expressed the wish to come so that we could listen to them, but that wish was not realized.
