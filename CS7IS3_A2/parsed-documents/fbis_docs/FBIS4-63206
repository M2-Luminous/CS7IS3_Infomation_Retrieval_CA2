Deputy Head of the Russian Foreign Economic Relations Department for Multilateral Cooperation Maksim Medvedkov told Interfax that to adopt the package, approved by all other EU members on May 16, would make the prospect of the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between the Russian Federation and the European Union being initialled and then signed in June or July a reality. The Shokhin-Brittan agreements concerned ways to settle the two most burning issues in Russian economic relations with the EU: the conditions for the activity of foreign banks in Russia and trade regulations for substances used in the nuclear industry, particularly uranium, which has become a true stumbling block. Medvedkov said that France was afraid that Russian uranium exports would deliver a blow to its own nuclear fuel exports to EU countries. He said he doubted that France had any other reason to veto the Shokhin-Brittan deal or the signing of the partnership and cooperation agreement itself. He said France was simply making the latest in a series of attempts to tailor the regulations governing uranium sales to its own requirements but without providing so much as a hint of an argument in defense of its position. "France's fears are economically groundless and are more abstract in character," Medvedkov commented. Paris was concerned, for example, that Russia would try to inundate Europe with its uranium at some future date and alter the existing market. "That assumption too is unfounded, since EU restrictions on the export of fissile substances exist, and there are other Euroatom rules which are binding for Russia," he said. Russia and France will discuss this complex issue and other difficulties associated with the signing of the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between Russia and the EU during the current visit by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe to Moscow.
