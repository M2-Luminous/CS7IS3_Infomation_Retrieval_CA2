The arrests were made last night at Balloch, Strathclyde, near the Royal Navy base on the Clyde where Polaris and Trident nuclear submarines are sited. The Scottish skirmish was the latest in a series of clashes between the convoys, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and other peace protesters. Trucks with police motorcycle outriders were briefly halted earlier today by protesters at Albermarle, near Newcastle upon Tyne, and then Stirling in Scotland. Anti-nuclear campaigners claimed the convoy was one of those which regularly took warheads between Burghfield, Berks, and the Clyde submarine base. Pat Freeborn said it was impeded near Balloch when demonstrators chained themselves to vehicles and daubed them with paint in protest at warheads being carried on public roads. "If they are going to have such dangerous weapons, there must be another method of moving them," he said. "They are going to end up blowing up the very people they are supposed to be protecting." The Ministry of Defence said there were "incidents" today involving a military convoy, but described them as minor and would not confirm the presence of nuclear warhead carriers. Police said 15 men and seven women were arrested over an alleged breach of the peace but could not say if they would appear in court.
