This meeting will follow on directly from a meeting of the homologous European (Community) (EC)-China Committee. On Wednesday, before the latter dispersed, the Belgian delegation contacted observers at the meeting (which was chaired by European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan -- BELGA editor's note) with a view to taking its bearings. Generally speaking, during the BLEU-China trade negotiations which will start this Thursday with an interview with Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi, Minister Urbain intends to align his position with that of the EC in all areas, including that concerning the normalization of human rights. Cooperation between Europe and China is still governed by an economic and trade cooperation agreement revised in 1985, which aims at increasing reciprocal imports at the market price in priority sectors (mining, energy, transport, telecommunications, technology -- BELGA editor's note). European-Chinese cooperation was brutally interrupted in June 1989 (Tien An Men -- BELGA editor's note) and gradually built up again in 1991. Their full normalization remains subordinate to progress on the question of human rights, and two "sanctions" are theoretically still in application (meaning no visits by heads of state, a provision which has not in fact been respected, and the interruption of military cooperation and arms sales -- BELGA editor's note). [passage omitted] The essential precondition imposed by Europe with a view to achieving full normalization and, above all, supporting China's request with a view to its full and complete reintegration into GATT as from 1996, concerns the accelerated emergence of a real market economy, especially through adaptation of the Chinese tax system (a single VAT [value added tax] of 17 percent has just been adopted, but many hindrances remain at the level of the cooperation from one day to the next with European companies, e.g., the virtual doubling of the price of services since the start of 1994 -- BELGA editor's note), abandoning all dumping practices, and endeavoring hard to integrate environmental, safety, and hygiene standards into economic trade in general, as well as increased respect for intellectual property rights.
