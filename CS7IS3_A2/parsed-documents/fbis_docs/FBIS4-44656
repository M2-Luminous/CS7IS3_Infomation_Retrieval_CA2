The SSC was designed primarily to elucidate the mechanism by which elementary particles acquire mass. In order to do this, the SSC would have consisted of a large accelerator capable of colliding protons at energies 20 times larger than currently available. While almost no one in the U.S. questioned the fact that the SSC would have been a superb scientific instrument, in the end it was sacrificed on the altar of the budget deficit. It is estimated that the final cost to the U.S. taxpayer could be as high as $4 billion. The termination of the SSC has thrown long-term plans for the future of particle physics into confusion. A series of meetings in the last few months at CERN, the European centre for particle physics research in Geneva, has surveyed the new landscape. Enter the LHC The only proposal now capable of ensuring that we can throw light on the origin of mass is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), planned to be constructed at CERN. Since it will operate in the same tunnel as the Large Electron Position (LEP) collider, it will be much cheaper than the SSC was projected to be. The LHC design document has now been produced and it is clear that there are technically no outstanding questions hindering its approval. Chris Llewellyn Smith, an eminent UK physicist and the new director-general of CERN, has outlined the project strategy The intention is to construct the LHC from within the current CERN Budget -- contributed to by all member states in proportion to their net national incomes. He believes that construction could be achieved without extra resources provided that CERN is allowed to take out small "bridging loans," either from member states in the form of advanced subscription payments, or from banks. These would allow the smoothing out of the peaks in expenditure which are inevitable in large projects and permit construction within a constant budget. Completion would be in 2002 and any necessary loans would be paid off by 2006. If extra contributions were available, for instance from non-member states, then naturally the situation would become even more favourable. Llewellyn Smith has already warned that these timescales are long ones, and that prompt approval is both desirable and necessary to maintain momentum and to ensure that the essential groups of engineers and physicists can continue work on the project. Preliminary steps towards this goal were taken at the CERN Council meeting last December and, although some delegations -- including those of the UK and Germany -- expressed reservations, it currently seems hopeful that these can be overcome and that approval for the project can be gained at the next Council meeting in June. Attractive Proposition Curiously, one problem which currently might stand in the way of LHC approval is the demise of the SSC. It might seem that the disappearance of a competing project should make things easier. But the problem lies in the attractiveness and popularity of the LHC. Many U.S. and Japanese physicists who had intended to work on the SSC now wish to work on the LHC. However, CERN is primarily a European facility and the admission of a large contingent of U.S. and other non-member-state physicists is therefore far from simple. An overview of the current state of U.S. particle physics was given at a meeting of the European Committee for Future Accelerators in December by Stan Wojciki, chairman of the prestigious panel which advises the U.S. Department of Energy on particle physics. Clearly, the demise of the SSC, which was the major future project in the U.S., has been a very traumatic event. Many U.S. groups who were taking a lead in the SSC experimental preparations are now searching for a future activity. Although the U.S. is still operating successful accelerators, particularly at Fermilab near Chicago, their lifetime is limited to a few more years at best. New U.S. initiatives will necessarily be on a much smaller scale than the SSC. All of this points to increased U.S. participation in CERN, in particular the LHC project. However, such participation would have to be agreed upon by the U.S. Congress. Having just cut off funding for a U.S.-based accelerator, it is difficult to imagine Congress voting to bind itself to spending substantial sums of money over an indefinite period to allow its physicists to decamp to Europe and engage in high-tech activities with some of its biggest economic competitors. Nevertheless, it is clear that U.S. participation in the LHC can only take place if there is an equitable financial contribution both to LHC construction and to the running of CERN. This is also true of Japan. Japanese plans for particle physics imply no firm commitment to making an immediate financial contribution to CERN, although this could well be forthcoming in the longer term. The problem of allowing access to CERN by scientists from non-member states could be solved in a variety of ways. For instance, CERN could be fully internationalized to become a world laboratory for particle physics. Alternatively, a new world organization, of which CERN would become one of a number of regional centres, could be set up. Finally, the structure and membership of CERN could be left essentially unchanged and non-member states allowed to participate in any of all of the CERN programmes by a number of ad- hoc bilateral agreements. There are enormous problems with the first two options. Full internationalization of CERN would produce an unwieldy organization without a strong regional identity. Many member states are understandably reluctant to sacrifice CERN's states as one of the few unambiguously successful pan-European institutions. The second option is likely to be a very long and complicated procedure given that, as yet, there is no clear blueprint for the form of such an international organization, nor for any umbrella organization it might operate under. Nevertheless, there is a growing feeling among the physics community that this is a desirable goal for the long term, if only to avoid the waste of resources inherent in disasters such as the cancellation of the SSC. It is sobering to realize that the amount of money which will have been spent by the time the SSC is properly terminated would have sufficed to fund the entire CERN programme, including the LHC construction, for about a decade. Many physicists are now bending their minds to find ways of achieving an organization which would strengthen the international dimension of the subject while preserving the best features of proven institutions such as CERN. The third option -- concluding ad-hoc bilateral agreements -- is the only practicable one in the short term. However, it is essential that the approval of CERN's future programme is not made contingent on the successful conclusion of any such agreements. it seems very unlikely that, for example, U.S. funding could be available for LHC participation before FY96. Positive Contribution The LHC is technically now ripe for approval: It could be built within CERN's own financial resources, to which any non-member-state contribution would be helpful but not essential, and it is imperative that it be approved soon if the momentum and cohesion of the teams of physicists and engineers who will build it and perform its experiments are not to be lost. In the next few months European governments, the UK prominent among them, will have the chance to approve a project that will ensure the pre-eminence of European particle physics for the forseeable future. More importantly, a positive decision will result in timely construction, at no extra cost to the taxpayer, and thereby provide the only instrument that we can be certain will help us to understand why the universe has mass.
