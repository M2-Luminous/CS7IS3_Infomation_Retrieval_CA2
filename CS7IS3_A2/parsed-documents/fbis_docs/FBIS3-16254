And whereas the first task was soon resolved -- Bill Clinton responded with $100 million and the Congress agreed to consider increasing that sum -- the second task proved a far harder nut to crack. After announcing full political support for the peacemaking efforts the White House boss nevertheless categorically avoided promising to send his soldiers to the Transcaucasus. Not even under the blue flag of the United Nations. Nevertheless, the U.S. President did give his word to head an international movement to send the UN blue helmets to the border with Abkhazia. This measure will be particularly beneficial given that the latest round of Georgian-Abkhazian talks held in the past few days at UN headquarters in New York ended fruitlessly. But the idea of international involvement in the search for ways out of the crisis, by all accounts, has not been abandoned by the Georgian leader. He took that idea to New York, where he met with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and set out his plan at a session of the Security Council. There are three "buttresses" to this plan: the creation of a directorate involving the opposing sides and representatives of the High Commissioner for Refugees, Russia, the "friends of Georgia" group, and other UN member states, the institution of a mixed administration in Abkhazia, and after that elections under international control and the formation of new organs of power based on those elections. "A specially created international organ is operating under UN auspices, with the assistance [sodeystviye] of the Russian Federation, and the participation of the CSCE," Eduard Shevardnadze said, "which will cooperate with the directorate and the government of the Republic of Georgia in elaborating and implementing a program for the economic revival of Abkhazia."
