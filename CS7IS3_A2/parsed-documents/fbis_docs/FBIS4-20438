These 10-21-nm-diameter carbon tubes have been fabricated via electric arc discharge with the following parameters: externally applied voltage is 20 V, dc current is about 200 A, helium gas pressure within the discharge chamber is about 500 x 133.332 Pa, and diameters of the two graphite rods used as discharge electrodes are 6 mm and 20 mm. Figure 1 below shows high-resolution electron micrographs of the carbon nanotubes; Figure 1(a) indicates that the carbon nanotube consists of two-layer or multilayer coaxial carbon films, with the cap sealed by a conical carbon film. Figure 1(b) shows a transverse cross section with two types of structures -- one type consists of the traditional quasi-concentric circles while the second (first newly discovered) type consists of quasi-rectangles (upper right part of figure). The second newly discovered type of carbon nanotube, with a quasi-triangular transverse cross section, is shown below in Figure 2. Figure 1. High-Resolution Electron Micrographs of Carbon Figure 2.
