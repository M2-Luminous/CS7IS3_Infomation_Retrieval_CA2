"Without any support, my government is changing this country and giving it an efficient and productive economic structure," said the 72-year-old president, who described his rivals as "the crazy opposition." However, Duran-Ballen did not confirm the plebiscite, suggested by Vice President Alberto Dahik the previous evening, to solve the problems of governability caused by a political structure that furthers conflict between government branches. The suggestion made by Dahik, who is considered to be the liberal government's ideologue, unleashed a wave of criticism and charges that the government is trying to alter the ongoing electoral process and avoid a defeat which, according to the polls, will be overwhelming. The government's acceptance rating is under 10 percent, thus, it can be anticipated that the opposition will obtain a large majority of the 65 deputy positions -- in the 77-member Congress -- to be renewed on 1 May. The opposition-controlled Congress has halted the bills presented by the government to change the economic structure, which is very centralized presently. "They are damaging the country, not me. They, however, care nothing for the country," Duran-Ballen stated when he commented on the "perverse obstructionism." Despite the blocking of the bills, the government has announced it will start to privatize some of the 167 public firms this year. This action is part of the "Modernize the Government" program which will also reduce the number of bureaucrats and fiscal expenses. "We will continue the program until 1996" (when his term ends), reiterated Duran-Ballen today. "The crazy opposition will not stop us," he added.
