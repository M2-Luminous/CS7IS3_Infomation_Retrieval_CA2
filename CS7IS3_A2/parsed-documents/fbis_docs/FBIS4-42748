But he did not win over to the yes line the 250 delegates who had gathered at Cirkus in Stockholm. Late on Saturday night after 12 hours of debate the congress voted, as had been tipped, by 131 votes to 117 against EU membership. Two delegates abstained. Social Democratic Party secretary Mona Sahlin told TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA after the vote that she has great respect for the decision even through she herself takes a different view of the EU question. The SSU adopted a strategy that was more or less the same as that of its Social Democratic mother party. At the regular SSU congress last year it was decided that an extraordinary congress should be held once the negotiations with the EU were complete. The SSU leadership, like the party's, has spoken out in favor of membership. The SSU board was split: 10 for and 3 against membership. There is one decisive difference between the party and its youth organization. The same delegates will attend the Social Democrats' extraordinary congress 18-19 June as attended the regular congress last year. The SSU delegates -- the vast majority of them born in the seventies -- had, however, been elected at annual conferences around the country on the basis of their attitudes to the EU. The SSU leadership had therefore a pretty clear picture of the situation prior to Saturday's extraordinary congress. The heavyweight delegations from Stockholm and Goteborg had called for a no in their motions. Remarkably enough Skane arrived with a delegation consisting entirely of no sayers, while Norrbotten fielded a majority from the yes side. Usually interest in EU membership becomes cooler the farther north in the country one travels. For the youth organization as for the mother party the important thing is to keep ranks united in the future despite the split on the EU question. "There are those who hope that we will battle to the death here today. They want nothing more than to see the SSU and the Social Democratic movement politically wounded in the run-up to this fall's Riksdag elections," Thorwaldsson said when he opened the congress. "But they have underestimated our strength in being able to hold dangerous free debates and then reach decisions in comradeship." He said that the congress was about whether the EU is the right or the wrong way to go in order to achieve the common goal: to tame market forces and set up rules for international capitalism. There were delegates who said that the SSU should not reach any decision at all on the EU. After all the decision does not tie members' hands in the referendum. It was decided that the SSU will not be a campaigning organization in the referendum, but members of the organization's board will follow the organization's line when they represent the SSU on the EU question.
