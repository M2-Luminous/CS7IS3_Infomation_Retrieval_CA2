At a meeting convened this morning at the headquarters of the CAAC, Zou Jiahua officially announced the appointment of the new leaders of the CAAC. Chen Guangyi, former provincial party secretary of Fujian, has been named as director of CAAC, while Jiang Zhuping, Yan Zhixiang, Li Zhao, Shen Yuankang and Bao Peide have been appointed as vice-directors. In his speech, Zou reviewed the development of CAAC since the founding of New China, and praised the contributions of CAAC to the development of the national economy. But he also pointed out that problems still exist in the country's civil aviation industry, and that CAAC should recognize its defects and improve its work. Zou stressed that civil aviation work should continue to pursue the guiding principle of "safety first, normal flights and quality service," which was put forward by the late Premier Zhou Enlai. Even today the principle still bears immediate significance. Zou reiterated the general purpose of civil aviation work, which is "serving the passengers, serving the development of the national economy," adding that passengers' opinions are the best gauge for CAAC's work. Zou also urged the CAAC to develop a good style of work. The CAAC staff should be united, realistic, inventive and honest, he said. CAAC's new director, Chen Guangyi, also made a speech at the meeting, saying that the CAAC has much to do to maintain air safety. All CAAC staff should be inspired with great enthusiasm to establish a good image in the world for CAAC. Chen, aged 61, was vice-secretary and governor of Gansu Province until 1986 when he was transferred to be Communist Party secretary of Fujian Province. Last month he was appointed director of CAAC.
