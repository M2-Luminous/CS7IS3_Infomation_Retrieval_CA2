Eighteen Asian and Pacific nations are expected to take part as well as representatives from international bodies involved in immigration issues. Australia's immigration minister, Nick Bolkus, says the practice amounts to slavery and has been growing in the Asia-Pacific region. Senator Bolkus told Linda Mottram it is a multi-billion dollar industry with organized crime links. [Begin recording] [Bolkus] To the extent that people can be smuggled into places and money is there for this to be done, people are focussing on those countries that they can smuggle them into. Although I think for all of us there has been a cooperative spirit in the past in respect to these issues, but we think that by having this regional conference in Australia we can have a cooperative spirit building in a way that we can preempt some of the problems in our region. [Mottram] What are the parallels specifically then between this consultation arrangement you have put in place and the agreed common plan of action in the eighties dealing with the Indochina boat people problem? [Bolkus] Well, in respect to that I think that the plan of action -- the comprehensive plan of action -- had as its target the orderly processing of potential refugees, the orderly acceptance of those people, and of course, the orderly return of those who were determined not to be refugees. So, there is always an element of what to do with non bona fide refugees. When it comes to people smuggling, we have always got to accept that some people are bona fide refugees, but when you are talking about organized crime involvement in people smuggling, you have also got to accept that we are talking overwhelmingly, I think, of cases that do not fit within our refugee category. The current approach is worth dwelling on. The comprehensive plan of action we got together with other countries in our region had worked on the problem which dealt with both refugees and non refugees. In this case, we are getting together once again with the countries in our region and other international mechanisms to once again work at, in this case, for greater priority on illegal smuggling, but also recognizing a need to be sensitive to the bona fide refugees. [Mottram] The Indochinese issue is of course a trigger for quite some significant regional attention from time to time. Do you see a similar regional heat being generated over people smuggling? [Bolkus] I don't think so. I think already there have been discussions, for instance with the USA and China, on this issue. Our region is fully aware of the problem and I think many countries in the region can see themselves as being targets of this specific problem and they don't like it. So I think there is a common awareness, common direction in our region to: one, recognize the problem; two, define the extent of it; and three, work together to try and overcome it. But I think when you have got that common bond in the early stage that we have now, I think you are actually working toward overcoming the tensions down the road. I think we should look at previous experience. Tensions arose because countries are caught flat footed. [end recording]
