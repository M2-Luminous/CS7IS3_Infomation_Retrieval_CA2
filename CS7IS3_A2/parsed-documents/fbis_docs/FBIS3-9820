Data of the security services indicated that prohibited trade had been taking place for quite some time at 26 points along the "lines of contact," mainly with the Muslim army. Military experts estimated that this phenomenon is a "form of planned special warfare" and that it could seriously threaten the country's defense capability. On 18 January 1994, the president of the state formed a state commission headed by Major General Bogdan Subotic to interdict this phenomenon "by all available means." The chairman of the state commission has formed a staff of the best-known experts from Public Security and Military Security, inspectorates, and judicial bodies, and he chose for the operation known as "Border 94" Teslic Opstina, in which the border with the Muslim army is about 120 km long, and where trade with the enemy has assumed "disturbing proportions." The knowledge gained by the state commission has astonished everyone. In Vucja Planina an open-air market where several hundred people gathered has "operated" daily right alongside the trenches. Serbian and Muslim soldiers, Serbian and Muslim civilians, were buying and selling. Everything was being sold, just like at the ordinary open-air market. The Serbs even hauled goods to the Muslim trenches in trucks. The Muslims were being sold artillery shells and even mortars. The Serbs in Teslic who live in daily fear of shelling, who have come to the town from the direction of Tesanj, cannot believe that the Serbian soldiers are selling those same shells to the Muslims. The Fund During the operation, which lasted a month in Teslic, goods intended for prohibited trade were confiscated in the amount of 990,000 German marks [DM]. Cash derived from prohibited trade amounting to DM337,698, 42,870 Austrian schillings, 18,000 Swiss francs, and $3,250 was confiscated from individuals. Inspections by the inspectorate shut down 35 private firms and independent shops. Twenty-three legal entities inspected were found not to have paid state tax on time in the amount of DM3,403,427. With the interest accrued, the tax obligation of those debtors amounts to DM9,655,000. Criminal and misdemeanor charges were filed against 422 persons, and 49 persons were detained. Criminal charges were also filed against the opstina president, the former chairman of the Executive Committee, the chief of the public security station, and several enterprise managers. The business being done by the wartime suppliers runs into millions of marks ending up in the pockets of individuals. Along the lengthy chain of middlemen, the earnings are beyond the dreams of ordinary mortals. DM250,000 were found buried in the vicinity of the house of someone living near the demarcation line on Vucja Planina. Among the mysterious stories circulating in Teslic, the most interesting one is about the flight of two Muslim soldiers taken prisoner as they were carrying on trade along the line. These two prisoners disappeared one night from the detention facilities of the military police in Teslic, and the manner of their escape and who is to blame for it has not been ascertained to this day. There is suspicion that they were released so that they would not expose those with whom they were trading or that they themselves were traded in a good bit of business. The state commission obtained much more important knowledge in its study of the operation of opstina authorities and commercial firms. It was found that the opstina had its own fund of foreign exchange, referred to as the war fund, which by opstina decision was receiving the income tax on individuals working abroad in the amount of DM300 per month and DM50 for individuals working in republics of the former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. According to the republic statute, this tax has been uniformly set for the entire republic at DM200 and is a revenue of the state itself. Not only did the opstina authority not respect the republic statute, but it evaded all the rules of business finance in the way it handled the money collected. No decision was made on establishment of the fund, no rules were established on conducting its affairs, nor were management authorities elected.... The funds were handled by the opstina president, the chairman of the Executive Committee, the secretary of the Secretariat for the Economy, and the chief accountant: by word of mouth, in writing, over the telephone, however it suited them. Money was given to individuals, who signed a receipt that was thrown away when the money was repaid. DM5 million were spent from the "war fund" in slightly more than a year and a half. The List The funds were used by government-owned and private commercial firms, institutions, government bodies, and individuals.... Individuals carried some of the foreign exchange in briefcases to Belgrade where they exchanged it in private currency exchanges at an exchange rate known only to themselves. The people and the government can only guess as to their honesty and integrity. It is sufficient to know that the merchants carried to Serbia hundreds of thousands of marks to buy flour, sugar, oil, and other goods, while at the same time inflation was rendering worthless the immense claims of the Teslic economy in Serbia. Anyone who risked suspicion knew why he did so. An examination of the financial and accounting documents of commercial firms revealed all the shortcomings of current legislation and all the resourcefulness of dishonest merchants. Imported goods are accompanied by one set of documents to the border, another set from the border to the destination, and then it is all shredded. Bills of lading are even used made out to customers who have nothing at all to do with the goods ordered except being located in the same town. Thus, there are cases, according to the documentation, when the business of certain firms has increased slightly over the previous year, although everyone knows that trade has been flourishing. Given this way of doing business and taxes made worthless by inflation, it is clear how individuals have acquired immense wealth in a short time through trade. While the state commission is writing up criminal charges and making a list of illegalities and irregularities committed in the presence and with the blessing of the authorities, the opstina committee of the SDS [Serbian Democratic Party] is writing up a list of enterprise managers and government officials who are not members of the party and on whose trustworthiness members of the SDS opstina committee are to take a position. Of the 32 enterprise directors and officials on the list, only eight are members of the party. The rest are to be removed, but it is not clear who will do this and how. One thing is certain: The new uniformity of thought is turning the proclaimed democracy into dictatorship, and all the rest is familiar territory. The Remedy Members of the staff of the operation "Border 94" in Teslic are concluding on the basis of that operation's results that the pattern in Teslic reflects that in the entire republic. For a well-meaning observer of local conditions, the logical conclusion cannot be avoided that the present chaotic situation is the result of the wrong policy by the wrong people. How otherwise to explain the fact that criminal charges have been filed against the most responsible individuals in the opstina government? How is one to explain the fact that opstina authorities have done nothing to thwart and prevent goods from reaching the front line? Gen. Subotic declared war on criminals in a press conference which he held in the Culture Center in Banja Luka on 25 February, and that same evening on the program "Open Screen" over Banja Luka television. Viewers gave him credit and offered him support, but did not fail to ask him when he would get around to other cities and when the people would finally learn who the culprits were in the affair of the "Golfs." The general was self-confident and made a public promise that the commission would take its work to the end and that the time would come ultimately when the culprits in the well-known scandal of the "Golfs" would be made public. It remains to be seen whether the general was caught by an embarrassing question or the time of truth has really come. Quite a few people are doubtful about the success of the general's campaign. By and large, the people have stood by the general, and his failure could signify defeat of a policy.
