Not because it is the first official visit, but because it represents the end of a period in the relations between Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Bulgaria, and the beginning of a new one." At a news conference held yesterday afternoon, these were the words with which the President of the Republic of Bulgaria Zelyu Zhelev assessed the visit and the discussions held with President Gligorov. "This is our fourth meeting and my feeling is that we can urge the promotion of relations between the two countries. The Republic of Macedonia, as an independent country, has proven to be a condition for the stability in the Balkans. Macedonia is opposed to any alliances or prominences, because they can lead to new divisions in the Balkans. The Balkans are mixed, so we must respect each other and must not allow constant repetitions of Balkan wars, which brought nothing good to any of the nations." This is how President Kiro Gligorov assessed his first official visit to Bulgaria at yesterday's news conference. In front of hundreds of journalists, the two presidents answered a number of "ticklish" questions, such as what was the number of Bulgarians in Macedonia. President Kiro Gligorov replied that, according to the last census, around 3,000 persons declared themselves as Bulgarians, but Macedonia will soon have a census under an international control, and that it was in our own interest to know who lives in Macedonia and in what number. A similar question was asked of Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev, to which he replied that according to the last census around 7,000 persons declared themselves Macedonians, and only 600-700 did not state their mother tongue was Bulgarian. There were several questions concerning the non-signed agreements between the two states. The dispute came out when Macedonia refused to sign the documents which said that the "documents will be signed in the official languages of the two states," because the Macedonian side considered it should be stated that the agreements would be signed in Macedonian and Bulgarian. The documents are to be signed in the official languages of the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Bulgaria. Therefore, in two languages. "Our side insisted on accepting this formulation," President Zhelyu Zhelev said, adding that the languages are a reality and that there should be no obstacles in promoting the relations. "If we think of a language in different formulations, it is a problem of great concern. We cannot sign anything that is not written in our own language, because the language is a part of the identity of a nation. We should not go back to the past, we should go to the reality instead, and the language in which the documents will be signed is one of the questions. I believe that democratic Bulgaria will soon take off that issue from the agenda," President Kiro Gligorov said. After the afternoon news conference and the solemn farewell at the "Boyana" Residence, the two-day official visit of the Macedonian president to the Republic of Bulgaria was accomplished. In the morning President Gligorov visited the Embassy of the Republic of Macedonia in Sofia and held discussions with some Macedonian representatives in Sofia. The working part of the visit continued also in the afternoon. President Gligorov met Mr. Evgeni Matinchev, deputy prime minister of the Republic of Bulgaria, with whom he discussed the agreements that are expected to be signed soon. First of all, the agreements are related to the railroad links between the two states, the economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries. On the other hand, according to the protocol, President Gligorov was supposed to meet Prime Minister Lyuben Berov; however, this visit was canceled due to sickness. After the discussions, the deputy prime minister and his wife organized lunch for the Macedonian president, and in the afternoon President Gligorov addressed the delegates of the Bulgarian National Assembly, which was broadcast by radio and television. The delegates and the numerous diplomatic representatives greeted the arrival of President Kiro Gligorov in the Parliament with loud applause. After the introductory speech of the Bulgarian Chairman of Parliament Yordanov, President Gligorov addressed the Bulgarian parliamentarians. "Today we all share the responsibility of taking history as a guide, and using our own and other people's experiences to the maximum. It is indispensable for us to learn the lesson about living our own lives, but all of us near each other. I firmly believe that the conscious commitment to coexistence and mutual confidence can be the key to peace and stability in the Balkans. It is particularly important to abide by the principles of respect for the existing borders between the states, of respect for the rights of minorities, and to solve all problems through political and peaceful means. We managed to contribute to peace and stability in the region. We are convinced it is of real interest to other nations, too, including the Bulgarian people and all the citizens of the Republic of Bulgaria," President Gligorov said. In his speech Gligorov reviewed the infrastructural connection with the East-West axis. "We consider that action," Gligorov said, "for which purpose financial means from Macedonia, Bulgaria, Albania, Turkey and Italy have already been engaged, as an investment for the future and as an outline for the development of the whole region of southeast Europe." Toward the end of his speech, Gligorov also reviewed the relations among the Balkan countries and nations. Recalling the historical complexity in their relations, Gligorov emphasized: ``It is also filled with many conflicts and misunderstandings, often for and about Macedonia. Unfortunately, some have still been maintained in some areas. However, some of the illusions covered with crust are being destroyed. We would like, and would be very happy, if that became the prevailing opinion in the Balkans, so as to liberate this region from the historical illnesses and myths once and for all. We must construct mutual confidence on a long-term and responsible basis as an indispensable premise for any agreement, as the key which will eliminate, on a long-term plan, all roots of conflicts and instability in the mutual relations throughout the region.'' [Box, p 5] Reactions in the Bulgarian Media All Bulgarian newspapers and the radio and television of our eastern neighbor gave great publicity to the two-day official visit of Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov to Bulgaria. The distinguished STANDARD assessed yesterday that "Gligorov and Zhelev decided to put an end to the political dispute," explaining the importance of the information that the Macedonian president provoked a great interest not only with the Bulgarian and Macedonian journalists, but also with the numerous detachments of Greek and other foreign journalists following this visit. Nearly all reports pointed out the "misunderstanding about the use of the languages" for which the Bulgarian side still claims that the interstate agreements should be signed in the "official languages of the two countries." The newspaper 24 CHASA, with a large circulation, went farthest in assessing the visit of Kiro Gligorov to Sofia, saying: "The language scandal between the two countries continues."
