FBIS4-49898 "drchi092_d_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-092 Daily Report 10 May 1994 Northeast Asia Magazine To Publish Japanese Documents on Nanjing `Massacre' Magazine To Publish Japanese Documents on Nanjing `Massacre' OW1005133894 Tokyo KYODO in English 0655 GMT 10 May 94 OW1005133894 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Beijing, May 10 KYODO -- A Chinese magazine will later this month publish "top secret" Japanese documents aiming to verify the true nature of the 1937 massacre of Chinese civilians in Nanjing, state press reported Tuesday [10 May]. "MINGUO DANGAN (Files of the Republic) will publish for the first time historic files written by the Japanese invaders themselves which will uncover the true facts of the Nanjing massacre," Xinhua News Agency reported. The documents, marked "top secret," were produced by a special group of the South Manchuria Railway, a railway company set up in northeast China by the invading Japanese, the report said. In mid-January 1938 the group reported that a 600-member team was formed and had buried around 5,000 corpses by the beginning of February. By March 15, after three months, the group reported that 1,793 corpses had been buried inside Nanjing and 29,998 were buried outside the city. According to the XINHUA report, charitable and benevolent groups, such as the Red Cross, were involved in burying the dead. "So if the Red Cross could bury some 30,000 corpses in three months, then it can be seen that the number of Nanjing citizens slaughtered by the invading Japanese Army was large," it said. The documents have been kept with files in the northeastern province of Liaoning, it said. The Chinese Government and citizens have long questioned the Japanese interpretation of its 1931-45 invasion of China and was especially outraged when former Japanese Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano last week called the Nanjing Massacre "a fabrication." Nagano, who also denied Japan was the aggressor in the war, has since resigned, but in China his statements have open up old wounds that have never completely healed. China estimates that Imperial Japanese Army troops massacred more than 300,000 Chinese civilians following their invasion of the then Chinese capital of Nanjing in December 1937. According to estimates given at the Tokyo war crimes tribunal in 1948, about 42,000 civilians were killed in Nanjing and more than 100,000 civilians and prisoners of war were killed in the vicinity over the next six weeks.
