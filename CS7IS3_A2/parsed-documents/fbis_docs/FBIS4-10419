They come from cities like Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Nijni Novgorod--among others. Their passports say Vladimir, Ilia, Igor, Irina, and Olga. The Russians are coming to town in an invasion as sweet as their Slavic accents. The wave is swelling to such a point as to constitute a new tourist boom, far from the prejudices of the Cold War. But the invasion has not only sent tourists; it has brought more than 30 scientists and high-tech researchers, first-rate "brains" from the former Soviet Union, now settled down and teaching at institutions like Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ) and the State University of Northern Rio de Janeiro [UENF] in Campos. "For us in Rio, this is an occasion as important as the arrival of 40 of Europe's brightest at the University of Sao Paulo (USP) during the Second World War. It was that importation of `brains' that gave USP the influence it has today," said Senator Darcy Ribeiro. Competition As chancellor of UENF, Ribeiro has already sent three delegations to Russia to compete--mainly with Israel, Germany, the United States, and Japan--for the chance to transfer to Brazil "22 of the best and the brightest," who were orphaned by the dismantling of Soviet scientific institutions. Not wanting to be left behind in the seduction of Russian "brains," UERJ Rector Hesio Cordeiro has now brought five scientists to his campus. When it comes to tourism, it is also "the Russians' turn" now, said Olga Dalamarczuk, assigned by Hotur (Association of Tourist Hotels of Rio) to take care of the visitors from that country. In general, these are people from the middle class who have benefited from the economic reforms begun in 1992. An Aeroflot flight brings groups of 50 every week. That has led Riotur and Hotur to invest in promoting Rio in the Russian capital. Salary Makes Move Worthwhile "They say that if you go to Salvador, you'd better not drop anything on the floor because if it makes a noise the Bahians will think it is a new rhythm and will start dancing." The joke, which conveys a feeling of intimacy with things Brazilian, is told by Irina Potapenko, a Russian physicist and mathematician who has been here for three months. Along with her colleagues Arthur Elfimov, Vladimir Tsypin, Nicolay Grishanov, and Fedor Nekrasov--all theoreticians in plasma physics (a scientific field concerned with such things as making better use of solar energy)--she works at the Department of Quantum Electronics at the UERJ School of Physics. Like her colleagues, Irina likes Rio, "a city that combines modern buildings, the sea, unusual mountain shapes, and hospitable people," as she puts it. The Russian scientists earn $1,000 (CR$700,000) a month at UERJ. In their own country, researchers would earn only $80.00 (CR$56,000) a month. "Russia has no means of investing in science. But since scientific knowledge is universal, it is better to do the work here than sit idle back there. Later, we can take the results back home," said Elfimov. Supply The researchers recall that their country now has 1.5 million researchers at the doctorate level, plus 200,000 scientists who have attained the highest level of education--all of them susceptible to becoming part of the "brain drain." Another physicist, Sergei Ivanov, came to Rio to develop "x-ray equipment to measure tension inside metals." He lives with his wife Nina and daughter Maria in Leblon. "Russia pays specialists low wages. Some day I'll go back. Although my 9-year-old daughter, who attends Saint Patrick School in Leblon, wants to stay in Rio. You say there are criminals here? Well, there are criminals in Russia, too," observed Ivanov. At the State University of Northern Rio de Janeiro [UENF] in Campos, says its president, Gilca Wainstein, an elaborate process of transfer and absorption of technology is under way. "We sent delegations to the Russian Academy of Sciences and reviewed more than 80 resumes from each scientific field. The idea is that even if the Russians go back to their own country, they will leave the technology here," said the university president. At UENF, 22 Russian researchers are earning about $3,000 (CR$2.1 million) each. They work in sophisticated specialty fields of biotechnology, diamond technology, fracture and corrosion engineering, and oil and gas.
