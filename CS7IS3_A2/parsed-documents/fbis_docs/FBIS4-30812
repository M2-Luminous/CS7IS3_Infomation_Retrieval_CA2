Army General Rasim Delic, commander of the supreme command headquarters of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, spoke about the current military (situation) in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Bosnian Posavina. Mladen Bosnjak has a report. [Bosnjak] As Rifad (Semulabegovic), president of the Council of Bosnian Posavina, said in an introductory speech, the aim of the meeting of people from Posavina is to adopt conclusions on the eve of tomorrow's session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina assembly. They want to define the relationship of the federation's assembly with Posavina. [passage omitted] At the beginning of his speech, Army General Rasim Delic stressed that the balance of military power in Posavina is such that the aggressor, although technically incomparably superior, cannot do much to change the front lines. Regardless of the possibility of winning, Bosnia-Herzegovina Army units will not launch attacks on the technically superior aggressor and sacrifice its' people. However, they will use any opportunity to capture territory that is strategically very important for the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. He gave examples of having captured the strategically important locations such as Vijenac on Mt. Ozren and some locations on Mt. Vlasic. Speaking about the military aspect of severing the corridor near Brcko, Mr. Delic said: [Begin Delic recording] The army headquarters has made an official statement, I hope that our political bodies will uphold it, that if the Security Council discusses the protected area it will only speak about the protected zone of the free territory of Brcko, not of Serb-held Brcko. To protect Brcko is to protect the occupation. The deployment of the observers on the Serb side is a trap for us because they will monitor our activities. They wanted to ensure that if we start attacking, then we will be accused. [passage indistinct] Yesterday I had specific talks with Croat General Petkovic to see what interest the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] has to take part in [word indistinct] Bosnian Posavina. Bosnian Posavina does not belong only to the Muslims or the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. In the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army there are Muslims as well as people of other nationalities. We must find common ground. [passage omitted] [end recording]
