FBIS4-33504 "drlat107_s_94015" FBIS-LAT-94-107 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 IRAN * Report on Spreading Strikes at Universities * Report on Spreading Strikes at Universities 94LA0168A Stockholm NAMEH-YE MARDOM in Persian 12 Apr 94 p 4 94LA0168A Stockholm NAMEH-YE MARDOM Persian CSO [Text] Concurrent with the unprecedented intensification of the economic and social crisis in the country and increasing mass protests by an exasperated public, reports have been received of the spread of student strikes. Following the student strike at Martyr Beheshti University in Tehran (formerly the National University), which began as a strike by women students against the unworkable situation at the student dormitories and quickly spread throughout the university, the strike continued for a week with a demand for the firing of the university management. Based on this report, whose details are still unclear, 500 accounting students at Tehran's 'Alameh Tabataba'i University staged a strike on 7 and 8 Esfand last year [26-27 February 1994] demanding the firing of the university president. Likewise, officials at Qom's Fatemieh University closed the academic term in the face of an extensive student strike against this university's excessive tuition increase. The leaders of the regime of the "vice regency of the chief jurisconsult," who remember well the experience of the student strikes of the years 1355-56 [21 March 1976-20 March 1978] and their connection with a mass movement during the Bahman [21 January-19 February] revolution, have undertaken a terrified search for a solution, believing that by "dealing" with some of the class demands of the students they will prevent the student movement from spreading and becoming a national political movement. In this regard, in a note in the budget passed for 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], the Majles has required the Central Bank to "provide the relevant universities with 10 billion tumans through the banking system in the form of interest-free or participatory loans and other devices to complete and build student dormitories."
