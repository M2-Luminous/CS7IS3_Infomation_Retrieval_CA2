Dubovskiy, under the rubric "Opinion": "Russian Aftershock Inflation: How They Explain It and What They Plan to Do About It"] [Text] Psychologists have a well-known recommendation: if you are tired of a small boy's endless "why's," tell him: because the perpendicular. The child will be stymied, and the questions will run out. If this doesn't help, distract him with a toy, and in the extreme case give him a slap. This psychological device is being applied rather successfully now to the mass consciousness. Why has our country--a world exporter of energy that has freed itself not only from the burden of state orders for the military-industrial complex (nearly 20 percent of the GNP) but also from its role as donor to contiguous regions (another 20 percent of the GNP)--fallen into utter impoverishment instead of flourishing economically? we ask yet again. Because, my dears, reforms have to be paid for, the agitprop warriors among our advisers, experts, commentators, and film directors have replied. Who must we pay and why isn't everyone paying? we ask again, puzzled. The first parts of scenes like this are often played out now in the SMI [mass information media] when talk begins about the persistent aftershock inflation that has been going on for more than two years now, to the incessant music of promises of financial stabilization by the end of the quarter, the year, or the decade. A whole bouquet of agitprop replies to questions as to the causes of inflation has already been gathered. An almost mystical and therefore extremely convincing response is contained in the president's message to parliament: "When price liberalization was deployed, the inflationary energy that had been building up for years burst to the surface." The flame of Vesuvius and Hiroshima, the wail and moan of the citizens! Right away we see that the Great Reformers had nothing to do with it. If someone is guilty, then it is Granddad Lenin and Trotskiy the Jew. A very scientific "political-economic" answer is offered by M. Delyagin (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 24 February 1994): "The basic source of structural inflation is not the tendency of domestic prices toward world prices but the sale of inefficient monopoly-status enterprises in the processing industry." Also: "This is an inevitable process, the natural consequence of profound structural disproportions in the economy." From the standpoint of psychology, the reply is fairly successful, since in the mass consciousness a monopoly is a terrible thing from which you have to expect the very worst. He doesn't do as well with his proofs, which for some reason are cited in the form of two examples that relate to export-import restrictions, not inflation. M. Delyagin evidently does not understand that if the export of oil is restricted by a special license quota and the export of processing industry goods is not restricted by anything, then the dynamics of their domestic prices have to be different. In exactly the same way, restrictions on the import of sugar inevitably lead to domestic prices exceeding the world price. The history of foreign trade relations is full of such examples of divergences between world and domestic prices, from the "bread laws" in England in the first half of the nineteenth century, according to which taxes were levied on the import of grain in order to support high domestic prices, to the so-called trade war between the United States and Japan going on today, which consists of the constant review of mutual restrictions on export-import operations. If we are talking about so-called inefficient enterprises, then ignorance in tax assessment and foreign trade policy could bring even the most efficient branch to a halt, as happened recently here with the production of vodka. An increase in the excise from 0.85 to 0.9 raised the price of vodka by 50 percent and made it uncompetitive in comparison with imported vodka. It took the loss of hundreds of billions of rubles in excise duties for the authorities to realize this and correct their mistake. This example brilliantly illustrates the extreme superficiality of conducting propaganda discussions about Russia's inefficient processing industry in isolation from an analysis of taxation, export-import restrictions, wages, and transportation costs. Actually, in agitprop political economy, it is all right to disdain not only the realia of life but also statistical facts. We are told as if it were an achievement that in the years 1992-93 the purchasing power of the dollar in the Russian market fell by a factor of more than 12. Weekly observations of this indicator by the FinIst AO (joint-stock company), which are widely published in the business press, and the assessments of other independent sources give a figure closer to 5. Not a bad difference, is it? This is the question that should be asked: If the explanations for inflation cited are nothing but psychological devices for working on the mass consciousness, then is it impossible to espy the author's intent? The plan set forth below has been tested with the help of a model based on real statistics. The January price jump of 1992 not only moved the economic system to a point of equilibrium between supply and demand but destroyed, along with the population's savings, the circulating funds of enterprises, without which production is impossible. Instantly, money became a bottleneck, as a result of which, at the new point of equilibrium, the economic system became less productive and, accordingly, the tax base narrowed. Simultaneously, the government transferred part of the state-owner's traditional income to private structures--commercial banks and export-import firms. This was done in order to create a social base to ensure support for the government. The loss of state budgetary income and taxes immediately created a deficit that had to be covered by the emission of "extra" money. That is how aftershock inflation got started. Inflation ate into enterprises' already meager circulating funds, the volume of nonpayments grew to a quarter of the GNP, and it became necessary to carry out a mutual debt cancellation and compensate for the inflationary loss of circulating funds with credits, which required an additional emission of payment means. The nightmare of what was going on was added to by the organization of the ruble zone, in which more than ten Central Banks were already competing in emission. Therefore Ye.T. Gaydar is formally correct when he says that rates of aftershock inflation have been determined by the amounts of credit compensation for inflationary losses of circulating funds and by the deficit in the state budget for the financing of social systems. However, he says nothing about how aftershock therapy was started with his direct participation and why over the last two years all possible levers for stabilization have not been employed. The political intention or mistakes in January are quite specific: the carrying out of a total price jump in a poor market without land outside the cities, real estate, or the means of production; the uncontrolled liberalization of foreign trade and foreign currency operations; the transfer of state income to private structures; the absence of a set, controllable mechanism of behavior for the directors of state enterprises; and the organization of the ruble zone. Actually, these mistakes could still have been corrected, inasmuch as all reserves and levers of management were still in government hands. In order to evaluate these reserves, let us use official data, although they sometimes look simply anecdotal. For instance, it has been reported (ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, 8 February 1994) that in 1993 the state budget deficit was 7 percent of the GNP and credits were 19 percent of the GNP. These figures correspond to an average monthly rate of inflation of about 13 percent, therefore they remain wholly on the conscience of the Ministry of Finance, if such a concept is allowable for a ministry. If we are to believe the data of Goskomstat (State Committee for Statistics), then Russia's positive foreign trade balance in 1992 totaled about 35 percent of the GNP (approximately 20 percent was attributed to donor assistance to the former republics of the Soviet Union and 15 percent to the flight of hard currency capital abroad). In 1993, the same balance totaled approximately 23 percent of the GNP (12 and 11 percent, respectively). In these figures lies the quintessence of everything that the government has done. Here is the ruble zone, and the "humanitarian" supplies to friendly regimes, and the transfers of state income to private structures. The amounts of this foreign trade balance are such that it undoubtedly could have covered any real deficit in the state budget and, accordingly, cut off the road to inflation. Ye.T. Gaydar is correct when he writes that the inflationary rivers of the Central Bank dump into foreign commercial banks. He merely forgets to mention that it is the flight of capital to foreign commercial banks that is causing the inflationary flows out of the Central Bank, and the government has not only failed to fulfill its obligation to construct a dam on the course of these flows but has actually taken down what barriers there were. What have the government and the Central Bank done in 1993? To the credit of the Central Bank, with the introduction of a Russian national currency, the ruble zone was eliminated, but the government continued to supply virtually free resources to the former republics of the Soviet Union, although it did reduce their volume by about 40 percent. Simultaneously, the government compensated with the help of loans for some of enterprises' inflationary losses, thus attempting to avert a collapse. The decline has continued, however, and the corresponding narrowing of the tax base has eaten into the economies made on donor assistance to the former republics. The government has utilized one other reserve: it has simply failed to pay salaries. Now the 1994 administration has to pay the debts of the 1993 administration. Today three basic economic scenarios that are still possible without freezing prices and incomes are being examined. The first, harsh scenario proposes carrying out stabilization by liquidating the state budget deficit and compensation credits to enterprises at the expense of a final destruction of social systems and the processing industry. It is this scenario that 7 percent of the voters voted for in the elections of 12 December, and the Russia's Choice faction represents it honorably in the State Duma. The second scenario proposes a continuation of the policy of the latter half of 1993, that is, moderate selective compensation credits to enterprises and a continuation of the financial suffocation of the social systems, accompanied by a curtailment of donor assistance to the former Soviet republics. According to this scenario, the economic decline must continue and, accordingly, the tax base will narrow. The drop of national income into the state budget will have to be compensated for either by new emission, that is, increased inflation, or at the expense of further cuts in donor assistance to the former republics. This development, however, cannot continue for more than a year, since the sources of its existence (allowable amounts of inflation and cuts in donor assistance) will come to an end. Real stabilization is not to be seen here. Finally, the third scenario proposes quick stabilization at the expense of total utilization of all the above-described reserves, that is, a simultaneous halt in the flight of capital and in donor assistance. Carrying out this scenario requires not only a strong but also a well-qualified government, which Russia has not had since the days of Aleksey Nikolayevich Kosygin. It goes without saying that each of these scenarios risks specific social and political consequences (strikes, civil disobedience, sabotage, a change of regimes in contiguous territories, separatism, requests for reunification, and so on). Therefore, each of these scenarios could be cut short or altered by sufficiently powerful social groups. In conclusion, I want to emphasize that what has been said here, the ideas and assessments, are by no means unique. Various experts using various methods have, independently of one another, come to the same conclusions at various times. Therefore I will conclude with a quotation from an article by an economic advisor to the Labor group in the British Parliament, John Rossi (DELOVOY MIR, 21-27 February 1994): "Crisis has come about only because, in complete contradiction of its national interests and economic logic, Russia has allowed an export of capital in the amount of approximately $30 billion at the very moment when it had a large international indebtedness and a huge demand for resources for capital investment into its own economy and for financing the budget deficit."
