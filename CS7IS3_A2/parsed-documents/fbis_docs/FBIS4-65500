One day after the Geneva foreign ministers' conference on a peaceful solution in Bosnia, Kinkel said in Bonn on Saturday [14 May] that one should think about whether one should grant funds and resume negotiations on a cooperation agreement. The parties to the conflict must realize that the efforts for peace are worthwhile. Yet, the aggressor cannot expect support for the reconstruction of his country. Kinkel noted that, despite all criticism of the international peace efforts to date, one must not overlook that in some spheres, the situation has improved in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the past few months, Croatia has made a contribution to a peaceful development. By pointing to the talks in Geneva, Kinkel said that the sanctions against the Serbs would have to be consistently maintained. According to Kinkel, the signal of Geneva was: "The Bosnian Serbs and the government in Belgrade must realize that they are facing a joint position of the countries that participate in the conference, countries they will need politically, and, later, also for economic reconstruction." Kinkel stated that one must not harbor any illusions regarding the difficulties of the future course of the negotiations. Too many promises and agreements have been broken to date, particularly from the Serbian side. "Hence, there is no reason to be euphoric," Kinkel concluded.
