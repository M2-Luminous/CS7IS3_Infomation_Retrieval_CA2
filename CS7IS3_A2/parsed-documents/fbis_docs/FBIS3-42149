The minister has just returned from a visit to Russia, which included a tour of a nuclear power plant. The minister explained why he refused the offer: [Begin Shahal recording] I am not in favor of entering or buying existing technology for nuclear power plants. I think that Israel and probably the world will have to wait many years for a new technology, a safer technology. The Russians mentioned that in the past, during the time when Professor Yuval Ne'eman was the minister of energy and afterwards in a meeting with Prof. Amnon Rubinstein, there were talks by the Israeli Government to have a sort of a joint venture for a nuclear power plant. I mentioned and I explained our policy that we are more interested in the scientific question, in cooperation together maybe with Russia and the United States, but for future technologies, not the existing ones. Basically, I would say the government is not involved in buying energy supply as it was some years ago. I explained the new structure that we have here. [end recording]
