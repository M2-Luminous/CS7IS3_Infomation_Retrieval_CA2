Let us take stock of the military situation as described less than half an hour ago by one of our special correspondents in Kigali, Christophe Boisbouvier: [Begin Boisbouvier recording] At nightfall this evening, the Rwandan Armed Forces were still resisting in the basin of Kigali. They are under fire from the rebels who are attacking on two fronts, in the north and in the south. In the south, they are attacking from a hill that overlooks the district of Gikondo. Their aim is to join up with the RPF pocket, which, as you know, has been holding out for six days in the area between the town and the airport. According to the latest information here, it seems that the rebels coming from the north have managed to link up with those in the pocket, but this is not certain. This evening, for the first time we heard firing from rocket launchers. This is proof of the violence of the fighting and, again, of the resistance of the Rwandan Armed Forces -- or at least those of its battalions which have not yet decided to surrender. As far as Westerners are concerned, there has not been a single French soldier in town since the evacuation of the embassy this morning. Some Belgian units are still in two or three positions while they evacuate the last foreigners. There is also the airport where 500 Belgians and 350 French soldiers are deployed. The RPF has just told them via the United Nations that they have another three days to complete evacuating and leave. [Announcer] Christophe Boisbouvier, this was truly a mad day in Kigali, right? [Boisbouvier] Absolutely, a mad day indeed, where events moved very quickly. At 0600 to 0630 this morning, the rebels were arriving from the south of the town, where they were not at all expected to be. It seems that last night they managed to go round the capital through the wooded hills around the town. This is reminiscent of Vietcong tactics, somewhere else, in Asia. They surprised everybody indeed when they attacked above Gikondo. This is partly why the French Embassy had to be evacuated. [passage omitted] In the afternoon, since the evacuation road between the town and the airport was cut, the rebels continued to progress from the south and the north, and, as I was saying, they may be joining up with the pocket which is between the town and the airport. [end recording] [Announcer] That was Christophe Boisbouvier, one of our special correspondents in Kigali. He spoke to us on the telephone less than half an hour ago.
