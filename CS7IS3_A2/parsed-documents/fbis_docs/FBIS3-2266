Jiang made these remarks during talks with visiting Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev here this afternoon. He said China and Azerbaijan are both in Asia, and their peoples' friendly contacts can be traced back to the "Silk Road" of more than 2,000 years ago. The Chinese people have always harbored friendly sentiments toward the hardworking and wise people of Azerbaijan, which has a long history of culture, he said. Jiang said Azerbaijan's independence and the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries have laid good conditions for the growth of bilateral ties. Noting that the two countries have established contacts and cooperation in every aspect, Jiang said bilateral relations are now advancing in a healthy and steady way. Jiang said the two countries also can strengthen and coordinate cooperation in international affairs and the United Nations. He expressed the belief that the president's current visit to China will surely help raise bilateral relations and cooperation to a new level, as the two sides will sign a Sino-Azerbaijan joint statement and other documents on bilateral cooperation. On the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Jiang said China is deeply concerned about the escalation of the conflict, the large number of people who have been wounded or killed, and the great loss of property during the conflict. He said both sides of the conflict have paid a great price. It will bring no benefit to the two sides to delay the settlement of the conflict. "We sincerely hope that Azerbaijan and Armenia will properly settle the conflict through peaceful negotiations as early as possible," Jiang said. President Aliyev said that Azerbaijan places great importance on China's role and influence as a big nation in the international political and economic arena. He said that his country is looking attentively and with great interest at the smooth execution of China's reform movement. China has made tremendous achievements in its reforms, the visiting president said, adding that the Azerbaijani Government and people are willing to learn from China's experiences. He expressed the belief that his current China visit will push Azerbaijani-Chinese ties to a new stage. The two leaders shared the view during the talks that the five principles of peaceful co-existence should be the norms for handling state-to-state relations. The leaders also briefed each other on their respective countries' domestic situations and foreign policies. Among those attending the talks on the Chinese side were Qi Huaiyuan, director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the State Council, Yin Dakui, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception Committee and vice-minister of public health, and Dai Bingguo, vice-minister of foreign affairs. Viktor Kuliyev, first deputy prime minister of Azerbaijan [name and position as received], Gasan Gasanov, minister of foreign affairs, Ali Insanov, minister of public health, and Sabir Rustamkhanly, press minister [name and position as received], also took part in the talks. Prior to the talks, Jiang presided over a welcoming ceremony in the central hall of the Great Hall of the People for his Azerbaijani counterpart. Tomur Dawamad, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China (NPC), attended the ceremony. In the evening, Jiang held a banquet for the Azerbaijani president and his party. Aliyev arrived here on an official visit to China this morning by special plane, at the invitation of President Jiang. He is the first Azerbaijani president to visit China since Azerbaijan gained its independence.
