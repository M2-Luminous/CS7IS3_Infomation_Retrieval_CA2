It has repeatedly condemned terrorist acts in Turkey, but it believes that the fight against terrorism should be conducted within the law and with full respect for human rights. It further wishes to reiterate its appeal for a political solution of the problems in South Eastern Turkey. The EU wishes to underline that the right to express freely one's ideas and opinions is a fundamental freedom for all, and a fortiori for members of Parliament. It is enshrined in many international instruments, to which Turkey has subscribed. This right also forms the basis of the Parliamentary immunity of elected representatives in democratic States. The EU calls on the Turkish government to fulfil its earlier undertaking on constitutional reforms in the area of human rights."
