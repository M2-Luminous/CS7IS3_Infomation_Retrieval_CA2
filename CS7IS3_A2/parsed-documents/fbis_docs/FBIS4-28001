He said both countries felt their partnership should not be limited to military and technological cooperation. We have decided to set up a joint group of experts to study proposals from both sides and identify areas for future cooperation, he told a news conference Tuesday. Malaysia Tuesday signed a US$550 million contract with Russia to buy 18 MiG-29 jetfighters, of which US$450 million will be paid in cash and the balance in the form of Malaysian refined palm oil over a five-year period. Soskovets said he had a useful discussion with Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed covering Malaysia's interest in Russia's high technologies in satellite communication, telecommunication and space studies. On trade between the two countries, he said it was not sufficiently developed. Russia might consider granting certain tariffs and custom duties to Malaysia in future trade, he added. Soskovets also said the counter purchase of palm oil in the MiG-29 deal was very profitable to his country. Russia, he said, was also interested in selling its weapons and military equipment to other countries in Southeast Asia. The new Russian military doctrine emphasised the utilisation of its advantages in military technologies and to put them to commercial use. Conversion is underway in the Russian defence industry... Many items are now discontinued but at the same time we should preserve the capacity in industrial and scientific potentials and to do this we should seek new markets, he said. He said Russia's sale of combat weaponry in the world market had dropped tremendously compared to that of the former Soviet Union. According to statistics of an international peace research institute, the former Soviet Union contributed some 38 per cent of world weapons sales against 30 per cent by the United States, he said. Now Russian arms exports only comprised five per cent of the total compared to 60 per cent by the United States, he added.
