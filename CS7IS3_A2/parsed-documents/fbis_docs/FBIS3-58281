Kinkel expressed understanding for Poland's calls for clear-cut prospects regarding NATO membership. Germany sees itself as an advocate acting on behalf of the reformist states of Central and East Europe. Kinkel said Poland's admission to the alliance could be the result of an "evolutionary process" first of all, but at the NATO conference, Germany would urge that an unmistakable sign be given "that the alliance is essentially open to new members." Chancellor Kohl has said NATO's offer of Partnership for Peace should not just amount to a diplomatic formula, but must contain "a clear-cut statement of future prospects for admission to NATO." It is also being said in Bonn that Kohl is counting on bringing the Central European states Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into European Union structures. Even if they are not full EU members, Kohl is evidently thinking about involving those countries in European political cooperation with their status to be established at some later date.
