In addition to the assembly, Polak said, a series of other demonstrations, manifestations and protests are being prepared. Polak would not specify any times or locations "so they will not be prevented." Polak called Clinton the representative of a country "that is not qualified to be a parliament of human rights and that does not have the right to talk about peace." The President himself "awakens false hopes" and his policies "postpone necessary changes," Polak said. Prague Police Spokesman Petr Link told CTK today that the police had not been notified of any demonstrations in connection with Clinton's visit.
