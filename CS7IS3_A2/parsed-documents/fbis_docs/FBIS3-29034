Due to the prolonged recession and the restrictions on their scope of activities, the subsidiaries are entering a harsh environment, and their prospects for profit are less than bright. However, each parent company has adopted a long-term strategy and intends, by means of distinctive management--providing new trust services, etc.--to meet diversifying trust needs and expand the market. The First Group of Entrants Includes Five Companies The trust bank subsidiaries of Tokyo Bank and the four major securities companies began operating on 1 October. The procedures that the parent companies followed in establishing their subsidiaries included the following: On 11 August they obtained unofficial authorization from the Ministry of Finance for establishing a trust bank. On 24 August they obtained authorization for a special-case subsidiary [tokurei kogaisha] in accordance with the Banking Act, and authorization for a special-approval company [tokunin kaisha] in accordance with the Antitrust Act. On 3 September they obtained, from the banking industry, a license as well as authorization to operate a trust bank as a secondary business. With this, the legal procedures were completed. One thing that should be noted is that, in connection with authorizing the trust bank subsidiaries of the securities companies to conduct foreign exchange activities, the Ministry of Finance decided to authorize the full line of those activities. Let's look at the starting size of each subsidiary as measured by its capital and number of employees. The smallest of the subsidiaries is Tokyo Trust Bank, with capital of 10 billion yen and 21 employees. According to the bank's president, Hiroshi Hayashi, "With regard to banking activities, we are a step ahead of the securities companies' trust banks as far as skill and know-how go, and we are concentrating on the services that are our strong suit." As small as this bank is, it is functioning well. The biggest of the trust bank subsidiaries is Nomura Trust & Banking, with capital of 30 billion yen and 71 employees. As mentioned below, this company claims that its strong suit is foreign exchange activities, for which it has an appropriately large number of employees. The reason that each company has invested a liberal amount of capital is to balance the poor profit prospects with financial services. Initially, the capital for the securities companies' subsidiaries was planned at 1-2 billion yen. However, activities such as tokkin [specified money trusts], which were prospectively regarded as main sources of income, ended up not being authorized, as a result of which the capital was increased. On this point, the difference between trust bank subsidiaries and securities subsidiaries might be mentioned. In the latter category, IBJ [Industrial Bank of Japan] Securities started with capital of 25 billion yen and 138 employees. At this company, as well as at Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan [LTCB] Securities, the proportion of capital to number of employees was only about 200 million/person, whereas it was more than double this, 400-500 million yen/person, at the trust bank subsidiaries. This clearly shows the difference between business based on transaction commissions and business based on managing assets. The staffs at the trust bank subsidiaries are composed mainly of young people who have experience conducting trust activities according to foreign laws and who have been sent to trust banks for training. They also include some people who were lured away from major trust banks. The opinion has been expressed that it will be necessary to increase the number of personnel when the regulations on the scope of activities are relaxed. At present, however, any movement towards increase is extremely cautious. What seems the prevailing attitude was expressed by Akira Kiyokawa, president of Nomura Trust & Banking, who said, "We have no intention of increasing our staff to 200-300 people. Rather, we will seek to increase the specialization of each of our people so as to form an organization of specialists." ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Outline of the Five Trust Bank Subsidiaries at the Time of Their Establis-| |hment | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Name |Representative|Employees |Capital (yen) |Main Activiti-| | | | | |es | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tokyo Trust B-|Hiroshi Hayas-|21 |10 billion |Fund trusts, | |ank |hi | | |monetary clai-| | | | | |ms in trust | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nomura Trust |Akira Kiyokawa|71 |30 billion |Foreign excha-| |Bank | | | |nge activitie-| | | | | |s, investment | | | | | |trusts, fund | | | | | |trusts | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Daiwa Interna-|Katsuhiko Fuj-|76 |20 billion |Fund trusts, | |tional Trust |imoto | | |investment tr-| |Bank | | | |usts | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nikko Trust B-|Tsutomu Yamas-|48 |20 billion |Fund trusts, | |ank |hita | | |investment tr-| | | | | |usts | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yamaichi Trus-|Yoshinobu Iso-|56 |20 billion |Investment tr-| |t Bank |kawa | | |usts | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Limiting Main Activities The scope of the activities of the first trust banks since the new law went into effect is extremely narrow. It includes banking activities, of course, as well as securities investment trusts, fund trusts, non-monetary trusts (except real estate trusts whose purpose is the disposal of trust property), public trusts, special donation trusts, etc. According to Yoshinobu Isokawa, President of Yamaichi Trust Bank, "The fact that some of the activities--tokkin, shiteitan [the portion of postal savings and postal insurance funds designated for stock investment], etc.--that we wanted to include among our main activities were not even partially authorized is extremely painful to us in terms of nurturing the skills we need." Dissatisfaction on this point is strong. Therefore, each of the companies has limited its main activities to ones with earning power, and set up a small staff of elite employees. In this way, each hopes to maintain profit and bring its own distinctive brand of activities management to the fore. One of the activities common [to the new trust banks] is fund trusts. The four securities companies all mentioned securities investment trust deposits. About fund trusts, President Hayashi said they are "an interest-bearing item, an internationally diversified investment, a foreign exchange hedge-type of mid-risk, mid-return," whereas Tsutomu Yamashita, president of Nikko Trust Bank, said, "We offer a custom-made type of exclusive portfolio." Thus, everybody has a different emphasis. As regards securities investment trust deposits, "Japan's investment trust balance is one-fourth that of the United States," said Katsuhiko Fujimoto, president of Daiwa International Trust Bank; "future growth can certainly be expected. This is a field that our know-how can invigorate." This company aims to get investment trust deposits not only from within the Daiwa group, but also from foreign companies. Activities related to monetary claims in trust are naturally one of the main activities of Tokyo Trust. What is drawing attention, however, is that Yamaichi Trust is also looking into them. In the case of Tokyo Trust, there are the claims of the parent bank and of the group, so it is easy to imagine Tokyo Trust undertaking these activities. As for Yamaichi Trust, President Isokawa said, "We will offer a mechanism that raises capital by converting installment sales claims ["kappu saiken"] to trust beneficiary rights." As this indicates, the target of these activities stretches from nonbanks to general corporations. For Yamaichi Trust, the key seems to lie in whether it can make use of the Yamaichi group's reported strength among corporate customers. Nomura Trust & Banking is the only trust bank subsidiary that mentioned foreign exchange activities as a main activity. The decision whether to conduct these activities hinges on whether the company is able and willing to maintain the needed system and number of employees. For the time being, Nomura Trust & Banking will mainly handle the foreign exchange that occurs within the Nomura group. As to whether the companies in the group choose Nomura Trust & Banking or their current banks, "It's fine with me if they make their decision on a commercial basis; otherwise, we won't grow," President Kiyokawa said with clarity and dignity. One of the conditions stipulated by the Ministry of Finance for authorizing companies to establish not only trust bank subsidiaries but any subsidiary in a different field than that of the parent company is that, by its third year, the subsidiary must be operating in the black based on its current-term profit. Therefore, the fact that each of the five parent companies is claiming that its trust bank subsidiary "will be in the black after three years" is only natural. They are also saying that it will take an additional year or two to fully eliminate the accumulated loss. Expectations From Relaxation of Regulations on Tokkin Now then, what do the various companies expect from the relaxation of the regulations governing the scope of their activities--said to be two to three years off? According to President Yamashita, "Not only will there be an increase in the activities that we can conduct, but convenience to the customer will also improve markedly. I definitely want the relaxation of regulations to quickly become a reality." This opinion is widely shared. The need for relaxed regulations is particularly strong with regard to tokkin, which, due to relations with the parent company, will immediately become one of the activities of the trust bank subsidiaries. On the other hand, loan trusts--one of the main activities of existing trust banks--are not popular among the trust bank subsidiaries. As President Isokawa said, "We are not thinking of entering retail activities, now or in the future." Nor is there currently any thought of engaging in such activities as land trusts, which require activities related to real estate, or annuity trusts, which require that specialists in actuaries, etc., be maintained. The activities strategies of the trust bank subsidiaries are unexpectedly not predicated on a relationship of competition with the existing trust banks. According to President Hayashi, "Trust banks have functions that enable them to offer even more services than now." And, according to President Isokawa, "In the financial field, trust banks should aim at activities other than those related to loans." Emphasis is thus being put on answering the needs that the existing trust banks are not adequately addressing. A fair argument about financial system reform is that the relaxation of regulations and what activities a company conducts should be two different things. Ideally, the full line of activities will be allowed, and companies will be able to choose, according to their individual strategies, the ones at which they are best. However, the shadow of the existing trust banks is looming behind the Ministry of Finance, so there is no guarantee that things will progress according to what's fair. This is cause for concern among the new trust bank subsidiaries. At the present stage, it is difficult to predict how the relaxation of regulations will be decided. However, it can probably be said that at least the vector along which the activities of the trust bank subsidiaries are developing is conforming to the spirit of financial system reform. There would be nothing strange if the newcomers tried to hold the existing trust banks in check by saying, "If the market weren't growing, it would be a different story; but given how the market is, the existing trust banks are guarding it too closely." Each of the trust bank subsidiaries has expressed the intention of joining the Trust Companies Association. However, there is a problem: "the rent is too high." The "rent" is several tens of millions of yen a year for members (seven companies exclusively engaged in trust banking and Daiwa Bank) and about 5 million yen a year for semi-members (nine foreign trust banks). The trust bank subsidiaries, who are resigned to being in the red for the first year or two, undoubtedly have considerable resistance to paying such a large sum. If they are unable to make it into the black after three years because of the "rent," it will be too ironic for tears. A contention of the trust bank subsidiaries is that "since the scope of our activities is restricted, the amount of our `rent' should be proportionately reduced." At present, discussions between the association and the individual trust bank subsidiaries are continuing. When this magazine went to press, it seemed that the problem would be resolved. It would only be natural if some special measures or some time-limited measures were taken for the trust bank subsidiaries. The five companies in this first group of new entrants into trust banking field have waited long to enter the field. They have thus had plenty of time to clarify their strategies, and so are expected to develop their activities in a way that makes the most of their individual characteristics. As for other financial institutions that intend to establish trust bank subsidiaries, the National Society of Credit Associations is in the midst of preparing an application aimed at establishing one by next April, and the Japan Credit Bank is carrying out studies preliminary to establishing one.
