A spokesman for Raytheon Co. told CNA that "we expect Taiwan to buy Patriots, but we are still waiting for word from the Taiwan Government in order to finalize the deal." He said that negotiations for the sale have been going on for sometime, and there are still some differences to be ironed out before a final deal can be reached. Informed sources here said that the two sides have yet to agree on the price of the missiles and other matters. The sources said that the patriot air defense system batteries Taiwan plans to purchase will be an improved version of the Patriots used in the Gulf war. According to the US Defense Department, after studying the missile's performance in the war, the US Army and Raytheon have made both hardware and software improvements on the system aimed to increase accuracy.
