The U.S. under secretary of state added that the administration will ask Congress to lift the restrictions on military aid so it can hand over the F-16 aircraft to Pakistan for which payment has already been made, but in return Islamabad will have to give assurances that it will not make any further advances in its nuclear program. Pakistan has repeatedly assured the international community that its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes, that it does not intend to manufacture a nuclear bomb, and that it does not harbor any aggressive designs against any country, even though India has already exploded a nuclear device and committed two acts of aggression against Pakistan. The United States has maintained a policy of overlooking the nuclear programs of India, South Africa, and Israel, but its strategy vis-a-vis Islamic countries -- especially Pakistan -- has been to prevent them from acquiring modern technology at all costs. When the former Soviet Union was alive as another superpower, the U.S. attitude was somewhat flexible; but with the disintegration of the USSR, the United States -- swollen with pride at being the sole superpower -- has been continuously pressuring Pakistan. This is why it has not only approved discriminatory legislation in the form of the Pressler Amendment, but has also refused to deliver aircraft for which we have already made payment. If Pakistan were situated in a peaceful region without such a crafty and cunning neighbor as India, it would not have needed to start a nuclear program or spend a large chunk of its resources on defense. Pakistan -- which has faced two aggressions and lost half of its territory -- cannot afford to demonstrate any weakness or enter any deal regarding its nuclear program. The only reason India has not attacked Pakistan so far, despite its intentions, is the nuclear deterrent. It is also a fact that the United States has shown it is not Pakistan's trusted friend. After the way it turned away from Pakistan after the withdrawal of the Soviet troops and tried to improve relations with India, it is impossible for Islamabad to accept Washington's offer, abandon its nuclear program, and in exchange rely on U.S. weapons or try to live with U.S. promises that proved unreliable during the 1965 and 1971 wars. Pakistan has forwarded several proposals to eliminate regional tension and declare South Asia a nuclear-free zone. These proposals have included a nonaggression treaty and a five-nation conference that has been supported by the United States. India, however, has never given a positive or favorable response to these proposals, thereby proving its aggressive designs. The United States has been pressuring Pakistan to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. Pakistan is ready to sign the NPT on the condition that India does the same. Even this is not in Pakistan's interests, because it does not have the strength to face India with conventional weapons. Moreover, India is not even ready to sign the NPT. The United States has also been pressuring Pakistan to open Kahuta and other nuclear research centers for inspection. This is tantamount to eliminating Pakistan's nuclear program, because the inspections would be the same as those carried out against the Iraqi nuclear installations, as a result of which the United States silenced Iraq. If Washington thinks that any Pakistani government could remain in power after committing such a blunder, it is mistaken. The U.S. assistant secretary of state is due to arrive in Pakistan in a few days; the Pakistani Government must not demonstrate any weakness in this regard. If Washington -- ignoring the ethics of trade -- intends to demand a quid pro quo for the delivery of those F-16 aircraft that were paid for in cash, it is outrageous. The government must stand firm rather than bowing to this blackmail and meet the situation by keeping the nation informed. There is no need to indulge in confrontation with the United States. In the context of its national interests and regional situation, however, Washington can be convinced that its discriminatory attitude is harming its own interests and its image is being tarnished in the eyes of the Islamic world. In this context, the government should apprise the opposition of all the details and tell the United States that we want friendship, not submission.
