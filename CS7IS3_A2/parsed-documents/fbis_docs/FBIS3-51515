It is the most neglected state of the Mexican federation, even though in San Cristobal de las Casas, the first city the guerrillas took, an opera theater costing $10.5 million is being built. The theater will seat 1,000 persons and will have a concert hall and a parking lot that can easily accommodate 250 cars. It is an area that was only reached by the economic compensators of the Carlos Salinas de Gortari administration until after rumors of the existence of guerrilla groups became stronger. According to former Mexican guerrilla Gustavo Hirales, the Solidarity program arrived in Chiapas State overnight with its projects for dignified health and hospitals, dignified housing, children in solidarity, and so on. Chiapas is also the area served by a bishop whom the Pope has asked to leave, charging him to be a follower of Liberation Theology. This sums up what even the dullest observer believes has taken place in that remote Mexican area, where from 1 January it has been demonstrated that there are at least two Mexicos: the one the official publicity sells and endorses and the one that seems more like Central America than part of the northern continent. But for those who look at the Chiapas uprising with greater interest from Guatemala, it is impossible not to notice other characteristics. It is an area where the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) guerrillas move about practically with full freedom. It is an area where hospitals for wounded guerrillas have been built, there are safe houses for the Guatemalan guerrillas and even guerrilla recruiting networks in cities as close to the border as Tapachula. This is the perspective from which the Guatemalan military intelligence, at least, observes what is going on in the Mexican State of Chiapas, which is ablaze. Sources close to the Army admit that for over six months the second section (Second Directorate or G-2) had information on the activities of Mexican guerrillas. In fact, during a visit to Mexico City, Guatemalan officers offered to help in the investigations. When they received no reply they directly contacted the 24th Regiment in Chiapas. Nevertheless, the Mexicans hesitated in accepting their colleague's help. A few months later they appeared in Guatemala seeking the very information they had previously disdained. Most of the information supplied to them showed a link between the Zapatist [Zapatist National Liberation Army -- EZLN] guerrillas and two Guatemalan guerrilla groups: the Poor People's Guerrilla Army (EGP) and the Revolutionary Organization of the People in Arms (ORPA). To the Guatemalan military, the Mexican rebels are very similar to the EGP in their Maoist leanings, their ethnic claims, and their preference for the "prolonged popular war" fighting modality. The Zapatists have taken great care to demand in their first war declaration the presence of international observers, respect to the Geneva Convention on the treatment of political prisoners, and the presence of the International Red Cross in combat areas, demands that have been made in the past by Central American guerrillas such as the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front and the URNG. According to analysts, as in the case of the EGP, the Zapatists have carried out spectacular actions to attract international attention to their demands. The Guatemalan military officers identify the Zapatists with the ORPA because of the type of operations they carry out, such as blowing up bridges and attacks on Mexican Army troops in open areas.
