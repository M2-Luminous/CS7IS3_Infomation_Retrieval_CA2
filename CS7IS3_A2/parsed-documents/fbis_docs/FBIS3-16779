The mayors fear that the new tariffs will endanger the provision of food to the country's major cities. They cite specialists who say that the decision on new rates will further rupture traditional trade links between Russia and "near abroad" and lead to an abrupt reduction of import food deliveries. The three city leaders who signed the appeal believe that the aim pursued by the government -- to protect and support the domestic agricultural producers -- will not be achieved. They say that the domestic firms which supply food products to major cities are abruptly reducing their activity and all the major cities are already facing considerable shortages of the most important foodstuffs. The appeal stresses that the food market in the major cities has dwindled dangerously, increasing the impoverishment of the people.
