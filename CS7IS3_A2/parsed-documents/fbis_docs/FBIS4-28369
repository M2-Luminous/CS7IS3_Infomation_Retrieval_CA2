This was disclosed to the press by Coordinating Minister for Industry and Trade Hartarto in Medan Thursday following the conclusion of the third IMT-GT Ministerial Meeting which produced 11 memorandums of understanding on cooperation between the business companies of the three countries. At the Penang meeting the three governments are expected to agree to further their talks on several matters relating to the improvement of investment and trade climate for an earlier realisation of the IMT-GT cooperation scheme, he said. Minister Hartarto at the press conference attended by dozens of local and foreign news reporters, was flanked by the Perlis [Chief] Minister (Malaysia) Dr. Abdul Hamid Pawanteh and Thailand's Deputy Premier for Economic Affairs Dr. Supachai Phanitchaphak. Hartarto said the three nations also agreed to continue their deliberations on the joint uniformity concept on the granting of various facilities to support businesses within the growth triangle. The joint uniformity concept on the creation of a favourable business atmosphere covers uniformity in tariffs to be shared on the flow of goods, immigration, customs and excise, insurance, special passports and fiscal matters. Sharing various views with Minister Hartarto, both Perlis Minister Dr. Abdul Hamid Pawanteh and Thailand's Deputy Premier Dr. Supachai Phanitchapak once again stressed the commitment of the three governments to fully support the realisation of the cooperation project. In the meantime, Pawanteh reminded the need for the three governments to give an assurance on the definition of a number of terms in the IMT-GT cooperation scheme, such as free trade zone and border development region, to make it easier for the Asian Development Bank to conduct a feasibility study scheduled for completion in July. The meeting of the businessmen and the ministerial conference held since May 31, have produced 11 memorandums of understanding (MOUs), which were signed in the presence of the Industry and Trade Ministers of the three countries, and also covered the construction of an international standard hospital in Medan. The other 10 areas of cooperation included the development of television broadcasting facilities, electric power generation, meat import, fishery, the import and export of used aluminum and iron, the export and import of batik cloth, coal exploration, trade, and the construction of sea transport network.
