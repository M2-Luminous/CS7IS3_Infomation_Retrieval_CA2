Please listen. Today, at both the House of Representatives and the House of Councilors sessions, we elected Mr. Hata as our 80th prime minister. The SDPJ made an all-out effort to elect Mr. Hata as prime minister. We expected a meeting of the ruling parties heads to be called after the election, and that Mr. Hata would show us a basic plan for the cabinet formation. However, we did not receive any calls. A meeting of the ruling coalition heads was called after 08:00 P.M. [1100 GMT] this evening. However, it was only called to change the coalition's framework, and at the meeting, Mr. Hata did not present a cabinet formation plan. The following is what happened and what our position is: 1) As our party was waiting for the call to notify us of the meeting, preparatory work for the formation of a parliamentary group "Kaishin" [Innovation] within the Diet -- which is said to have been proposed by Japan Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] Chairman Ouchi to former Prime Minister Hosokawa -- secretly took place without consultations with the SDPJ. We found that the new parliamentary group made a report to the House of Representatives on their formation after 08:00 PM [1100 GMT]. In the past, the idea of forming a parliamentary group called "Kaikaku" [Reform] among the coalition was scrapped. In view of this, we believe the purpose of the formation of the new parliamentary group -- which is a renamed version of "Kaikaku", and which took place immediately after the nomination of the prime minister -- is to break the faith with the coalition's framework. We can not help feeling that there is a certain strategy behind such a move. 2) We, taking advantage of forming a new government, recently reconfirmed policies agreed upon after sharp debates by the coalition partners at the ruling parties heads meeting. That agreement was to affirm the coalition's position to take over the Hosokawa government's reform policies, based on an agreement the coalition reached last July. The agreement among the coalition partners is an outgrowth of the coalition's all-out efforts in maintaining reform policies and the Hosokawa government's framework. The coalition has agreed that the formation of the new cabinet was supposed to be discussed at a meeting of the ruling parties. In this sense, the fact that certain parties and individuals of the coalition members have ignored such a process and have selfishly broken the coalition's framework is intolerable. 3) The SDPJ believes that such an intentional manipulation of the coalition's framework is nothing but an attempt to increase the people's distrust in the politics of the new coalition government and cannot tolerate it. Therefore, the SDPJ cannot remain in the coalition. The party is now determined to promote reform politics with the people, and thus, it is impossible for us to cooperate with the new government in reshuffling the cabinet. However, our party is resolved to make all-out efforts to fulfill what we have pledged to the people, including the adoption of the budget bills for fiscal 1994 in an attempt to revive the economy. This is the SDPJ's statement. [Unidentified moderator] Now reporters may ask questions. [Reporter] Is there any possibility that the SDPJ will support the new government from outside? [Murayama] Yes, there is a word of support for the cabinet from outside. But in fact, I am of the opinion that it will be difficult to do so. But as for the budget bill, which was proposed by the Hosokawa government, and which the SDPJ took part in, we will do our utmost to pass it because our party has a responsibility to carry out what the party has pledged. [Reporter] What do you mean by certain intentional strategy? [Murayama] The ruling parties originally agreed to decide on the nature of the coalition's framework and form a cabinet after coordinating policies. But other ruling parties have drastically changed such a framework without consulting our party, thus breaking the coalition's original agreement. Judging from this, we can clearly see that what lies behind their move is their intention to bisect the coalition. I believe that such an attempt is unpardonable in view of the coalition government's character that places emphasis on managing the government through a democratic process. [Reporter] Do you mean they are trying to kick the SDPJ out of the coalition? [Murayama] I am not sure whether it is appropriate to say they are tying to do so. But in short, we can clearly see that they are trying to control the management of the coalition by making use of their superior numbers. This is intolerable. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Murayama] I cannot go that far. But judging from what they have done, we cannot help thinking so. [Reporter] Has the SDPJ's position already been conveyed to the prime minister? [Murayama] Yes, we informed the prime minister of our position. [Reporter] Directly to the prime minister? [Murayama] Yes. [Reporter] What did the prime minister say? [Murayama] He repeatedly said he wants us to reconsider our position. But we have no time, you know. [Reporter] What time did you inform him? [Murayama] Immediately before I came here. [Reporter] Are you going to attend a coalition party leaders' meeting? [Murayama] No, I am not. [Reporter] Is there room for discussion? [Murayama] No, there is not. [Reporter] Is this a decision approved by all SDPJ members? [Murayama] That is right. The council, composed of three executives, was entrusted with the task of making decisions. I do not mean to say that we were entrusted with making the decision to secede from the coalition. However, it was too late at night to convene a party meeting. Also, this is something that could not wait until tomorrow. Therefore, we took the responsibility to make the decision on our own. [Reporter] Did you expect this to happen? [Murayama] No, we did not. [Reporter] Is the SDPJ going to quit the coalition's decision making bodies too -- including representatives' meeting, the policy executive council, and the tax system research council? [Murayama] That is right. [Reporter] Can you explain how you felt before making the decision? [Murayama] We were unable to have budget deliberations for more than two weeks. However, we did not waste time during that period. We had serious discussions and agreed to form a better administration. We united our party and did our best to approve Mr. Hata as prime minister in both the upper and lower houses. However, I was told that a party leaders' meeting might be held at around 4:00 [0700 GMT] immediately after the prime minister was elected. I was waiting for it at the Diet members' office building. But, the party leaders' meeting started around 2000 [1100 GMT] without informing me. Notification of the new parliamentary group's formation was completed immediately before holding the party leaders' meeting. They held the meeting after completing all the necessary procedures for formation of the parliamentary group. Formation of the group will change the framework of the coalition and it is goes against the promise we made with each other. They did not keep the promise. We thought the coalition government would not function well if such a thing should happen often. We tried to talk with them, but it was too late because notification of the new group's formation had already taken place. Under such circumstances, we gave the matter careful consideration and unanimously agreed that the secession was unavoidable. [Reporter] Are you planning to call for a general election after approving the draft budget? [Murayama] We have not thought that far. We have to see how the situation will change. [Coordinator] One more question, please. [Reporter] What about the coalition platform? Is it invalid now? [Murayama] This is an agreement we made at the time of forming the coalition government. We will not be restricted by it because we are going to secede from the coalition government. [Reporter] Can we say that the SDPJ will split from the coalition rather than saying that it will cooperate with the government from outside the cabinet? [Murayama] That is right. [Reporter] Do you feel angry, mortified, or betrayed? [Murayama] What? [Reporter] Do you feel angry, mortified, or ... [Murayama interrupting] What are you talking about? This is not an emotional issue. The coalition government was formed on the basis of mutual trust. It will not function well if there is no trust. Under such a circumstance, we are just not confident that we can steer the coalition government well. Therefore, we came to the conclusion that we should split from it.
