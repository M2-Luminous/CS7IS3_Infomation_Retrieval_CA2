The next time I come to this arena, in six months, I will be doing it to deliver the presidential sash to the president the people will freely elect in May. At that time, the Legislative Assembly will comprise citizens who enjoy the approval of the majority of their voters. Because of this, the legislative period that begins today provides the current Legislative Assembly with a final opportunity to discuss the important bills it still has to discuss. Whatever is not done within the next four months will be left as unconcluded work by the representatives who were elected in 1989. This is why I want to begin my speech by encouraging you to make this last phase of the mandate you received a constructive phase in every sense for the benefit of the Panamanian people. Exactly four years ago I addressed you for the first time. The Legislative Assembly was belatedly installed on that day and that installation marked the beginning of the relationship the legislative and executive branches have maintained. In my opinion, this relationship shows a positive balance. We have made conscious efforts to work in a reasonably harmonious way. We have also been aware of the limits imposed by our respective state branches. Throughout these years, in my eight previous speeches at this assembly, I have touched on several issues. Some of them were reiterations. On other occasions I discussed issues that at a given moment were of special interest. I have repeatedly spoken about the critical situation under which we assumed the government and about the chaos in which we found the country at the end of 1989 and the beginning of 1990. We have spoken about serious maladjustments in state finances and about the enormous foreign debt burden we inherited from the past regime. We have spoken about the depths of unemployment and poverty into which we were plunged and about the continuous efforts we have made since then to mitigate these problems in the short-, mid-, and long- term. We have spoken about how necessary it is to encourage our worn out economy and about the predominant role the private sector has as an engine of economic recovery and development. We have spoken about the functions of the state and about the size of the state in relation to private activities. We have discussed specific actions we have adopted in this regard. We have discussed public security and the social peace we want and have been building despite the obstacles we faced. We have discussed democracy, the creation of a de jure state, civil liberties, especially freedom of expression and respect for the independence and separation of the state branches. We have spoken about my conviction that it is necessary to produce a clean and fair elections campaign and to deliver power to the legitimate winner of the elections. Other issues also have been the source of special interest in my messages at the beginning of each legislative period. Among these issues I must mention the urgent and pressing need to save the Social Security Bank, which was heading for bankruptcy because of past mismanagement; the creation of the Interoceanic Region Authority to manage those assets that have been returned and will be returned; the amendment to the Constitution to create the Panama Canal Administration that will pave the road for assuming control of the canal at the end of the century; and the basic law for the existence of a police-minded, not military-minded, public force as an important tool for guaranteeing public security and peace. Other issues we have discussed are the administrative career law to give public employees stability and peace of mind; the reforms to the electoral code that will be in effect for the current elections; and the approval of the family code and the health code -- both tools of great importance for protecting society's basic core as well as the Panamanian people's health. We have discussed many other but no less important issues. I am very pleased to see that these proposals, which on occasion have been the key or most important part of my messages to this honorable assembly, have received priority attention. Many were approved by you. They were presented for your consideration as initiatives of the executive branch, and most of them are already laws of the Republic. They have been an important part in the process to reconstruct nation of Panama and its institutions. Today I want to stress a bill that is on your legislative agenda. This bill is inspired by the legal duties that officials charged with enforcing and interpreting the law fulfill on a daily basis. In addition, various social sectors directly affected by related crimes have made recommendations. With this bill, an attempt is being made to amend Law 23 of 1986 and some provisions of the penal code. All of this is being made to make more effective the struggle against the scourge of drug abuse and narcotics trafficking. This topic is very important. It is, unfortunately, a very current issue. During the last legislative period, you ratified the Vienna Convention on drugs and money laundering. This was another important step to establish, once more, Panama's commitment in the international struggle against these evils. The 1988 Vienna Convention -- the name used to identify the convention against the illegal trafficking of drugs and psychotropic substances approved by the United Nations -- is one aspect of our country's commitment within international cooperation. To this we must add the agreements signed with the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, Colombia, and all the Central American republics to collaborate in the eradication of the illegal trafficking of drugs and psychotropic substances to prevent the shipment of chemicals and basic substances and, in general, to provide legal assistance in connection with drug trafficking and other crimes. Currently, we are extending this network of international agreements on this same matter through negotiations that have gotten under way with Canada, Mexico, and the Russian Federation. On this occasion, we have to make further progress with the approval of new internal regulations against drug trafficking and money laundering. For several years, we have discussed a possible review of existing legislation on this topic. The Legislative Assembly's Drug Commission began this process in 1991. The Attorney General's Office presented a bill during the previous legislative period. If changes proposed to existing laws are approved, we will have comprehensive guidelines to modernize and consolidate the legal basis needed for this struggle. We cannot deny this reality: Panama is threatened by drug trafficking, drug abuse, and money laundering. We are not the only ones to suffer the dangers and consequences of these evils, but we cannot find consolation in this fact. The Panamanian people have repeatedly expressed their concern over the fact that drugs could be undermining the foundations of our society. The Panamanian Government also has expressed this same concern several times at various international forums. The health and welfare of a generation of young Panamanians is at stake. The future of this nation rests on the shoulders of these Panamanians. In addition, we are witnessing, with great surprise, a new wave of murder, kidnapping, and other crimes that are characterized by a special kind of cruelty and savagery. Without a doubt, these crimes are directly linked to this imported scourge. Legitimate economic and financial activities in our country are overshadowed by money-laundering activities. Drug traffickers act against our sovereignty when they make a mockery of our borders and economic institutions and try to buy people and influence with their dirty money. My words are not exaggerated one bit. Quite the contrary, I am understating the situation. This is a sad and dangerous reality, and we cannot allow this to happen. The people demand that you -- men and women who have been elected to serve society -- take action on this matter. Mothers in Santiago, Bocas del Toro, and Penonome; teachers in Chitre and David; honest bankers in Panama City; policemen in Colon, Darien, and Los Santos -- all of them demand action against this evil of our times and demand the approval of the necessary tools to fight it. These legal instruments will not by themselves solve the problem completely. They must be enforced by able, devoted, honest, and well-paid officials. Ample economic resources are also required. Nevertheless, strict and effective legislation is essential to avert an unfair fight. The country is in the middle of an important election campaign. The new legislation that you deputies are to debate does not entail political purposes. This legislation has not originated in any political party and favors no special interests. Quite the contrary, it benefits all Panamanians. Our fellow citizens demand and deserve the approval of this legislation. I wish to refer briefly to some of the items that may be good to introduce into legislation extant. These items are included in the recommendations presented by the Attorney General's Office and supported by various sectors of society. In the first place, to investigate these crimes it is necessary for our legislation to include canons on two settings that it currently does not envisage: the undercover agent and controlled deliveries. Both are necessary to be able to infiltrate international mafia bands and to destroy them with overwhelming evidence obtained from within the criminal organizations themselves. Next, it is necessary to apply stiffer measures, other than preventive detention, on those found guilty of drug trafficking or related crimes. We cannot deceive ourselves. We must admit that this business moves plenty of dirty money. This money starts to move as soon as a drug trafficker is apprehended and sent to prison. He starts to make his tempting moves immediately, determined to buy any weak consciences available to him or which succumb to his dishonest approaches. For this reason, it is necessary that only magistrates may lift preliminary measures, such as preventive detention. The magistrates will be made fully responsible for their actions. Third, we must admit that profits can be made in this business, not only in cash, but in other assets, negotiable certificates, securities, or goods. All of these can be laundered and, in turn, must be confiscated. Fourth, it is necessary to revise the structure of the agency that conducts investigations on drug trafficking cases. Presently, the Drug Secretariat through a single office investigates all drug- and money-laundering related crimes. The accumulation of files and the bottleneck are evident. It is necessary to decentralize functions to make the punishment of criminals more expeditious and effective. Also, the situation of drug addicts has not been overlooked in the project. We must offer alternatives for their rehabilitation and, later, for their rejoining of society. To this effect, we have been planning that all of these goods, instruments, or valuables that have been seized in these cases be turned over to the National Commission for the Study and Prevention of Drug-Related Crimes. This commission would then assign them to the government or nongovernmental institutions that form part of it, or will put them up for public bidding in order to create a common fund for campaigns and programs for the prevention, rehabilitation, and repression of these crimes. Last, I want to specifically point out a new measure in our penal code. Not only is it new, but in addition it is needed immediately. I am referring to the new measure that will establish penalties for using money or any illegal financial resources coming from drug trafficking to finance political campaigns. This measure, which would be new in terms of legislation of this kind, would be designed to alert us against the temptation of willingly ruining the exercise of free democracy. Such links would be shameful and denigrating. Let it be clearly understood by narcotics traffickers that in times of democracy their shameful money is never welcome, and much less welcome in Panamanian political campaigns. Let the drug barons know that in Panama there is a definite political determination that rejects their activities and their money. Mr. President, honorable legislators: I want to recall the words I said here on 1 September 1990, more than three years ago. I said the following, and I quote: Allow me also to voice my pleasure over the fact that finally the three branches of state have managed to form the Electoral Tribunal. We have done this with honorable and qualified citizens. I have great faith in the honesty, independent criteria, and capacity of the new magistrates. Here, in this great hall, I want to tell the people -- and with God as my witness -- that I will devote all of my efforts so that the 1994 presidential elections will be remembered as the most honest elections of our history. I will turn over the presidential sash to whomever wins it honestly. This is the end of my 1990 statement. Therefore, my commitment with this year's electoral campaign and my clear intentions of turning power over to whomever the people elect is nothing new. It is an ethical decision I made and a moral commitment I accepted from the Panamanian voters and myself, even before I won the 1989 elections. Ever since I assumed power, I have tried to create the proper atmosphere. I have made and supported all decisions that will facilitate this goal. I consider it an intrinsic duty with holding public power in an authentic democracy. I want my intentions and behavior to this effect to become a paradigm that is demanded from future presidents. I must reiterate my hopes that the elections will be conducted at a level worthy of all Panamanians and within the framework of decency and respect. The majority of the deputies and alternates of this Legislative Assembly are hoping for reelection. They are thereby joining the thousands of Panamanians who are running for the hundreds of posts up for election in this campaign. As president of the Republic, who has had to preside over a difficult period of transition, I would like to see people elected who, during the next five years, will devote their best efforts to improving the country and continuing to build positive things. I do not think there has ever been a president that has been targeted as much as I have been. My work has been questioned and severe charges have been levied against me, without any consideration whatsoever. All aspects of my administration have been harshly judged and this has been done in complete freedom. I have tolerated this because I have a historic mission to fulfill and because I respect the right of others in a democracy. The eradication of national problems has not been, is, or ever will be, something that can be achieved overnight. Only disinterested discipline, honest intentions, tenacity in the face of adversity, and clear and attainable goals can guarantee lasting and long-term success. The Panamanian people deserve they be addressed honestly. No success is possible without effort or without sacrifice. The country's development and the wellbeing of the nation's poorest people can only be attained through everyone's hard and constant work and by way of essential values -- values such as honesty, loyalty, generosity, tolerance, and integrity. We must not forget that the political stability I have gone great lengths to maintain during these four years, despite all of the pressures exerted, is essential to creating the appropriate atmosphere for development, creating jobs, and reducing poverty. God, guide all Panamanians to ensure that correct decisions are made during the upcoming elections and thereby lead us to the end of this epoch and guide us into the 21st century. All of us await better days for our fatherland and for our families. Hopefully, we will show good judgment in our decisions and actions to ensure that nothing clouds our hopes. Today, more than ever before, our future depends on us. Unlike times gone by, we do not have a dictatorship that persecutes us in the street and in our homes. There is no regime like there was in the past -- one that uses blackmail or threatens the tranquility of our homes and families. There is no atmosphere of tension and fear that existed during the past elections campaign, which led to all kinds of unimaginable abuses the very same day that elections were being held. Moreover, we will not have a shameless vote count, such as occurred in May 1989, which led to the disgraceful annulment of the elections. All we have is a broad path down which everyone's creative energy can be channeled toward a single constructive direction to make Panama a great nation. We are going to choose our destiny in full freedom; this will be our responsibility and no one else's. By way of well-channeled energies, we shall resolve both our large and small problems. All goodwilled Panamanians, without distinction of race, position, or political belief, will face united the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead -- a future that is promising, splendid, and within our reach. I am issuing this fervent call to all of my fellow citizens: We are a small country, but its size is also a fountain of opportunities and advantages. I feel optimistic. In my last message I invited you to lead our government of national reconstruction and transition toward democracy. Future presidents will find a country that is incomparably better and more orderly than the country we found. History will show this to be the case and will recognize it. Many thanks. [applause]
