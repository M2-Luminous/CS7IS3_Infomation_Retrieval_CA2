FBIS4-26108 "drchi118_a_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-118 Daily Report 18 Jun 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS General Carter Returns to Seoul Carter Returns to Seoul OW1806044694 Beijing XINHUA in English 0412 GMT 18 Jun 94 OW1806044694 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 18 (XINHUA) -- Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter returned here from Pyongyang via the truce village of Panmunjom this morning after a four-day visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) during which he held talks with President Kim Il-song on resolving the nuclear issue. Carter is expected to brief South Korean President Kim Yong-sam on the results of his two rounds of talks with the DPRK leader. During their second round of talks in Pyongyang on Friday, Carter told Kim that the U.S. had suspended its moves to apply sanctions against the DPRK, while Kim declared that he had authorized a joint search for Americans missing in action (MIA) from the 1950-1953 Korean War. The news appeared to signal a breakthrough in the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula, with Carter describing the MIA initiative as a "good omen for the future." "I would like to inform you that they have stopped the sanctions activity in the United Nations," Carter told Kim at their talks. The former U.S. President also said that Washington had "provisionally agreed" to hold a third round of high-level talks with Pyongyang, and added that he was passing on the message after consultations with the White House. U.S. President Bill Clinton said on Thursday that his country would resume high-level talks with the DPRK if signals from Pyongyang indicated that it was willing to freeze its nuclear program. The U.S. and the DPRK held two rounds of high-level talks on the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula in June and July last year. The third round of talks, which was scheduled for March 21 this year, was cancelled because of differences between the two sides. Kim told Carter during their first round of talks on Thursday that two inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would be allowed to remain in the DPRK rather than be expelled, a gesture of conciliation in Pyongyang's nuclear row with Washington and its allies. Carter passed through the heavily-fortified border village of Panmunjom on Wednesday on his way to Pyongyang after meeting South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, Deputy Prime Minister and National Unification Board (NUB) Minister Yi Hong-ku, and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu during a three-day visit to Seoul. He said earlier that his trip to the Korean peninsula would be a private one. "My hope is to discuss some of the important issues of the day with leaders in the area," he explained. Recently the U.S., after consultations with South Korea and Japan, drafted a resolution calling for United Nations sanctions against the DPRK when it banned IAEA inspectors from testing samples of nuclear fuel to determine whether it had been diverted secretly to make atomic weapons. Pyongyang warned that any sanctions aimed at forcing it to accept inspections would be regarded as a declaration of war, while insisting that its nuclear program was entirely peaceful. On Monday, the DPRK announced that it was withdrawing immediately from the IAEA, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, and would accept no more inspections of its nuclear program, in retaliation for the agency's own sanctions resolution against Pyongyang. The resolution provided for an immediate halt to IAEA technical assistance to the DPRK totaling 250,000 U.S. dollars a year. Before meeting president Kim Yong-sam here today, Carter will meet Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu to discuss the steps that Seoul and Washington can take to deal with the nuclear issue, based on the outcome of his talks in Pyongyang, official sources here say. The former president is to meet the press here this afternoon before leaving for the United States.
