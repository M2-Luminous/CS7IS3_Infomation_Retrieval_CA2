There have been shooting incidents with casualties, and there is a feeling that the situation is unclear and that working patterns have as yet to be established. The deputy defense minister made these observations during a visit to the Qatif Bloc on the first day of the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] redeployment. Our Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that referring to 'Arafat's remarks in South Africa, Deputy Minister Gur said the PLO chief's conduct was beyond any political or human ethics, and was inexcusable. He did not believe, however, that the agreement was in any danger. Tzvi Handel, head of the Hof 'Aza Regional Council, told the deputy minister that a car stolen yesterday from the Eley Sinai settlement was today found in the possession of a Palestinian policeman.
