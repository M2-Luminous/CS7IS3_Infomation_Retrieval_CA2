Shokhin, who is the main foreign debt negotiator, said the federal budget envisages only a little over four billion dollars to cover all external debts while Russia owes the Paris Club one billion dollars of interest only for the first quarter of this year. The total Russian debt amounts to 80 billion dollars. Shokhin said that if Russia is made to cover the whole debt payable in 1994 this would mean curtailing of other budget appropriations or higher inflation. "We hope that the Western partners will understand that if Russia fulfils its foreign debt commitments in full volume, this would inevitably result in surpassing the budget-fixed amount for servicing the foreign debt which means either curtailing other appropriations or spiraling up inflation", he stressed. Shokhin recalled that the Paris Club had twice met the requests of the Russian Government taking into consideration the difficult reforms in the country. The creditors had first agreed to freeze for 15 years the payment of 15 billion dollars of the Russian debt and then rescheduled the payment of last year interest for the first four months of 1994. Russia is currently preparing concrete proposals to the Paris Club which will be submitted before the G-7 summit in Naples, according to Shokhin.
