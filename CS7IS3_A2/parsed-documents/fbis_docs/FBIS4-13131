The Senate's statement said his majesty has reiterated the constants of the firm Jordanian policy toward the Palestine question and the issues and problems resulting from it. The Senate expressed full support for the Jordanian position, which was expressed by his majesty when he clearly explained Jordan's sincere intentions toward a just peace that realizes the national ambitions of the Palestinian people on their soil and liberates the occupied Arab territories in harmony with international legitimacy and human rights. The Senate emphasized that Jordan has always stood against terrorism and has paid a dear price with the blood of its sons while firmly confronting terrorism. Jordan has always been eager to reject violence in politics. This position is manifested in Jordan's long history of working for the cause of just peace. The Senate also stressed that Jordan strongly rejects any charges that it is soft on, or encourages terrorism. It considers that these false charges are made to justify the aggressive pressure being placed on the country, including the unjust siege on the Port of al-'Aqabah, in a bid to force it to change its pan-Arab constructive position on just and lasting peace.
