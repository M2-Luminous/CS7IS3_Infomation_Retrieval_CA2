They are poet Chen Dongdong, writer Sun Ganlu, and scholars Chen Zishan and Zhu Dake. All are editors of the cultural magazine Tendency Quarterly, founded in the United States and Hong Kong in November. Chinese authorities have been keeping a close eye on the quarterly which was founded by Bei Ling, an American-based Chinese poet who took part in the famed Democracy Wall movement in the late 1970s. Mr Bei was reportedly interrogated repeatedly by police and state-security agents in Shanghai and Shenzhen in January for publishing an "illegal journal" when he was about to return to the U.S. One thousand copies of the first issue of Tendency Quarterly, carried by Mr Bei then, were seized by the Shenzhen authorities. The quarterly has five mainland editors. The fifth, Meng Lang, left Shanghai in February. Mr Meng had been detained for two months by the Shanghai public security in 1992. Mr Chen told the South China Morning Post that he had been interrogated six times by the Shanghai police since mid-April for his involvement in Tendency Quarterly. "The interrogation usually lasted a few hours. And this was very troublesome," Mr Chen said, adding that not only were the editors questioned but also the contributors to the magazine. "(The police) said that the Shenzhen authorities asked them to learn more about the magazine. They suggested that the magazine was liaising with the democracy movement in the West. "But I told them this was not the case. They refused to believe me," Mr Chen said. Speaking from Boston, Mr Bei said he was worried about the situation of the Shanghai-based editors, particularly Mr Chen who apparently had been questioned the most often. "He sounded desperate the last time I talked to him. "And Mr Sun was also deeply worried, fearing that his work as a contracted professional writer of the official Shanghai Writers' Association would be jeopardized," Mr Bei said. He said his parents in Beijing were recently questioned by the police. "This was the first time in years that they had done such things. They asked them what I had been doing during my stay in Beijing during the end of 1993 and early 1994," he said. He contended that the Chinese authorities, by intimidating these people, wanted to curb "reactionary" activities before the anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen crackdown. "(China) also wants to show the international community, especially the Americans, that China is not afraid of the pressure they have been trying to exert on it," Mr Bei said. "I understand it is a sensitive magazine since a number of dissident writers are involved. But until now, no mainland editors have asked to resign," he said. The second issue of Tendency Quarterly -- partly funded by an American foundation and with a board of editors consisting of writers in the U.S., Hong Kong and China -- is expected to be published next month. Mr Bei said that it would carry details of the harassment.
