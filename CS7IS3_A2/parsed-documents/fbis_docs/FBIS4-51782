FBIS4-51782 "dreas085_d_94025" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 South Korea ROK, Japanese Defense Chiefs on Flight Schedules ROK, Japanese Defense Chiefs on Flight Schedules SK2704083394 Seoul YONHAP in English 0719 GMT 27 Apr 94 SK2704083394 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 27 (YONHAP) -- South Korean and Japanese military aircraft will not have to be scrambled so often after the two nations' defense ministers agreed to provide prior notification of their flight schedules, officials at the Defense Ministry here said Wednesday. South Korean Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and his Japanese counterpart Kazuo Aichi agreed Tuesday to prevent confusion in identifying planes flying over the open sea by providing advance notice of their flight schedules near the zone. They also decided not to scramble their military aircraft in principle if the other country's flight schedule for the "air defense identification zone" had been reported previously, according to the officials. In the past, the two nations' Air Forces had to scramble their planes in a bid to prevent foreign aircraft from violating their territorial airspace when South Korean or Japanese planes flew over the open sea where both have air defense "pickets." Frequent scrambling of military aircraft, however, has increased the danger of Japan's and Korea's planes clashing or firing on each other and become an urgent bilateral issue. South Korea first raised the issue when former Japanese Defense Minister Yozo Ishikawa visited Seoul in 1990, and since then working-level officials from the two nations have held several meetings in Seoul and Tokyo. The airspace where both countries have air defense pickets is below 37 degrees east longitude near the Japanese islands of Kyushu and Tsushima, defense officials said. The two nations are soon expected to discuss prevention of accidents on the basis of the ministers' agreement.
