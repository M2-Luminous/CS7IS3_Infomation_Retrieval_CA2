Many problems, however, still remain. While discussing cooperation in financial consultancy with foreign countries, our prime minister remarked: Finance and money are the two most important areas when we transform to the market economy under state management. These areas have made some progress and achievements. But they are far too short for our demand and too little when compared with our neighboring countries. Therefore, in 1994 and the following years, the entire banking sector must further its renovation and satisfactorily accomplish the duties outlined in the government program of action. The important duty and requirement imposed on the banking sector by the national economy is that it must firmly stabilize the currency. This is one of the decisive factors for a stable macroeconomy and for the creation of a safe environment for savings and investment. Therefore, it must be considered a paramount duty in monetary management. This is a main and direct responsibility of the Central Bank and this responsibility must not be neglected. Although inflation has decreased and market prices have been relatively stable, our ability to control inflation is not very strong and the possibility of increasing inflation must not be considered lightly. We resolutely have stopped issuing money to cover budget overruns. But with its current practice of providing credit capital to commercial banks, the Central Bank cannot control and regulate monetary circulation and it cannot fulfill its role as a last credit provider in the credit system. And the two-level banking structure outlined by the stipulations of the banking system has not been correctly implemented. The control and regulation of monetary circulation becomes more complicated when development investment rapidly occurs and foreign capital quickly enters the system. This causes the investment situation to overheat and damages price stability. In addition to that, many enterprises, government organs, and the public still use both U.S. dollars and gold to settle their financial transactions in the market. The bank cannot control this practice. In reality, there has been no progress in the attempt to make the dong the only currency used for financial transactions in our country. This is an urgent and complicated issue for the banking sector in its duty to control inflation and stabilize the currency. Capital is badly needed to maintain and expand current business and production enterprises, build new establishments, and create economic transforming steps for industrialization and modernization. When the capital market is still primitive and without the existence of a stock market, the effort to fulfill the capital demand for different economic sectors and the public is a great imperative and challenge for the banking sector. In 1994, the capital reserved for loans by the Investment and Development Bank is at least 6,300 billion dong, excluding 3,000 billion dong reserved for the electricity sector. The demand on capital by different sectors and localities is much greater, about 20,000 billion dong. Many urgent investment projects have not been able to find any funding sources. Present enterprises are badly in need of capital to upgrade equipment and technology and to meet their higher demand to circulate capital. Our agriculture and rural areas also demand a great amount of capital to change their production structure; to transform the planting and cropping structure in central and mountainous provinces; and to invest in processing industries, building material production, and fishing boats. We must introduce processing industries to rural areas as outlined in the Fifth Plenum resolution in order to build new rural areas and improve the peasants' material and spiritual life. At the mid-term party national conference, Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi stressed: Internal capital is decisive and external capital is important in the national construction process. Internal capital comes from higher economic efficiency, the practice of frugality, and the continuous rate of accumulation for investment. To raise internal capital resources, one must encourage the people to practice thrift for their own interest and for national prosperity, ensure adequate developing investment, and create conditions for better attraction and application of the external capital resource. In a strategic sense, internal capital has a decisive role, although in the beginning, external capital may account for a higher percentage in the total developing investment. According to the Statistics General Department, at the moment, there is about 20,000 billion dong (equals to $2 billion) of idle capital in the public domain. If it can be put to use, it will be an important source to develop investment. The banking sector should develop cohesive coordination with other sectors to widen relations with foreign credit organizations, which offer acceptable interest rates. This credit then can be used in various forms as loans to business establishments and individuals at reasonable interest rates. This is an urgent task that needs to be started now or we might miss many development opportunities in 1994. In the process of transforming to a market-oriented economy, it is impractical for central-level management to send out orders on projects to local authorities. The establishment of projects should be based on the development trend of our economic structure from now until the year 2000; credit and investment activities should be oriented by the industry-agriculture relations. The banking sector should be sensitive to all new demands, be apt in finding targeted customers, and be dynamic in soliciting credit partners and not using the usual sit-and-wait-for-the-customer practice. Banking activities should be thoroughly revitalized before they effect changes in the economy. In many countries, banks never reject a loan proposal that proves to be efficient and will be repayed. Bankers will find other ways to finance a good proposal if funds are not readily available, including loans from other banks, raising funds, or calling for foreign credit. Current bank interest rates are another issue that needs reorganization. In the present situation, most business capital, especially circulating capital, is obtained through bank loans. When the inflation rate is at a level that makes the borrower pay annual interest several tens of percent, then it is excessive and exceeds repayment capacity. At the current interest rates for bank loans, business establishments will not be able to create any reserves nor expand their business after tax obligations are fulfilled. Business establishments are actually facing this difficulty. If businesses are unable to develop, their production activities will not expand or modernize. Competitiveness will be damaged and they will not be able to avoid further the danger of economically lagging behind other countries. The interest rates, therefore, need to be adjusted more reasonably. This will allow businesses to develop and banks can develop their credit activities. Business establishments with sluggish activities need to be reorganized. Bank interest rates also have a direct relation to banking operation costs, which presently are too high. Measures should be worked out for more suitable interest rates. We must strive for progress in foreign currency management in 1994. A foreign professor remarked that there is now a trend of U.S. dollarization in liquidation [USD hoa trong thanh toanfor banks to guarantee their liquidating ability in all situations, using faster and more convenient methods, and using less cash. This will attract more funds for bank reserves. Liquidation procedures through banks quickly should be modernized. Banks should have concrete plans for investment in technology and equipment modernization and use all available fund sources, including the depreciation allowed by the government or overseas loans. The last issue is the urgent need to train bank personnel at present and for the future. We need to gradually form a contingent of banking experts. We are also in need of experts to be sent to work at international and regional finance institutions. We need to pay attention to both skills and character when training staff since these two elements are closely interrelated. Talent should be coupled with a high sense of morality, which can be effectively used, in every country. This is even more important as we pursue a socialist path: bank cadres should not see money above all else. The banking sector should strive to fight negativity and corruption. It has to be reorganized to get rid of excessive, annoying, and redundant procedures. It also has to eliminate authoritativeness and other disturbing attitudes. This way people will see that the banking sector truly serves the people's interests and the national economy. The trust of the people and customers is a decisive element for the competitiveness of the state bank 21/03] in Vietnam. This is a dangerous trend and we need to be careful, especially when using the U.S. dollar to lend and repay capital and interest. We have to prepare positively and start as early as possible to carry out all operations of exchange, trade, and liquidation for goods and services using Vietnamese currency. All establishments with income in foreign currencies should sell those currencies to banks. Business establishments, according to operations demands, presently can keep suitable amounts of foreign currencies in their bank accounts for use to import supplies and materials for production activities or to expand business. Banks should ensure that business establishments can easily purchase foreign currencies whenever needed. Banks should operate in accordance with the economic structure and not rely on administrative orders to buy and sell foreign currencies. Bank liquidation operations made some progress, but they are mainly manual and backward when compared with foreign banks. The target for the year 1994 is for banks to guarantee their liquidating ability in all situations, using faster and more convenient methods, and using less cash. This will attract more funds for bank reserves. Liquidation procedures through banks quickly should be modernized.
