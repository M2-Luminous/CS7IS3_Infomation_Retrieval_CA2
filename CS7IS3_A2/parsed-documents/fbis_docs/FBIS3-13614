The request came in a message that 'Arafat sent to Clinton. The Palestinian news agency said today the message dealt with the difficulties blocking a Security Council resolution denouncing the massacre and providing international protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied territories and their holy places. The message also dealt with Israeli maneuvers and lies aimed at blocking the implementation of the Declaration of Principles and the serious situation in the occupied land.
