True, this has called for several tens of billions of rubles in direct expenditures from Russia. Mr. Lozovoy described the Ingush side's position on the return of the refugees as "unconstructive." In his opinion, the Ingushi are trying to force the relocation of refugees to Prigorodnyy Rayon in North Ossetia. "At the same time we have been very worried by the unwillingness of the Ossetian side to sit down at the negotiating table on this question prior to republican presidential elections," Vladimir Lozovoy noted. Yesterday North Ossetia demanded the promulgation of a political and legal assessment of the October-November 1992 events in the republic's Prigorodnyy Rayon, as a result of which some 500 people died, before the presidential talks are to begin. President Yeltsin, concerned about with situation in the conflict zone, stated at a meeting with representatives of the Almaz women's Russian-speaking movement that he intends to enforce the edict. Furthermore, according to Ingushetia's permanent mission in Moscow, the president is going to visit the republic on 23 February, the anniversary of the deportation of the Ingush people in 1944.
