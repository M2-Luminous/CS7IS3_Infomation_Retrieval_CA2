Among other things, an exchange of views will also take place in connection with developments in Central and East Europe, the situation in the Dniester region, and the fate of the Ilascu group. Regarding Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's statements about Romania and the Romanian people, and about other European states -- which were termed irresponsible -- the Foreign Ministry spokesman emphasized that these statements have caused the unanimous reaction of condemnation in the political media and international public opinion. The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has acknowledged with particular interest the statements made by the U.S. representative at the United Nations, Mrs. Madeleine Albright, whereby she emphasizes that the United States rejects the idea of creating demarcation lines in Central and Eastern Europe, and that, as far as the U.S. Administration is concerned, all countries in this area have the same political and strategic interest, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated at the same weekly news conference. He added that Mrs. Albright will pay a visit to Bucharest on 15 January as President Bill Clinton's special envoy. The main purpose of the visit is to brief the authorities in Bucharest on the results of the NATO summit, and specifically on tangible aspects of the partnership-for-peace alternative. During a meeting with Romania's president, with the Romanian foreign minister, and other figures, the sides will also discuss Romanian-U.S. bilateral relations, the Yugoslav crisis and the effects on the Romanian economy of the sanctions imposed against the Yugoslav Federation, as well as cooperation with the United Nations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman also emphasized that the letters addressed to the U.S. President by Romania's president also present our country's concerns about security. They clearly emphasize Romania's desire for NATO integration, a subject that enjoys the consensus among Romanian political forces. At the same news conference by the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, journalists were informed that the letter from President Ion Iliescu on 24 December 1993 to the heads of state and government of the NATO member countries and the NATO secretary general regarding Romania's desire for integration in the alliance as a member with full rights was positively received by the member states and viewed by the majority of the representatives of the ministries of foreign affairs or of the offices of the heads of state and government as being particularly opportune. The move by the Romanian president was assessed as being direct, firm, and clear. On receipt of the letter, the representatives of several countries emphasized that they will support Romania in its effort toward integration into NATO and the other Euro-Atlantic structures. As our reporter, Doina Saiciuc, informs us, this letter from Romania's president was unanimously assessed as an important sign of the absolute priority Romania gives to intensifying its political, economic, and security relations with the Western countries.
