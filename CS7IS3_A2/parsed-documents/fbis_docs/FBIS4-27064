At the meetings, the final draft for deliberation of the Regulations on the Supervision and Management of Quality of Products of Hainan Province was deliberated and approved in principle, and issues concerning development and construction of Yangpu were discussed. Attending the meetings were Vice Governors Wang Xiaofeng, Wang Xueping, Mao Zhijun, and Liu Mingqi, and Secretary General Cui Zongjun of the provincial government. Attending the meetings as nonvoting delegates were comrades in charge of provincial departments concerned. The issue of the quality of products has a bearing on the immediate interests of thousands upon thousands of households. Constantly improving the quality of products and ensuring a good economic mechanism of the special economic region are pressing needs for the development of an export-oriented economy and for improving the investment environment in our province. In the past two years, our province has repeatedly organized large-scale activities to crack down on fake goods and has made considerable achievements. However, viewed from the actual situation, the existing laws and regulations can hardly meet the need of enforcing laws on supervision over quality. The 37th routine work meeting held that to promulgate as soon as possible regulations on the supervision and management of quality with Hainan's own characteristics was of great significance to strengthening supervision over quality and protecting competition on an equal basis according to law. The routine meeting approved in principle the final draft for deliberation of the Regulations on the Supervision and Management of Quality of Products of Hainan Province. In addition, the meeting also decided to submit the regulations to the Standing Committee of the provincial People's Congress for deliberation and examination after revisions are made. The 38th routine work meeting discussed issues concerning the development and construction of Yangpu. The routine work meeting held that under the correct leadership of the State Council and the provincial government, and with the concerted efforts of the Yangpu Administrative Bureau, businessmen engaged in the development of Yangpu, and builders of Yangpu, great changes had taken place in Yangpu, China's first large development zone being developed by foreign businessmen over a vast area, and great progress had been made in development and construction. Major achievements made are manifested in the facts that the developers have basically fulfilled the contracts and have invested large amounts of capital in the construction of infrastructure in the past year and more, and the scale and speed of construction have tallied with the requirements of land transfer contracts and agreements on projects. In the Yangpu Economic Development Zone, the social order is stable and the people support the development and construction. Domestic and foreign investors have always taken a keen interest in and a positive attitude toward Yangpu. However, since the development and construction of Yangpu have been carried out without the support of a city or any infrastructure, and have encountered considerable difficulties, some time is needed. The provincial CPC Committee and the government will enthusiastically help overcome these difficulties, for example by linking the supply of electricity from the Yangpu Power Plant to the major power grid, by supplying water, and so on. The government will also enthusiastically coordinate with other sectors concerned to solve other problems.
