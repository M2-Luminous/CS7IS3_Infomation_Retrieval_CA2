The figure, considered preliminary by Cuban economists, appears in a letter and annex sent by Fernando Remirez de Estenoz, Cuban ambassador to the United Nations, to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and distributed at UN Headquarters as an official document of the General Assembly. [passage omitted] The report stresses that one of the major strategic impacts of the blockade consists in closing Cuba's access to advanced technology and any kind of scientific and technical exchange. It adds that in the field of medicines, the U.S. blockade has had particularly harsh consequences in that it has limited the nation's ability to acquire third-generation antibiotics essential in treating severe infections and cytostatic medication used on cancer patients. Among other problems, the report stresses that the price of insulin, which can only be obtained through a European supplier, has been driven higher because of the great demand in Cuba. There are an average of 16.5 diabetics for every 1,000 residents, and many Cuban diabetics are dependent on insulin.
