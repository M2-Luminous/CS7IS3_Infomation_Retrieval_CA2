The perpetrator is the same and the objective is identical. The perpetrator in both cases is Israel. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Do you think that the bombing is aimed against the visit of His Holiness the Pope to Lebanon [scheduled for May]? [Samahah] It may be directed against the visit ... [pauses] Among other things, it may be directed against the visit by the Holy See to Lebanon. I certainly hope that those who have expressed opposition to the Pope's visit have nothing to do with this morning's incident in Sayyidat al-Najat Church. [passage omitted]
