[Rokita] It is certainly a clear indication that the efforts and arguments I brought to the task of shaping the Democratic Union over the past two years, on both the national scene and here in Krakow, have somewhat eroded my authority. However, I believe that a politician's authority is not something to cultivate artificially but something to engage--even at a risk--in fighting for just causes. My determined involvement in the campaign to achieve a coalition with the Liberals, then in the unification process and then in the effort to rid that party of its openly anticlerical and prosocialist tendencies, has naturally impaired my authority to a certain extent. Given these circumstances, I view the result of the election as my own personal success. [CZAS KRAKOWSKI] The Krakow Liberals do not appear to be particularly pleased with the course and outcome of the unification campaign. Does this not pose a special, rather delicate problem for the UW regional chairman? [Rokita] It certainly creates a need for an honest, thorough discussion with the activists from the former Liberal Democratic Congress [KLD] structures. We recently had some differences connected with the postulated composition of the election list to be prepared by our new, joint coalition. I will not deny that I made some considerable concessions for the Liberals. I take full personal responsibility for these concessions, as I made them against considerable pressure from certain structures hailing from the former Democratic Union [UD]. This was not an easy thing to do because many UD members still remember the KLD's inauspicious beginnings in Krakow at the time that party was still a marginal group set up by local anarchists. However, that part of their past is now behind us, especially because the present leadership of the Krakow KLD organization had nothing to do with that episode. I trust we will be able to resolve certain questions hinging on personal ambitions. In any case, I do not predict any serious or lasting conflict based on these minor difficulties. [CZAS KRAKOWSKI] On the other hand, a much more serious conflict, in which you are involved, arose at the central level of your new party structures. You clashed quite sharply with Sejm Deputy Barbara Labuda. How do you propose to resolve this problem? [Rokita] I cannot yet specify the detailed procedure by which our conflict will be resolved, but I can already say that I have no doubt that, given her record in the parliamentary vote on the budget and the preparation of the new constitution, and considering her fanatical attacks against the Catholic Church and her part in the abortion debate, it is only a question of time before Barbara Labuda leaves the UW parliamentary caucus and, indeed, the party as such. However, the difficulty here is that her temperament does not allow her to leave the party of her own will, despite the open conflict and contentious argument she has with almost the entire party on almost all of the possible issues. But there is no question that a solution to this problem will have to be found.
