The minister reported in general on the tasks and plans of the ministry, most of which have not been realized due to relations with the international community, which need to be set straight. The government is arguing that the international community should contact the government directly about activities in Somaliland. The minister went on to say that the plans include action on reconstruction and resettlement affairs in the country and ways of repatriating refugees. He said these things would be stressed. On refugees from Somaliland in neighboring countries, Mr. Burale said that discussions have been held in the last eight months with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] and host countries on the most appropriate way of repatriating them. The minister said the government has told the UNHCR how the refugees should be repatriated and has explained the plan for preparations for resettling them before their arrival in the country. The government has requested that the basic necessities should be made available for resettling the refugees.
