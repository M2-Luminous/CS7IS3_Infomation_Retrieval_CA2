Asked about the latest turn of events in the nation, including the slaying of Luis Donaldo Colosio and the nomination of presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, Subcommander Marcos said the government is either preparing for the Institutional Revolutionary Party's [PRI] honorable defeat or for a great electoral fraud. As for the peace commissioner, Marcos said his removal would bog down efforts to find a peaceful, political solution to the armed conflict that began on 1 January. The subcommander said: "The removal of Camacho from the peace talks would force a break in the dialogue. If they bring in someone else, we would have to approve him, just as we approved Camacho, subjecting him to the same process. The worst part of all this, however, would be that the whole process would drag on and on." Marcos, who is in charge of the EZLN's military strategy, said that at the start of the peace talks, the EZLN thought the government would force it into a confrontation with belligerent groups of businessmen and ranchers in Chiapas, while ordering the Mexican Army to sit on the sidelines and watch. "At that time, we thought there was a move afoot against Camacho. We thought attempts were being made to force an impasse in the dialogue and to force a break in the cease-fire in order that the political cost would fall on Camacho at a time when there was talk that he might decide to become a presidential candidate," Marcos pointed out. "Then came the incident with Colosio, and we thought there were plans to blame us for the assassination, for ordering his assassination, or for creating an atmosphere of violence leading to his assassination. We thought military actions against us would start at that time," he added. Subcommander Marcos argued that Colosio Murrieta's assassination was ordered from within the government, which now appears as the only entity capable of guaranteeing order and of preventing this type of violence from continuing. "The government knew of the attack; perhaps it knew about it but allowed it to happen because Colosio's commitment to security was too uncertain at a time when the country was not calm," he said. "On one hand, I think the state and Salinas greatly benefited from Colosio's death, but on the other, they were hurt by the ensuing political instability and the loss of international prestige, because they proved they were unable to protect their own candidate. It certainly left Camacho Solis out of the picture," Marcos said. He added that with the assassination of the PRI candidate, the PRI not only took Camacho out of the political picture, but it also recovered the newspaper headlines -- an ideological priority. Finally, he said, the PRI came to be viewed as a victim instead of an aggressor. With Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon's nomination, Subcommander Marcos said he believes it is doubtful that Zedillo will be able to conduct a strong political campaign and win the election. "When Colosio was killed, we thought it would weaken Camacho's position and the government's alleged negotiating position, but when Zedillo entered the race, it did not make sense because with this candidate the PRI will not be able to fend off the other contenders," he said. "If the PRI continues with Zedillo, of whom nothing is known other than the textbook scandal and the fraud committed in Chiapas by his relatives, then only two things are possible: Either the government is preparing for the PRI's honorable defeat or it is preparing a very, very large fraud -- an unprecedented fraud," he said. What does not make sense, the subcommander said, is to plan an electoral fraud, because then the entire nation would rise up, the problem could no longer be blamed on the EZLN or Aburto, and the war would definitely continue. If the PRI is trying to open the door for democracy in the political arena, it should have nominated a transitional candidate, and, in this case, the logical candidate would have been Camacho Solis. Marcos said: "If the PRI would ultimately decide to share power or agree to a democratic opening in the electoral game, the logical thing would be for it to nominate a transitional candidate, in this case a solidarity candidate. The logical one would be Camacho, despite everything the PRI might want to impose on Camacho following Colosio's death." He explained, "Camacho would be the logical candidate because he has insisted that he would maintain Salinas' economic project." The subcommander said, however, that a political change would lead to a change in economic policy, which would contradict the neoliberals. He added: "No one can be a political democrat and an economic tyrant. Reforms within the same general guidelines would have to be made. Reforms in social spending and income distribution would have to be made, but this would run against neoliberal thinking," he said. The subcommander said he doubts a Camacho Solis candidacy is possible at this time: "I do not know if he will decide to run. I have not seen him for a long time, but I think that ultimately the decision will not be his to make. He is waiting for a signal from someone, perhaps from a sector within the PRI or Salinas himself. At any rate, he will let time pass, but I do not think it will be until 21 July [date as published]." Finally, as for the invitation presented to the presidential candidates before Colosio's assassination to visit EZLN territory, the rebel subcommander said the situation has changed in accordance with what the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General Command has already announced. However, Marcos added, it might be possible for the EZLN to obtain safe conduct guarantees for its delegates so they can participate in a meeting with the candidates or for the presidential candidates to send representatives to EZLN-held areas. Marcos said: "We had planned to invite the candidates here, but we have changed our minds. This is because if they are shot while they are in this region of the country, we would be blamed for it. Can you imagine what would happen if they were to be shot here?" Marcos added: "What we could do is to request safe conduct guarantees so that some committee delegates could participate in a meeting at a certain place and talk with the candidates, or for the candidates to send representatives so that they could outline their positions regarding the agreements presented by the government in case these agreements are accepted by the EZLN."
