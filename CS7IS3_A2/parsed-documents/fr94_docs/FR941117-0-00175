FR941117-0-00175 FR941117-0-00012 Thursday November 17, 1994 Part III Department of Education 34 CFR Parts 75 and 76 Direct Grant Programs and State-Administered Programs; Final Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 221␣/␣Thursday, November 17, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 34 CFR Parts 75 and 76 RIN 1880&hyph;AA50 Direct Grant Programs and State-Administered Programs AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: The Secretary amends the Department's regulations on direct grant programs and State-administered programs to clarify the requirements and procedures for establishing and applying indirect cost rates under programs administered by the Department. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations take effect on December 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Glenn Riley, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W., Room 3636, ROB&hyph;3, Washington, D.C. 20202&hyph;4700. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;7640. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 14, 1994, the Secretary published in the Federal Register (59 FR 2480) a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing to revise certain sections in the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) on indirect cost rates. These proposed revisions were intended to improve the administration of discretionary grants and to clarify for grantees the procedures and requirements of the Department. The proposed regulations addressed a number of problems in this area of grants administration, including the computation and use of restricted indirect cost rates in programs with a statutory supplement-not-supplant requirement, the definition of a training grant, and the use of indirect costs as matching or cost-sharing. Significant differences between the NPRM and this final regulation include changes to §§75.561 and 76.561 to allow State educational agencies to approve multi-year indirect cost rates for local educational agencies, the deletion of research training programs from the definition of a training grant in §75.562, and the inclusion of a definition of ``modified total direct cost base,'' also in §75.562. Analysis of Comments and Changes In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 21 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations. An analysis of the comments and of the resulting changes in the regulations follows. Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory authority_are not addressed. Section 75.560␣General Indirect Cost Rates; Exceptions Since the Department recently adopted the revised OMB Circular A&hyph;110 as 34 CFR Part 74, references in this section have been revised to be consistent with the new Part 74. Comments: Several parties commented on the requirement that a recipient have a current indirect cost rate agreement to charge indirect costs to a grant, asking what should happen if a recipient has submitted an indirect cost proposal but has not received approval from the Department. One suggested that the Department should assign an indirect cost rate based on the applicant's last approved rate and another thought the applicant should be allowed to use its proposed rate. Discussion: The Department now allows six months to review a rate proposal and negotiate a new rate, which is generally adequate time to complete the process. If for some reason a rate has not been approved on time, the use of a temporary rate would be considered by the Department. Since other changes to these regulations give the Department authority to establish temporary rates, no additional changes concerning temporary rates are necessary. Changes: None. Comments: Another commenter asked about the effect of the proposed regulations on contractors under a grant and whether this section requires contractors to obtain a rate, including a temporary rate if necessary, from the Department.
