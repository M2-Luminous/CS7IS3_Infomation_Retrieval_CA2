Come November, a series of seminars will be held in Delhi in collaboration with the World Intellectual Property Organisation in Geneva for senior levels of the police and customs departments. These seminars will shift later to the states for the benefit of junior officials. The Centre is also planning to request the states to set up a Copyright Enforcement Cell which will oversee the enforcement of the copyright laws. Briefing mediapersons on the amended Copyright Law passed by Parliament last week, Additional Secretary in the Education Department, Y.N. Chaturvedi admitted that the Law was a "brain-twister." Its implementation was faulty, he said, mainly because the police, which is the enforcing agency, did not have a basic knowledge of its provisions. Regarding the recent Amendment, Chaturvedi said it would have "far reaching effects" in protecting the intellectual property rights of creative artists, particularly the poorer and more vulnerable ones. One of the important changes introduced by the Amendment is redefining what constitutes a copyrighted musical work. The Amendment moves away from the traditional British definition that musical compositions had to be written or notated to warrant copyright protection. "Since much of Indian music is not in the form of graphic notations, the identity of a musical composition will now be through its author," Chaturvedi said. In addition, the Amendment for the first time gives rights to performers such as snake charmers, acrobats, conjurers, actors and singers, making it mandatory for anybody to seek their permission for a video or audio recording. Computer programmes, cinematography films and sound recordings have also been brought under the purview of the Act.
