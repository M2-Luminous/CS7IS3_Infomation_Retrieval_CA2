Zamora, aka "Uncle Mocho", was arrested on 25 May in a luxury apartment house located in the Miraflores residential neighborhood in Lima. His arrest was kept secret until today so as not to obstruct investigation proceedings. Zamora had his base of operations in the jungle town of Uchiza. It is located in the heart of the Huallaga valley, the most important cocaine paste production center in the world. Zamora sent huge cocaine shipments from Uchiza to Colombia. Zamora's arrest was possible as a result of information supplied by a Shining Path [SL] leader who confessed that drug traffickers had "donated" money and guns to the Shining Path. SL Leader Alejandro Estelita, arrested in the northern town of Trujillo a few days before Zamora's arrest, was a member of the "Huallaga Regional Committee" and "coordinator" of the agreements reached between the SL and several Peruvian drug trafficking gangs. Estelita confessed he was in charge of collecting funds in cash, food stuffs, guns, medicines, and vehicles that drug traffickers supplied to the SL in exchange for protecting drug shipments. Estelita informed the police that during the last meeting with Zamora, the drug trafficker handed him $25,000 for the purchase of various supplies. Estelita added that Zamora handed the terrorists about $100,000 per month. In addition, Zamora assisted the terrorists in finding hideouts and planes, to hide or flee each time the security forces conducted antiterrorist operations in the Huallaga valley. In compliance with the Peruvian law, Zamora will be tried for terrorist crimes and sentenced to a minimum of 30 years in jail. This is the same sentence that was given to drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano," in March. Moreover, the police presented to the press a cocaine paste shipment of more than 500 kg, valued at $10 million that was found on 5 June in Vainillas-Chacra San Insidro, in the Huallaga valley. The drug was found hidden in pits covered with excrement. Also found hidden in the pits were nine rifles and three machine guns. It is believed these guns belong to the Ecuadoran security forces. According to the police, the shipment had been stored by a drug trafficker known as "Picaflor." He was supposed to deliver it to the drug trafficking gang led by "Lucho Culon," one of the Colombian cartels major cocaine suppliers.
