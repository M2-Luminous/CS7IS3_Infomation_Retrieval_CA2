In their message the Dniester deputies accuse the leadership of Moldova of "persistently not wanting to tackle the Dniester problem and pursuing a policy of endless veering between threats, military conflict, and political blackmail." If Chisinau does not want to "find a mutually- acceptable settlement" of the conflict, Tiraspol asks the Russian parliamentarians "to recognize the Dniester Moldavian republic as an independent and sovereign state friendly to Russia". The document also contains a request not to withdraw the Russian 14th Army from the Dniester region. Moldavian Parliament Deputy Chairman Victor Puscas told the ITAR- TASS correspondent that the appeal from the Tiraspol authorities to the Russian parliamentarians bore witness to the fact that they were unwilling and unable to settle the Dniester region problem around the negotiating table. "There can be no question of any confederation," he said. "The Dniester region problem can and should be resolved within the framework of a united Moldova by means of granting the left-bank districts special juridical status."
