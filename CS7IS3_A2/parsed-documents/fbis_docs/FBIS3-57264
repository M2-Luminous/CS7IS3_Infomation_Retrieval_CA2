Estonian authorities don't know who these people are, because the Russian embassy has refused to reveal the names of its country's citizens here, Olesk said. "Russian Ambassador Alexander Trofimov told me at the end of last year that the names were not to be revealed because the people had so requested for the fear of persecution. Some kind of possibility to check who these people are will come up when the Citizenship and Migration Department starts receiving applications for excluding these people from Estonian citizenship," the Estonian minister said. Only two such applications have been submitted so far. Olesk said Russia was pursuing a policy of dual citizenship, when Russian citizens don't have to declare giving up the other country's citizenship," he said. Therefore it is impossible for Estonian authorities to know whether a person is a Russian citizen, holds dual citizenship or is a stateless person, Olesk added. The minister said that about 11,000 persons had become naturalized Estonian citizens after the country regained its independence. He didn't rule out that some of them might be simultaneously Russian citizens. He said it was in the interests of Estonia's national security to avoid the formation of a large Russian citizen community in Estonia. He said massive presence of legal Russian citizens in Estonia would provide Russia with good opportunity to interfere with Estonia's internal affairs and prompt the Russian-speakers to set territorial claims.
