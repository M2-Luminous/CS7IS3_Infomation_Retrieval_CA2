This and other details will be discussed in the following report by Mario Espinoza: [Begin recording] In a few seconds I will give you the name of the new National Police commander who will be installed on 4 February. But let us review the issues one at a time. I am here in the Senate, where this afternoon there will be a secret session during which at least four police colonels will be promoted to general. The promotion of at least two of them is absolutely certain, that of the current Police Department chief, Colonel Luis Rocha; and Colonel Willy Arriaza. The new National Police chief will be installed on 4 February during a ceremony to be held at Government House that will be headed by the president. The current National Police chief, General Einar Lopez, has fulfilled his years in service and, therefore, will retire. He will be replaced by newly appointed General Luis Rocha. Moreover, Col. Willy Arriaza, who will certainly be promoted to general, will be appointed National Police deputy chief. At any rate, well-informed Government House and Senate sources have confirmed this report. Therefore, new National Police Chief Luis Rocha will be installed on 4 February. But this is not an isolated report, at least not within the police force. There are problems within the police force. On 1 February, we were told by well-informed sources that Minister of Government German Quiroga asked for Police Commander Einar Lopez's resignation. Einar Lopez has refused to resign and said that when he assumed the post a few months ago, he thought it was a long-term important post, that he was not an acting police commander. Everything seems to have resulted from a letter Gen. Einar Lopez submitted to Government Minister German Quiroga, which states there are unusual promotion procedures regarding the background reviews of those proposed for promotion to general. According to the Police Commander's Office, the following police colonels have been proposed for promotion to police general: Willy Arriaza, Walter Romero, German Pomier, and Jaime Escobar. According to information obtained by this television station, there is great disorder in the National Police force. [end recording]
