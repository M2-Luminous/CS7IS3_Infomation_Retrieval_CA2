The leaders all arrived this morning at the convention center by bus, except for Spanish President Felipe Gonzalez, who arrived in his own car, and posed together for the official summit picture. Cuban President Fidel Castro, who this morning held a meeting with his Honduran counterpart, Carlos Reina, again appeared with a white guayabera and dark blue slacks, after surprising everyone yesterday, since it had been the first time he was seen without his uniform since the armed struggle began in Cuba in 1956. Yesterday, the Cuban leader met with Felipe Gonzalez and tomorrow, he is scheduled to meet with Eduardo Frei. He had already met with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in Havana. During today's meeting, the last of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, the presidents expressed their opinions in complete privacy on the central issues of the meeting, trade and integration, and will be able to freely discuss any other issues they wish. It is expected that an important part of the discussion will center on Cuba, after Cuban President Fidel Castro lamented the fact that there had been no declarations against the blockade during yesterday's meeting. On the other hand, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina denied that our country was disappointed by the developments of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. Robaina was interviewed by the media this morning and questioned on the lack of pronouncements on the U.S. blockade on Cuba, to which Robaina replied: We have no reason to be disappointed [words indistinct] on the debates regarding the blockade.
