"Beijing has not only failed to faithfully implement the written agreements it has reached with Taiwan but has also often distorted oral agreements or interpreted them out of context," said Kao Kung-lien, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC], which sets Taiwan's policy toward Beijing. Kao was commenting on the slow progress in the ongoing round of talks in Beijing between the two semi official intermediary bodies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait on the three thorny issues -- the repatriation of mainland hijackers, the repatriation of illegal mainland immigrants, and the resolution of cross-strait fishing disputes. The talks between officials from Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) have deadlocked over Beijing's reluctance to recognize Taiwan's legal jurisdiction. During the talks, Kao said, mainland delegates have unilaterally distorted "consensuses" reached in talks between SEF Vice Chairman Chiao Jen-ho and his ARATS counterpart, Tang Shubei, in Beijing late last year concerning the three issues. For one thing, Kao explained, the joint press statement issued at the end of Chiao-Tang meeting said Taiwan would agree not to include the repatriation of criminal suspects in cross-strait agreements on the repatriation of illegal immigrants and hijackers if Beijing would agree to SEF proposals that Taiwan be allowed to automatically repatriate illegal mainland immigrants and that it not have to repatriate Taiwan nationals who hijack mainland planes to Taiwan. In the current round of talks, which began March 25, Beijing rejected the two SEF premises while simply insisting that criminal suspects be excluded from any agreements on the repatriation of illegal immigrants and hijackers. Talks were adjourned Monday with no progress reported, and will resume Tuesday. Reports from Beijing quoted chief Taiwan negotiator Hsu hui-yu as saying that whether the talks will continue through Wednesday as scheduled depends on whether any progress can be made in Tuesday's talks. Hsu is also SEF deputy secretary-general. This is the fourth round of SEF-ARATS talks on the three issues since the heads of the two organizations met in Singapore last April. The two sides failed to reach any agreements in subsequent talks held in Beijing, Xiamen and Taipei in the second half of last year. Another SEF secretary-general, Shih Chi-ping, was originally scheduled to leave for Beijing Monday for talks with ARATS officials on some cross-strait economic issues, but his trip was canceled because of the lack of progress in talks on the aforesaid three pressing issues.
