Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that a closure was also clamped on Qiryat Arba'. In practice, however, it is not being observed and every two hours a convoy of cars and a bus to Jerusalem leaves Hebron and Qiryat Arba'. The convoys are escorted by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops due to stone-throwing incidents in the area of Halhul. In several Israeli Arab settlements where the Islamic Movement is in power, a general strike is still observed today and will continue tomorrow. Our correspondent Yo'el Dar reports that Police Minister Moshe Shahal has promised Knesset Member Tawfiq Zayyad that all the Israeli Arabs detained in riots yesterday will be released today. Some 23 of the youths detained yesterday in riots in al-Tayyibah and al-Tirah were released this morning. Only two youths suspected of throwing stones were remanded in custody. Riots continue this morning in Bedouin settlements in the Negev. Youths are hurling stones at passing cars, and a policeman was slightly injured by a stone. An Egged Company bus was set on fire in Kusayfah; no one was hurt, and the police arrested three rioters there. Rocks were hurled at reporters in Tel Sheva'. Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that riots also take place in 'Aro'er and Laggiyah, and the police are trying to restore order. The 'Arad-Beersheba highway is still closed in the Kusayfah region. In al-Tayyibah in the triangle, masked youths armed with axes staged a demonstration and set tires on fire.
