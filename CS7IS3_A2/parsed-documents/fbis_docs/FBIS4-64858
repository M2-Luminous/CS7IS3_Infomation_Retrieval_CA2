The most comprehensive survey of Thursday's [5 May] local elections for THE SUNDAY TIMES shows that if last week's voting pattern is repeated on June 9, the Tories will finish third behind Labour and the Liberal Democrats, losing more than half their Euro-MPs in Strasbourg. A computer analysis of 2.8 million town hall votes in 100 constituencies shows the Tories would win only 12 of the 84 Euro-seats, a devastating loss of 20 seats. The Lib Dems [Liberal Democrats] would be the big winners, capturing 14 Euro-seats, their first election victories in the European Parliament. Labour would remain Britain's biggest party in Strasbourg, winning 56 Euro-seats, a gain of 10. The analysis was carried out by Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, acknowledged authorities in electoral analysis, at the Local Government Chronicle elections centre at Plymouth University. Senior Tory MPs admitted last night that it would increase the pressure on Major. They said the survey's most worrying finding was its projection that, on the basis of last week's votes, more than 200 Tory MPs would lose their seats in a general election, giving Labour a majority of 127. There were signs yesterday, however, that Major will win a breathing space with a majority of MPs and local party chairmen rallying behind him. A survey of 75 backbenchers by THE SUNDAY TIMES since Thursday found that 60 MPs did not want him to stand down, only 14 did and there was one "don't know." Asked whether they believed Major would still be Tory leader at the next general election, 45 said "yes," 24 said "no" and there were six "don't knows." A SUNDAY TIMES survey of 50 constituency chairmen found that 44 did not want Major to stand down, three wanted him to resign and there were three "don't knows." Thirty-six chairmen believed Major would lead the party into the next general election, only three thought he would not and there were 11 "don't knows." In spite of this support and Major's determination to fight on, there were also reports yesterday of high-level Tory moves to oust him in the immediate aftermath of next month's elections. Some ministers loyal to Major expect the Euro-results to be worse for the Tories than last week's rout. Ministers say fear of higher council tax bills being imposed by Labour councils persuaded many Tory supporters to stay in line last Thursday, a factor that will be missing on June 9. Senior figures will hold informal talks this week on contingency plans to prevent open civil war breaking out in the party if the Euro-results are as bad as expected. Sending a powerful delegation to Major to ask him to stand down is among the moves being canvassed. Close colleagues insisted last night that Major would send such a deputation away "with a flea in its ear" but one minister said: "Things could happen very quickly in June." In another sign of crisis manoeuvring, it emerged that informal links have been established between groups of Tory backbenchers on the right and the left. Some MPs involved talk of building a consensus for a "new start" with Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade, as prime minister and Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary and leading right-wing candidate for eventual leadership, as chancellor of the exchequer. Major's supporters continue to insist the public will not accept a party which ditches its leader twice in less than four years. "If we do that," a senior Tory said, "we will be turned out and there will be a minority Labour government, followed by a deal with the Liberal Democrats giving them electoral reform and, in my view, never a Tory government again." Former cabinet heavyweights on the Tory right rallied to Major yesterday. Lord Tebbit, the former Tory chairman, said it was "no time for a leadership election." Sources close to Baroness Thatcher said she, too, was preparing to intervene on Major's behalf after the Euro-elections. Tory divisions over Europe resurfaced yesterday when Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, criticised Portillo for speaking out against a single European currency. "Obviously what he said was out of keeping with the prime minister's policy," Heath said. If the Tories were to do well in the Euro-elections, the government needed to face up to its mistakes quickly, he said If Major does fall, Heseltine remains the MPs' favourite to succeed him. He was chosen by 14 MPs in our survey, five opted for Portillo, two preferred Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and one wanted John Redwood, the Welsh secretary. Even if Major survives the Euro-results, his allies admit a leadership contest in November looks inevitable. Major's critics claimed yesterday that about 60 Tory MPs are ready to request an election -- almost twice the 34 needed under the rules -- and some Major supporters concede his position would become untenable if between 80 and 100 MPs voted for a "stalking horse" challenger or else abstained. Evidence of Major's unpopularity with the voters emerges in a poll for today's ON THE RECORD programme on BBC1. Gallup examined the views of 1,613 people who voted Tory in the last general election. Of the 988 "lost Tories" who were not planning to vote Conservative last Thursday 58 percent wanted Major to resign, 34 percent wanted him to stay and 8 percent expressed no view. Of the 625 who remained loyal to the party, 22 percent wanted Major to quit, 72 percent wanted him to stay and 6 percent expressed no view. Sir John Nott, the former defence secretary, said last night the Tory party could do with a period in opposition. Writing in THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH, he said: "Politicians in opposition can renew their acquaintance with the real world. They have the time to stand back from events and seek out the real issues."
