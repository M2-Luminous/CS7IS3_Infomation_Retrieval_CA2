In the new year, China will continue to deepen reform and open wider to the outside world. He also stressed that it is necessary to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control. [passage omitted] The state policy on macroeconomic regulation and control was drawn up by the party Central Committee and the State Council and is enforced jointly by them. However, it is different from the planned management of the past. It does not contradict the state's introduction of the socialist market economy. Commenting on this, NPC Deputy Shen Daren, who is also chairman of Jiangsu People's Congress Standing Committee, said: [Begin recording] [Shen] Macroeconomic regulation and control... [recording fades into announcer-read passage] Deputy Shen Daren held: A market economy is not a free economy in which one can do whatever one wishes. Not only is it restricted by law, but it is also subject to interference by the administrative means of the state. Experiences, both positive and negative, in economic development over the past decade show that it is impossible for localities to develop their economies successfully if the overall economy is not well developed or not enlivened, and if the economic relations between the center and localities are not straightened out. If localities only take into account their special interests to the exclusion of the overall interests, and if they ignore the damage done to the overall interests, there is no way they can preserve their special interests. In past few years some localities have, more of less, vied with one another in seeking higher growth rates, undertaking new construction projects, and recklessly trying to increase output. Problems of the localities need to be addressed. Only by solving these problems can we guarantee a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. [end recording] [passage omitted] NPC Deputy Shuai Liguo, mayor of Guangxi's Beihai City, put forward his view when he discussed the central policy on macroeconomic regulation and control. He held that macroeconomic regulation and control present opportunities for localities. Deputy Shuai Liguo said: [Begin recording] [Shuai] The introduction of macroeconomic regulation and control by the state is aimed mainly at achieving a balance between total supply and total demand in the economy and solving the problem of irrational economic structure. Under macroeconomic regulation and control, we can strengthen weak links in the local economies, readjust their structures, and remove bottlenecks restricting the development of local economies. In addition, during the period of macroeconomic regulation and control, we can strengthen the construction of urban infrastructural facilities and improve the "hard" investment environment. We can also strengthen local economic management, rectify the economic order, expand the scope of reform, accelerate the pace of transforming the operating mechanisms of enterprises, and heighten their economic performance. We can concentrate on improving the "soft" investment environment in order to lay the foundation for economic development. A rational structure in the national and local economies will, doubtless, play a role in boosting economic development. Therefore, macroeconomic regulation and control, in a positive sense, also provide an opportunity for localities to develop their economies. [end recording]
