The Czechs are led by parliament chairman Milan Uhde. Le Duc Anh said that the Vietnamese people respected democracy and human rights, adding that Southeast Asia could become a market for Czech goods. He also spoke in favor of Czech-Vietnamese parliamentary cooperation. The Czech delegation then met Vietnamese Premier Vo Van Kiet, "the man who carries the burden of the Vietnamese economic reform," Uhde told journalists, adding that the two sides spoke about the need to sign bilateral agreements on investment protection, double taxation, and tax evasion. Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec's visit, due in April, will be taking place in a favorable climate, Uhde said, adding that the current visit managed to do away with a "certain silence and unease." Same as during his recent trip to Thailand, Uhde spoke in favor of three-party cooperation involving the Czech Republic, Vietnam, and Thailand, with Thailand seen as having free capital. The Czech also met Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam.
