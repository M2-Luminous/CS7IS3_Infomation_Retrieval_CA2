"Our experiences show that it is not the question of joint military exercises or the presence of foreign troops on our territory but genuine cooperation in the interest of peace, security, democracy, and economic prosperity which should be embedded in these treaties," the letter says. To fulfill these goals "collective consultative mechanisms of all countries concerned" should be strengthened. Employees of the U.S. Embassy in Prague told CTK they could not confirm whether the letter was received by the embassy since "there were many letters addressed to the President." However, they said that Clinton would certainly get all the correspondence addressed to him. KSCM Chairman Miroslav Grebenicek writes in the letter that communists recall with pleasure Clinton's first informal visit in Prague in 1970 where he stayed in his friend's house "with the family of hero of anti-fascist resistance and renowned left-oriented politician Jan Sverma." From the position of one of the strongest Czech opposition parties the communists express their stand on Clinton's forthcoming talks in Prague and stress that the interests of the Czech Republic' security, sovereignty, national identity, and economic prosperity are their prime concern. However, unlike official representatives, the communists do not believe that membership of NATO is the road to implementing these goals. "We have very bad experiences with the Europe of Cold War and military pacts" the letter stresses.
