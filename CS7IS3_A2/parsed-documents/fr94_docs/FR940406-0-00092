SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a notice published in the Federal Register on October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54353) which announced that Sandoz Agro Inc., 1300 East Touhy Avenue, Des Plaines, IL 60018, had submitted a pesticide petition (PP 3F4177) to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), establish tolerances for the residues of the herbicide, dimethenamid, 2-chloro- N -[(1-methyl-2-methoxy)ethyl]- N -(2,4-dimethyl-thien-3-yl)-acetamide in or on the RAC soybean grain at 0.01 ppm. The Agency is editorially correcting the RAC to read soybeans. There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to this notice of filing. The data submitted in the petitions and all other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicology data considered in support of the tolerances include: 1. A rat acute oral study with an LD50 of 2.14 grams (g)/kilogram (kg), males, 1.30 g/kg females and 1.57 g/kg combined. 2. A 13&hyph;week rat feeding study with a no-observed effect level (NOEL) of 500 ppm (33.5 milligrams (mg)/kg/day for males and 40.1 mg/kg/day for females). 3. A 13&hyph;week dog feeding study with a NOEL of 100 ppm (2.5 mg/kg/day). 4. A 21 day rabbit dermal study with a NOEL of 50 mg/kg/day with mild irritant effect at all dose levels. 5. A carcinogenicity study in mice with no carcinogenic effects observed at any dose level under the conditions of the study and a systemic NOEL of 300 ppm (40.8 mg/kg/day for males and 40.1 mg/kg/day for females, based on food consumption) and a systemic lowest effect level (LEL) of 1,500 ppm (205 mg/kg/ day for males and 200 mg/kg/day for females based on food consumption) based on significantly elevated liver weights. 6. A rat chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study with a systemic NOEL of 100 ppm (5 mg/kg/day) and a LEL of 700 ppm (35 mg/kg/day) due to decreased food efficiency and histopathology findings. Under the conditions of the study limited evidence of carcinogenicity was observed based on a statistically significant increasing trend for benign liver cell tumors in male rats and a statistically significant increasing trend for ovarian tubular adenomas in female rats. A re-evaluation of the ovarian neoplasia data indicated that there was no statistically significant, dose-related, trend in the incidence of ovarian tumors in female rats. This study is discussed further below. 7. A 1 year dog feeding study with a NOEL of 250 ppm (9.6 mg/kg/day) and with a LEL = 1,250 ppm (49 mg/kg/day) based on clinical chemistry and histological changes in liver. 8. A two generation reproduction study in rats with a parental and reproductive NOEL of 500 ppm (36 mg/kg/day for males and 40 mg/kg/day for females) and a parental and reproductive LEL of 2,000 ppm (150 mg/kg/day for males and 160 mg/kg/day for females) based on reduction of body weight and of food consumption, and increases in liver weights (parental toxicity), and significant reductions in pup weight during lactation (reproductive toxicity). 9. A rabbit developmental study with a maternal NOEL of 37.5 mg/kg/day and a LEL of 75 mg/kg/day based on decreased body weight and food consumption, and with a developmental NOEL of 75 mg/kg/day and a LEL of 150 mg/kg/day based on a low incidence of abortion/premature delivery and angulation of the hyoid alae. 10. A rat developmental study with a maternal NOEL of 50 mg/kg/day and a LEL of 215 mg/kg/day based on excess salivation, increased liver weight and reduced body weight gain and food consumption, and with a developmental NOEL of 215 mg/kg/day and a LEL of 425 mg/kg/day based on increased resorptions. 11. An Ames mutagenicity assay negative with and without activation, an in vitro chromosomal aberration using CHO cells positive with and without activation, an unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes unequivocally positive in one in vitro assay and negative in another in vitro assay. A Dominant Lethal Study to further evaluate the mutagenic mechanism is due March 5, 1995 (2 years after the date of the initial conditional registration of dimethenamid under the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act [FIFRA]). The Agency has concluded that the available data provide limited evidence of carcinogenicity for dimethenamid in rats and has classified the pesticide as a Category C carcinogen (possible human carcinogen with limited evidence of carcinogenicity in animals) in accordance with Agency guidelines, published in the Federal Register in 1986 (51 FR 33992). Based on a review by the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity of the Office of Pesticide Programs, the Agency has determined that a quantitative risk assessment is not appropriate for the following reasons: 1. The tumor response was primarily due to a significantly increasing trend for benign and/or malignant liver tumors in males and due to a significantly increasing trend for ovarian tubular adenomas in female rats. A re-evaluation of the ovarian neoplasia data indicated that there was not a statistically significant, dose-related, trend in the incidence of ovarian tumors in female rats. 2. The chemical was not carcinogenic when administered in the diet to mice at dose levels ranging from 30 to 3,000 ppm. Based on this evidence, EPA concludes that dimethenamid poses at most a negligible cancer risk to humans and that for purposes of risk characterization the Reference Dose (RfD) approach should be used for quantification of human risk. Residues of dimethenamid will not concentrate in processed soybean commodities and a food or feed additive regulation is not required for dimethenamid. The standard risk assessment approach of using the RfD based on systemic toxicity was applied to dimethenamid. Using a hundredfold safety factor and the NOEL of 5 mg/kg bwt/day determined by the most sensitive species from the 2&hyph;year rat feeding study, the RfD is 0.05 mg/kg/day. The Anticipated Residue Contribution (ARC) from the established tolerances is 0.000003 mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes 0.007 percent of the RfD for the overall U. S. population. The proposed use on soybeans would contribute an additional 0.000068 mg/kg/day, raising the ARC to 0.000071 mg/kg bwt/day, or 0.14 percent of the RfD. The exposure of the most highly exposed subgroup in the population did not utilize a significantly greater amount of the RfD. Tolerances have been previously established for dimethenamid in corn grain, corn fodder and corn forage. The metabolism of dimethenamid in plants is adequately understood. There is no reasonable expectation of secondary residues occurring in meat, milk and eggs from the tolerance associated with this petition. An adequate analytical method, gas chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes. Because of the long lead time from establishing these tolerances to publication of the enforcement methodology in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II, the analytical methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Information Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Room 1130A, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, (703&hyph;305&hyph;5937). The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought. Based on the information and data considered, the Agency concludes that the establishment of the tolerances will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fees provided by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, and the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of the evidence relied upon by the objection (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 2 of Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
