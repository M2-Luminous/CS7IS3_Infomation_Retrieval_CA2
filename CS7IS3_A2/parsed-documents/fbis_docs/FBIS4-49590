Better water should improve health standards and boost economic development, experts say. Zhou Wenzhi, Vice-Minister of Water Resources, said 300 million yuan ($34.5 million) has been invested this year in water works projects, aiding 200 million people in 40,000 rural townships nationwide. And the amount of money, including 200 million yuan ($23 million) in bank credits and 100 million yuan ($11.5 million) in subsidized loans, will increase, he said. In the next few years, special funds are to be earmarhed for large scale water projects and overseas investment is to be sought. The move is needed to meet the needs of growing townships. Over the years the number of farmer-run rural enterprises has skyrocketed, attracting millions of surplus labour [as published] and causing such problems as air and water pollution. It is estimated the population in such towns will reach 250 to 300 million by the end of the century. The ministry has completed more than 7,000 water supply projects in the last few years, improving the quality of life for more than 15 million people and accelerating economic growth in rural areas, Zhou said. Projects this year, an expert said, will provide one ton of clean running water per month to farmers in areas with polluted water supply. [sentence as published] This is vital because polluted water has been directly linked to poor health standards and slow economic development. According to Zhou, many young people from the countryside fail militaly checkups due to having drunk polluted water. "It is of vital importance to the government's efforts to improve the health of the Chinese people," he said. Over 200 million of China's 900 million people in rural areas live in more than 2,000 counties and 40,000 townships. But only a minority have access to running water. Many must fetch water from nearby rivers, small reservoirs, ponds and wells. Nevertheless, these townships have developed into economic, political and cultural centres since China's reforms began in the late 1970s. Official statistics show the gross value of industrial output in rural township enterprises hit a record 1.3 trillion yuan ($150 billion) in 1992, a third of the country's total. And the figure has increased 30 times the amount in 1978, Zhou said. With such continual development, more water supply projects for rural residents are needed, Zhou said.
