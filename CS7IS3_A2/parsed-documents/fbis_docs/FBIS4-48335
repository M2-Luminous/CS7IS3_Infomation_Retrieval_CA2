The Human Rights Committee said on Monday it had asked the government to lift the state of emergency because violence had declined and there had been no change in the number of detainees, 63. Spokesman Ms Linda Mclean said violence last week was at its lowest ebb since June. She said more than 1,000 people had been murdered in the first four months of the year, an average of 55 a week. [passage omitted] Besides the 13 murders, police reported the suicide of a policeman at Umlazi, south of Durban, and the discovery of a decomposed body at KwaMakutha on the south coast.
