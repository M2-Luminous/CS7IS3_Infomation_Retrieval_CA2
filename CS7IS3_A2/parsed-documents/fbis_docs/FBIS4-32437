[ZYCIE WARSZAWY] When will Polish people receive certificates of participation in the popular privatization [swiadectwa udzialowe]? [Kaczmarek] We are planning distribution of the certificates for the end of this year and the beginning of next year--that is to say, either in December or January. We do not yet know who will be handling the operation. Negotiations are in progress, among others with Poland's largest banks and the Postal Service. I think that over 2,000 distribution centers should be set up throughout the country, so as to have at least one in each gmina [small administrative unit]. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] How much will each participation certificate cost? [Kaczmarek] Every adult citizen is entitled to receive a popular participation certificate. The appropriate statute provides that only registration fees will be collected, which will be up to 10 percent of the average salary. The certificates will be in the form of bearer securities. One will be able to sell or buy them from someone else for any price that is set. If a certificate is lost, destroyed, or stolen, no duplicate will be issued. Through brokerage houses making appropriate account transactions, it will be possible to exchange certificates for one of the shares in investment funds. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko recently presented "Strategy for Poland," which is the government's new economic program for the next three years. Among other things, it envisions speedy commercialization of large state-owned enterprises. What will happen next to the enterprises that are transformed into Treasury-owned joint-stock companies? [Kaczmarek] Through commercialization, we want to introduce management of state wealth through capital partnerships [spolka kapitalowa] in order to have a situation where supervisory boards [rady nadzorcze] and not employee boards [rady pracownicze] play a decisive role in firms subject to the transformations. Employee boards destabilize the situation of many companies. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But the "Strategy" program envisions the establishment of company boards [rady zakladowe]. [Kaczmarek] It is an attempt to look for areas of agreement in cases where there are, for instance, 15 different trade unions in an enterprise. I cannot imagine negotiating with each of them separately. Company boards--perhaps the name is not good--are to represent the entire work force of a company. Currently, we are helpless, faced with cases of obvious law violations. The recent strike in "Katowice" Steeelworks, for example, was a violation of the principles defined by a statute concerning the settling of collective disputes. An agreement was signed on salary policies one day, and, the following day, a small trade union was capable of turning everything upside down through its strike, not paying attention to whether the firm can afford the demanded pay raises. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But, in partnerships based on the Commercial Law, there are work force representatives sitting on supervisory boards. [Kaczmarek] Employee representatives sit on a supervisory board, while company boards are addressed at trade unions. This reflects the "higher-level area of agreement"--that is to say, the Trilateral Commission (government, employers, trade unions). In a commercialized company and privately owned firms, we suggest the following scheme: owner, supervisory board, company board. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] When will commercialization begin? [Kaczmarek] I would like it to begin on 1 January 1995 and to finish the following day, but, because of administrative or legal obstacles, that will not be possible, so we plan on finalizing commercialization of the 1,500 largest enterprises in the second half of 1995. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] How long will the State Treasury continue to own these enterprises? [Kaczmarek] We want to privatize them. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] By what method? [Kaczmarek] Mainly by using the capital method and, to some extent, also through National Investment Funds. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] How long will the privatization done this way last? [Kaczmarek] Ten to 20 years. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] That long? [Kaczmarek] It may seem like a long time, but let us look objectively at how much we succeeded in privatizing using the capital method over three years. It was several hundred firms. That is the most in Europe or the world, anyway. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Speaking about other countries' experiences, do you not think we could use the Czech example and carry out privatization of large state-owned enterprises through the coupon method? [Kaczmarek] I think the Polish and Czech popular privatization programs will converge at some point in the future. Then we shall see who gained a bigger advantage. The Czechs began by going "from the bottom up": First coupons were issued, then they were exchanged for shares in the funds. What we want to do is set up the funds first and then issue popular participation certificates. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] The Polish popular privatization program covers just several hundred enterprises, while the Czech program covers almost all of them. One cannot compare the two. [Kaczmarek] Given that we are muddling through conflicting interests right now, where every lobbying group wants to guard its own interest only instead of looking at macroeconomic policies, I cannot imagine coupon privatization being done in Poland. I am sorry, but I do not identify myself with the Czech philosophy of "capitalism coupons." [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But it may turn out that, in five years, the Czechs will have completely privatized their economy, and it will be much more efficient than the Polish one, which continues to be state-owned to a large extent. It is Czech firms and not Polish ones that attract more foreign capital. [Kaczmarek] The Czechs recently announced that they have too much foreign capital. When it comes to Poland, you just cannot do everything contrary to public opinion. First, one must prove to the people that privately owned firms are more efficient than state-owned ones, and only then can one move on. One cannot draw such a conclusion from Polish privatization experiences. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Do you agree with the view that privately owned partnerships are more efficient than state-owned ones? [Kaczmarek] Are you talking about the world or about Poland? [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Both. [Kaczmarek] In other countries, the privately owned sector is indeed clearly more efficient than the state-owned one. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Does it follow that you regard Poland to be an abnormal country and that you want to consolidate inefficient structures here? [Kaczmarek] No. I want to carry out privatization, but that requires time. We are certainly not planning on "preserving and stabilizing the old arrangement," as Henryka Bochniarz, who was the industry minister in the Bielecki Cabinet, says. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] The Czechs have already demonstrated that one can privatize practically anything, even the refinery industry or regional railways. They have 900 enterprises registered on their stock market, whereas we have just 25. [Kaczmarek] Yes, but what kind of a stock market is it really? Look at the enterprises, the share values, and the procedures applied. All of that is of very poor quality, so what you are saying does not convince me. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Why are the railways or the refinery industry not being privatized in Poland? [Kaczmarek] Why do you ask me that? [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Because you are the ownership transformations minister... [Kaczmarek] But I am not responsible for that. Address these questions to the transportation minister and the industry minister. Once I represent the owner of these firms, I will try to answer your questions. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] What will happen next to the institution of the State Treasury? [Kaczmarek] The Finance Ministry has prepared a draft that is based on a French/Italian model and that envisions the establishment of a management operating within the structures of state-owned enterprises through several different holding companies. The model, especially its Italian version, was a disaster. I am opposed to the idea because I do not want the emergence of another field for corruption. The Ministry of Ownership Transformations [MPW] proposes a merger of the structures of regional State Treasury offices, the MPW's regional branches, and departments of economic development and privatization in voivodship offices into single bodies called "agencies." Under the MPW's supervision, they will be managing the State Treasury's wealth at the regional level. We want to abandon central economic management. The proposal is included in the "Strategy for Poland" program. There is no question of a ministerial approach. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] What will happen next to the reprivatization law? [Kaczmarek] Its draft was transferred over for interministerial consultations. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] When will it be debated again by the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers? [Kaczmarek] In a month or two. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] A few months ago, you said that a reprivatization referendum would be absurd. Right now, you, along with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko, are in favor of voting on the issue of returning property to its rightful owners. [Kaczmarek] I think that at times it is worth asking people whether they are willing to take the burden stemming from decisions that were made 50 years ago. We have adopted the principle that, as of 1945, a lawful legal order was in operation in Poland, and there are currently no reasons or conditions to apply the principle of restitution of property. So reprivatization will not mean a return of everything that was nationalized but only reimbursements for that property that was taken illegally. Former owners will receive reprivatization coupons in return. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But these coupons will be worth less than the property that was plundered. [Kaczmarek] Why do you say that? [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Since you assume a degression scale will be applied on property worth over Z2 billion, everybody knows even now that the coupons' value will be lower than the value of the property. [Kaczmarek] If we were not to adopt a degression scale, then, according to our estimates, the reprivatization would cost the state as much as Z200 trillion, and that would be only in the case of law violations that occurred between 1944 and 1958. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] That is not the reprivatization cost but an estimated value of the property that is being claimed by former owners. Tell us how much exactly taxpayers would have to pay in order for the state to return a plundered mill, a brickyard, or a manor house with a park to its owner? [Kaczmarek] That is easy to calculate. It would be about Z6 trillion out of the state budget. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] According to what criteria? [Kaczmarek] According to simple simulation... [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] What simulation are you talking about? [Kaczmarek] What do you mean what simulation?! This is property that is in the hands of the state... [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But the state is not its owner. [Kaczmarek] What do you mean the state is not its owner?! No, this conversation makes no sense at all... [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Mr. Minister, the state is just managing the property... [Kaczmarek] And please explain to me why you are saying something like that. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Because the property was illegally taken away from its owners... [Kaczmarek] No, it was not. It was nationalized in accordance with the appropriate laws. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But the state budget does not include the property. [Kaczmarek] What do you mean? [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] The state budget is a list of state revenues and expenditures. [Kaczmarek] Exactly. Property can be sold, and revenue accruing from the sale can be listed in the budget. [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Why cannot at least part of the plundered property be returned in its natural form? [Kaczmarek] Because I do not want to have hundreds or thousands of conflicts. That is because I do not know why I am supposed to return a mill in Siedlce Voivodship in its natural form but not one in Ciechanow Voidodship because over there it would result in a major brawl. Everybody will be treated equally in the process; there will be no better or worse people. They will receive their coupons for which they will be able to purchase real estate. Nothing will be returned to them.
