FR941025-0-00004 FR941025-0-00001 In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 [44 U.S.C. Chapter 35], the information collection requirements contained in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been assigned OMB No. 0581&hyph;0149. Eliminating the Beginning Inventory Data form will decrease the information collection burden for the industry by 65 hours. It has been estimated that it will take an average of .5 hours for each of the approximately 65 handlers of kiwifruit to complete the KISS form. Thus the finalized change will increase the overall burden by 325 hours because the KISS form is filed with the committee more frequently. A proposed rule concerning this action was published in the Federal Register on August 14, 1994 [59 FR 41717], with a 30-day comment period ending September 14, 1994. No comments were received. Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register [5 U.S.C. 553] because: (1) Handlers have begun labeling boxes in preparation of shipping kiwifruit for the 1994/1995 season which began in mid-September; (2) Handlers are aware of this rule, which was unanimously recommended by the committee at a public meeting; and (3) a 30-day comment period was provided for in the proposed rule.

For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 920 is amended as follows: PART 920_KIWIFRUIT GROWN IN CALIFORNIA 1.
