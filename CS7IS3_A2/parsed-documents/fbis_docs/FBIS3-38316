President Clinton informed her that President al-Asad neither promised anything nor opened any door on the issue of the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] and Hizballah during their talks in Geneva. Considering President al-Asad's indifference to PKK terrorist activities, Turkish Foreign Ministry officials have said: "It seems President al-Asad wishes to continue to use the PKK as a trump card against Turkey." Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin is reportedly expected to hold bilateral talks with his Syrian counterpart when the foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran, and Syria hold a summit on northern Iraq in Istanbul early in February. Recalling that the summit should have been held in November 1993 but was repeatedly postponed because of Syria's objections, Foreign Ministry officials have revealed that Damascus has informed Ankara that the Syrian foreign minister may visit Istanbul from 4 to 6 February. But they have also said that "Iran has not yet responded."
