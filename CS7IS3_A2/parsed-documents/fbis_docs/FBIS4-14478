He said the working draft of the agreement submitted to Boris Yeltsin has been basically approved by the president. Interfax has not received confirmation of the information from official sources. At the office of the presidential advisor Satarov our reporter was told they do not know "the full reaction" of Yeltsin to the working document. The official who was involved in drafting the agreement confirmed that one of the main provisions renounces the introduction of destabilizing constitutional amendments, in particular concerning the procedure and time of presidential elections. In keeping with the draft, the organizers of rallies and demonstrations shall assume the responsibility for the peaceful nature of the actions. The draft also calls for refraining from making evaluations of the 1991 attempted coup and developments in October 1993 in a manner which hightens public confrontation. The official found unrealistic the idea expressed by certain creators of the draft to pass a special law to better control the observation of the agreement by its sides (the president, government, parliament, trade unions, political parties and public movements). Still he admitted that the mechanisms provided for by the draft rely primarily on the moral capacity of those who are going to sign it. Under the draft a permanent conciliatory committee will be formed. If the agreement is violated it will call for the resignation or dissolution of the person or group in question through the media. In the opinion of the administration member, the document should be widely discussed after the president approves its text. He spoke of the possibility of a debate at a regular session of Public Chamber under the president due on April 9. He said it would be useful to involve some organizations which have gained a reputation for being extremist in the work on the agreement.
