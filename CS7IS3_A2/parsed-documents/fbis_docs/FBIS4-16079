Azerbaijani military aircraft is going on with barbarous bombardments. Meanwhile the Azerbaijani leader Geydar Aliyev makes cynic appeals to the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh to stop the bloodshed assuring the security for the Karabakh Armenians. Twice in a period of three days the Azerbaijani war planes bombed the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh -- the Azerbaijani authorities showed the real truth of their false statements. The document the Karabakh Government issued states the Karabakh authorities made the Karabakh troops undertake all the measures to defend the civil population. Besides, the Karabakh side reserves the right to retaliate. The document says the Azerbaijani side is responsible for the escalation of the tension in the region.
