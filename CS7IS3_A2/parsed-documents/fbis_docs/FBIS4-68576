Certainly, the Kurdish question in Azerbaijan is perceived differently from Turkey. This is only natural. Mutual relations between Azerbaijan citizens who are of other nationalities and Kurds are not at the level of armed confrontation as in Turkey and could be characterized up to the present by peaceful understanding and mutual respect. But it is an undeniable fact that a number of foreign political and state circles are intentionally active to artificially inflame ethnic relations in Azerbaijan -- the sources of tension of the Lezgian question in the north, the Kurdish question in the west, and the Talysh question in the south corresponds to the geographical aspects of the territories where these problems are inflamed. The Kurdish question, as seen from these abbreviated materials (and not only from these) surfaced under the influence and administration from Moscow as channeled through Yerevan for many years. Today Armenia is bringing the "Kurdish card," which has been used very capably against Turkey, into the "game" with Azerbaijan. We wished to believe that our Kurdish compatriots would understand this truth: as a result of inflaming the Kurdish question in Azerbaijan artificially and in a dangerous direction, they will serve the interests of not only the Kurds, but also completely different forces. According to official information, 56,000 Kurds live in Armenia; according to the Kurds, there are 150,000. The PKK [Kurdistan Workers' Party] began its "Armenia action" two years ago. The majority of the first group consisted of PKK members coming from Cologne. Their goal was to draw the Kurds living in Armenia into a "fight." This was not very difficult because all of the Kurds living in 21 villages had migrated there from Turkey in 1828. Two years ago the PKK began its "Armenian action" by wandering from village to village asking this question: "Would you rather dance, or have an independent state?" As time went one, the number of those opting for an independent state increased. Today, all 21 villages in Armenia are a PKK encampment. Theoretical instruction is being given. Every adult village inhabitant comes to the lectures of the PKK cadres in the village house. The lectures are aimed toward an understanding of "Independent Kurdistan in Turkey." It is also possible to see camp discipline in the villages. All cultural activity is about "Kurdishness" and directed from the same center. When we were guests in the home of Ishhan Aslan, who formerly worked in the Kurdish broadcasting section of Radio Yerevan but has now been selected as the commander of all the PKK in Armenia and bears the stamp of the Lachyn Kurdish Republic on his hand, explained the new strategy of the PKK: "When the sun rose, he gave 72 peoples the place they wanted, and now it is our turn. We know that our liberation can only be possible with the liberation of Turkish Kurdistan. Therefore, we are going to fight." Ishhan Aslan is from Diyarbekir. His family emigrated to Armenia in 1936. The walls of his home in Afshin village are full of photographs showing the Mahsum Korkmaz Academy together with PKK partisans, Abdullah Ojala (leader of the PKK -- ed.) and portraits of dead guerrillas. "As soon as it is needed we will send the Kurds under our command to fight." "The same pertains to Armenia, which causes no problems among us." The military command of the PKK in Armenia does not publicize the partisan groups, those in training, or questions about weaponry, but a "very recent" video cassette did not fail to put us on the track: The Krasnodar meeting! This is a documentary film on a PKK meeting of which we were unaware up to now. The PKK held a meeting attended by 102 representatives in Krasnodar in Russia from the 1st to the 8th of July. There were 12 Kurds from Armenia and 54 from Central Asia. At the end of the meeting a joint resolution was issued. Ishhan Aslan was elected as military commander at this meeting and took up his duties in the Assembly of the Lachin Kurdish Republic which was declared in June 1992 with Armenia's permission. He says: "We are training an army of 20,000 soldiers. There were close to a million Kurds in the former Soviet Union. We know that many will join us in this fight we are beginning. This question was also discussed in Krasnodar. We established the Kurdish Union. It was said that the Lachyn lands would be turned over to this union when it passed into Armenian-Azeri ownership." On 15 August the 10th anniversary celebration of the PKK was held in Afshin village with four thousand people taking part. This is the central base of the PKK in Armenia. It is 50 kilometers from Kars. Ishhan Aslan, military commander of the Kurds in Armenia, lives in this village. We went to the village square and found a crowd playing zurnas [a kind of lute] and bells. In their hands were pictures and portraits of Abdullah Ojala, and the red, white and green flag with a sun in the middle of the Mahabad Kurdish Republic under which we believed that all Kurds would rally...The crowd was chanting the slogan "Bizhi Apochi, bizhi PKK!" We had the feeling that some youths were standing at a distance from the cameras. We entered the "guest house." Inside were many chairs and benches. The bookshelves were filled with books and magazines. The walls were occupied by signs and announcements written in the Cyrillic alphabet. Lectures are being held in this "guest house." Meetings and seminars are held here. The question of "Kurdistan" is discussed here... An old man emerged from the crowd and came to our side. "My father is Botanly. I was born here. May the road to Apo be smooth. If he wishes, God will grant it. I am 65 years old, but I am ready to fight." Mers Memlioghlu shouted in Turkish: "We want to come and give our own blood. May there be a Kurdistan, may the Kurds have their own land. May the PKK be victorious..." A youth raised a picture of Abdullah Ojala and shouted in Kurdish: "I am going to fight as a partisan!" Barzany Dirbo, who was the same age, also shouted "I am from Kars. I, too, am going to fight!" Hano Cherkez added, "Me, too." Koroghlu Esger, 53 years old and from Kars, promises: "When I say Apo, I think of Kurdistan. We live in comfort here, but our hearts are there. Thus, we are sending the youths to fight. We have still not had a martyr." Although Koroghlu Esger says that they have given no "martyrs," Javo Avdal from Afshin, who was killed in an operation the south-west in the last few months, was in the PKK. His father Abdul and his mother Nigar Avdal said "May our ten sons be sacrificed for independent Kurdistan." As for Javo Avdal's wife Aloyan, she lives in Yerevan. Although we wanted to meet with her, she did not want to meet with us. Her acquaintances say, "Aloyan is also going to war, she is also in the PKK and has no children." Javo went alone to Turkey. He went with three companions from Shamiran, the largest J=Kurdish village, and a PKK member who had come from Turkey. They traveled in the following way: one hour to Batumi, and from Batumi by sea to Trabzon and Kars... We asked about those fighting in Turkey and whether they had any arms training before they went, but received no answer... Yet another proof of the presence of the PKK in Armenia are the two weekly newspapers located in central Yerevan: REYA TAZE (NEW WAY) and BOTAN REDAKSIYON. REYA TAZE, with a circulation of two thousand, is the organ of the Armenian Communist Party and the central state press organ. Within the 52 newspapers published in Yerevan, it stands in third place. For the last two years REYA TAZE, which has existed for 63 years, has been spreading the ideas of the PKK. As for BOTAN REDAKSIYON, it was begun by PKK members who came from Turkey and Europe a few months ago and has a circulation of 2,500. We met with Amerike Serdar, director of the press bureau of REYA TAZE in a twelve-storey building in Yerevan. Serdar is also the director of the Kurdish Intellectuals Union, which was founded two years ago. "I am a member of the PKK," he says. "The struggle of the PKK is the basic struggle of the Kurdish nation." "I am also an Apochu. We have tied our future to the future of the PKK. We do not belong here. Finally we will have a country of our own. Whoever wants to can go there and settle down." We await Dr. Sheref Ashir at REYA TAZE. He is professor of the politics of the peoples of the Middle East at the Yerevan Polytechnic Institute and assistant to the General Director of the Kurdish Intellectuals Union. But Ashiri has an even more important position: he is a member of the Assembly of the Lachyn Kurdish Republic...When he met with us, he selected a very attentive and cautious manner. In answer to our question "Are the PKK-ists coming here?" he said: "Kurds come and go here from everywhere. The basic criterion is love of country." Our duties are for the future. We are striving for social, economic and political power for the Kurds. "In this question, we also have relations with the state of Armenia." We asked Sheref Ashiri about Mustafa Vekili, head of the Lachyn Kurdish Republic. "I have not seen him for a long time," he says. We do not believe him because we know that they were both at the meeting in Krasnodar a week earlier. The fact is that the PKK camps in Armenia did not correspond to the image of a PKK encampment that was in our imagination, but what we saw, proved and heard in Armenia proved without doubt that the PKK is present there.
