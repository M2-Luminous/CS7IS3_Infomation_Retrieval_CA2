Statistics from the provincial government show that last year the province's agricultural output totaled 68.3 billion yuan (about 7.85 billion U.S. dollars), up by three percent over the previous year. Farmers' per capita income hit 1,600 yuan, up by ten percent in real terms. Last year, the province was hit by successive natural adversities such as cold waves, hail, storms and typhoons, with direct losses totaling 12.2 billion yuan. Government officials attribute the increase to the dissemination of improved grain varieties and cash crops, and a better development of livestock and some poultry. In addition, the province has been putting great emphasis on fostering agricultural bases for the production of fine grains, vegetables and fruits.
