Col. Kh. Alyautdinov: "I find myself wondering why and for whom we are doing all of this. Whom are we protecting? I have the sense that no one wants this." I understood not only what he said, but also what he chose not to say. That is why I went to the most exclusive and ominous bar in Yaroslavl--the "Golden Bear." The building, which is located in an neglected park, has no external appeal whatsoever. In fact, it looks like a painted shed, but as soon as I walked up to the door, it opened and a young man with an athletic build asked politely from inside: "May I help you?" After hearing that I wanted to see the director, he stepped aside and courteously helped me remove my coat. I entered a luxurious room, tastefully decorated with modern furniture and the finest china and glassware, and also...with soft and soothing music playing in the background. An attractive long-legged waitress brought me a cup of coffee, an orange, a glass of water, and...a check for 3,540 rubles. According to reports received by the organized crime-fighting division of the Yaroslavl Oblast Internal Affairs Administration, the main black marketeers and criminal "authorities" were supposed to meet here for a "convention." They were supposed to agree on the division of economic spheres of influence and reach a consensus on certain areas of controversy. The Moscow bosses and representatives of the Georgian and Chechen Mafia were expected as guests. This interregional meeting was viewed by the Yaroslavl police as an exceptionally disturbing event. After all, the experience of other cities, not to mention Yaroslavl itself, indicated that "conferences" of this kind frequently culminated in bloody confrontations. The Yaroslavl Organized Crime-Fighting Division began planning an operation to cut the "convention" short and arrest the guests of the exclusive bar. The rapid-response team which had been created specifically for the apprehension of armed criminals in emergency situations would be part of the operation. The detectives knew the time and place of the gang leaders' meeting, and they were even "accompanying" the bosses all the way from Moscow. The crime world had responded quickly to the creation of the new subdivision fighting organized crime and had established a reliable system of defense against the infiltration of their top ranks by MVD personnel. At around 1600 hours the guests began arriving at the family tavern of Ye. Karpova. They ordered tea at first, and then cold appetizers and meat. The family dinner began. By that time the personnel of the special subdivision had entered the kitchen and had dashed from there into the main dining room. Within 30 or 40 seconds they were leading the visitors out of the bar and asking for their identification papers, filming the whole operation with a video camera. It was a motley crew: former Komsomol personnel, prominent athletes, and novice businessmen. In all, 32 people were detained, including 10 "chiefs" from Moscow, 12 residents of Chechnya, and 10 representatives of Yaroslavl commercial groups and their companions. Unfortunately, the success of the raid was minimal. Because no one was armed (although there was a weapon in an old Zaporozhets parked near the bar, according to some reports), no one could be charged with a crime, and the police had to release all of the "innocent diners." I think they did this grudgingly. After all, they know all about the present activities and the criminal past of many of the people who were detained. Just four of them had spent a total of a quarter of a century behind bars. Knowing this, however, is not the same as being able to take action within the law. Organized crime is a complex structure today, enveloping our whole society like a cobweb. Furthermore, its social base is growing broader. By constantly augmenting its covert economic relations, it has already turned into a threat to the system of public administration. The organization of the old crime world, which was based on concealment from society, is undergoing rapid renovation. The strong will of the leaders of organized crime is combined with intelligence, and they are excellent organizers, psychologists, and economists. Furthermore, the people behind them are absolutely respectable gentlemen who are almost above suspicion. That is the reason for the minimal results, and sometimes even the outright failures, that provide the grounds for the contradictory evaluations of police performance. The events in the "Golden Bear" demonstrate all of the complexity and depth of the criminals' social mimicry. "Golden Bear" proprietress Ye. Karpova, for instance, is an expert at impersonating a victim. "This bar belongs to my private firm `Katerina,'" she explained. "Our clients have always been respectable. We never let suspicious people in. Yes, our bar is frequented by local `authorities,' and we know them, but can you name a bar they do not frequent?..." Of course, the proprietress of the "Golden Bear" immediately filed a complaint with the procuracy, accusing the police of beating her daughter, Yu. Pautova, who was working in the kitchen at that time. The Kirovskiy Rayon Procuracy charged the police with exceeding their authority. Deputy Chief Kh. Alyautdinov of the Organized Crime-Fighting Division publicly acknowledged that "the operation might have been conducted with more finesse, but our boys in the special subdivision do not have that much experience. All of the cafe owners' complaints about their behavior were investigated by the heads of the Internal Affairs Administration and the Procuracy in the manner prescribed by law." There is good reason for the special interest in the exclusive bar. The owners serve a select clientele. One day they even turned away the deputy chief of the crime-fighting division, who had come there with his family, because he was not one of their regular patrons. Furthermore, this is not the first time the bar has been under investigation. How could an establishment with only around 10 patrons a night be so successful? High prices? Yes! But how high would they have to be to cover expenses and provide a profit? That is what made certain agencies suspicious.... The "Golden Bear" is closely associated with a firm in the motion picture business. Was it a coincidence that the deputy director of the firm was at the bar on the date of the "convention" and was one of the men detained by the special subdivision? Besides this, bar director Ye. Karpova was a good friend of Mudryashov, the municipal administrator who was killed not long ago. He was not the only one who was killed at that time, during the struggle for spheres of influence and power. Now the people in charge are his friends and associates, and perhaps his conquerors, but it was Mudryashov who guaranteed the safety of the "Golden Bear." "It was because of him that no one bothered us," Ye. Karpova admitted. "He told everyone that we were his friends. That was a long time ago, and no one has bothered us up to now...." I think the proprietors of trade and food service establishments are well aware of the price of this protection. Literally all of them are expected to pay outrageous fees for it. Furthermore, it was apparently no coincidence that the interregional meeting of the "influential" men was held in the "Golden Bear." Incidentally, according to reports received by the organized crime-fighting division, the decision to give one of the Yaroslavl "authorities" the control of the purchase and sale of weapons was made at that "conference." One of the guests at the "family dinner" was killed in Moscow soon afterward. Another appeared on the central television network and announced his intention to form a new party. In this way, the consolidation of economic influence is being accompanied by the gradual politicizing of the crime world, reflecting its leaders' plans to use their capital to create more favorable conditions for their activities. The friendly gathering in the bar is already having far-reaching consequences. Yaroslavl's proximity to Moscow has made it an appealing location for the investment of criminal capital in privatized state property, the sale of real estate, and involvement in trade and financial affairs. The money is usually invested in spheres with a quick turnover, where there are no production stages guaranteeing superprofits. The reason is simple: Businesses with a quick turnover of capital are difficult to monitor. Is this why Yaroslavl is called the "sweet city"? The organized crime-fighting division assured me that they have the situation in the city under control and cited some reassuring statistics. Last year division personnel solved 227 crimes, 76 of which were committed by organized crime gangs, including 24 with implications of corruption. The criminals had managed to launder more than a billion rubles with the aid of fraudulent bank documents. A large criminal gang had been discovered in the oil business. All of this is impressive, but reports received by the same division indicate the rapid growth and merger of criminal gangs in Yaroslavl. Private security firms with criminal connections are springing up like mushrooms. Trade establishments with respectable names are using coercive methods at privatization auctions to buy state property and real estate at low prices. The motor transport base with a large sports complex here, for example, was sold for only 60 million. According to a reliable source, a noodle shop with imported equipment was privatized for 47 million rubles. Some commercial structures that were established as part of state enterprises are also closely related to criminal businesses. There are some companies with colossal assets in Yaroslavl that are still in the shadows. Some own hotels or gambling and trade establishments, but who is behind all of this? The common opinion is that criminal communities cannot exist without the help of corrupt officials, who cover their tracks in exchange for a share of their income. The events at the "Golden Bear" aroused some interest and were then immediately forgotten. Only Kh. Alyautdinov took the failure to heart. Every cloud, however, has a silver lining. This might contribute to the realization that traditional police methods of fighting organized crime cannot produce the desired results. Running around in kitchens in bullet-proof vests and masks and waving assault rifles cannot be effective in fighting the forces that are now a visible segment of the Russian society. This will take other methods and other skills. We still have to learn them. From whom? From life, of course.
