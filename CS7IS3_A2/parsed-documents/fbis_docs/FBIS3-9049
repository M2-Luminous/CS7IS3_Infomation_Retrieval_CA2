Granic felt the Serbian side should accept two preconditions: Withdrawal from the occupied territories and permitting trials of suspected war criminals. The Serbs should be obliged by the international community to start negotiations, the vice-president said. Slobodan Milosevic's rule over Serbia is not strong enough to resist the world's will for ever, he believed. Granic ruled out a politically restored federal Yugoslavia yet felt successor states might grow closer again economically in a few years' time.
