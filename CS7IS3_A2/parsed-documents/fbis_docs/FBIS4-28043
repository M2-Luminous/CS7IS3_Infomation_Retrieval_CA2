Spokesman Lt Gen Anuson Kritsanaserani, however, confirmed that a group of Thai military officers met in Hong Kong recently to discuss the current political situation. "They did talk about politics but it did not amount to anything concrete," Anuson said. Anuson was commenting on a press report that a group of senior military officers met secretly in Hong Kong early this week as domestic political tensions grew over Chalat Worachat's hunger strike. "It was a coincidence," Anuson said of the Hong Kong meeting. The spokesman insisted that the military was not making any move in response to the political situation. "The military just monitors the political situation. But it has no intention of making any move." Anuson said the military believed that despite the tensions the political situation "poses no concerns". "There is nothing of concern yet. We don't anticipate any violence," he said.
