New Phase of Crisis Russian society has entered a phase of systemic crisis: This means, first of all, that the crisis has had a seriously injurious effect on all the main spheres of societal life, not just a few, and that it cannot be surmounted in any of these spheres without recovery in the others. Second, regressive changes have almost reached the critical point at which they could become irreversible and could deprive Russia of its chances for social and economic progress for a protracted period of indefinite length. The continued recession in the economy has led to the dramatic deterioration of the structure of productive forces. The first production units to be ruined will not be the underdeveloped ones, but the most progressive, high-technology fields of production--precisely those that would secure the breakthrough to qualitatively new frontiers of economic development. Our domestic scientific and technical potential is being destroyed. There has been a disastrous decrease in the output of the very products on which the restoration of production with reliance on our own resources would depend (machines, equipment, and building materials). In this way, the prospects for intensive and extensive economic growth have been undermined to a dangerous extent. In the sphere of production relations the abrupt stratification of society along property lines has not created any new productive classes. This has not been the "classic" (according to Marx) form of capitalization of societal relations, but a process of rapid social degradation and the growth of parasitical declassed strata on all levels, which subsist on redistribution and conspicuous consumption instead of the productive accumulation of societal resources. All of this has had a particularly injurious effect on our youth. We have witnessed the rapid reduction of labor reserves and loss of labor skills. Soon there will be no resources for economic restoration and no one capable of accomplishing it. The policies of the government are based on a balancing act between the rising rates of inflation and unemployment. The balance is maintained primarily by using up all the resources accumulated in earlier decades with no thought of replacing them. As the last of these resources are being depleted, the monetarist methods of economic development are losing even the semblance of effectiveness. The cultural and moral potential of society has suffered a dangerous decline. Russia is the target of unprecedented ideological aggression for the purpose of suppressing its cultural and historical features and the continuity of its development. Their obliteration and replacement with the mediocre Western brand of "common human" values could lead to the loss of the instinct of national-state self-preservation and the will to resist the economic, political, and spiritual colonization threatening our country. The coup d'etat the president and his administration carried out in September and October created a constitutional-legal vacuum in political affairs. The real power in the country has been usurped by bureaucratic executive structures that are free of any effective societal control and are increasingly likely to rely on violence or threats of violence. This has been accompanied by the increasingly confident efforts of organized crime to serve as the "regulator" of economic and political affairs. These two structures are undergoing an intense merger, installing the machinery of a criminal-bureaucratic dictatorship. This has put every aspect of public safety in danger: the personal safety of citizens and their property, the social protection of the laboring public, the technological safety of production, and the economic and military security of the country. All of this is constantly diminishing the state-political unity and integrity of the Russian Federation. Alternatives The experience of recent years has proved unequivocally that emergence from systemic crisis by means of the capitalization of the country is impossible. Even if the processes of establishing "authentic" capitalist production relations and a civilian society of the bourgeois type are going on, they are incomparably slower than the related processes that are destroying the material and spiritual foundations of society and state. Their clearest reflection is in the subversion of the bases of civic peace in society. Today the country is already in a state of torpid civil war, interspersed with outbursts of increasingly savage brutality against the people. These destructive processes are resulting in the gradual disappearance of the actual bases for the maintenance of civic peace in society. In connection with this, the possible course of future events is becoming increasingly ominous. The most alarming possibility is the danger that the escalated tension created by the social degradation and impoverishment of society will turn into an uncontrollable anarchic rebellion by declassed elements, in a "war against all" for the remainder of our society's resources. Communists must be prepared for any turn of events, and if a particular turn of events cannot be prevented, it will be our party's duty to give the spontaneous mass movement the most organized structure possible and direct it into the channels of conscious class struggle by the laboring public for its vested interests. We do believe, however, that a civil war, regardless of how just it may be, will be a tragedy for the country and the people. There can be no victors in this kind of war under present conditions. That is why the Communist Party is certain that the preservation of civic peace and its consolidation by means of a transition to the socialist pattern of development are essential conditions for the avoidance of a national-state disaster. That is our alternative, and it is completely in the interests of the vast majority of people. With a view to this and to its own actual capabilities as an opposition force, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has set three strategic objectives: 1. The achievement of civic peace as the main condition for emergence from the systemic crisis and for the transition to socialist development. 2. The creation of a broad coalition of leftist, centrist, patriotic, and national-democratic forces capable of neutralizing the "civil war party" and then accomplishing its political, economic, and moral isolation. 3. The assumption of power by the coalition as a result of an election victory or by other peaceful and nonviolent means. The organizational and ideological-theoretical preparation of the party for work following the victory of the coalition of national-democratic forces. The successful attainment of these general democratic objectives and the existence of strong government by the people and social stability will create the necessary prerequisites for a peaceful and civilized struggle by the communists for their less immediate policy goals. The Road to Civic Peace The Communist Party of the Russian Federation defines the state of civic peace as a set of social conditions and political procedures agreed upon by various social forces for the resolution of their differences exclusively by peaceful and nonviolent means. Civic peace does not mean universal harmony and the absence of conflict in society. The struggle between different tendencies is natural and inevitable, and there will always be winners and losers in this struggle, but it must not lead to the destruction of the state and its economy, social sphere, and spiritual foundation. Civic peace is not achieved by the mere signing of a formal declaration of some kind. It must be based not on declarations, but on a group of real and perceptible moves directed primarily at the elimination of concrete sources of civic confrontation. Today these sources, the main "risk factors," are the abrupt stratification of society along property lines, accompanied by uncontrollable recession and inflationary processes; violation of the socioeconomic rights of the working public; lack of balance between branches of government; the growth of corruption and crime and the diminution of public security and personal safety; spiritual impoverishment and destruction of the traditional cultural environment; regional and ethnic separatism; dismemberment of historical Russia as a result of the collapse of the USSR and the transformation of the Russian nationality into a divided people. The most complex group of problems exists in the sphere of political relations. The political regime that was installed during the coup d'etat is distinguished by a severe crisis of legality, monopolization of power by presidential and executive structures, and deprivation of all other participants in the political process of any opportunity to influence the affairs of state. Elimination of this constant source of political confrontation will require acknowledgement of the need for close cooperation by various social forces to surmount the crisis and establish the kind of interaction by the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government and by political parties, trade unions, associations of producers of goods, and public organizations that will secure not only a genuine balance and stronger guarantees of the performance of their functions and fulfillment of their mutual obligations but also a considerable augmentation of responsibility for the state of affairs in the country. Today the executive branch of government is free of responsibility because of the virtual lack of oversight, and the legislative branch is free of responsibility because of its total lack of power. Augmentation and redistribution of responsibility will be impossible without redistribution of powers among the branches of government and reinforcement of their mutual democratic oversight. This will require the following: --elimination of the present separation of the chambers of the Federal Assembly and the definition of the sphere of their joint and equal jurisdiction, which will necessarily include interrelations of the Federal Assembly with the executive branch; --elimination of the dualism of the executive branch--the dual subordination of ministries and departments to the chief of state and the head of government. Establishment of the prime minister's exclusive jurisdiction over their routine operations. Clarification of the powers and functions of the president and his administration in connection with this; --a move to the principle of government accountability to representative bodies, and legislative definition of the government structure and staff by the Federal Assembly. The assembly's approval of the government program defining its main goals and the deadlines for their attainment, as well as the composition of the government staff. The impermissibility of intervention in the routine work of government on the approved program, and the possibility of removal of the government by the Federal Assembly in the event of departures from the program; --exclusion of agencies in charge of state television and radio broadcasting systems from the executive branch. Their creation on an equal basis by parliament, the government, and the judiciary with consideration for the opinions of political parties, trade unions, and public organizations. Guarantee of equal access to the media for representatives of all branches of government, political parties, trade unions, and other public organizations; --restoration of the whole vertical structure of representative bodies of government, extension of the accountability of executive bodies to representative bodies to all levels of public administration, and return of agencies of local self-government to the system of governmental authority; --strict delineation of spheres of jurisdiction of different levels of governmental authority, consolidation of autonomy in the exercise of their powers, and encouragement of their closer interaction and cooperation; --agreement that the highest priority of Russian policy is reestablishment of the Union state on a new and voluntary basis, and denunciation of the sections of the Belovezha accords abrogating the Union Treaty; --agreement on the need to bring constitutional laws into conformity with the principles set forth above. Another important prerequisite for the restoration of civic peace is a change of socioeconomic policies. A complete program of national economic recovery and emergence from crisis can only be coordinated through the joint efforts of all concerned parties within the confines of the political procedures described above. Several measures, however, will brook no delay. They include the following: --cessation of predatory privatization and verification of the legality and economic expediency of all earlier transactions, and verification of the legal origins of capital invested in privatization projects; --legislative guarantees of the priority rights of labor collectives to own and use public property and to choose specific forms of denationalization wherever it is economically justified, and a ban on interference in the economic affairs of enterprises owned by collectives or groups, particularly in the agro-industrial complex; --reimbursement of losses incurred by citizens and economic organizations as a result of the "shock therapy" and the planning of ways to resolve the nonpayments crisis, to pay all back wages, and to make cost-of-living adjustments in savings accounts--not by issuing more currency but by confiscating illegally acquired capital; --legislative guarantees of the socioeconomic rights of the laboring public to labor, recreation, housing, education, health care, and social security. The main governmental-legal and cultural-moral prerequisites for the preservation and consolidation of civic peace include the following: --a more intense struggle against corruption and crime and against the merger of the bureaucracy with mafia capital, and the closure of all channels for the theft of societal resources; --protection of the spiritual and moral environment from the forcibly instituted cult of vice, violence, and easy money; --acknowledgement of the purpose and value of all periods of Russian and Soviet history, and the impermissibility of any mockery of the people's patriotic symbols, monuments, and victories; --renunciation of ideological revenge and all kinds of prohibitions and discrimination against citizens adhering to opposition views; --the institution of all possible measures for the prevention of interethnic conflicts, return of refugees, and consolidation of the friendship and fraternity of all nationalities in the country; --maximum effort to enhance the combat capabilities of the army and its soldiers and veterans, and protection of the high prestige of citizens discharging their patriotic military duty; --restoration of our state's prestige in international affairs and the exclusion of any incidents of betrayal and neglect of our national interests by diplomatic and other representatives. Acceptance of this minimum agenda by all the main classes and social groups as the basis for civic peace will prevent spontaneous social upheavals and keep the political, economic, and ideological struggle within civilized boundaries. Prospects of Coalition for Civic Peace During the struggle for civic peace and under the conditions of this peace, the opposition will still be the opposition, and the Communist Party will still be the Communist Party and will have its own program for the rebirth of the fatherland. In any discerning analysis of past experience, we have to note that the opposition acquired its present form at some point in the middle of 1992. The composition of the opposition forces stabilized, and their political and mass nucleus acquired distinct outlines. Sometimes, however, the opposition tends to be too self-contained. Its meetings and rallies and its press sometimes seem to perform a venting function, serving as a means of psychological release instead of mobilization. Because of the decline of active public involvement, the organizational nucleus of the opposition is obviously not strong enough. The October defeat in 1993 served as evidence of this. In this context, the pseudo-opposition has been able to influence public thinking to a considerable extent with the pseudo-patriotic demagoguery of individuals who were always too cowardly to join the real struggle and can only discredit the opposition movement with their behavior. The opposition's next objectives are the attraction of potential reserves, reinforcement of its social, material, and organizational base, and augmentation of the opposition to the scale of a national and democratic coalition for civic peace and accord for Russia's sake. The prospects of this coalition will depend on the success in accomplishing the following: --encouragement of political movements from the centrist and liberal spectrum to join, as well as trade unions and associations of industrialists and entrepreneurs; --delineation of the sphere of mutual consensus on issues connected with the preservation of civic peace and defense of the country's fundamental national-state interests without slurring over differences of opinion in all other areas; --coordination of the actions of various detachments of the opposition after determining the special goals and functions of each; --consolidation of the political experience of parties, the organizational potential of trade unions, and the financial capabilities of industrialists and entrepreneurs for the attainment of common goals by forming a shadow government and choosing prestigious candidates for nomination in the presidential election campaign. We realize that the coalition's methods of achieving power will depend on future events in the country. Although the opposition advocates peaceful forms of political struggle, it cannot exclude the possibility of all types of provocations by the ruling elite and reserves the right to respond in appropriate ways to the kind of situation this would create. These are the steps the Communist Party of the Russian Federation plans to take on the road to civic peace and accord. It is ready to make its part of the journey and is hoping for the understanding and support of all sensible and truly patriotic and democratic forces concerned about the future of our motherland. This document was adopted at the Second All-Russian CPRF Conference on 24 April 1994.
