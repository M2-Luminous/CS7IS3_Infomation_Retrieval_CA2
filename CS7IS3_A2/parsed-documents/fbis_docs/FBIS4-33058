The source told NOTIMEX that "there is a group that remains inflexible" in its position to request political asylum in Belgium. This is the first indication there are opposing opinions among the Cubans who are occupying Ambassador Paul Vermeirsch's house. The source added that the exact number of members of the "inflexible" group remains unknown as of tonight, four days after the violent takeover of the residence. He also added that most of the people who occupied the house have maintained a "peaceful attitude." The source pointed out that, despite this situation, the Cuban and Belgian Governments continued to meet during the ordeal and affirmed their determination to resolve this situation by negotiation. On 30 May, an exchange of talking points between the Foreign Relations Ministries of the two countries followed a number of meetings, during which Havana and Brussels concluded the occupation was "illegal." The two governments rejected the forceful occupation of the residence as a formula to negotiate the departure of Cubans and agreed that the members of the invading group should follow legal procedures. It was learned in official Cuban circles on Tuesday [31 May] that the number of occupants is 22, including "about 30 women and 20 children." [figures as received] This figure contrasts with that of other sources, both local and official, which coincides with the number released by Belgian authorities of 114 persons in all: 56 men, 34 women, and 24 minors. One man, who according to several sources left the building on his own accord Sunday night without being challenged by the police that guard the residence, must be subtracted from the total. On Monday afternoon, and in front of Vermeirsch's residence, a Cuban Government official read through a loudspeaker an official communique urging the occupants to vacate the building and follow the legal procedures to leave the country. The statement, of which the press had no copies, confirmed that the Cuban authorities will not take reprisals against those who started the incident, a government source reported. An official of the Foreign Ministry's International Press Center (CPI) said officials of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba confirmed the government position yesterday. The source also disclosed that Ambassador Vermeirsch notified Cuban authorities that he had begun efforts to get the Red Cross to provide food, personal hygiene supplies, and other humanitarian aid for the house's occupants. Cuba reiterated its willingness to take the necessary steps for this aid to be delivered to the residence and for the occupants to do the legal paperwork needed to leave the country, the source added. The CPI official, who transmitted the government reports and information from the police unit in charge of protecting the residence to reporters, said the occupants are sleeping inside the house, on the terrace, and in the garden.
