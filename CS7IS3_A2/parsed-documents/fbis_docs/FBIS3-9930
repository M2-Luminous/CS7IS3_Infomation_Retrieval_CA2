Vargas reaffirmed that the PAC have spearheaded counterinsurgency activity in the countryside. In this context, the existence of the PAC is fully justified, not only for that reason but also because they provide security for the inhabitants. She explained that in areas where there is no guerrilla threat, the PAC are becoming Peace and Development Committees. These committees help bring progress to their communities. Vargas admitted that some patrol members have committed human rights violations, as Garcia Laguardia had previously stated. She said, however, that such cases have been put in the hands of the law. The military spokesperson reaffirmed that there is no obligation to participate in the PAC. She said the document filed by the human rights ombudsman at the National Congress requesting the repeal of this decree-law should be examined under the same light in which the decree itself was originally issued.
