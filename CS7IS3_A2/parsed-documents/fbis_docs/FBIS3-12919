Al-Agha added that if the Israeli Government wants to implement more positive measures, it should release all the Palestinian prisoners, without exception or discrimination. It should also reassess the settlement policy, disband the settlements in the occupied territories, and disarm the settlers. Commenting on the Israeli Government's decisions in the wake of the massacre, al-Agha said: The Israeli Government's decisions are deficient. I do not believe that they will be effective in putting an end to the danger posed by the settlers and to their conduct and aggressions. He noted that the Israeli Government must address the issue of the settlements and settlers in a fundamental rather than a superficial way. Regarding Fatah's position and intention to resume armed activities in response to the massacre, Dr. al-Agha said: I believe there was never a decision to stop armed activities. There was only a "truce" which the two sides were obliged to observe and respect. We now see that the Israeli side failed to abide by the truce and violated it several times. It is inconceivable for us to stand idly by in the face of these violations and remain committed to the truce. Dr. al-Agha expressed the belief that conditions must be set for the resumption of the talks -- the most important being the disarming of all the settlers. Israel must also agree to disband the settlements and evacuate them from all the occupied territories. International protection should be provided for the Palestinian people until these two conditions are met. Dr. al-Agha noted that the current situation necessitates the drafting of new formulas for the talks. He said that the Palestinian people support the suspension of the talks until the situation is reassessed and new conditions are set. These conditions must be accepted by Israel, because the negotiating climate and the circumstances that prevailed prior to the massacre have now changed. New realities have imposed themselves on the scene and should be addressed. Among these are the settlement issue, the Palestinian people's safety, and the settlers' aggressions. Therefore, these issues must be given top priority before the resumption of the talks is considered. The Palestinian official stressed that international protection is not a substitute for removing the settlements; it is a temporary measure until all the settlements are removed. Commenting on the positions taken by the United States and Western countries regarding the massacre, the Palestinian official expressed the belief that these positions were good but not enough. He noted that while they condemned this criminal act, condemnation alone is not enough and words must be translated into deeds. the way to do this is to support the Palestinian people's demands, which are their natural right. Dr. al-Agha called on Palestinian national and Islamic forces to coordinate and close ranks. He said that this stage is crucial and critical for every Palestinian and that it is the duty of all Palestinian national and Islamic forces to engage in dialogue and seek the lowest common denominator for national unity.
