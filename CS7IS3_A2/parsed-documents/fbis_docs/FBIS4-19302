As European commissioner responsible for external trade affairs and Commission vice president, he was the Twelve's chief negotiator in the talks that led to the completion of the GATT Uruguay Round, which is to be finalized on Friday 15 April in Marrakesh. A clever and engaging man, this former interior and industry minister of a conservative British Government will appear in "L'heure de verite" [Hour of Truth] television program on Sunday 17 April on France 2. On the next day, his pro-European manifesto, The Europe We Need, will be released in France. Sir Leon received LE MONDE's special correspondents in his Brussels office. [LE MONDE] You would like to succeed Jacques Delors at the head of the Commission. How, in your opinion, has this candidacy by an Englishman been received, for example in France? [Brittan] I am not on the campaign trail. I only let it be known that I was available should the heads of European states and government decide to approve my candidacy. I did not apply as an Englishman. I am an independent commissioner. As an Englishman, and I am proud of it, and as a member of the Conservative Party and a former minister, I take seriously the independence of the Commission and its commissioners. And I have ideas of my own. For instance, I have always been in favor of the economic and monetary union, and I have supported it both in Britain and elsewhere. This is one illustration of my independence. There are others. In France, all I can do is explain my ideas. This is the reason why I have written a book. [LE MONDE] You were Europe's negotiator in the GATT Uruguay Round to be finalized on Friday in Marrakesh. Now that some time has elapsed after the talks came to a successful conclusion in December 1993, do you believe their outcome has been as positive as was expected at the time? [Brittan] Yes, definitely. We achieved almost all of our objectives. Some issues were set aside and will be dealt with later; this was the case with financial services, for example. But we convinced the other countries -- developed and less developed alike -- to remove many obstacles to free trade, including tariffs. We were able to preserve those industrial sectors that are experiencing real difficulties, such as the aluminum sector. This is why European manufacturers were so happy with the outcome of the talks. But most important will be the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the consolidation of trade rules, which constitute a great step forward on the road to multilateralism. A major trade power such as the United States has now fewer levers with which to impose its views on other countries, because it has formally agreed to be more mindful of the rules of the multilateral game. This was always one of Europe's objectives. And thanks to the consolidation of its own regulatory framework, Europe is now better able to defend itself, for instance against dumping. Add to this the results concerning farm products. For the most part, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has now been recognized as legitimate. All parties, including the Americans, have approved a "peace clause" whereby they undertake not to harass European agriculture any longer. [LE MONDE] Concerning farm products, you are happy with a result that came about after France exerted strong pressure, often encountering opposition by its European partners. What do you now think of this strategy? [Brittan] These talks produced an number of important political lessons which must be heeded. Long discussions within, but also outside, the Council of Ministers contributed to a better understanding of France's position on the part of its partners. Such discussions also afforded French citizens a better view of the advantages of a successful GATT, of more open markets, and lower tariff barriers. Conversely, France's liberal partners now have a better understanding of its agricultural interests as well as, on another level, its commitment to a strong audiovisual policy. [LE MONDE] On your initiative, after the Union's enlargement to 16 members, the Commission has initiated a review of policy options with respect to East Europe. Can it lead to tangible results? And if so, how long will that take? [Brittan] Yes, I think it can. But when? That is another story. The future integration of East European countries in the Union hinges on moral, economic, and political grounds. Morally, we have no right to reject them after showing such understanding, even compassion toward them during the Communist era. Economically, there will be difficulties, of course, but ultimately their integration will be an asset for us. Politically, the question that matters is as follows: What will happen if we turn them down? I believe rejection on our part may push them into the arms of the Russians, which is the exact opposite of what they want. Or they may consider that Germany -- which has been keeping a high profile in the region -- is the only European country with any real interest in them. Germany would not like finding itself in such a situation, which would run counter to the Union's interest. This is why we must take them in. When and under which conditions? The hardest part is finding a way to integrate East European countries while continuing to strengthen the Union. Those who advocate enlargement in the hope of preventing further consolidation are totally in the wrong. We must combine those two processes. Hence the key question to be asked at the intergovernmental conference provided for by the Maastricht Treaty in two years is: which institutional changes will let these countries join the Union without slowing down the consolidation process -- a perspective that would lessen the Union's cohesion? This is a complicated matter, but it can be solved. `I Favor the Single Currency' [LE MONDE] Aside from monetary union, what are the other issues on which your position diverges from that of the Tory party? [Brittan] You know, there is no single position within the government. There is a range of nuanced opinions, and a number of topics on which no-one has taken a clear stand yet, such as institutional issues. In fact, the debate will take place at the time of the intergovernmental conference. The notions I outlined are not currently those of the British Government. It may yet come to adopt them. [LE MONDE] Do you think that the negative, dramatically reaffirmed stance of the Euroskeptics still reflects the views of a majority of the British population? [Brittan] Opinions vary widely both within the population and within political circles. These differences have been around for a quarter of a century. A number of Conservatives bitterly oppose further integration within the Union. And the government is obviously hampered by its very small parliamentary majority. As for British voters, it all depends on the questions asked as well as the time they are asked. The positions of the British can be explained by their history and experience, which are quite different from those of the French or Belgians, for example. Yet again, such differences can also be found in France, where the outcome of the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty did not reflect a dramatically pro-European feeling, and in Germany, which is still divided over the currency issue. Also, England does have a more lively debating tradition that other countries. [LE MONDE] The British do not share your enthusiasm for the single currency. [Brittan] No, they do not; however, before the crisis in the European Monetary System, business and corporate circles were overwhelmingly in favor of it. After the crisis, the idea lost some of its appeal with everybody. What I tell my fellow British citizens is that they do not have to decide right now; they can decide later whether or not they want to switch to the single currency. I for one am in favor of it. And it is my duty to say so to those who, mistakenly, believe that there will be no Economic and Monetary Union. In Great Britain, differences on this issue are also a matter of generations. Young people who travel a lot have more generous ideas. Over the past 20 years, British society has become more European, albeit very slowly.
