Han, who completed the schedule at his first stop in Manila, will leave for his next destination, Bangkok, after the event at Chongwadae (presidential residence) so he can get some rest on a trip that also takes him to Vietnam and Indonesia. Ministry officials explained that it is customary for the foreign minister to attend the annual party for foreign envoys at this time of the year. They made it clear that there was no urgent reason for Han to fly back home during his overseas trip. The minister's one-day return was scheduled long before he embarked on his tour and, therefore, Thursday was left free, they said.
