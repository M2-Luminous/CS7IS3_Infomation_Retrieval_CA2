The document proclaims the raising of bilateral relations to a level of mutually complementary constructive partnership, and reflects the two sides' approaches to the main problems of both world politics, including the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula, and to questions of cooperation between Moscow and Seoul in the economic, political, and other spheres. A number of other bilateral documents were also signed, including intergovernmental agreements on cooperation in protection of the environment, on preventing incidents at sea outside territorial waters, and on the protection of migratory birds, and also a protocol on consultations between the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the ROK. The South Korean side was handed more than 200 archive documents relating to the Korean War during 1950-53. They include correspondence conducted by the then leaders of the USSR, the DPRK, and the PRC, with telegrams from Josip Stalin and Mao Tse-tung, and they reveal the degree of the former Soviet Union's involvement in the Korean War. "History should stand revealed in its true form," a high-ranking official of the Russian Federation's Foreign Ministry said in a conversation with the ITAR-TASS correspondent. He said the handing over of archive documents would make it possible to "close one of the pages of the past." At the same time, the sides are united in the opinion that the sad past in relations between Moscow and Seoul should remain in the past and should not affect the present and future.
