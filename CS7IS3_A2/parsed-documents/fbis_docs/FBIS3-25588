Chief Simon Gumede was minister of works and deputy secretary-general of the IFP. He was also a member of the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly and the IFP Central Committee as well as president of the Federated Council of Indigenous Rulers of South Africa. Chief Gumede's name appeared on a pamphlet listing 21 alleged African National Congress activists within the kwaZulu administration. Nongoma College Registrar Thabiso Ngubane, whose name also appeared on the list, was shot dead at the weekend. Announcing his departure, Chief Gumede said his decision had not been influenced by the distribution of the pamphlet. He had instead decided to serve his Gumede clan in the Ubombo area in northern Zululand and would remain a member of the IFP. KwaZulu Chief Minister and IFP President Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi said it was sheer coincidence that Chief Gumede's resignation had come at the same time as the distribution of the pamphlet. He said he had not suspected Chief Gumede of being disloyal. The ANC [African National Congress] has disassociated itself from the pamphlet and has asked the Transitional Executive Council to investigate the matter. Several people were attacked and their houses gutted after a similar document was circulated in Ulundi last year.
