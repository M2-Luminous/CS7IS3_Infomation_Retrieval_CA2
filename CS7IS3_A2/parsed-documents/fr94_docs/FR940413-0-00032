FR940413-0-00032 FR940413-0-00007 19 CFR Part 142 [T.D. 94&hyph;39] Identifying Information Required on Entry Documents AGENCY: U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury. ACTION: Final interpretive rule. SUMMARY: This document sets forth examples that correctly identify the party in the U.S. to whom imported merchandise is sold or consigned, or the premises in the U.S. to which it is delivered. This information is required by regulation to be shown on Customs entry or release documents for the merchandise. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lou Samenfink, Office of Cargo Enforcement and Facilitation, (202&hyph;927&hyph;0510). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Merchandise imported and entered for consumption must be supported by Customs entry and entry summary documentation. Briefly stated, this entry documentation is detailed in §142.3, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 142.3), and consists of the information which must be filed with Customs to secure the release of imported merchandise from Customs custody (19 CFR 141.0a(a)); entry summary documentation is that which must be filed in order to enable Customs to assess duties, and collect statistics with respect to the merchandise, and to determine whether other requirements of law or regulation are met (19 CFR 141.0a(b)). In addition, in certain circumstances as enumerated in §142.21, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 142.21), merchandise may be initially released under a special permit for immediate delivery, in accordance with §448(b), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1448(b)), and in these circumstances as well, the information required by §142.3 must be provided, except that a commercial invoice need not be submitted at such time (see 19 CFR 142.22(a)). Customs capability to identify fully all parties involved with imported merchandise being entered or released is essential in order to support investigative efficiency. Information concerning the party in the U.S. to whom such merchandise is sold or consigned represents one of several elements which Customs considers in the process of assessing the risks associated with the transaction and determining the appropriate level of examination to be accorded the merchandise involved. This process is known generally as ``cargo selectivity''. In this latter regard, principally to correct a problem on the Northern Border, §142.3 was amended by T.D. 90&hyph;92, 55 FR 49879, to add a new paragraph (a)(6), in order to specifically require that entry or release documents set forth the identity, including the importer identification number, of the party in the U.S. to whom the imported merchandise is sold or consigned, or if this is unknown at the time of entry or release, the premises in the U.S. to which the merchandise is delivered.
