In the audience, tears ran down the faces of all the female inmates in their gray prison uniforms; were they repenting their pasts? Or were they expressing a shameful feeling toward their kin? This was the scene during an art performance for the female inmates in Shandong's Weibei Prison, whose ages ranged from 18 to 65. They were put here to accept transformation for crimes of theft, murder, embezzlement, and sex offenses. "The way of the world is made dangerous by human desires, which make quite a few people go awry and ruin their lives." The female inmates are categorized into those desiring material goods, those desiring sex, and violent types. Most of them have committed crimes because of the stimulation of such factors as marriage, family, and love, and could only come to their senses when they were put into prison. However, they are then liable to sink into degradation. In transforming female inmates, it is precisely necessary to awaken their consciences, which have not been lost in their entirety, while guiding them to bear maternal and social responsibilities. Liu Xiulian, who is 32 years old, was given a life sentence for murder because she was disappointed in a love affair 10 years previously. When she was first put into prison, she was in utter despair. With the persuasion of a prison warder, she taught herself the skill of tailoring and became a garment designer in prison. Because of her outstanding performance, she was granted a commutation of her sentence to 16 years imprisonment. Later, she was again granted a commutation of her punishment and released. However, she was determined to train a few apprentices before leaving as an appreciation for the education by the prison authorities. In her briefings, female ward deputy instructor Wei Huiying of Weibei Prison said that most female inmates are narrow-minded with very strong inferiority complexes and suicidal by inclination. The administration and education call for well-organized meticulousness to help substitute their negative, world-weary outlook on life characterized by "belittling themselves, lacking in self-respect, being self-piteous, and being self-destructive" with "self-respect, making efforts in self improvement, conducting oneself with dignity and independence." Over the past 10 years, there have been over 30 attempted suicides but none of them have been successful. Female sex offenses mostly result from a deviation in moral concepts and outlook on life and are regarded as the most difficult category for transformation. There is a "kingdom of women" inside Shanghai Municipal Prison in which "the worst women in Shanghai are imprisoned" as Shanghai residents put it. The prison authorities put them in different cells based on different categories to avoid overlapping effects; at the same time, they invite experts to give a series of lectures on sexual ethics, sexual sociology, and sexually transmitted diseases. They then conduct treatment using drugs and psychological techniques on those those who are abnormal both physiologically and psychologically with remarkable results. The rate of recidivism among those released after serving the full term of their sentences has been extremely low. Compared with female inmates, juvenile delinquency has more profound social causes. The bulk of the more than 800 juveniles being held in Shandong Prison for Juvenile Delinquents are from the rural areas, especially the suburban areas, and 70 percent of them are school dropouts. The situation is pretty much the same in the Shanghai Reform Center for Juvenile Delinquents. Such an unsound social atmosphere as the "theory that study is useless," and money- worship has spoiled the innocence and nature of rural teenagers. The major criminal offences committed by juvenile delinquents are theft and sex offences. Regarding juvenile delinquents, "it is imperative to treat them as parents would when nursing their own children with infectious diseases, as doctors treat their patients, and as teachers treat their students when they make some mistakes." This is China's persistent policy for correcting juvenile delinquents. Each day in prisons or reform centers, juvenile delinquents take part for half the day in labor to learn some skills, such as repairing electric appliances, gardening, sewing, and cooking; the rest of the day is devoted to cultural studies, to make up for the lessons they should have learned at school. Fine arts, such as music and painting, have become effective means in correcting juvenile delinquents in China. This reporter watched a rehearsal by the "Yuxin Performing Art Troupe" at Shandong Provincial Prison for Juvenile Delinquents and a performance of "Huichun Performing Art Troupe" at Shanghai Reform Center for Juvenile Delinquents. When one sees their concentration on music, one has to believe that the best of human culture has purified the soul that was once soiled. Wang Wenting, who has already served four years of her sentence for theft told this reporter that whenever she feels restless, she finds peace once again when she takes up her musical instrument. Inside the iron gate of Shanghai Reform Center for Juvenile Delinquent stands a three-dimensional work of art, entitled: "Return." The Center named its cultural and technical school, art performance troupe, and paper "Hui Chun [return to spring]." All work involving education, persuasion, and salvation here is just for spring to return to those tender but distorted minds and help the lost lambs return to spring.
