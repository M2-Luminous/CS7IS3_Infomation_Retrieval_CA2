One of these media is the NBC television network, which released the following report: [Begin recording] [unidentified reporter] In an interview with the NBC network yesterday afternoon, [Politburo member] Abel Prieto referred to the conference: [Prieto, in progress] ...and I do not think any emigre has come with that intention. I think they have come with great respect, and this morning they were listening and discussing the Cuban political system; in the afternoon we discussed culture. I believe there are many paths and bridges that can be opened through cultural activities. [Reporter] Prieto also explained the administrative reorganization that is being carried out on the island. [Prieto] For a long time now we have been making adjustments. We are working on some reforms to streamline the country's finances. [Reporter] Some people abroad are asking when democratic elections will be held in the country, but according to Prieto, this main discussion should focus more on the definition of democracy. [Prieto] According to our Constitution, the president is elected indirectly. He is elected by the parliament, the members of which are directly elected by the people. I think we must review the ideas on democracy that have been so often repeated concerning Cuba. I think the people who have freedom of thought must study the Cuban experience. It is an interesting experience, and I think we should go a little more deeply into it. The problem is that there are many stereotypes on this matter and democracy is taken as synonymous with a specific model, which we need to review to see just how democratic it really is. I think democracy is a dream that is still far removed from men. This is my personal opinion on this matter. [Reporter] Prieto also referred to the U.S. blockade against Cuba meant to force Fidel Castro's departure from the presidency. Referring to this situation, Prieto used a baseball analogy. [Prieto] The pitcher is removed only when the team decides he is no longer suitable. In this case there was a Cuban poet, who has unfortunately already passed away, but when we were asked from abroad to replace Fidel, this poet used to say that this is the first time that the opposite team has asked us to remove our pitcher. [Reporter] According to Prieto, the embargo against Cuba violates the human rights of millions of Cubans. [end recording]
