Vienna-based correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna: [Cha Man-sun] The full-fledged nuclear inspection of the seven nuclear sites has not been conducted as scheduled due to North Korea's lack of cooperation. The inspection team arrived in Pyongyang on 1 March and coordinated its inspection schedule in order to begin a full-fledged inspection activity in Yongbyon today, but due to the North Korean side's lack of cooperation, such as the delay in the inter-Korean working contact for the exchange of special envoys, the inspection team has not been able to begin the inspection activities, it has been learned today. David Kyd, IAEA public information officer, disclosed this and said that the seven-man inspection team is now standing by, preparing for a full-fledged inspection. Mr. Kyd said that although the inspection team has not been able to conduct a full-fledged inspection activity today, he hopes that the inspection team will begin the inspection activities on 3 March and that in view of the fact that the IAEA cannot contact the inspection team at present, the inspectors may be standing by at the Yongbingwan [guest house] in Yongbyon. In connection with this, the IAEA today held an emergency ad hoc meeting and decided to take follow-up measures after watching developments for a day or two. Meanwhile, an IAEA official said that the inspection team in North Korea was scheduled to conduct inspection activities for at least 10 days and was to inspect the nuclear fission reaction laboratory facilities of Kim Il-song University in Pyongyang for a few days.
