And he very politely inquired whether LITERATURNAYA GAZETA could make its pages available for constructive criticism of the point of view repeatedly expressed in the newspaper regarding the kolkhoz-sovkhoz system as a burden and an impediment to our movement toward a bright capitalist future. Inasmuch as the deputy turned out to be a professional economist, who took part, by the way, in developing banking legislation, the telephone conversation quickly turned into a friendly discussion, which, however surprising (for the subject of criticism were the appearances in LITERATURNAYA GAZETA of B. Fedorov's and my own articles), ended with an ascertainment of the coincidence of our views on quite a few points. On the following day, the deputy brought an article to the editorial office, which we are offering for your attention. We are also prepared to give the floor to those who have different views, but on one condition: Do not restrict yourself to indiscriminate criticism, but propose constructive ideas, and seek a way out of our current economic impasse. [Signed] Vladimir Prokhvatilov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA columnist Agriculture in Russia is in a disastrous state. The slump in production is not ending for the second year, and the motor vehicle and tractor inventory is falling apart. But what is most regrettable is the fact that the agro-industrial complex simply is not entered into the logic of the liberal reforms that were conducted until recently. B. Fedorov, the former minister of finance, saw the Russian APK [agro-industrial complex] as a number-one inflationary danger, and he proposed purchasing foodstuffs abroad at cheaper prices. Boris Fedorov and Yegor Gaydar have resigned, but the attitude of the government toward agrarians has practically not changed. At a recent meeting of representatives of the agrarian faction of the State Duma with V. Chernomyrdin, our prime minister almost kissed a cross as a sign of his love for Russian kolkhoz workers, but he gave money for the spring sowing grudgingly. But is a lot of money needed, and what for? Let us estimate. In Russia, 120,000 hectares of kolkhoz land are under grain. Approximately 60,000-70,000 hectares are sown annually, and about 100 million tonnes of grain are gathered from them. If the government needs this amount of grain, then it is necessary to allocate 8 trillion rubles [R] for the spring sowing. This will go for the payment of fuel, mineral fertilizers, and repair of equipment. If there is less money, there will also be less of a harvest. It seems that the government decided to allocate R5 trillion for the needs of the APK in the form of credit at 213 percent annual interest and to pay off debts for products that were turned over last year. This is another R1.4 trillion. It is not difficult to calculate that this is not enough money to maintain the harvest at last year's level. The agrarians understand very well that an appeal to the budget is futile. There is no money in the treasury, but if you resort to monetary emission in order to cover inadequate resources with its help, then we will have a very severe inflationary outbreak that will destroy our economy. But if money is not given, the consequences could even be worse. There would be such a severe harvest shortage that it would simply be impossible to compensate for it with any kinds of purchases abroad. In addition, the inflationary expectations of the population on the threshold of an approaching famine would instantly draw long lines and would clean shelves of all foodstuffs. This would cause a sharp jump in prices.... So this is what the unhappy alternative is. And I fully admit that many Russians will not be pleased by this choice between the Scylla and Charybdis, and that they would prefer to send all Russian kolkhoz workers to the moon and to buy wheat in America and Canada. Well, first, this would denote a full loss of national sovereignty. And, second, a year earlier the government of reformers tried to send the Russian VPK [military-industrial complex] "to the moon" by simply not continuing to finance it. As a result, the social resistance was of such a force that the government went back on its word and fully restored the state order for the defense industry. There is nothing good in such shying away. And, third, the financial inadequacy of the Russian kolkhozes is not their fault at all. From the time of the notorious war of the city and the village in the 1920's, which ended with the robbery of the village, Russian peasants have been unable to stand on their feet firmly. It is as if peasant and subsequently kolkhoz property were inferior, an embryo of private property relations, as if it were considered a socialist virtue to take everything from the village, without returning anything. In a paradoxical way, the liberalization of prices in 1992 robbed the village in precisely the same way once more. The disparity of prices between rural and industrial commodities grew even more. By comparison with 1992, all prices "took off" by a thousand times and more, but rural products increased in price by a factor of only 100-120. While earlier one tonne of grain was equal in cost to 1.5 tonnes of fuel, then now this ratio is already 1:0.65. The same thing happened not only with grain, but also with other agricultural products. And those who are dissatisfied with the increasing prices for bread and milk should know that the peasant receives only one-third of this price. For comparison: In the price of beer, 80 percent is "added" by the producer. Well, and where is the poor peasant to turn, you ask. Is there a constructive solution to the present impasse? Of course there is. It is off-budget financing. While there is no money in the treasury, there is money in the commercial banks. Economists of the Agrarian Party of Russia conducted consultations with a number of commercial banks and established that they are prepared to finance the spring sowing from their own resources, given the presence of certain guarantees. According to our calculations, by involving commercial banks, it is possible to collect the money that is lacking and to save the 1994 harvest. This, of course, will not reduce the budget deficit, but it will "stretch it out" in time, and remove the seasonal outbreaks of inflation. And incidentally, the necessary guarantees can be given. At least, V. Gerashchenko, the chairman of the Central Bank, appearing in the State Duma, supported such an idea. The off-budget financing of the agrarian sector by commercial banks, in our opinion, can be implemented in two ways. First, Russian banks give the necessary special credits to the Ministry of Agriculture under a small, for example, 3-percent margin, after receiving in exchange the guarantee (promissory note) of the Ministry of Finance. This is the way the lacking resources are "acquired," and moreover, rather quickly. But it is necessary to hurry--it is already time for Krasnodar Kray to start sowing, but there is no money. Second, it is necessary to develop direct horizontal ties; that is, banks and kolkhozes should communicate between themselves directly. This kind of drawing together, which is still rather timid, has started. For the time being, our bankers are more interested in the sphere of livestock raising, especially in poultry farming, where there is an uninterrupted production cycle. Bank credits can be granted to kolkhozes under a promissory note of a regional administration, or 10-30 percent of the shares of stock of a joint-stock company (which 70 percent of our kolkhozes have already become) as security. The first method of financing will give a quick effect, and the second is calculated for the future. This, perhaps, is the only method today to save Russia's perishing agriculture and to conclude a peace that is favorable to everyone in the exhausting and senseless war between the city and the village. And the government of V. Chernomyrdin, which up until now has not declared itself in any way, can stimulate this constructive process by convening a "roundtable" of bankers and agrarians, while playing the role of organizer of the negotiations and a guarantor of agreements.
