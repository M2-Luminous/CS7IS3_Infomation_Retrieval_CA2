"The blast was probably a religious warning due to the holy month of Ramadan," Yusuf al-Halabi, manager of the Kuwait National Cinema Company, told the ARAB TIMES. "Last year we received a threat at the same time but it was not carried out," he added. A security source who requested anonymity, however, said he believed Iraqi agents planted the bomb. The Interior Ministry first said two people were slightly wounded in the blast, but a high-ranking police officer said only a guard suffered a slight head wound. The Interior Ministry stepped up security measures around the nine cinemas in Kuwait City after Monday's bombing, sources said. Attacks on cinemas, video shops, show business poeple and music stores, which are considered by fundamentalists as activities contrary to Islam, began after Kuwait was freed from a seven-month Iraqi occupation, in February 1991.
