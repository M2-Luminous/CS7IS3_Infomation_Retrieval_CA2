The survey also showed that agricultural cooperatives in 15 prefectures have refused to cooperate in the government's rice production adjustment program. Farmers in these prefectures were strongly upset with the government's decision to partially open the rice market to imports. The Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives (Zenchu) adopted a resolution last December not to cooperate with the government in producing rice for processing. Zenchu officials said the union plans to urge the government to review its farming policy, featuring conversion of rice acreage for production of other farm produce. Farmers are reluctant to produce rice to be used for processing because of low prices as compared with rice for table use. Despite their strong reaction to the government's agricultural policy, many agricultural cooperatives acknowledged the need for production adjustment because of government subsidies.
