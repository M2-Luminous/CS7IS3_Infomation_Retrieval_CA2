Mexico had wanted to sign an agreement with all of the Central American countries, but the pressure exerted by both President Salinas and President Calderon -- both of whom were eager to sign a bilateral agreement of such great significance for their countries -- was decisive. This agreement is undoubtedly one of President Calderon's personal victories, and it will represent great benefits for Costa Rica's development, particularly because it strengthens our independence vis-a-vis the unionist pressure by the remaining Central American countries.
