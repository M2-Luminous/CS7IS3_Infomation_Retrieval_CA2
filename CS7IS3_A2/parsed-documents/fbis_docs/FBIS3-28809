The meeting is chaired by Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas. Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs and head of Jordan's delegation, made a speech at the opening session. [passage omitted] Explaining Jordan's position on the Bosnian issue, the minister of state for foreign affairs pointed out that the war crimes committed by Serbian forces have continued despite international condemnation. He said: The siege on the city of Sarajevo and Muslim regions is getting worse. Ethnic cleansing is increasing at a fast pace. Mass murder and the shelling of civilian targets are getting uglier. More than 260 civilians were either killed or injured. This is an indication of the ugliness of this crime and the Serbs' unmatched barbarity. The minister of state for foreign affairs added that after the partition of former Yugoslavia, Jordan was among the first countries to dispatch troops under the UN flag. Jordan now has the second largest contingent of peacekeeping troops after France. Talal Sat'an al-Hasan added: Jordan strongly condemns Serbian crimes and is amazed at the silence of the international community toward Serbian disregard for international legitimacy and resolutions. Jordan believes that dialogue is a way of settling disputes. Therefore, it calls for an immediate cease-fire, starting talks, and lifting the Bosnian arms embargo to achieve a balance in military capabilities between the two warring parties. Al-Hasan said Jordan urges measures and supports an urgent meeting for the Security Council, as proposed by the chairman, to restore peace to war-torn Bosnia. According to the proposed measures, there should be an end to the continued Serbian encroachments on the international borders of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia, in line with Security Council Resolution 796 of 1992. Also, the former Republic of Yugoslavia (the Serbs) should be forced to stop arms supplies to Serbian militias operating within the borders of the Republic of Bosnia in line with Security Council Resolution 819 of 1993, lift the siege on the city of Sarajevo and other cities, and adopt measures to protect holy and residential areas.
