The report shows the dishonesty of the allegations made by the so-called human rights organizations on the island. Signed by Joseph Gerald Sullivan, the head of the U.S. Interests Section, the report points out that in the cases presented by the heads of those groups, the subjects are incapable of proving that they have been or are victims of persecution or violations. The text was addressed to the State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and was circulated in Geneva while Cuban Ambassador Jose Perez Novoa responded to the report presented by (Carl Johann Gros), the special rapporteur of the UN Human Rights Commission assigned to Cuba. The official text of the U.S. mission recognizes that the number of political prisoners is very small and that once they are freed, they are not persecuted, discriminated against, or mistreated. Most of them request visas at the U.S. Interests Section to escape Cuba's economic situation, not out of fear. Furthermore, the document points out that many of the members of those groups take that path as the most opportune way to emigrate toward the United States with that country's official backing. The document, signed by the head of the U.S. Interests Section, describes the differences between groups and the need to work harder to identify those who, as demonstrated by their nature, would be most useful in serving the objectives of the United States.
