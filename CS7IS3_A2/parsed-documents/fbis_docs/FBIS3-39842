On Friday, the bodies of Rimmele's business partner Klaus Eichler (53) and the Czech interpreter Alena Petrusheva (39) were recovered. The search for Rudolf Wirschen (44), the pilot of the crashed plane, and Iveta Ranetova (30), the Czech hotel manager, was continued yesterday by the 70-member crew of the August Thienemann research ship with the support of the Jago research submarine. By Sunday afternoon, however, the search remained without any result. Bundeswehr experts from Fuerstenfeldbruck performed autopsies on the two bodies at a hospital in Friedrichshafen, after Jago used its grip arm on Friday to recover them from a depth of 160 meters. The experts stated that it was certain that the two persons had drowned, and that they were also affected by the cold. Thus, the disaster can be reconstructed in the following way: The two-engine charter aircraft, which set off from Prague on 24 January, was forced to attempt an emergency landing on the water -- for reasons that are still unclear -- immediately before approaching the Swiss Altenrhein Airport (St. Gallen). Some 5 km from the lake shore, the wreckage floated on the surface for a little while. The five persons on board the aircraft -- Rimmele's dog might have been on board as well -- survived the crash, managed to undo their seat belts, and left the aircraft. However, they could not rescue themselves from the ice-cold waters of Lake Constance.
