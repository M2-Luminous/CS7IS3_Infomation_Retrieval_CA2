Heiner Geissler, the Social Democrat's adversary in his capacity as the general secretary of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), further refined this work into an art--"seizing" topics, formulating arguments in such a way that they can serve as weapons in the political struggle, and creating the capacity to marshal one's own troops in the proper battle formation and to produce potential majorities. What Glotz was wont to formulate in a theoretical manner, was Geissler's practical application. Guenter Verheugen, who rounded out the Bonn trio for the Free Democratic Party (FDP) in those years, remembers that there was a certain "sense of elitism" on the part of the party managers back then. Verheugen left the liberals after they switched and formed a coalition with the CDU and is now doing the job for a second time--this time as the successor once removed of Peter Glotz. The days of the "big three" are only nostalgia now. Verheugen's Bonn colleagues are now called Werner Hoyer (FDP) and Peter Hintze (CDU). "The general secretary supports the chairman in the performance of his duties. In concert with the chairman, he conducts the party's business." These two sentences from Paragraph 37 of the CDU's by-laws precisely describe the functions of the other two party managers as well. All the strings for the exhausting nonstop 1994 election campaign come together in their hands. They have to get the machinery running up to full speed and that means, above all, focusing their activities on their top candidates--Helmut Kohl, Klaus Kinkel, and Rudolf Scharping. Despite the fact that the three party headquarters are close to each other on or next to Bonn's "diplomats' race track," they rather seldom see one another. "He treats me with respect," observes Verheugen curtly about the liberal Werner Hoyer--discreetly remaining silent about the fact that many people in the FDP fondly remember his time in the Thomas Dehler House. Nonetheless, he recently got a visit from a colleague: When the dispute was on over nursing care insurance, Peter Hintze showed up at the head of a small demonstration in front of the Social Democratic "barracks." After reading a brief polemic text about the SPD's rejectionist position, he turned over the megaphone he had brought along and thus the Social Democrat unexpectedly became the main speaker at a CDU demonstration. "I had not imagined that it would be that easy," Verheugen smirked. The little anecdote illustrates one of his rules of thumb for the unwritten textbook of political action: "Politics: It is 90 percent skilled craftsmanship and 10 percent substance." A scene from the life of a national secretary: "It is a decision" says Guenter Verheugen into the mouthpiece of the telephone. Pause. The interlocutor on the other end of the line is apparently contradicting--at length. "He does not want it" says Guenter Verheugen. This time the answer is considerably briefer. The interlocutor gives in. Not only the success achieved by the five short words, but even the call is noteworthy. A little while ago--to be precise, in those nearly forgotten days when a certain Bjoern Engholm...--a leading Social Democratic politician would not have so readily called up the national secretary and coordinated his statements for an interview with the party line. As if it were the most natural thing in the world, Verheugen succeeds in pronouncing the "he" as if it were written in capital letters: HE wants it, HE wants it this way, HE does not want it. In accordance with these three principles, this HE has come forward to reshape the SPD for the upcoming election campaign. There are three problems associated with this kind of bringing things to a head: Work, work, work. And the three answers: Scharping, Scharping, Scharping. It is not without irony that it is, of all things, a former liberal who is bringing the "SPD tanker" around to the traditional Social Democratic course of "Strength in Unity." That, however, is precisely the basic terms of reference for his being hired by Scharping: The head of the party stands at the center and must show leadership ability--and he simply can best demonstrate this to the national public if the party becomes a political machine for the election of its candidate for chancellor. If the boss occasionally comes a cropper--such as in the presentation of his tax policy proposals--then the only role left to the national secretary is to pick up the pieces--a vicious circle because the more Verheugen increases the power of the great chairman, the less amenable the latter becomes to advice. The results can be seen in the CDU. When CDU boss Helmut Kohl promoted his long-time political traveling companion Heiner Geissler out of the office of party manager, he did so with, among other things, the comment that he had become too much of a "general" for his liking and not enough of a "secretary." With this as a starting point, someone other than Hintze would have a hard time of it as well. Is it cynical to assume that his appointment is not a mistake--as the nearly unanimous view has it--but precisely what Helmut Kohl wanted? He studied to be a pastor and is indeed a clever fellow and a stimulating conversation partner in a small circle. His ruthless analysis of the starting position in this superelection year even made believers of Christian Social Union (CSU) politicians who otherwise only make jokes at his expense. At public appearances, however, Hintze leaves a rather negative impression and not only when--as was the case at the CDU convention in Hamburg--there is an opportunity to directly compare his rhetorical talents with those of Heiner Geissler. Hintze is one of the few people who are just as nervous at the end of their speech as they are at the beginning--for good reason, since his scintillating brilliance in conversation always gets lost somewhere on the way to the podium. Guenter Verheugen describes the work of a party manager as "providing orientation, externally as well as internally." Internally, many a shortcoming can be made up through organizational talent, yet when it comes to the public, a harmonious personality is required. The liberal, who has mutated into a Social Democrat, does not exemplify the "attack dog" type either--and he is not even trying to play the role. Hintze has consistently failed at it, yet instead of giving up, he is obsessed with trying to shake off the reputation of a political lightweight--without gaining in stature. He consoles himself by noting that "being underestimated also offers opportunities" and he defiantly points to the example of his chairman, who was similarly undervalued for a long time. Of course, he is too intelligent to ignore the possibility of failure: "Being a politician always means being a bit of a kamikaze as well." Werner Hoyer, whose attempts at polemics seem hardly less labored, would scarcely disagree on that score, and not only because a modicum of chaos is part of the folklore of the liberals who passionately remove themselves from the clutches of discipline. If Hintze has to deal with a chairman who does not like to have more than one secretary around him, the FDP boss is all the more urgently in need of a general. Klaus Kinkel is experienced in government administration, but he is a newcomer to partisan politics. He cannot, of course, directly mention his boss' "need for an education" but Hoyer alludes to it when he emphasizes how important it is for the star of the party to get an electoral district and to become a member of the Bundestag caucus. The minister of foreign affairs also thought that Hoyer, as its former parliamentary secretary, would have the ideal qualifications to weld party and caucus together into a potent entity, yet what is needed for that, as the examples of the CDU and the SPD show, is a boss who is capable of submitting himself to advice and a team that is willing to exact such submission. Since both elements are missing, Hoyer can run up his telephone bill as much as he likes before the Monday meetings of the party's top leadership, and a Juergen Moellemann--in contrast to Scharping's defeated rival Gerhard Schroeder--is not going to toe the line. And party caucus boss Hermann Otto Solms will still remain in the "big eavesdropping session" at cross-currents with Kinkel. How gladly would Werner Hoyer like to escape from this crude reality. He thrives when he can swoon about policy perspectives: Modern liberalism, of course, and a kind that will bring the FDP recognition of its stature at last--that is his dream. On that score the otherwise sober author of a textbook on microeconomics succumbs to the myth of Karl Hermann Flach and the "Freiburg Theses." Granted, scarcely a nonmember can still remember the FDP secretary general who died young nor would he know what was in the legendary policy document, but the man and the paper are emblematic of the dream of a "liberal identity" beyond the acquisition of power. What will they do--will they want to do--after the elections? Peter Hintze, Werner Hoyer, and Guenter Verheugen do not fall into the trap of such inquiry. Somehow they all evade the question. The Social Democrat, who, the rumor mill has it, is a potential foreign minister, gives the most nonchalant answer: "Lie under a baobab tree, drink banana beer, and gaze into the blue African sky." A meeting of the party managers could be held there--even if it would likely be a forced vacation for one or another of them after 16 October.
