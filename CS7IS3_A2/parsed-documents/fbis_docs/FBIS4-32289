We accommodated the majority view among the Czech public, and that was the right thing to do. However, I would like to say that, from the very beginning, we were aware of the difficulties and problems this decision would bring on a practical level and of the kind of genie that was being released from the bottle. I think we have done more in this issue than any other postcommunist country. Despite this, it seems to me that the current dissatisfaction of some people (and mainly its disproportionate representation in the media) with the alleged slowness, inconsistency, and small scale of the rehabilitations and restitutions is increasing directly proportionately to the extent of the rehabilitations carried out and with the amount of property already returned, and this is the reason for my contemplation. I do not want to deal at all with the economic aspect of the issue. This has already been discussed enough in our country, and it is not the main issue, although it is certainly not a negligible one. The issue involves something far broader and far more general--that is, what the past in fact means for the life of the state and the nation or, rather, the extent to which it is possible to rectify it or take it back. Many people in our country view the communist regime as a kind of weight that descended on all of us from the outside in 1948. Therefore, it also seems to them that, when we managed to haul this weight off ourselves, we were once again in the early evening of 24 February 1948, and, if not entirely, we must strive with all our might and as fast as possible to be there. This is only half the truth, however, and it may even be less. In actuality, the communist era meant a profound structural transformation throughout the whole of Czech society, not only on the ideological level but also on the everyday one. Society stratified thanks to the previous democratic regime into a multitude of local, regional, social, ethnic, and mainly enormously multifarious special-interest groups that differed from each other not only in the extent of their wealth and political influence but also in their sundry life styles; communism forcibly cemented them together in false unity, dreariness, and injustice. The objective of communist ideology was the collectivization of society, whose end result, however, was its considerable atomization. This severed the thousands of fine threads that wove us together. This was one of the most profound social transformations that our country has gone through in its thousand-year history; moreover, it was amplified by the fact that the conditions that evolved lasted for two whole generations. It was not, however, external intervention. A not insignificant part of our society, whether consciously or unconsciously, was involved in organizing this transformation and in carrying it out. The gradual sobering up, which set in as a result of the public disclosure of the Stalinist terror and of the subsequent collapse of communist ideology itself, could not, even in 1968, be fully implemented politically because of the nature of the already stabilized regime. This was accompanied, into the bargain, by further mistakes and further illusions. Let us admit finally that communism was not a natural disaster but was more like a serious and prolonged illness against which we did not have enough antitoxins. It follows on from this that, among other things, each of us who went through this process, albeit quite involuntarily, is marked by it, no matter what he tells himself. The spasmodic disputes and polemics whipped up by the sudden and unexpectedly obtained freedom are convincing proof of this, and the current restitution mania is part of it. It is naive to think that we will simply replicate our future from our more illustrious past. On the one hand, we are somewhere else, and, on the other, we do not know what our more illustrious past is, this paradise lost to which we want to return. Are these the years immediately before 1948, years noted for their diverse violations of human and civil rights, their crippled political spectrum and mass nationalization? Or is this the interwar Czech Republic, more than half a century remote from us? Or is it perhaps even the imperial and royal monarchy? Without a doubt, we must follow up on our positive historical traditions. At the same time, the current fundamental framework for a free society as it has evolved in Europe is also decisive for us. However, these are just auxiliary bearings. We have to create our future ourselves; we cannot replicate it. It will be new, it will be ours, and it will be different from what we know of our past or of that of our neighbors. The road toward it is untraveled. It is a road "on which one gets dusty," a bumpy road, and a road with sharp bends and steep slopes. A concept for a return to "the time before" is impossible. The river of time will not flow backwards, even if we were to pass hundreds of laws and government decrees for this purpose. From time to time it is also said "give back what was stolen." This, at first glance attractive moral imperative is, upon closer inspection, terribly ungenerous and terribly improvident. Among other things, the one who stole is not the one who gives back. The individual also harmed by communism is, in the overwhelming majority of cases, the one who gives back. Each of us who trots out this demand should realize what it means in practice. Quite unnecessary disputes will erupt, and are already erupting, and these could become a barrier separating us from each other and dividing us all from our neighbors. The passionate debates about returning property to an aristocrat or the property claims of the Sudeten Germans are classic examples of this. Moreover, I do not believe that the major injustices of communism were property-related injustices or that we should orient ourselves in this direction. Only the future will tell whether we made the right decision when we chose our "Czech" solution to rectify the wrongdoing committed by the communist regime. However, the present is already sending us clear and comprehensible signals that it is necessary to bring an end to more and more restitution claims. We will not settle scores with the past any better by their continuous augmentation.
