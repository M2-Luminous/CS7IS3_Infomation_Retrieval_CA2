[passage omitted] I would like to give the points of view that I considered when making this decision. First, the main requirement is that the elections should take place as soon as possible in order to have a stable administration as soon as possible--before the summer season, if possible--and that the second round could be held before the start of the spring work. The date of the second round will not be determined by me but by an election committee formed by the parliament. [passage omitted] Second, my consideration was also that it should be as cheap as possible. A holiday day would have had to be declared if the election were to be held on a weekday. [passage omitted] This would have made the elections incredibly more expensive. [passage omitted] My third consideration was that as many as possible should vote. All parties have an interest in as many voters turning out as possible. My impression is that a large percent of the voters will participate in the ballot. In my view, the people of this country are clear in their mind that they have a stake in the elections. [passage omitted] Regarding my being above party politics, I can only say that this date does not agree--as far as I know--with the wish of any party. So, if you like, take this as a sign of my being above party politics. [passage omitted] [end recording]
