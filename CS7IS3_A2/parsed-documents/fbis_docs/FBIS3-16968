The head of Derzhatomnahlyad's scientific and technical directorate, Vadym Hryshchenko, told UNIAN that although the radioactive situation had not deteriorated, a fire always posed a potential threat of weakening safety control systems in the power unit. Therefore, this case should be classified on the international scale of incidents as first level, not zero level. Derzhatomnahlyad has reported its verdict to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
