From the primary sector to the tertiary sector through the secondary sector, they have always sought to develop their country's economy, thanks to peace and concord installed for more than a quarter of a century in Togo. This is why, taking advantage of the calm situation since this morning, in the aftermath of the painful events in Lome in recent days, the people of Lome have not hesitated to gradually resume their normal activities. Some vehicles and motorcycles, as well as pedestrians, have started going about the city. These people, however, have to obey the injunctions of the security forces who, for their part, are still trying to dislodge the last terrorists still in hiding after their deadly act. The official balance sheet for this attack yesterday stood at 58 dead, after the discovery of 16 more bodies. It will be recalled that yesterday, the National Gendarmery presented the arrested terrorists to the national and international press. The statements they made pointed to the fact that they all received military training in neighboring Ghana, and that their mission was to arrest or to kill the head of state, General Gnassingbe Eyadema, and then later to cause panic within the peaceful population of Lome and its environs. It will also be recalled that the head of the government, Joseph Kokou Koffigoh, yesterday in a press statement deplored the attack on the Togolese people. The prime minister also spoke of Togo's desire to live in peace, in particular with its neighbors. He stated that himself, President Eyadema, and the government will do everything possible to preserve this peace, which is so dear to the whole of Togo.
