In carrying out statistical work, we should stress accuracy, timeliness, comprehensiveness, and convenience, attaching primary importance to accuracy. We should establish a statistical survey methodology based on periodic general surveys which are essential; which are focused on regular sampling checks; and which are supplemented by surveys in selected areas, scientific calculations, and the general application of a small number of wide-ranging statistical reports. What new demands has the socialist market economy set for statistical work? Vice Premier Zou said: The state's economic management mode should shift from the management of tangible aspects of the economy, the management of microeconomic activity, and direct management to the management of intangible aspects of the economy, macroeconomic activity, and indirect management. In making macroeconomic policy decisions and exercising macroeconomic regulations and control, the party Central Committee and the State Council have often been confronted with the following three questions: 1) What is the current state of operations of the national economy and society? 2) Does the national economy and society function normally? If not, how should they be regulated and controlled? 3) What are the results of the implementation of macroeconomic regulatory and control measures? These three questions are closely related to statistical work and cannot be separated from the latter even for a moment. It would be difficult to make policy decisions on the national economy in the absence of ample information, scientific advice, and effective supervision by a statistical system. Zou Jiahua added: To establish a socialist market economic structure, we should nurture and develop an information market. The commercialization and industrialization of information is one of the priority tasks in establishing a market system. Because statistical information reflects the general state of national economic and social development and is the main part of economic, social, scientific, and technological information, actively nurturing and vigorously developing a statistical information market are tasks that brook no delay. Statistical departments should fully play their role as the main departments in charge of socioeconomic information, should make great efforts to plan and manage national socioeconomic information and consultation services, and should vigorously promote the effective distribution of socioeconomic information so all of society can share it. Zou Jiahua noted: We must further carry out reform and opening up in statistical work in accordance with the need to establish a socialist market economic system. We should shatter traditional concepts regarding statistics, and in accordance with the general law of the market economy, should boldly draw on advanced international statistic-related science and technology to institute a statistical system suited to China's conditions. We should exercise stronger centralized and unified leadership, and should scientifically and effectively organize national statistical work and national economic accounting work. We should radically reform our statistical surveying methods and develop surveying methods which are not all-encompassing, placing special emphasis on widely promoting sampling surveys. Zou Jiahua said emphatically: The statistical survey plans developed or approved by the State Statistical Bureau in accordance with the law are binding as national laws and regulations. All legal entities and citizens must fill in their forms truthfully; this is a bounden duty for every legal entity and citizen. The current practice of filing false statistical reports by the leaders of some localities, departments, and units--who are driven by personal honor and advancement, or by certain types of political honor and material benefits for small groups--is quite serious. Some of them even go so far as to retaliate against statisticians who dare maintain their principles. We should sternly investigate and deal with such negative and corrupt practices.
