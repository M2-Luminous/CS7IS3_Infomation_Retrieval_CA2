Windward Properties, Inc, and Mobil Land Development (Georgia) Corp., No. 1:91&hyph;CV&hyph;348&hyph;JEC (N.D. Ga.), was lodged with the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia on December 13, 1993. The other three counts of the complaint were previously settled pursuant to a partial consent decree entered by the Court in May 1993. The proposed partial consent decree concerns alleged violations of sections 301 and 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1311, 1344, as a result of the unpermitted construction of a dam in Caney Creek and a recreation area in wetlands by the defendants at the Windward development in Alpharetta, Georgia. Under the partial consent decree, the defendants will pay a $100,000 civil penalty to the U.S. Treasury, and will provide up to $225,000 in funding for projects to improve and protect wetlands and water quality in the same watershed where the alleged violations occurred. If entered by the Court, the proposed partial consent decree, in conjunction with the previously entered partial consent decree, will fully resolve this litigation. The Department of Justice will receive written comments relating to this consent decree for a period of thirty days from the date of publication of this notice. Comments should be addressed to the Acting Assistant Attorney General, Environment and Natural Resources Division, U.S. Department of Justice, Attention: Jon M.
