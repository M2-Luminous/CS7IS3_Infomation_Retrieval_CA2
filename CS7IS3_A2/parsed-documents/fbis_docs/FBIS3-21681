In a joint operation in Transvaal and Natal last night, they arrested at least 46 members of the syndicate known as the Boere Mafia. Fraud and theft amounting to more than 250 million rands are involved. Over 300 members of the police took part in the operation. Teams were sent as far as Groblersdal to arrest members of the Boere Mafia at their homes. All their homes were searched thoroughly for evidence. Seventeen stolen vehicles were also taken possession of. The suspects will appear in court in Pretoria and Pietermaritzburg today on charges of complicity to murder police officials, armed robbery, housebreaking, credit card and check fraud, and theft. The police have been on the syndicate's trail for at least two years. In August last year 19 people were arrested. Some of those released on bail at the time were again arrested last night. The police say the court cases could take up to three years.
