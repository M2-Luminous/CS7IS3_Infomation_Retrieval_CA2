FBIS4-68099 "jptot020__l94021" JPRS-TOT-94-020-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 2 May 1994 LATIN AMERICA PERU New SL Central Committee To `Reorganize' Party New SL Central Committee To `Reorganize' Party PY1105214194 Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 2 May 94 p A6 PY1105214194 Lima EXPRESO Spanish BFN [Excerpt] Analysts in the Peruvian security forces have concluded that the new Shining Path (SL) Central Committee, which is headed by dissident Alberto Ramirez Duran, aka "Feliciano," has decided to reorganize the party to resume the so-called "people's war." The key steps toward this objectives are: a) resume "work with the masses" (especially in poor Lima neighborhoods); b) step up military actions; c) strengthen compartmentalization (cell organization) at all levels; and d) enhance underground security. The main objective is to move ahead with the so-called Sixth Grand Plan, whose implementation stopped suddenly in September 1992 when Abimael Guzman was captured. In simple words, "Feliciano's" SL faction intends to continue terrorist operations, openly disregarding Guzman's instructions to his followers -- who have paid no attention so far -- to cease violent actions in the quest for a peace agreement with the government. Above and beyond the feverish fantasies of SL's current leadership, the organization no longer poses an imminent threat for the Peruvian state. The analysts believe that SL's decay is irreversible, although it is not going to be a short-term process. The experts indicated that the final battle against the terrorist organization is nowhere in sight yet, and it would be imprudent to lower guard. According to information this newspaper and Dincote [National Counterterrorism Directorate] gathered in Lima suburbs, for some time now the SL has been infiltrating many shantytowns, settlements, cooperative urban developments, and the multitudinous Lima marketplaces. This infiltration is simply part of the "work with the masses" aimed at rebuilding cadres. The murder of neighborhood leader and street vendor Benito Escalante Apaza on 29 April, near La Parada in the La Victoria district, was followed by the murder of national boxing champion Carlos Lavalle, a much-liked former leader of the Felix Raucarte Housing Cooperative in Ate-Vitarte. Dincote found out that Lavalle was killed by an SL annihilation squad, and that Escalante Apaza used to be a leader of the Manuel Scorza settlement in San Juan de Lurigancho. Dincote also found out that SL militants killed two residents of the Santa Eulalia district (Huarochiri Province), near Chosica, early on 28 April. The victims were accused of stealing cattle. The police explained that terrorists seek to win the residents' trust and support by punishing criminals. [passage omitted]
