Production has fallen an estimated 40 per cent compared with last year and both its currency and state revenues have plunged. Inflation has been screwed down from hyperinflationary levels to around 6 per cent a month and official unemployment is a mere 100,000 people. But this is achieved, economists say, at the cost of idle plants and millions of workers paid -- or more often not paid -- to do nothing. The plight of the economy, and possible reforms to drag it out of the mire, were discussed yesterday by international economists at a conference in Kiev organised by the World Bank, the Kiev International Centre for Advanced Studies and the Economic Policy journal. Among those on the podium were Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the formgr deputy prime minister of Poland, Mr Sergey Vasiliyev, deputy economics minister of Russia, and Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the highest-profile western adviser to the economies in transition. Mr Balcerowicz, the inspiration behind Polish reforms in 1990 and 1991, told the audience that Poland in 1989 was in a similar position to Ukraine today, with suppressed hyperinflation, a command economy and little private sector. "A radical programme can work," Mr Balcerowicz said, "so long as it includes stabilisation of the currency, privatisation and a unified exchange rate" -- none of which Ukraine at present has. Mr Vasiliyev, in the rare role for a Russian minister of being seen as the representative of a success story, said that "if Ukraine continues on the road it is now on it has no chance of coming out of its crisis. Experience shows that the more rapidly you go, the faster you get out." Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, a member of the Ukrainian parliament and a former reformist deputy prime minister with responsibility for the economy commented: "We in Ukraine have chosen to show the word that we can commit every possible mistake on the road to a market economy." Mr Daniel Kaufman, the head of the World Bank mission in Kiev, said that the black economy was now growing rapidly -- despite increasingly desperate efforts by the government to tighten its grip on the state sector. "Literally speaking, assets, capital, activities and entrepreneurs have departed from the official economy (but) the emergence and growth of the unofficial economy does demonstrate the entrepreneurship, creativity and ability to adapt and survive of Ukraine's citizens. "This bodes well for the future," said Mr Kaufman.
