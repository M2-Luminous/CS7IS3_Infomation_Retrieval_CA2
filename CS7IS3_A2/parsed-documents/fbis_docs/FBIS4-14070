That is a total of 1,068 deportees. In exclusive statements to MENA, Dahlan said that 105 deportees have returned and that the others will return in groups, the number of which will be agreed with the Israeli side. Dahlan pointed out that Israel deported 68 Palestinians because of the intifadah while others were deported for different reasons. He added that the release of 1,400 of 8,400 Palestinians held in Israeli jails has not yet been agreed with the Israelis. He added that it has been agreed with the Israelis to release 2,500 prisoners two days after the Gaza-Jericho implementation agreement is signed. He also said that 1,000 detainees will be released after the Israelis complete their withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho and that 500 will be released one month after the withdrawal is completed. He added that the release of 1,000 detainees will be discussed after the inauguration of negotiations on autonomy in West Bank. The Palestinian negotiators are seeking the release of all Palestinians held in Israeli jails regardless of their political orientation. The purpose is to preserve Palestinian unity, because these prisoners represent every affiliation. The Israelis refuse to release Hamas members, particularly following the operations the movement launched recently against the Israelis.
