Danilov-Danilyan on Program of National Ecological Revival"] [Text] The Russian minister of environmental protection and natural resources, who was elected to the State Duma by a federal list, said that there is "legal uncertainty" in the area of ecology. The minister emphasized that it is necessary to create as soon as possible "a legal base for environmental protection activities that will be in keeping with the new constitution." In his opinion, it should define the interaction between federal authorities and federation components with respect to natural resource utilization. V.I. Danilov-Danilyan pointed out that the implementation of ecological policy requires tremendous capital investment and is only possible when the economy improves. Nevertheless, it is necessary to beef up the environmental protection system--in particular, ecological monitoring and expert evaluation. The minister reported that development of programs for ecological improvement of the regions has began. For instance, in Tula Oblast. According to the minister, in 1993 penalty payments by enterprises polluting the atmosphere may possibly amount to about 300 billion rubles. In his opinion it is not expedient to increase the penalty rates, because it reduces production efficiency and does not lead to an improved environment. The minister refuted the rumor spread by the REUTER agency that Russia had allegedly dumped into the ocean "half a Chernobyl of radioactive waste." "In reality," he clarified, "the volume was smaller by two orders of magnitude." Russia's Choice plans a national ecological revival, said V. Danilov-Danilyan, based on a considerable reduction in the human and industrial impact on the environment. In particular, bringing within the norm atmospheric discharges and waste water dumping by industrial and agricultural enterprises, and developing a "repair network" for ecosystems that have become out of balance.
