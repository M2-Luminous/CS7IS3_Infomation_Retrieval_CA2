Xie Fei, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member and secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, delivered an important speech at the meeting. Propaganda and ideological work, he pointed out with emphasis, has always been an important aspect of the party's work and is an important channel for implementing the party's policies and principles, uniting the ideology of the whole party and the people of the whole country, and realizing party leadership. Propaganda and ideological work play an important role in uniting, mobilizing, and encouraging the people of Guangdong to strive to basically realize the magnificent goal of modernization in Guangdong within 20 years. Party committees and governments at all levels, various trades and professions, and various units should attach great importance to doing a good job in the propaganda and ideological work in the new period and should make greater achievements in this respect. The meeting was held in the provincial party committee auditorium yesterday morning. Zhang Guoying, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, chaired the meeting. Provincial Governor Zhu Senlin, and Huang Hua, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, also made important speeches. Wang Zongchun, Yao Siren, Zhang Hanqing, Li Lanfang, and Huang Hao also attended the meeting. Xie Fei's speech was divided into four parts: 1) attach importance to and strengthen propaganda and ideological work; 2) educate the broad masses of cadres and party members with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; 3) do a good job in giving guidance to public opinion; and 4) properly grasp the building of basic engineering in propaganda and ideological work. The great practice of establishing the socialist market economy structure and developing the socialist productive forces with great efforts, Xie Fei pointed out, have provided a new impetus and favorable opportunity, putting forward even more important tasks for, and higher demands on, propaganda and ideological work. Propaganda and ideological work are faced with even more arduous tasks. The establishment of the socialist market economy structure urgently demands that propaganda and ideological work create a public opinion environment of enthusiastically forging ahead. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, Xie Fei stressed in his speech, is contemporary Marxism in China. Since Comrade Deng Xiaoping made his important remarks during his inspection tour of the south in 1992, tremendous changes have taken place in the society, economy, and the people's mental attitude in our province. This is inseparable from the fact that various localities in our province have seriously organized the study of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The establishment of the socialist market economy structure, the further liberation and development of the productive forces, and the speeding up of socialist modernization have put forward new and higher demands on our theoretical level, our level of understanding of policies, and our work ability. To meet the needs of such demands we must have a thorough understanding of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and be able to use it skillfully in practice. Leading cadres at all levels should, despite their heavy workloads, consciously find time for studying theories and should strive to improve their own ideological and political quality and to raise their theoretical level. They should be determined to get away from and reduce unnecessary social intercourse and should, in light of major issues of the reform and development of their respective localities and departments, concentrate their minds on the study of theories, read more books, ponder on problems, skillfully use scientific theories as guidance to solve problems in practice, and strive to raise their level in the art of leadership and other kinds of work. In studying the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics at present, we should mainly study the third volume of "The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping." In our study, we should pay attention to properly settling the following issues: 1) firmly grasp the essence of the emancipation of the mind and seeking truth from facts and establish the Marxist world outlook and methodology; 2) guide the broad masses of party members and cadres to seriously sum up the experience in reform and opening up in the past 15 years and strengthen the faith in taking the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics under the party's leadership; 3) strive to improve the ability to lead and control the socialist market economy; and 4. improve study methods, widen channels of study, and uphold the style of study of linking theory with practice. Adhering to a correct public opinion guidance is to adhere to the party's basic line, properly propagandize the party's line, policies, and principles, and strive to arouse the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and to guide them toward the realization of modernization, said Xie Fei. Our public opinion should be conducive to: Furthering reform and opening up, the establishment of the socialist market economy structure, and the development of the social productive forces; encouraging and urging the people to do arduous pioneering work and to blaze new trails in making the country prosper, the people happy, and the society progressive; helping the people distinguish right from wrong, to uphold the true, the good, and the beautiful, and to resist the false, the ugly, and the vicious; and conducive to the unity of the country, the solidarity of the nation, the easing of the minds of the people, and the social and political stability. To adhere to a correct public opinion guidance, Xie Fei pointed out, it is necessary to correctly handle three kinds of relationship: That between healthiness of contents and liveliness in form--the two should be integrated; and that between positive propaganda and negative exposure--uphold the principle of unity, stability, arousing enthusiasm, and taking positive propaganda as the dominant factor, while exposing and criticizing things on the negative and dark side of the society and giving play to the role of supervision with public opinion but it is necessary to seek truth from facts, have a sense of propriety, take social effects into consideration, and pay attention to effects at home and abroad; and the relationship between social effects and economic effects. We must properly grasp a crucial point and that is, improvement of the quality of the journalist contingent. To properly grasp basic engineering in propaganda and ideological work, emphasized Xie Fei, at present it is necessary to concentrate our efforts on properly grasping four aspects of work. The first is to grasp the foundation, that is, it is necessary to properly grasp the foundation of education for teenagers. Teenagers are the future and hope of the motherland and efforts should be made to properly grasp education and training for them and to develop them into a new generation of people with ideals, ethics, culture, and a sense of discipline. The second is to grasp the grass roots. Propaganda, ideological, and cultural departments at all levels should place the focal point of their work at the grass roots. It is necessary to carry out propaganda and ideological work and the building of spiritual civilization in the grass roots and to give full play to various kinds of organizational role for grass-roots party branches as a powerful fighting force. It is necessary to carry out in the grass roots various kinds of activities which are healthy and progressive in content, vivid and lively in form, and attractive to the masses and the contents of propaganda and education should be merged with such activities to silently exert a subtle influence. The third is to grasp the position. The construction of hardware for propaganda, culture, and spiritual civilization is the material basis for improving the quality of ideology and ethics and the quality of science and culture of human beings. It is also one of the marks indicating whether or not a locality is "grasping with both hands" and "grasping hard with both hands" and indicating the level of economic and social development of that locality. Various localities should include the "hardware" of propaganda and cultural undertakings into the overall plan for economic and social development and into the government annual financial spending budget and gradually increase the percentage of investment. The fourth is to grasp the mechanism. It is necessary to sum up the successful experience of various localities in our province since reform and opening up began, to meet the new demands of the development of the socialist market economy, and to further form, improve, and consolidate the following mechanisms: The switch-on and guarantee mechanism enabling party committees to strengthen leadership, governments to pay attention, and various quarters to participate; the mechanism enabling the comprehensive use of administrative, economic, and legal means to carry out management, regulation, and control; and the mechanism enabling the masses to govern and discipline themselves, to educate themselves, and to keep themselves within bounds. Party committees at all levels should really undertake their responsibilities and earnestly strengthen leadership over propaganda and ideological work, Xie Fei pointed out emphatically. First, party committees at all levels should strengthen guidance and coordination in propaganda and ideological work, regularly study and analyze the ideological trends of various social strata, determine the policy, major tasks, and focal points of propaganda and ideological work in different periods, and give guidance to propaganda departments and help them discuss and grasp major matters and carry out their work in a down-to-earth manner. Second, party committees and governments at all levels should give support to the development of propaganda and cultural undertakings in terms of financial and material resources. They must implement the instruction by the central authorities that "taxes and profits handed over to the state by the propaganda and cultural system should, in principle, be returned to the system and should be used for the development of propaganda and cultural undertakings." Third, it is necessary to strengthen the building of the contingent of propaganda and ideological workers. It is necessary to show concern for their politics, ideology, work, and livelihood, give full play to their role, and constantly improve their quality. The tremendous achievements made in economic construction and other aspects in our province since the beginning of reform and opening up cannot be separated from the hard work of the broad masses of propaganda and ideological workers, Zhu Senlin pointed out in his speech. The new situation has put forward new tasks for, and new demands on, propaganda and ideological work and propaganda and ideological departments have undertaken even more important historical missions. Under the condition of the socialist market economy, these departments should enthusiastically explore ways and means to do a better job in propaganda and ideological work, carry out their work in a creative manner, and better serve the reform, opening up, and economic construction of the whole province. They should, in accordance with the general goal and demand of basically realizing modernization in Guangdong within 20 year, make great efforts to developing flourishing propaganda and cultural undertakings. Governments at all levels should attach importance and give support to propaganda and ideological work, let the propaganda and ideological department know about the situation in good time, and try their best to provide better conditions for propaganda and ideological work so that it can produce greater benefits. They should include the building of propaganda and cultural undertakings into the general plan for the local economy and society, make overall arrangements, and construct in a planned way a number of relatively modern propaganda and cultural facilities which are in keeping with the economic development. They should, with the economic development, appropriately increase input into propaganda and cultural undertakings and resolutely implement an economic policy to support the propaganda and cultural undertakings. They should continue to encourage various social quarters to run propaganda and cultural undertakings and give them support in this respect. They should grasp prosperity in one hand and management with the other and make great efforts to straighten out problems existing in the cultural market. They should attach importance to improving the working and living conditions of the broad masses of cadres and workers in the propaganda and cultural systems. Huang Hua relayed at the meeting the guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work meeting and put forward views on the implementation of such guidelines. To implement the guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work meeting, he stressed, we must link them with the reality of Guangdong, grasp the key points and, in particular, make great efforts "to arm the people with scientific theories, to guide the people with correct public opinion, to portray the people with noble spirit, and to encourage the people with fine works." We must formulate plans, grasp typical examples, improve work methods, provide better services on our own initiative, earnestly do a better job in all kinds of work, and strive to attain good results. We must, Huang Hua added, earnestly strengthen the building of the contingent of propaganda and ideological workers, constantly improve their quality, and further inspire their enthusiasm to make the country prosperous, to forge ahead, and to make new contributions to opening up a new situation in the propaganda and ideological work in our province and to basically realize modernization in Guangdong within 20 years.
