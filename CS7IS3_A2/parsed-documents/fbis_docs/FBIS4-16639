Meshkov. Unfortunately, not only did the high official of the autonomous Republic fail to embark upon the road of respecting the law, but he is even further intensifying his illegal activity. This is confirmed, in particular, by the following facts: On 11 April, the Crimean president, accompanied by a group of his bodyguards, arrived at the building of the Crimean Security Service, where, in the presence of members of its council, he announced his edicts on suspending from duty Crimean Security Service chairman General I.F. Kolomytsev and on appointing another person as acting chairman. He did the same at the Crimean Ministry of Internal Affairs with regard to Minister of Internal Affairs General O.N. Plyuta. Not only are such actions on the part of the president of the Crimean Republic a blatant violation of Ukraine's legislation and of the international norms on human rights, but also of the Constitution of the Crimean Republic on the text of which he recently took the oath of allegiance. The Main Law of the Crimea (Article 129) envisages the right for the president to introduce proposals to the Supreme Council on the candidacy of the Security Service chairman. In accordance with Article 8 of Ukraine's Law "On the Division of Powers Among Organs of State Power of Ukraine and the Crimean Republic" and the Constitution of the Crimean Republic (Article 115, clause 13), the Crimean Supreme Council agrees to the appointment of the chairman of the Crimean Security Service only on the recommendation of the chairman of the Ukrainian Security Service. The appointment and the dismissal of this person from this post are the prerogative of the chairman of Ukraine's Security Service. Besides, the dismissal must be coordinated with the chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council. Regarding the minister of internal affairs, in accordance with the Constitution of the Crimean Republic, this official may be appointed or dismissed only upon coordination with the Crimean Supreme Council. The president of the Crimean Republic, in conformity with his status, must act as a guarantor of the Constitution and laws. However, if he opts for a different road, it will inevitably lead to anarchy and lack of security in society. No objective circumstances can justify such actions.
