This was also noted by the UN Security Council last Thursday [3 February]. It threatened measures against Croatia, if these troops are not withdrawn. This withdrawal must take place. It is not only the Serbs who have violated the cease-fire the parties to the conflict promised the European Union [EU] foreign ministers. Bosnian troops, too, have initiated a major offensive against Croat towns in central Bosnia. The senseless killing, misery, suffering, and the driving away of people has to stop. Bosnian Muslims and Croats need each other. The UN Security Council has given Croatia a period of two weeks. It then intends to decide on measures against Croatia, which might also entail the danger of further streams of refugees to Germany, a radicalization, and endangering humanitarian aid. Therefore, we must make good use of the time. Therefore, at next Monday's meeting of the 12 EU foreign ministers, I will advocate that we Europeans, in close cooperation with Croats and Muslims, seek an understanding that restores order to the deeply disturbed Croat-Muslim relations. This is the key issue.
