[Begin Milewski recording] I consider the Partnership for Peace program very good as a transitional measure that will speed up and facilitate Poland's full membership in NATO, membership as an equal partner, and as a partner equally valuable to our future NATO partners. The Partnership for Peace program has, however, been criticized. It has been criticized by the highest state officials in the country, by President Lech Walesa and by Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej Olechowski, as a program that does not give us the necessary political protection, protection needed at this particular moment against the growing threat, now only political and verbal, from the East. Increasingly frequently we hear from Moscow voices that give indications that a return to imperial, expansionist policies is increasingly probable. Because at the moment this threat is only political and is expressed in words, not in deeds or military action, and thank God, there is no military threat yet, today we only need political protection. The transitional period when our Army adapts itself to NATO can and must take a few years. [end recording]
