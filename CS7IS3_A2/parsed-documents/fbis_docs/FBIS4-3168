The tour, taking in the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan as well as Mongolia, will be Li's first foreign trip since heart problems in April last year removed him from the political scene for some six months. "I don't think there is any negative impact for Sino-Russian relations," Li told reporters at the Great Hall of the People prior to his departure. "China is ready to maintain good relations with Central Asian republics and Mongolia, and at the same time we also hope to see the maintenance of good relations between these countries and Russia," he said. However, diplomats here say that China, in its bid to to set itself up as the major power in Asia, is keen to counter Russian influence in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Beijing is also anxious to ensure that political instability in some CIS states does not spill over into neighbouring Xinjiang, China's predominantly Muslim province in the far northwest. "The purpose of my visit is to enhance mutual understanding, promote cooperation and strengthen friendship," Li said, laying special emphasis on the mutual importance of strengthening economic links. "It is true that at present these countries are encountering economic difficulties, but I think that these difficulties are temporary and that they will be overcome," he said. Diplomats point out that China's economic boom has given Beijing the chance to boost its influence in Central Asia at the expense of cash-strapped Moscow. The highlight of Li's trip to Mongolia will be the signing of a new friendship and cooperation treaty to replace the one signed in 1960, when China was essentially a Russian puppet. "I hope that through my visit the two sides will further promote and extend trade and economic cooperation," Li said, adding that that more than 1,000 kilometer (600-mile) Sino-Mongolian frontier should become a "border of friendship." During Li's absence, Vice-Premier in charge of the economy Zhu Rongji will take the role of acting premier.
