Nos. 171&hyph;129, 173&hyph;240, 178&hyph;105, 180&hyph;7] RIN 2137&hyph;AC37 Cargo Tanks; Miscellaneous Requirements AGENCY: Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: RSPA is amending certain requirements for the manufacture, qualification and maintenance of cargo tank motor vehicles. These regulatory actions are based on petitions for rulemaking, exemptions, National Transportation Safety Board recommendations, and RSPA initiative. The intended effect of these actions is to relax certain regulatory requirements and to reduce unnecessary economic burdens on industry where there will be no adverse effect on safety. DATES: Effective date: January 5, 1995. Compliance date: Compliance with the regulations, as amended herein, is authorized immediately. Incorporation by reference: The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in this final rule is approved by the Director of the Office of the Federal Register as of January 5, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ronald Kirkpatrick, telephone (202) 366&hyph;4545, Office of Hazardous Materials Technology, or Jennifer Karim, (202) 366&hyph;4488, Office of Hazardous Materials Standards, Research and Special Programs Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590&hyph;0001. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On March 3, 1993, RSPA published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) [Docket No. HM&hyph;183C; Notice No. 93&hyph;7; 58 FR 12316] proposing to amend certain requirements for the manufacture, qualification and maintenance of cargo tank motor vehicles. Most issues raised in the NPRM relate to requirements that were adopted in final rules published under Docket No. HM&hyph;183/HM&hyph;183A (June 12, 1989, 54 FR 24982; May 22, 1990, 55 FR 21035; September 7, 1990, 55 FR 37028; June 17, 1991, 56 FR 27872). The final rules established three new cargo tank specifications designated as DOT 406, DOT 407 and DOT 412, and revised the structural design requirements for MC 331 and MC 338 cargo tanks. Voluntary compliance for manufacture of cargo tanks to these new or revised specifications was authorized beginning on October 1, 1990. As manufacturers began modifying their manufacturing operations to construct cargo tanks to the new requirements, they encountered certain technical problems which caused them to question changes they had endorsed several years ago. They raised issues relating to structural integrity, accident damage protection, use of dual function pressure relief devices, and certification by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). Also RSPA received several petitions for rulemaking addressing certain issues not previously raised. In the NPRM, RSPA pointed out these concerns and other issues based on petitions for rulemaking, exemptions, and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommendations. The NPRM also announced a public meeting that was held in Chicago on March 24 and 25, 1993, to address issues raised in the NPRM. On March 8, 1993, RSPA published a final rule [Docket HM&hyph;183, 58 FR 12904] granting an extension until April 21, 1994, for the continued construction of cargo tank motor vehicles to the MC 306, MC 307, MC 312, MC 331, and MC 338 specifications. This action was granted to allow additional time for RSPA and industry to address certain technical issues concerning the manufacture of cargo tank motor vehicles to the DOT 406, DOT 407 and DOT 412 specifications, and to resolve certain concerns about the structural design requirements in the MC 331 and MC 338 specifications. At the March 24&hyph;25 public meeting, several significantly different views of design engineers and cargo tank manufacturers were identified. Additionally, preliminary results were presented of an advanced structural evaluation (using finite element analysis) of the MC 331 cargo tank which raised questions in regard to stress levels in areas of concentrated loadings. On January 12, 1994, RSPA published a final rule [Docket HM&hyph;183, 58 FR 1784] granting another extension until August 31, 1995, for continued construction of cargo tank motor vehicles to the MC specifications. The final rule also announced a public meeting in Washington, D.C. on February 7&hyph;8, 1994. At the February public meeting, RSPA obtained clarification of certain comments received in response to the NPRM and also obtained additional supporting data on certain alternate proposals offered by industry. In addition, RSPA sought information to resolve the remaining issues on structural integrity, accident damage protection, use of dual function pressure relief devices, and ASME certification of low pressure cargo tank motor vehicle manufacturers. II. Summary of Comments RSPA received over 50 written comments in response to the proposals contained in the NPRM from trade associations, cargo tank manufacturers and repairers, manufacturers of cargo tank parts and equipment, and Federal, State and local agencies. RSPA has considered all comments, public meeting transcripts and petitions in the development of this final rule.
