For the purposes of this Order, licensed activities include the activities licensed or regulated by: (1) NRC; (2) an Agreement State, limited to the Licensee's conduct of activities within NRC jurisdiction pursuant to 10 CFR 150.20; and (3) an Agreement State where the licensee is involved in the distribution of products that are subject to NRC jurisdiction. B. After the five year prohibition has expired as described in paragraph A above, Mr. Preston shall provide notice to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, for acceptance of any employment in licensed activity for an additional five year period. The Regional Administrator, Region III, may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above conditions upon demonstration by Mr. Preston of good cause. VI In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, Mr. Preston must, and any other person adversely affected by this Order may, submit an answer to this Order, and may request a hearing within 30 days of the date of this Order. The answer may consent to this Order. Unless the answer consents to this Order, the answer shall, in writing and under oath or affirmation, specifically admit or deny each allegation or charge made in this Order and shall set forth the matters of fact and law on which Mr. Preston or other person adversely affected relies and the reasons as to why the Order should not have been issued. Any answer or request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, DC 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address, to the Regional Administrator, Region III, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 801 Warrenville Road, Lisle, Illinois 60532&hyph;4351, and to Mr. Preston, if the answer or hearing request is by a person other than Mr. Preston. If a person other than Mr. Preston requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity the manner in which his interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d). If a hearing is requested by Mr. Preston or a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this Order should be sustained. Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), Mr. Preston, or any person adversely affected by this Order, may in addition to demanding a hearing, at the time that answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error. In the absence of any request for a hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An answer or a request for a hearing shall not stay the immediate effectiveness of this order. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 5th day of April 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
