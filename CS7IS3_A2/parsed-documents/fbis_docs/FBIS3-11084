During an informal meeting with foreign journalists he said the Colombian Government does not welcome the fight between the prosecutor general and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno. Attorney General Arrieta rejected what the prosecutor general said in what represents a struggle for power that goes beyond Colombia's borders. In the meeting Arrieta said that the Colombian Government does not agree with the prosecutor general's position or academic views concerning his U.S. counterpart, Janet Reno. Nevertheless, he said Reno's noncompromising attitude encourages solidarity with the prosecutor general, which was not advisable for the Colombian Government because it is concerned that this fight obstructs the surrender process. Immediately after the meeting an ASSOCIATED PRESS report said: Arrieta stated his concern that drug traffickers might fish in troubled waters if the confrontation continues.
