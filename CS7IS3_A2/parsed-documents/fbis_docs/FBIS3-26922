Wage reform, which had been discussed and planned for a long time, was originally introduced with the civil service system. Due to the current high inflation, the grim economic situation, and the heavy tasks of reform, however, the CPC senior leadership decided at the end of last year that wage reform for cadres, servicemen, and teachers should be sped up and that it should be completed before the Spring Festival so as to maintain the stability of the "backyard" [hou yuan 0683 7108]. Following the wage reform, Jiang Zemin has become the official who receives the highest income. Of the many titles he holds, he receives his salary with the highest-paying title of the Central Military Commission chairman, a monthly income of 1,600 yuan. This time, there were not many new elements in the wage reform. It still determines pay scales with such indexes as seniority, post, and technical title; the higher the position, the higher the wages. The wage reform's increase rate was 36 percent on average. The troops had higher rates than those for officials in the localities, and cadres had slightly higher rates than those for teachers. In the wake of the reform, high-ranking military officers and officials at the local ministerial level receive approximately 1,000 yuan; field officers and cadres at the local department or bureau level receive approximately 700 yuan, and cadres at and below the sectional level and general teachers receive approximately 400 yuan. The wage gap has obviously widened. The wage reform was implemented at a time of rather large financial difficulties. For the 3 million troops, the state had to spend approximately 3 billion yuan and for the 30 million cadres and teachers, it had to spend another 20 billion yuan or so; so that their wages are paid according to the new pay scale retroactive to October 1993. There are advantages and disadvantages in wage reform. The advantages are that it has stabilized the long shaky moral of the troops and the general moral of cadres and teachers. But its disadvantages seem to outnumber the advantages. First, at a time when organizational reform has not been completed and when organizations are overstaffed, wage reform has not succeeded in improving work efficiency. Second, under the current social situation, it will inevitably lead to competition and spark off big increases in wages. For large numbers of loss-making state-owned enterprises particularly, it will lead to rising labor costs and accelerate financial difficulties while their efficiency does not seem to improve. Third, the substantial wage increases will accelerate inflation. At a time when China is a the buyer's market, an increase in the currency that people hold in their hands will pave the way for a worsening economy.
