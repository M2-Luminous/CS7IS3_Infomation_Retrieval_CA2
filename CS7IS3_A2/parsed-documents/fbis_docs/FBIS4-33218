FBIS4-33218 "drlat107_m_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-107 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 Brazil `Confidential' Report Details Occupation Strategy `Confidential' Report Details Occupation Strategy PY0306010294 Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 2 Jun 94 p A17 PY0306010294 Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO Portuguese BFN [Article by Tania Monteiro] [Text] Brasilia -- The Strategic Affairs Secretariat (SAE) has produced reports for President Itamar Franco informing that the Landless People's Movement (MST) is very well coordinated, and that it even has training centers for the political and ideological formation of its leaders. According to the reports made available to O ESTADO, one of those centers is located at the Ranch of Workers in the town of Ipojuca, in rural Pernambuco, where landless people might be receiving guerrilla training for the purpose of guaranteeing the possession of occupied areas. The reports are divided into one main section and its annexes, all of them bearing the "confidential" seal. The reports say that representatives from Germany, Chile, Nicaragua, Cuba, and the former USSR are cooperating in the training of landless people. They add that the MST is linked with Latin American and Caribbean peasant organizations, and that it also has links in Chile, Uruguay, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. One 15-page SAE report says that MST leaders have transformed the action into a movement of masses supporting political and ideological interests that are against the government and the system of government. The document emphasizes the participation of the Workers Party (PT) and the Sole Workers Center (CUT), noting that the two organizations consider landless people their main force in promoting conflict in the field. The document says that the MST is like a military organization, having pamphlets with instructions for land occupation, resistance, and for the promotion of production in the occupied area in order to guarantee possession of the land. The document reveals that women and children are also instructed to resist, that landless peasants intend to build guerrilla bases in the Bico do Papagaio region, in Tocantins, and that while they were planning their action they proposed building homemade bombs. They are said to be heavily armed, but no reference is made to the weapons they have. PT Deputy for Sao Paulo Luci Choinacki, who backs the Sao Paulo landless people, has questioned the contents of the report: "The movement has no political-partisan motivation, and envisages the fight for land as being for the sake of the workers' survival." She added that "the land conflict in Brazil has neither increased nor decreased over the past few years. It is exactly the same." "Because we are in an electoral year, the information is being used for electoral purposes," she said. The PT deputy said that none of the 100,000 settlements were made out of the government's own will, but through the workers' struggle. She suggested that the government investigate those settlements to see that productivity has increased in those areas. She also proposed to check the work done by the Rural Democratic Union (UDR) to confirm the number of anonymous workers who were killed in armed conflicts. She denied that the movement is promoting any type of guerrilla training. PT Deputy for Sao Paulo Jose Genoino, a member of the Defense Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, will next week ask SAE chief Admiral Mario Flores for a public audience with the members of the committee for them to learn about the reports' contents. "It is necessary to know what is partial and what is impartial in those reports," he said. In order to obtain the information for the reports submitted to President Itamar Franco, SAE did the work that was previously done by the former agents of the defunct National Intelligence Service (SNI). To this end, SAE infiltrated the landless movements with its agents, who are supplying the government with new information every 15 days, and if necessary every week. SAE has not reported how many men are involved in this job. The report describes the factors that gave rise to the movement. One of the highlights is the landless people's slogan: "The need for implementation of a revolution of workers to terminate the capitalist state, which is responsible for the current exploitation and misery of workers, reaching Socialism." The document makes a thorough evaluation of land invasions in Brazil. It says that 122 occupations occurred this year. In Sao Paulo, for example, there were 20 actions by landless people. Parana is another main target, with 33 invasions. The report adds that no land conflicts have occurred in Goias and in most Amazonian states, despite the low productivity of land. The report notes that the MST is organized in almost all states, with the exception of Amazonas and Acre. Concerning PT influence on the movements, the document emphasizes that "the PT has considerable power within the movement, even within the Coordination Faction, which partially disagrees with the political-ideological position of the revolutionaries." In its conclusions the document says that the government position is not to negotiate under pressure. One of the recommendations is the adoption of measures that were planned for the farm sector, providing infrastructure to settlements and selecting families with devotion to farm work, to give them technological and community work orientation.
