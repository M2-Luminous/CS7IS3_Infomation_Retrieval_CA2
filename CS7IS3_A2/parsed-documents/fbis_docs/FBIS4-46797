There have already been many declarations. One of them concerns creation of an economic union of commonwealth countries, which as is commonly known, Ukraine joined as an associate member. A lot here is big politics. Economic reality, however, stubbornly injects its corrections in such agreements and treaties. It is necessary to take that into account. When I hear appeals by industrialists (particularly from the eastern regions) heard from tribunes at conferences and congresses for the immediate restoration of old ties with former cooperative partners, which for some reason are often linked with various forms of protests against active privatization of state property, I involuntarily feel surprised by the naivete and the feigned lack of insight by these mature leaders of large industries. The economic river is fast-flowing and variable. How is it possible to seek links with something that no longer exists with such recklessness? First of all I have in mind the new economy of our main economic partner, Russia, which is completely different from what it was yesterday. Totally different relations, frequently not controlled by decisions at the state, and certainly, at the interstate level, predominate there. The new property owner is already functioning in Russia and becoming more active, a prototype of whom is barely evident in Ukraine. Still we must hold on to former markets at whatever cost, inasmuch as we will hardly be able to get a foothold in the next several years on the new European market with our products, which lack high quality and competitive ability. It is necessary to seek ties with Russians, Belarusians, Kazakhs, and other CIS members, but on a qualitatively new basis. Structural interrelations among subjects of management in Russia, for instance, as I have already said, are undergoing important changes. For instance, tens of industrial-financial groups are already operating there (whereas we are only talking about them). Therefore, the question concerning mutual penetration and amalgamation of capital and, correspondingly, efforts for attainment of some common goal, is increasingly becoming the order of the day. Mutual acquisition of "foreign" property is necessary and inevitable. Again, because of the outstripping pace of their economic reforms, the Russians are today ready to sell shares in their enterprises and financial structures to foreign partners and purchase foreign shares. We, however, are not ready for this. Even though I feel confident that the future belongs to multinational companies. Thus, whether we want to recognize it or not, there is simply no other way for us to engage in normal work and obtain the possibility of economic integration with the closest, and in the long range, with presently distant neighbors, other than to follow the path of immediate radical reforms and mandatory fulfillment of privatization programs and measures. We have to create structures as quickly as possible that would be capable of conducting a policy aimed at assimilation and protection of markets (i.e. the amalgamation of efforts of industry and financial capital). It is necessary to develop the entire market infrastructure with insurance against risk, along with leasing, holding, and similar forms and organizations accepted in a market economy. Before attempting to change something on the outside, however, it is necessary to create optimal conditions inside the country for the normal existence, development, and flourishing of domestic production. Its export possibilities must not be stifled with thoughtless laws and decrees, but stimulated in every way. It must be offered the opportunity to get up on its feet so as to be able to arouse interest in itself primarily among countrymen, and then among consumers abroad. According to first quarter results 24 percent of our enterprises (read every fourth one) are unprofitable. Can they promise any dividends at all to potential owners of their potential shares? An absurd question. But it is already on the agenda in connection with the massive privatization that has started. It might turn out that we will yet again fail the expectations of our people. That cannot be allowed to happen. The policy must be rigid, but honest and open. People must be told the truth. They must know that profits, and that means dividends, may be generated only by effective production. That is what it will be when an enterprising owner emerges on the economic arena.
