FR940922-1-00015 FR940922-1-00005 All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by IDEQ and EPA (see sections 172(c)(6) and 110(a)(2)(A) of the Act and 57 FR 13556). EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIP's and SIP revisions were set forth in a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. (see 57 FR 13541). Nonattainment area plan provisions must also contain a program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C)). The specific control measures that were submitted as part of the SIP are addressed above under the section headed ``Control Measures.'' As also discussed in that section, although the State relies on mandatory wood smoke control ordinances throughout the entire nonattainment area (except for the Kuna area) to demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the standard, the State has adopted and submitted to EPA a mandatory wood smoke curtailment ordinance only for the City of Boise. The necessary ordinances for Eagle, Garden City, Meridian and unincorporated Ada County, as well as evidence that the wood smoke control programs for these areas are adequately funded, implemented, enforced and maintained, have not been submitted at this time. EPA has reviewed for enforceability the wood smoke ordinance for the City of Boise, which includes the mandatory curtailment program and the wood stove certification program for Boise, and has determined that it meets all of the criteria included in the September 23, 1987, Potter Memorandum. Exemptions from the mandatory burn bans are allowed only for the following reasons and must be approved by the City Building Department: a. wood burning is the resident's sole source of heat; b. curtailment would cause unreasonable economic hardship for low income households; or c. the wood burning device being utilized is certified by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality or EPA as ``clean burning''. This is consistent with the recommendations for woodburning curtailment programs provided in EPA's Guidance Document for Residential Wood Combustion Emission Control Measures. The wood stove certification program does not contain any exemptions. Compliance with wood burning curtailments and the certification program is mainly achieved by responding to citizen complaints, but the City of Boise has limited personnel that independently monitor for noncompliance. Enforcement of burn bans and the certification program follows three progressive steps: 1. written warning; 2. fine; and 3. further legal action against the violator, if needed. IDEQ's submittals and the TSD contain further information on the enforceability of the Boise wood smoke curtailment ordinance and the personnel and funding intended to support effective implementation of this ordinance. In these respects, this control measure appears to be enforceable. Section 110(a)(2)(E) of the Act requires that, where the State has relied on a local or regional government, agency or instrumentality for the implementation of any plan provision, the plan must provide necessary assurances that the State has responsibility for ensuring adequate implementation of such plan provision. The State's initial SIP submittal did not address the requirement of section 110(a)(2)(E). However, in a recent submission from the State addressing State responsibility for local control measures, such as the Boise wood smoke control ordinance, the State indicated that it relies on its existing ability to issue an operating permit to any stationary source when the Department determines that emission reductions from that source are necessary to attain or maintain a NAAQS (see Idaho Administrative Procedures Act (IDAPA) 16.01.01012.03.c (June 1993); IDAPA 16.01.01401.03 (May 1994)). The submission includes a copy of an opinion from the Attorney General's office stating that such permits could be issued to the owners of wood stoves and could include provisions directly implementing local mandatory wood smoke curtailment ordinances in the event a local entity fails to implement or enforce its respective local ordinance. This mechanism appears to satisfy the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(E) of the Act for State responsibility for local wood smoke control ordinances. EPA is reserving judgment on the enforceability of the outstanding control measures (i.e. mandatory wood smoke curtailment programs for Eagle, Garden City, Meridian and unincorporated Ada County) and the adequacy of the related enforcement programs until EPA receives and reviews these measures.
