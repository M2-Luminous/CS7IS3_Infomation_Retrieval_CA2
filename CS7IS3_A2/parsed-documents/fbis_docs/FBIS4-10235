The bloc approved the motion by 11 votes in favor and two opposed thanks to the support of the eight senators elected in the January 1993 partial legislative elections which has been challenged by the international community. The proposals refer to the application of Article 149 of the Constitution that foresees the appointment of the president of the court of appeals as president of the Republic in case of a prolonged absence by the president. The Constitution stipulates that in such cases, elections must be called within a "45 to 90 day" period. The senators decided to announce their decision to the Chamber of Deputies and Appeals Court President Emile Jonassaint. The deputies had already approved another plan, supported by the United States and the United Nations, to solve the country's crisis, but not with the senatorial bloc (led by Firmin Jean-Louis) acknowledged by the international community. Deposed President Jean Bertrand Aristide rejected the aforementioned plan that contemplates the designation of a new prime minister after the departure of Army Chief General Raoul Cedras, even though no mention is made of the date when he will be able to return to the country.
