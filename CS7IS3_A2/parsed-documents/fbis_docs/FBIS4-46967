Our discussion touched upon the refutation by the UOC-KP [Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kiev Patriarchate] of a report published in the Ukrainian business journal NOOSFERA. The text of this report has been widely disseminated by the mass media. It was obtained--as indicated--"from a source close to government circles." The gist of this published item lies in the statement that on 14 May of this year V. Kryzhanivskiy, Ukraine's ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the Russian Federation, had a meeting with Aleksiy II, Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia. Discussed at this meeting was the granting of autocephaly to the UOC-KP, as well as the secret meeting between Metropolitan Filaret and the leader of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate, Metropolitan Vladimir (Sabodan). At this meeting agreement was allegedly reached concerning the unification of both Orthodox branches into a single, integrated confession. In the opinion of a "reliable source," the leader of the UOC-MP [Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate] would have to become the patriarch of the newly unified church. Here is what my fellow-conversationalist, Filaret, stated on this score. "It is not true. Some persons would like me to have a personal meeting with Metropolitan Vladimir (Sabodan), but there was no such meeting. Nor could such a meeting take place behind the back of the patriarch of Kiev and All Russia-Ukraine. Such disinformation by no means stabilizes the coordinated work of both hierarchies, but--on the contrary--leads to dissension and discord. Whose purpose does this falsehood serve?"
