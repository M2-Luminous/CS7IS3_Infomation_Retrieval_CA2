Air Defense Forces Forced American Plane To Land" -- date, place of interview not given] [Text] There have been increasingly frequent instances recently of foreign aircraft ignoring the procedure for crossing the state border and for the use of airspace, penetrating deep into Russian territory and refusing to fulfill the demands of air traffic control organs. In the past two months alone, there have been seven such instances. The Air Defense Forces are obliged to take resolute measures against the violators. And that is what happened on 7 June this year. At 1354 hours a Lockheed C-130 aircraft belonging to the U.S. airline "Rapid Aerotrans" entered Russia's 25-km border zone. It has emerged that the plane was on a flight from Frankfurt-am-Main to Tbilisi and had not filed the appropriate application. The integrated air traffic control system's Main Center forbade the violator plane to fly over Russian Federation territory, but the Lockheed's crew ignored this order and penetrated 80 km into our airspace. Two Su-27 patrol fighters then took off from the Krymsk military airfield. But they did not get within 50 km of the target. On learning that the patrol forces had taken off, the U.S. violator plane declared its readiness to land at the nearest airport, and 16 minutes later it made a landing at Adler. Our correspondent asked Colonel General of Aviation Viktor Prudnikov, commander in chief of the Air Defense Forces, to comment on the situation. "Certain regions have emerged," the commander in chief stressed, "where violations of rules for the use of airspace have become frequent. First and foremost this is true of the North Caucasus. It is surprising, because everyone knows that before crossing a border, a plane must make contact with the relevant air traffic control organs and confirm its intention to enter the country's airspace. And that can only be done with permission. It is also well known that the appropriate applications have to be filed the day before the flight in accordance with the established procedure. "The cases that have been occurring recently indicate that nobody is notifying anyone and that random incursions into Russia's airspace are taking place." [Ivanov] What are the reasons why foreign aircraft fail to carry out the orders of the air traffic control services? [Prudnikov] Some people have the impression that the former Union has broken up into independent states which are not yet quite ready to exercise proper control of their airspace. There are also elements of contempt for the existing rules. People sometimes think it will all pass off with impunity. So that nobody forms the desire to test our air borders or behave like hooligans in the air, I will say that these opinions should be refuted by actions. In some regions recently, where the situation so requires, we have stepped up our monitoring of the air. In order to establish visual contact with a violator plane we are obliged to bring our fighters to within a short distance of it, which could lead to complications regarding compliance with safety measures. I hope that appropriate measures will be adopted in the near future, first and foremost in the CIS countries, to prevent violations of the laws and ensure safe flights for all the aircraft using our airspace. [Ivanov] In the present situation our state has to count every kopek. Additional measures by patrol forces against violators are costly. Is it not time to demand compensation for the economic loss sustained due to unlawful actions in Russia's skies? [Prudnikov] Bringing in additional resources and sending up patrol fighters is certainly costly. We do the calculations and draw up an account for payment. But at a certain stage, apparently, there is insufficient insistence on the payment of compensation. I suppose if our state organs took a firmer stance on this, not so many people would be willing to commit violations. After all, intercepting every such flight costs the Air Defense Forces tens of millions of rubles. [interview ends] [Ivanov] So the Air Defense Forces have shown that nobody can violate Russia's air borders with impunity. Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev has given a high appraisal of their patrol crews' actions.
