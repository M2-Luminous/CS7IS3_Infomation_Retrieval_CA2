It was explained that work incentives were first introduced in selected sectors such as tourism, ports, repairs, electric plants, mining, and the sugar industry to mention a few examples. Given the shortage of resources, the idea of rewarding a greater number of sectors with larger incentives is out of the question. If the resources were available, however, it would be absurd to reward every worker equally regardless of their labor contributions. Although this type of argument is strong enough to not require further explanation, it is logical that those who endure daily limitations will take longer to understand this fail-safe policy. Independent of the necessary understanding of the people, however, we need to listen to these who call for modest incentives at nonproduction workplaces that do not accrue hard currency. The idea of rewarding the most efficient workers at facilities that are not economically essential has merit if, from a realistic point of view, we acknowledge that some reward or modest services can also play a role while we wait for greater incentives. It would be good to adopt such a policy in budgeted facilities on the basis of local or provincial initiatives resulting in modest incentives -- given their actual value -- to meet a number of current expectations. A center not related to production praiseworthy for its efficiency, where management and the union arranges for its workers and their relatives services such as shoe and home appliance repairs, a special lunch, or reservations at a leisure camp, will thereby motivate workers demoralized by the loss of their purchasing power. Other motivational formulas could stem from initiatives from sectors with unique characteristics such as health and education, where it is imperative to find mechanisms to reduce the personnel exodus. Management and the unions face an unexplored path they must now undertake. The effort, however, will be worth its while if simple incentive formulas, which do not burden the payroll budget, are found.
