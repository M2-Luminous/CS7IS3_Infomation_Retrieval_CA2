"In Kinshasa, there is more criticism of Monsengwo than Mobutu. Children throw stones at his black limousine." Olenghankoy is one of the leaders of a new generation of the Zairian opposition--"young people who owe nothing to Mobutu," as he puts it. Olenghankoy is also one of the people behind the "dead city" protest action, with which the Sacred Union based round Tshisekedi occasionally paralyzes Kinshasa. In addition, Olenghankoy was one of the opposition negotiators in the talks held at the end of last year and the start of this year with Mobutu supporters on a new attempt at cohabitation. That agreement was immediately misused by the Mobutu camp, even though it had not even been ratified by the agreed procedure. The High Council of the Republic, which took over the role of provisional parliament from the National Conference, was dissolved at the end of January and merged with the rival Mobutu parliament to form a broader, new High Council. The Tshisekedi supporters protest against what they see as this illegal course of affairs, but they are taking part in the discussions in the new council. They say an empty chair policy would be counterproductive. Now, Archbishop Monsengwo is the opposition's bogeyman. "Two Wednesdays ago, he called together the old High Council, in his capacity as its president," Olenghankoy said. "He told us two things. First, if we did not vote for the dissolution and expansion of the parliament that Wednesday, then there would be an armed intervention by Mobutu and we, members of the High Council, would be on welfare. Second, he presented us with a list of the salaries to be paid in the expanded High Council. Mobutu had agreed to a wage of $3,000 a month for every member. Imagine: People who have never seen $100 in their life are suddenly promised $3,000 a month. A majority voted for the dissolution of the old Council in a euphoric mood. Monsengwo knows the weak spots of the Zairian politicians: Everyone is hungry and therefore virtually everybody is for sale." The presidential term of office is over And now? According to the Mobutu camp, the expanded council must quickly appoint a new prime minister and, for the president, that cannot be Tshisekedi. "Tshisekedi is the only leader to be elected legitimately since Patrice Lumumba," Olenghankoy said. "He was appointed leader of the government after debate in the National Conference and that decision was never undone by the High Council. Mobutu has no claim on legitimacy whatsoever: His former presidential term of office ended long ago. Tshisekedi does not have to be elected again. His position is not empty. The new High Council just has to reconfirm its confidence in Tshisekedi and his government on the basis of normal parliamentary rules." If the politicians can be bought so easily, by Mobutu or Monsengwo, then it should be impossible to achieve a majority for Tshisekedi? "No," Olenghankoy said, "the prime minister must come from the opposition, according to the agreement. And the opposition still has a majority in the expanded High Council, which now has 784 members. Mobutu has already tried everything to break that majority, first in the National Conference and then in the High Council. But every time it really came down to it, he never succeeded in finding a majority against Tshisekedi. Even those who are said to be behind Mobutu only do so because of the money." They call that "the politics of the stomach." Such politics mean that it is difficult to see who is in the opposition and who is not. "The real members of the opposition are those who opposed the dictatorship in the years when the great majority of our politicians still thought that Mobutuism would never end," Olenghankoy said. "Afterwards innumerable Mobutu supporters have fled to the opposition -- while maintaining their corrupt way of life, because it has become second nature to them. For me, they are not really members of the opposition. And we fully understand that many people round Tshisekedi continue to work for Mobutu. But ultimately they will not dare to oppose Tshisekedi. Because later the people will judge them in elections." In Kinshasa, Olenghankoy himself once went to disturb a nighttime rendezvous between Monsengwo and a number of former barons of the regime who called themselves members of the opposition by day and conspired against Tshisekedi by night. Wriggling He has unshakeable confidence in final victory. "The people want peace and democracy, and the people will in the end win the struggle against those who work for the status quo in Zaire," Olenghankoy said. "And the people are behind Tshisekedi. Our most recent `dead city' protest in Kinshasa was a referendum for Tshisekedi. Monsengwo can carry out his Vatican diplomacy, the monseigneur can bargain and maneuver, but even he cannot beat the people. Now even children understand that Monsengwo is wriggling, and that he is disappointing the original faith of the people." "In popular districts there is so much criticism of him that a support committee has been set up for the archbishop," Olenghankoy said. "It includes Karl-I-Bond -- who, when he was still in the opposition, was Monsengwo's greatest opponent. Who else is in that support committee? Every one of them has served Mobutu: People who were indicted by name in the National Conference's reports on the dishonestly acquired goods and political assassinations. How can a priest, a representative of god on Earth, permit himself to be supported by corrupt brutes? And why do they support him? Because Monsengwo prevented the National Conference from drawing conclusions from these reports about corruption and repression. Within that committee, forces are working together which should be opposed to one another like day and night." Mobutuism Once Olenghankoy got started, his tirade against Monsengwo would not stop. "He always travels and acts alone," he said, "without answering to the bodies of which he was or is president, for the last three years. Nobody knows who he speaks to or what about." Last week Monsengwo wrote a letter to the troika -- the United States, France, and Belgium -- who together are closely observing the developments in Zaire. They then confirmed their unconditional faith in him, despite the opposition in the Tshisekedi camp to the dissolution of the old High Council. "Monsengwo is still managing to prevent our partners from intervening resolutely," Olenghankoy said. "He is deluding them that he is following a third way between Mobutu and Tshisekedi, and that this way will ensure peace. In Zaire, no one believes him any longer." Olenghankoy also denied that the troika was slowly distancing itself from Tshisekedi. He has just returned from the United States, where he had contacts at the very highest level. "And the Americans continue to adopt a very strong position against Mobutu," he said. "In their analyses they continue to attach great importance to Zaire, which is the richest country in Africa. The Americans know that Mobutu is no longer safeguarding their interests, on the contrary, he is damaging them." "Mobutuism is like a virus which is spreading very rapidly," Olenghankoy said. "Now it has reached other parts of Africa. It kills its victims quickly and on a massive scale -- quicker than AIDS. Mobutu is creating trouble spots elsewhere in Africa, to distract the world's attention from himself. The Americans realize that. And the French also know that Mobutu is in the way of their interests. We cannot complain at all about Belgium: This country is fully backing up its conviction that Zaire must free itself from Mobutu." Sacred belief All good and well, Monsengwo can do nothing right -- but he does not have an army at his disposal like Mobutu. And that army is keeping Mobutu in power. Right? Olenghankoy laughs off that line of reasoning. "To tell the truth," he said, "in the past Mobutu could never count on his army. And now he can count on it even less. He has no more than a small unit armed to the teeth. The DSP [Special Presidential Division] is not behind the president, in contrast to what people believe here. However, there is a small unit in the DSP, called the dragons: They are Mobutu's nephews, uncles and close relatives. Virtually all the other parts of the army have been disarmed by Mobutu." "The Zairian army is the most ridiculous in the world -- and the impoverished military understands that," Olenghankoy said. "It is they who distribute our pamphlets. Nor are the security services undivided supporters of the president. They pass their information on to us as quickly as they pass it on to him. We have never played with the idea of taking power by force, we have chosen peaceful methods, but if the day comes when the people revolts -- and that day is approaching -- then it will be clear that Mobutu's army is useless. Even now he is virtually in exile in his own country: He is hiding in his native village, Gbadolite." This sacred belief in the will of the people can surprise someone observing from a distance. Haven't the Zairians tolerated Mobutu for 30 years? And why should the starving people be more resistant to the 'politics of the stomach' than the politicians? "The people have a far more straightforward way of thinking than the politicians," Olenghankoy said. "Politics has become business, a form of prostitution: Many people are hoping to make their fortune by choosing for or against Mobutu. That is commerce. But the mass of the people cannot be bought off. In the popular neighborhoods there is an expression which is frequently heard: Dying is nothing, but living under Mobutuism is to die every day."
