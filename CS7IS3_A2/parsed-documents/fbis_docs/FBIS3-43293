The party says in a statement that APLA and Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] members who seek asylum in Transkei after committing acts of terror should be arrested by the South African Police. The party denounced negotiations between the government and the ANC [African National Congress] and PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] and called for action against the two organizations. In a separate statement the CP appealed to whites to stop using trains as, according to it, the security situation on the railways has deteriorated to such an extent that whites are no longer safe while using the service. The CP's chief spokesman on transport, Mr. Joseph Chiole, said that whites who were compelled to use rail transport should arm themselves and not travel alone.
