This explains why Max van der Stoel, CSCE high commissioner for minorities, is visiting Ukraine for the third time in a month and a half. After returning from Crimea, he gave a news conference that was devoted to the results of his visit to Ukraine. Max van der Stoel acquainted the Ukrainian and foreign journalists with the program of his visit. Most important were meetings with senior officials of Ukraine and Crimea. The CSCE high commissioner had an hour long conversation with Ukraine's president and twice met Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Zhulynskyy. In Kiev, he had talks with Oleksandr Yemets [minister for nationalities and migration], Anatoliy Zlenko [minister for foreign affairs], and Roman Shpek [minister of the economy]. In Crimea, van der Stoel met President Yuriy Meshkov, Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov, and Crimean Supreme Council Chairman Serhiy Tsekov. The important guest's visit to Simferopol coincided with the consultations on the situation in Crimea between the parliamentary delegation of Ukraine, headed by Mr. Butkevych, and the delegation of the Republic of Crimea. The main conclusions drawn by the CSCE high commissioner for minorities were that both sides had taken part in the talks. Max Van der Stoel stressed, however, that, in addition to discussions at the level of parliamentary delegations, talks at the level of the governments of Ukraine and Crimea would not hurt. It is important to the high commissioner that the governments of Ukraine and Crimea confirm their wish to avoid incidents. The aim of van der Stoel's mission was to find ways for the CSCE to contribute to maintaining peace and stability in the region. According to the high commissioner, his organization is ready to extend a helping hand in resolving the problems that have arisen between Ukraine and its autonomy. Van der Stoel refused to comment on exactly what sort of help this should be, but noted that he would submit his conclusions to the participants of the consultation of CSCE countries in Prague on 13 June. He believes the Crimean issue to be a domestic conflict between Ukraine and Crimea. Regarding the influence of Russia, which is a CSCE member, on the Crimean issue, it should be guided in its actions, like all countries, by the main principle of the inviolability of borders and respect for the territorial integrity of states. At the news conference, van der Stoel reported to the press the decision by the CSCE standing committee of (?28) May. The standing committee, a body representing 53 countries of the world, expressed concern at the development of events in the Republic of Crimea because they run counter to the basic principles of the CSCE. The last question at the news conference concerned the latest "Ostankino" "sensation" regarding the presence of 120 Ukrainian paratroopers in Belbek. "I did not inspect the territory of Crimea, van der Stoel said, but everything I saw refutes these wild rumors. The situation in Crimea looks very calm."
