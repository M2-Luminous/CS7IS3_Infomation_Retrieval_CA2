FR940128-2-00212 FR940128-2-00137 [Docket No. 030&hyph;09792, License No. 13&hyph;02752&hyph;08 EA 93&hyph;111] Indiana University School of Medicine; Indianapolis, IN; Order Imposing Civil Monetary Penalty I Indiana University School of Medicine (licensee) is the holder of Byproduct Material License No. 13&hyph;02752&hyph;08 issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) on September 26, 1973. The license was amended in its entirety on October 6, 1989, and is due to expire on November 30, 1994. The license was most recently amended on April 9, 1992. The license authorizes the licensee to possess Cobalt-60 sealed teletherapy sources for medical use described in 10 CFR 35.600 and for irradiation of blood and blood products in accordance with the conditions specified therein. II An inspection of the licensee's activities was conducted on December 14, 1992, through January 13, 1993. The results of this inspection indicated that the licensee had not conducted its activities in full compliance with NRC requirements. A written Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) was served upon the licensee by letter dated October 7, 1993. The Notice states the nature of the violation, the provisions of the NRC's requirements that the licensee had violated, and the amount of the civil penalty proposed for the violation. The licensee responded to the Notice by a letter dated October 29, 1993. In its response, the licensee disputes the validity of the cited violation. Further, the licensee takes exception to the NRC Staff's application of the civil penalty adjustment factors in the areas of identification and licensee performance. III After consideration of the licensee's response and the statements of fact, explanation, and argument for mitigation contained therein, the NRC staff has determined, as set forth in the Appendix to this Order, that the violation occurred as stated and that the penalty proposed for the violation designated in the Notice should be imposed. IV In view of the foregoing and pursuant to section 234 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (Act), 42 U.S.C. 2282, and 10 CFR 2.205, It is hereby ordered that: The licensee pay a civil penalty in the amount of $5,000 within 30 days of the date of this Order, by check, draft, money order, or electronic transfer, payable to the Treasurer of the United States and mailed to the Director, Office of the Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Document Control Desk, Washington, DC 20555. V The Licensee may request a hearing within 30 days of the date of this Order. A request for a hearing should be clearly marked as a ``Request for an Enforcement Hearing'' and shall be addressed to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Document Control Desk, Washington, DC 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address and to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region III, 801 Warrenville Road, Lisle, Illinois 60532&hyph;4351 If a hearing is requested, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of the hearing. If the licensee fails to request a hearing within 30 days of the date of this Order, the provisions of this Order shall be effective without further proceedings. If payment has not been made by that time, the matter may be referred to the Attorney General for collection. In the event the licensee requests a hearing as provided above, the issues to be considered at such hearing shall be: (a) Whether the licensee was in violation of the Commission's requirements as set forth in the Notice referenced in Section II above, and (b) Whether, on the basis of such violation, this order should be sustained. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 18th day of January 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. James Lieberman, Director Office of Enforcement.
