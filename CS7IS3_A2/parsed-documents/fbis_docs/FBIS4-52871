The analyst says: Japan has never let a chance pass by without saying the production and stockpile of a large quantity of plutonium in the country were for "a peaceful purpose" and it would not lead to the conversion of Japan into a nuclear power. It has also boastfully claimed that it is "a model" in accepting inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. But it was fully revealed this time that all this was a lie. The analyst continues: Pretending to open to the public the amount of stockpiled plutonium, Japan has concealed a part of it. This proves that it has invariably stepped up the design to turn itself into a nuclear power under the cloak of "a peaceful purpose." Broad public circles of the world have considered that Japan's stockpile of plutonium more than necessary is related to its design to become a nuclear power. The Japanese authorities are now clamouring about "investigation" and "removal of misgivings." This is, however, a belated excuse. Japan's nuclear design remains unchanged. It is racing headlong toward nuclear armament. Its nuclear armament poses a serious threat to the peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world.
