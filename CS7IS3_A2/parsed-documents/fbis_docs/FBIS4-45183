In addition, Benitez Trevino is reviewing the relationship of this corps with other agencies in an effort to make it more efficient and to prevent illegal actions. Five commanders have been discharged, and the files of the PJF's approximately 2,000 agents, all of whom will undergo drug testing, will be carefully reviewed. If evidence of irregular or criminal conduct is established, they will be discharged and legal action will be taken against them. These actions are being viewed as a response to remarks by former Attorney General Diego Valades Rios, who has claimed that whenever PJF agents are discharged it is because they have drug abuse problems or are connected with drug traffickers. The PGR [Attorney General's Office], meanwhile, indicated that the measures correspond to the need to have a single command in the PJF. Regarding the dismantling of the so-called "special groups," the PGR said this action was prompted by "special group" investigations that fell outside the Judicial Police General Directorate's jurisdiction and proved detrimental to citizens. Commenting on the elimination of the General Operations Coordinating Office, which violated PGR regulations, was allegedly conducting investigations, and had command over the PJF agents. [sentence as published] In light of this, Commanders Juventino Sanchez Gaytan, Agustin Montiel Lopez, Saul Salvatierra Garcia, Carlos Venegas Contreras, and Luis Alberto Zetina Suarez were discharged. Meanwhile, Attorney General Benitez Trevino has also ordered a rigorous review of the condition and status of the approximately 2,000 PJF agents nationwide and evaluations of their individual performances in an effort to detect "bad" agents. If this review turns up evidence of any agent being involved in irregularities or illegal actions, appropriate administrative measures will be adopted and legal action will be taken. A review of of personnel will also be conducted to detect "reliable" or "commissoned" individuals, who are also known as "godmothers"--people who do not belong to the PJF but perform actions in support of the police corps. Those who have usurped powers, as well as the commanders and agents who have helped them do so, will be prosecuted.
