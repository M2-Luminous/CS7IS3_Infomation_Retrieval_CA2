FBIS4-34937 "drlat123_f_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-123 Daily Report 24 Jun 1994 CENTRAL AMERICA El Salvador `Terrorist' Plot Against Officials Revealed `Terrorist' Plot Against Officials Revealed PA2606193694 San Salvador EL DIARIO DE HOY in Spanish 24 Jun 94 p 3 PA2606193694 San Salvador EL DIARIO DE HOY Spanish BFN [Text] Police intelligence sources yesterday revealed the existence of a terrorist plot to justify attacks against members of the cabinet, individuals, and businesses as reprisals for the death threats politically irrelevant individuals are allegedly receiving. They added those anonymously hiding behind the FRS [Salvadoran Revolutionary Front] are trying to effect an apparent "emotional outburst" against the individuals who have been accused in the past of being the possible perpetrators of violent incidents. The sources stated it was known since early last week a communique reportedly from the self-styled FRS would be released. The FRS "condemns the threats against the human rights ombudsman, Monsignor Arturo Rivera y Damas, the Society of Jesus, and the National Judiciary Council" by a so-called "Domingo Monterrosa Command." The communique added it declared the members of the Calderon cabinet, as well as this newspaper's staff and installations, to be "military objectives" if any attack is executed against those who have received threats. Intelligence sources have stated they had no prior knowledge of any group named Domingo Monterrosa, which only leftist chieftains mention, as they did with another ghost group they have called the "Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez Brigade," whose alleged members nobody has ever seen. The plot, according to the sources, is clearly similar to the one the former FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] guerrillas used during the years of terror, when they took advantage of internal purges or the elimination of "expendable" or irrelevant figures to justify the selective murders of businessmen and democratically-minded ideologues. The pattern, they said, greatly resembles the events following the bomb blast at the Fenastras [Salvadoran Workers National Union Federation] building in October 1989, an explosion which days later led to the offensive of late November of that year. The sources added the impact that the individuals hiding behind the FRS hope to obtain is an "emotional outburst" against those had been previously accused of incidents that led to violence. EL DIARIO DE HOY was the target of an incendiary attack on 1 November 1993, following a tirade by FMLN chieftain Joaquin Villalobos during the funeral of Heleno Castro Guevara, alias "Commander Carmelo." On that occasion, Villalobos accused the newspaper's editor of being the spokesman for the murderers of Castro Guevara, who, it was reported days later, was killed during an unpremeditated squabble prompted by a traffic accident. On that occasion, the international community rejected Villalobos' attacks when the IAPA [Inter-American Press Association] issued a statement demanding the FMLN "abstain from attacking EL DIARIO DE HOY with words or deeds, urging this group to use the channels of the existent Salvadoran democratic system to peacefully express their own viewpoints."
