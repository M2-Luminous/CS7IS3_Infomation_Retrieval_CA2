The statement added that Sudan, which became an independent state on 1 January 1956, is also capable of defeating the forces of darkness, regaining its freedom, and rebuilding a democratic state. The statement noted that the 38th anniversary of independence comes at a time when there is a 60-percent shortage of grain in the country, something that is subjecting more than 10 million Sudanese to the threat of death from starvation. Furthermore, the lives of millions of Sudanese in the north and central part of the country are threatened by fatal epidemics, including malaria. The statement pointed out that this year's independence celebration must be an occasion for the grouping to ponder its future steps in a spirit of solidarity and unity to regain the freedom of Sudan.
