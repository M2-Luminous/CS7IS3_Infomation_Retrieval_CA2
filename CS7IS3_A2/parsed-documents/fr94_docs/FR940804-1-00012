FR940804-1-00012 FR940804-1-00004 Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no circumstances shall the value of production, for royalty purposes, be less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for lease production, less applicable allowances determined pursuant to this subpart. (b) The value of production will be the higher of the major portion value and the otherwise applicable value. This provision is contained in valuation regulations at 30 CFR 206.102(a)(2)(i), 206.152(a)(3)(i), and 206.153(a)(3)(i), which state: For any Indian leases which provide that the Secretary may consider the highest price paid or offered for a major portion of production (major portion) in determining value for royalty purposes, if data are available to compute a major portion, MMS will, where practicable, compare the value determined in accordance with this section with the major portion. The value to be used in determining the value of production, for royalty purposes, shall be the higher of those two values. (c) The value of production will be the greater of (1) the combined value, for royalty purposes, of the residue gas and gas plant products resulting from processing the gas, or (2) the value, for royalty purposes, of the gas prior to processing determined in accordance with 30 CFR §§206.152 and 206.155. III. Discussion The Secretary's responsibility to determine value for royalty purposes of production from Indian lands has not changed, although the industry and marketplace have changed dramatically over the years. One of the objectives MMS hopes to achieve is to develop a set of regulations to permit the Secretary to discharge this responsibility in an environment of continuing and accelerating change in the industry and the marketplace. The trust responsibility of the Secretary and the changing marketplace require that the Secretary develop flexible valuation methodologies for Indian production that can be complied with accuracy and on time. MMS seeks to improve several areas of Indian gas valuation including: major portion analysis, accounting for comparison (dual accounting), and Percentage-of-Proceeds (POP) contracts. Following is a discussion of each of these areas. (a) Major Portion Value Section 3(c) of most Indian leases provides that value may be based on the highest price paid or offered for a major portion of oil or gas or similar substances. Many lessees have stated that there are difficulties encountered in complying with major portion valuation requirements and the timeliness of major portion analyses performed by MMS. Indian mineral owners assert the median pricing methodology in the present regulations does not always achieve the highest price paid for a major portion of production provided by the lease terms. Since the Secretary has considerable discretion in establishing value for royalty purposes, the Secretary has been urged to be more flexible in establishing major portion methodologies. (b) Dual Accounting Section 3(c) of most Indian leases provides for ``dual accounting''_the requirement to pay royalties on the greater of the combined value of the residue gas and plant products resulting from processing the gas or the value of the gas prior to processing. Dual accounting is required whether gas is sold prior to processing or after processing. In either case, the lessees may have difficulty in gathering the data necessary to comply, which delays the proper payment of royalties to the Indian lessors. Improvement in the regulations that will permit lessees to timely and completely comply with the lease's dual accounting requirement is desirable. (c) Percentage-of-Proceeds (POP) Contracts This class of contracts for the sale of gas from Indian leases presents a different problem in determining value for royalty purposes. Under a POP contract, the seller is paid based upon a value determined after processing. As the name given to this class of contract suggests, the seller is paid an agreed-upon percentage of the purchaser's proceeds from the sale of residue gas and usually a different and much smaller percentage of the proceeds from the sale of gas plant products. Lessees have objected to the dual accounting requirement for gas sold pursuant to a POP contract because of a lack of wellhead sales. Regulations that permit lessees to timely and accurately comply with POP contract valuation requirements are desirable.
