Answer: A policy which is a disgrace to France. Let us review the facts. Sarajevo. General Cot, like all his predecessors, denounces the absurd conditions imposed on the troops he commands and whose dedication is nothing short of admirable. He has barely finished speaking when we -- government included -- unanimously proclaim our approval and our hope that his urgent warning will precipitate the Security Council meeting which will make the required decisions. What happens instead? Not only is the general prematurely discharged by the United Nations, but we hear that the government, which lauded him so last week, has agreed to the disciplinary measure this week! France keeps its mouth shut. Government Decisions Taiwan. A communique written in Beijing and endorsed in Paris tells us that France purely and simply aligns itself on mainland China's position and foregoes the relationship it had begun to establish with Taiwan. Forgotten, the Tiananmen massacre; forgotten, the human rights violations; forgotten, the fact that all other countries have managed to establish balanced relations both with Beijing and Taipei. The question would simply be to let it be known that under no circumstances would France condone any attempt from China to forcibly regain control of Taiwan, and that it is therefore committed to fulfilling the island's military needs. But China demands that France -- and only France -- give it its undivided attention. And France complies. Bern. Two Iranians facing murder charges in Geneva have sought refuge in France. Switzerland asks that they be extradited. The French Government quietly flies them off to Tehran. No explanation given. Not a word to the opposition, even though it was ready to listen to the language of national interest. Not a word to Switzerland, even though it was ready to listen to the voice of reason. But instead, a shady deal: "Free our executioners, and there will be no bombing in your country." Such a deal -- which is what France's friends are suspecting may have taken place -- is not only shameful, it is also ineffective. A deal with terrorists is always a fool's deal. I do hope that this is not what happened in this case, but the government has done everything it could to give substance to this accusation, which foreign newspapers do not hesitate to relay. France spreads dismay. In all three cases, the decisions were made exclusively by the government. In all three cases, we made quite a poor show of ourselves with the whole world watching. Spineless diplomacy hurts France's image. And to think that we owe it all to self-styled spiritual heirs of De Gaulle...!
