The UN Security Council was preparing meanwhile to vote on a controversial French proposal to deploy up to 2,000 troops and lead an operation to protect civilians from the ethnic bloodbath in the central African country. Sarkozy said the operation would have "a maximum duration of two months" and would entail "comings and goings from the place where our soldiers will be posted." A small contingent of French elite troops has gone to Goma in Zaire close to Rwanda's northeastern border on an evaluation mission and military sources said that Bangui, capital of the Central African Republic, would be the "operational base." Sarkozy said the views expressed in Wednesday's meeting formed a "broad general consensus and consisted in explaining the essentially humanitarian reasons for intervention in Rwanda." Mitterrand met with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, Defense Minister Francois Leotard and Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin, the chief of general staff Admiral Jacques Lanxade and the president's personal military aide, General Jean Quesnot. Sarkozy denied speculation that there has been disagreement among top French leaders on the planned intervention, which has brought warnings that it would be considered an invasion by Rwanda's mainly Tutsi rebels and only lukewarm support from the international community. "I deny that totally," he said. "An operation of this kind can only be carried out amid total understanding." In another development, a foreign ministry spokesman said representatives of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) on Wednesday had "contacts" here with the French government, which they accuse of backing the Hutu majority regime in Rwanda and being indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis. "Contacts are continuing in Paris with RPF representatives," the spokesman Richard Duque said, but he gave no details. On Tuesday, a top RPF official, Jacques Bihozagara, called off a planned visit from Brussels to Paris, saying that he wanted to meet a "competent political decision-maker with regard to military intervention." Sarkozy said the government believed the RPF "cannot reproach us for saving members of a community they themselves belong to, or they will have to explain that to the international community." Balladur plans to address the French national assembly on Rwanda later Wednesday during the regular session of questions to the government.
