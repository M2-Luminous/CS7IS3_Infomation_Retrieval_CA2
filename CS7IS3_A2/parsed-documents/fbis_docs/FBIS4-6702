Security Council [UNSC] with Japan as a permanent member should reflect the world body's ability to resolve problems it will face in the next century, New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Don McKinnon said Thursday [21 April]. McKinnon, whose country currently chairs the Security Council, told a press conference in Tokyo that New Zealand supports Japan's bid to become a permanent Council member, but any decision on membership will have to wait at least two or three years. McKinnon, who is concurrently minister of foreign affairs and trade, said this is the time it will take for the U.N. to conduct a thorough debate on the issue, initiated by U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. "It is going to take a fair bit of tough debate," McKinnon said. "But more importantly, that is to ensure that if the changes do take place, they not only reflect 1994, 1995 and 1996, but hopefully through to the 21st century." McKinnon also said New Zealand believes the power of veto is "inappropriate" and any new permanent member should not be given veto powers. The five permanent Security council members are Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, which all have veto power. McKinnon said other countries being considered as candidates for permanent membership on the Council are Brazil, Canada, Germany, India, Nigeria and Turkey. "From a purely Asian-Pacific viewpoint, I am very much aware that of the permanent five members, four have Caucasian faces and only one has an Asian face," McKinnon said. "And that balance could easily be upset to the point where the Security Council possibly begins to lose credibility." "And the credibility of the Council is really the basis of this whole exercise." McKinnon said Japan's contribution to peacekeeping operations in Cambodia was "certainly a plus" in its bid for Council membership. The New Zealand deputy premier arrived in Japan on Tuesday for a three-day stay. During his stay he met with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, and International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai. McKinnon leaves Japan on Thursday for Washington.
