FR940224-2-00049 FR940224-2-00029 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;135&hyph;000] Texas Eastern Transmission Corp.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff February 17, 1994. Take notice that on February 14, 1994, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern), tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets: Proposed To Be Effective June 1, 1993 2nd Sub Original Sheet No. 634 Sub Original Sheet No. 636 Proposed To Be Effective October 1, 1993 Sub First Revised Sheet No. 633 Proposed To Be Effective October 3, 1993 1st Rev Second Revised Sheet No. 633 Proposed To Be Effective November 1, 1993 Sub Fourth Revised Sheet No. 633 Texas Eastern states that it is making the instant filing to clarify tariff inconsistencies called to Texas Eastern's attention by the Commission Staff in connection with a January 25, 1994, technical conference in Docket No. TM94&hyph;2&hyph;17. Staff indicated that Section 15.6(A) could be read as meaning that all Rate Schedule FT&hyph;1 services are subject to the ASA provision. Texas Eastern states that it is filing Sub Fourth Revised Sheet No. 633 to clarify that certain incremental services, including ITP, are not subject to the ASA provision and to further clarify the definition of ``Applicable Shrinkage Percentages''. Additionally, Staff pointed out that Section 15.6(A) listed Rate Schedules LLFT, LLIT, VKFT and VKIT, also incremental rate schedules, as ASA Rate Schedules in Section 15.6(A). Pursuant to Commission orders authorizing these services, Rate Schedules LLFT, LLIT, VKFT, and VKIT should be and were intended to be defined as Non-ASA Rate Schedules, as shown on currently effective Sheet No. 130 of Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1. Texas Eastern states that it is filing Sub First Revised Sheet No. 633 and 1st Rev Second Revised Sheet No. 633 to eliminate these Rate Schedules from the listing of ASA Rate Schedules. Such tariff sheets are to be effective October 1, 1993 and October 3, 1993, the effective dates of Rate Schedules LLFT and LLIT and VKFT and VKIT, respectively. Further, as Staff pointed out at the technical conference, the reference to ``ASA Reservation Charge Surcharge'' in Section 15.6(E) of Texas Eastern's tariff should read ``ASA Usage Surcharge.'' Texas Eastern states that it is filing Sub Original Sheet No. 636 to make this modification. In addition, Texas Eastern states that it is filing 2nd Sub Original Sheet No. 634 to correct an error in the page reference in Section 15.6(A)(2). Texas Eastern states that copies of the filing were served on firm customers of Texas Eastern and interested state commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before February 25, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
