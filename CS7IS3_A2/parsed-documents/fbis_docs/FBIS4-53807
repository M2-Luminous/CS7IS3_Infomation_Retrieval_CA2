This was a challenge which the Western nations must respond to positively, he said. "If they do not, and instead try to stem the flood tide, the challenge would turn into economic conflict and fragment the world into economic blocs -- the European Union, NAFTA and, perhaps, a new Asian bloc." In a keynote speech to open The Asia Society's international business conference at the Shangri-La Hotel last night, he said Asia's time had come. ASEAN, China, India, Vietnam, even Myanmar [Burma] were opening up their economies. As China pushed through its economic reforms while India and Vietnam revamped their hitherto closed state-run economies, their impact on the global market would change the pattern of world trade and investment. "As they grow, the pattern will change further. We will all have to adjust to their in creasing economic presence," he added. "Integrating these new giant producers into the world market is a major challenge." Unfortunately, the West was ambivalent about Asia, and some Western leaders, politicians, trade unionists and opinion-makers saw Asia's emergence as a threat rather than an opportunity. He said: "Attempts to check imports from low-wage countries, like the recent efforts to introduce social clauses on workers' rights and minimum wages into the GATT agenda, betray the West's fear of competition from Asia and its growing sense of economic insecurity. "These thinly-veiled protectionist measures are short-sighted. They show a misguided preoccupation with preserving low-value jobs when the West should be concentrating on creating high-value jobs." Mr. Goh said Western governments should resist changing the rules to curb Asia's growth. "There is no alternative but to compete if Western countries want to maintain their edge in living standards over Asia and other developing countries." Cheap imports from developing states did not cause the high unemployment problem in the West, he said, pointing out that Asia's economic emergence coincided with the prolonged recession in the industrialised countries. "The relentless shift to wards new technologies is the major reason why those with out skills are losing their jobs. This will continue even if borders are sealed. It explains why the West is experiencing economic growth without corresponding job creation." Mr. Goh said Western leaders must have the political will to overcome some "basic self-inflicted problems". Europe was burdened with costly welfare systems, he said. The labour markets in Europe had become too rigid, and laws inhibited rather than promoted growth. The bottom segment of workers in the United States and Europe were also under educated and under-trained. He said: "The West needs to solve its structural problems now, while it still has the trump card on technology and know-how. "If it does not strive to stay ahead, it will find that in another generation, even this competitive advantage may be lost. Asia will catch up fast with the West in levels of education and skills." He noted that Asia, with its growing affluence, was becoming a huge market for consumer goods, travel and other economic services. Asia had already overtaken Europe as the leading export market for the US, accounting for over a quarter of US exports by 1992, he said. By the end of the decade there would be some 400 million Asians with purchasing power equal to the average Westerner today. If, despite these benefits the West continued to see Asia as a threat and tried to slow its growth, both Asia and the West would lose. "If the West blocks the emerging Asian countries, especially China from world markets, it will force them to turn inward. They will be less open and be less co-operative internationally. "Their weaker economic growth would translate into a more aggressive and destabilising military posture because they would distrust the West. "The West will be threatened not merely by the loss of exports and slower domestic growth, but with global insecurity, including the risks of losing the assets it already has in Asia." There would be similar negative effects if the European Union looked only inward and the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) only southward, he warned. "If they do, Asians will have to organise themselves and trade increasingly among themselves. The region's diversity in natural resources, wage levels, skills and technology will allow for continued expansion of intra-regional trade and investment. "Asia has the capital. It saves more than the rest of the world. Its growth will be slowed, but it will not be stopped. An Asian trade bloc is not an option of choice. But it is a viable option. And sometime in the next century, Asia, by its sheer size, would shift the weight of global economic power from the West to the East." Whichever the scenario, he said, the West would have much to lose by not being a partner in Asia's growth. "An economically-powerful Asia which is not integrated with the rest of the world will be sullen and ready to challenge the West. "An Asia made prosperous with the help of the West will want that beneficial relationship to continue." Citing Germany and Japan as examples, Mr. Goh said the wisdom of America's policy to help its World War II adversaries after the war was obvious. They were now America's allies. "Likewise, the US can help China, India, Vietnam and the rest of Asia integrate with the West by investing in them, selling to them and buying from them," he said. "This will lead to an interdependent world economically and politically. When the West and Asia reinforce each other's strengths and take a stake in each other's stability, prosperity and future, it is a much better world."
