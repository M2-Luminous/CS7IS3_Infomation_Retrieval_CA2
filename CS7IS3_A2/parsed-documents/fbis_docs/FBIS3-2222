It is believed, however, that a few dissidents are still being detained. U.S. President Clinton has criticized the detention of Wei Jingsheng and has asserted that this incident will affect Sino-U.S. relations. U.S. Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher has denied that he would cancel his visit to China -- scheduled for this week -- because of this incident. [passage omitted] When interviewed by a MING PAO reporter yesterday, Wei Jingsheng's family said that he had phoned them yesterday afternoon to send his regards to his father and tell them that he himself was quite all right. Wei Jingsheng did not mention that he had been taken away by the police, and his father refused to further confirm his whereabouts. An assistant to Wei Jingsheng said that she received a phone call from Wei Jingsheng around 1200 yesterday. Wei was calling from somewhere in the suburbs of Beijing, asking her to convey the message that he had been released. Wei said that he would return to the downtown area in the evening after meeting with a friend at Changping in the northern suburbs of Beijing. Wei Jingsheng was one of the key figures in the 1978 Democracy Wall Movement. He was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment by the authorities and was released on parole in last September. He was taken away by three policemen from his younger brother's home in the morning of the day before yesterday. Since that time, his whereabouts have been unknown. During yesterday's phone call, Wei Jingsheng confirmed to his assistant that he had been officially "summoned, detained, and interrogated" by the public security sector. He was allowed to go home by the time he made the call, but he did not say whether his movements would be restricted, and he did not explain why he had been detained and interrogated. He just said that he had been treated well. Wei Jingsheng's family and his assistant believe that the purpose behind his detention and interrogation was to embarrass the United States, which has consistently been pressuring Beijing to release political prisoners. Meanwhile, Bao Ge, another dissident who has been calling for war reparations by Japan, was also released yesterday afternoon after being detained by the Shanghai public security bureau for 22 hours since Thursday [3 March] evening. Bao Ge said he had earlier planned to arrange for a meeting with visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Shattuck through a go- between, but he was detained before any arrangements were made. Although those who interrogated him did not mention Shattuck by name, they warned him not to meet with any foreign officials and strongly warned Bao Ge not to try to organize any demonstrations during the Japanese prime minister's visit to China. On the other hand, Shanghai dissident Yang Zhou, who had arranged an appointment with Shattuck through the U.S. Embassy [as published] in Shanghai, found his home under surveillance by some plain-clothes men the day before yesterday, and he dared not go out for the appointment. He was later taken away by some uniformed policemen and detained for 24 hours until his release yesterday. Yang Zhou said that, as far as he knows, at least five other dissidents were detained, specifically, Yang Jingheng, Dai Xuezhong, Bao Ge, Ma Wei, and Gong Xingnan. [passage omitted]
