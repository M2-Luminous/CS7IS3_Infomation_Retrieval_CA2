The excellency said that within the next two to three years we will need greatly increased foreign funds and more foreign experts to help bring Cambodia to normalcy and train its human resources. His excellency the state minister said that he wants a market economy, but at the same time the country also needs the monarchy.

His excellency the minister of the economy and finance also said that, in a country in which over 85 percent of the population are farmers, the land ownership law is very important and peasants should be encouraged to stay in their hometown rather than immigrate into the cities or be compelled by poverty to join the Khmer Rouge. His excellency stressed that efforts should be made to enable the people to stay in their hometowns and have enough to feed themselves in line with the goal to make Cambodia self-sufficient in food. He added that this is the best means of defense against the Khmer Rouge.
