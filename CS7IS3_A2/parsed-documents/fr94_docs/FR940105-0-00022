FR940105-0-00022 FR940105-0-00006 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;47&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8788; AD 94&hyph;01&hyph;06] Airworthiness Directives: Rockwell International, Collins Air Transport Division, Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II Processors AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that applies to certain Rockwell International, Collins Air Transport Division (Collins), Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) II processors that are installed on aircraft. This action requires replacing the existing TCAS II processor with a new processor that incorporates updated computer logic or reprogramming certain processors while they are still on board the aircraft. The development of candidate enhancements to TCAS II logic that improves its utility and increases its overall operational acceptance prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent collisions or near misses caused by incompatibility between the TCAS II processors and the current air traffic control system. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Service information that is referenced in this AD may be obtained from Rockwell International/Collins Air Transport Division, 400 Collins Road, NE; Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52498. Information that relates to this AD may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Roger A. Souter, Aerospace Engineer, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office, 1801 Airport Road, room 100, Mid-Continent Airport, Wichita, Kansas 67209; telephone (316) 946&hyph;4134; facsimile (316) 946&hyph;4407. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that applies to certain Collins TCAS II processors that are installed on aircraft was published in the Federal Register on September 9, 1993 (58 FR 47409). The action proposed to require (1) removing from service all processors that do not have computer logic ``Change 6.04A'' incorporated; and (2) mandatory incorporation of ``Change 6.04A'' into the TCAS II computer system. The affected TCAS II processors are not designed for a specific aircraft type. The Collins TCAS II processors are installed on, but not limited to the following:
