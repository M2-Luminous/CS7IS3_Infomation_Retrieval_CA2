"Cooperate." This is the ever recurrent theme of the white paper on defense, the hobby horse of politicians. If you run out of funds to cover your needs, cooperate, they declare to both the military and industry, adding that, as a bonus, it will contribute to the establishment of a joint European defense structure. This is more easily said than done. The most recent and spectacular cooperation program (40 million French francs [Fr] committed by France over 10 years) is suffering, like a caricature, from all the shortcomings that can affect international projects. True, it brings together no less than the Royal Navy, French Navy, and the Italian Navy for the joint development of large antiaircraft frigates. The program is called Horizon, but its skyline is low because of the successive storms. It came into being following Margaret Thatcher's decision, five years ago to back out of the program under which seven NATO countries were building a frigate that was to resemble a veritable tower of Babel. The new program, however, is not benefiting from the reduction in partners to three, because, of course, they are all expressing different needs. The negotiations between the industrial partners, taking place one month in Paris, then in Glasgow, then in Rome, resemble a big poker game, where each player believes he knows everything and that the status quo should last. None of the partners want to release any know-how, and each partner is trying to recuperate the maximum number of jobs. In this cooperative project, three is definitely a crowd or, in the words of Jean-Paul Sartre, "Hell is someone else." The distribution of the work has rapidly become a bone of contention. "We have three or four times the number of frigates to replace than the French or the Italians and must, therefore, carry more weight in the repartition of the workload," say the British. "False, you will never replace all of your old antiaircraft frigates," reply the French, adding that the current discussions only relate to a first lot of three frigates anyway.... Despite this, they continue to take note of all of the declarations made in the House of Commons regarding the real needs of the Royal Navy. Other questions include: If each country provides one-third of the financing, should it automatically benefit from 33 percent of the industrial workload, or should the best economic solutions be sought without worrying about the nationality of the suppliers? "We agree with the latter solution, but with a ceiling fixed in advance, for example, at 40 percent for the country with the best proposals," say the French, "and without our losing ground in any of our specialities, because we need to build other boats," adds the French team leader Michel Gevrey of DCN [Naval Contructions Directorate] International. Reassured by these demands, French engineers have no objection to dividing up the frigate into 30 or so pieces, each with its own prime contractor, provided that the two other partners are present as assistants. We are a long way here from the naval Airbus! However, the battles are likely to be the hardest with regard to the definition of the antiaircraft defense systems, which are the frigates' raison d'etre in the first place. Each frigate will be equipped with almost Fr3 billion worth of electronic equipment and is destined to carry the Aster antiaircraft missile developed by the French company Aerospatiale and the Italian company Alenia. With only slightly different needs, the two partners were able to subcontract the workload easily: to the French Thomson, the Arabel radar designed to guide the short-range Aster-15 missiles; and to the Italian Alenia the Empar radar that will guide the longer-range Aster 30 missile. The British, however, want a more sophisticated radar, of British design of course. The problem is that the radar in question, the British Mesar, only exists on paper. "If the British Navy makes a point of developing the Mesar, it will mean at least a five-year delay for everyone involved," fulminated Enrico Gimelli, the managing director of Alenia, last week. Within a month, the 60 engineers from the three countries will have to find a compromise in the Rome-based joint program office led by the Frenchman Herve Guillou. If not the whole program could be put into jeopardy. A cloudy Horizon indeed.
