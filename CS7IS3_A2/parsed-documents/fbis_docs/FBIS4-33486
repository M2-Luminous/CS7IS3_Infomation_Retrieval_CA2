One of the expelled Iranians, Reza Payami, said: The reason for expelling this group still has not been announced by the Cyprus police. He said their expulsion was likely related to a theft that took place two weeks ago at a household appliances store. Another of the individuals expelled said without giving his name: I was arrested by the Larnaca police as soon as I reached the airport. He also claimed that the airport police tried in various ways to take the $1,800 he had away from him. He said that he was forced to sell some of his household furnishings to make his trip to Cyprus possible. A number of these expelled Iranians, citing deception or extortion of Iranians seeking work in Cyprus, asked Iran's embassies to cooperate with Iranians seeking work in various countries.
