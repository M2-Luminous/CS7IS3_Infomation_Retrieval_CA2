They launched fierce attacks yesterday, especially on the Mount Ozren and Vozuca battlefields, using all types of heavy artillery. Here is a report from the Third Corps press center: [Unidentified correspondent] Dozens of shells hit Hajdarevici, (Brasnevine), Livade, and Kamenica, and hundreds of large caliber shells were fired on the defense lines along the entire front line. The Third Corps responded to these attacks, so the fighting around Vozuca raged all day yesterday. In addition to frenzied artillery attacks, the chetniks launched several unsuccessful infantry attacks in which they suffered the largest losses so far. We estimate that several dozen of the aggressor's dead soldiers remained in the no-man's-land between the front lines. Many of their wounded were abandoned during the disorderly retreat. The huge losses incurred by the chetniks during their attempts to capture strategic locations around Zavidovici, the aim of their offensive, are the reason for the daily calls for reinforcements. In addition to the attacks on the Vozuca front, chetniks were also active on the Celic battlefield, where they stepped up provocations and occasionally opened fire from 82-mm mortars. The situation was similar in the Tesanj area, the free territories around Teslic, and Doboj, where the aggressor used infantry weapons and a (?D-1) tank to shell Kalosevici.
