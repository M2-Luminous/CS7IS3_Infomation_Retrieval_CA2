So strong was our fascination with the neighboring country during the past three years that in the heat of "passion" both inadequate measures and abnormal contracts piled up. People closed their eyes to quality and to strangeness in the conduct of the economic partners, and so on, and so forth. In this spirit, A. Levintal, chairman of the Committee for Economic Policy of the administration of the kray, opened the session of the regular Council on Foreign Economic Relations. The mutual cooling-off manifests itself extremely clearly. As the chief of the Amur River Steamship Line, A. Sukhov, informed the assembled, no one at the present time concludes contracts for the transportation of cargo to the Chinese or to our side with the steamship line; all the same, there are no cargoes in the port. And the point is not that it is still early--last year at this time there was no getting rid of businessmen. Automobile crossings in Pokrovka, near Bikin, and in Kazakevichev also have not produced the expected effect. Another symptom is the reduction in the rate of registration of joint enterprises with China. As the chief of the Department for Foreign Economic Relations of the administration, N. Pisarenko, reported to the assembled, there is a trend on the part of our neighbors to create their own enterprises 100 percent in the territory of the kray. According to information of the Khabarovsk City Service for Foreign Economic Relations, this is done for the purpose of the further creation of joint enterprises on the part of the Third World--Southeast Asia. Among the objective manifestations of the "fall of temperature" one can also include the toughening of the passport and visa procedure, the entry from one country to the other, and the prohibition by our governor of the registration of joint ventures in apartment houses. There are, of course, many reasons for the mutual disappointment. We have stuffed ourselves with Chinese consumer goods not of the best quality and we prefer the goods of other countries, even if more expensive, but better. The same with food projects, with the exception perhaps of noodles, apples, and sugar. The businessmen wore themselves out "beating" each other over the fulfillment of contracts, both in hard currency and in barter. Out of 193 Russian-Chinese joint ventures registered as of 1 April of this year (this is 43 percent of their total number in the kray), only a handful are engaged in production. Correspondingly, the volume of investments in our economy in this sector is insignificantly small. The Chinese partners contribute to the charter fund the funds they have gained in the kray from the sale of their products. Not to speak of the fact that statistics and the tax organs not cannot even find the mass of the joint ventures: People change their address and do not notify anyone. Many reproaches were expressed that were aimed at the practice of barter contracts, which are used to lower the cost of the deal and the foreign exchange enrichment of the leaders of the firms. Great uneasiness is also called forth by the massive export of foreign exchange from Russia by Chinese businessmen and speculators. As a countermeasure, it was proposed to establish foreign exchange taxation at the border (something like the tax on profits), a foreign currency duty for trading in markets, and so on. But these are already details. What awaits us on the plane of principles? At the session it was noted that the government of the PRC has instructed Chinese entrepreneurs to increase the quality of their products to make them competitive in the Russian market. There is a decision to reform the structures of the companies involved in foreign economic relations and to decrease their number. Still another interesting step: Beginning in 1994, it turns out, China is introducing the licensing of import into the country of ferrous metallurgy products, and this is the basic item of our export there, at least during the past year. The companies that will purchase metal for rubles gained from the sale of consumer goods in the Russian market are exempted from the licensing. This is not simply a fight for the market--these are consequences of the reduction in the quota for the import of Chinese textiles into the United States. Here we are already talking about the survival of an industry. On the other hand, by decision of the PRC Government, capital construction has been partly frozen as of November 1993. This has already struck painfully at firms that had concluded contracts for the delivery of building materials and metal to China. The shipped commodity got stuck in warehouses, Chinese foreign trade companies were proclaimed bankrupt, and ours did not receive the barter goods. And, obviously, no enlivening is foreseen in this sphere. The new Chinese consul in Khabarovsk has already turned to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry with the request to organize an exhibition of their consumer goods in order to demonstrate what their producers are capable of doing, and to break our allergy to everything Chinese. There are also many vaguenesses in regard to border crossings. According to some data, the Chinese authorities are inclined to think that large capital investments on their side of the Bikin and Kazakevichev crossings are inexpedient. And, on the contrary, they are actively building ships of the "river-sea" type. Incidentally, having spoken at the Council on Foreign Economic Relations, Ye. Shchukin, the chief of the Khabarovsk Customs Service, remarked that his service from the very beginning expressed doubt about the effectiveness of the construction of crossings in places where the Chinese side does not have large settlements and large expenditures are necessary for the construction of normal roads. And spoke in favor of the expansion of the existing crossings. But these are all positions of our neighbors. But is there an objective necessity for cooperation with Khabarovsk Kray? Judging by everything, there nevertheless is. As follows from the speech of N. Pisarenko, the expansion of the sale of products in China is regarded by many entrepreneurs as one of the variants of the way out of the crisis. Our cutters and boats, furniture, machine tools, and cable, not to mention metal and other materials, "go." On the other hand, the kray will have a difficult time without some Chinese products, above all, food products. It is another matter that all this Russian-Chinese business must go into a civilized framework. How to do this--that is the question.
