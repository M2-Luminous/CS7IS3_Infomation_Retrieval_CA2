FR940527-1-00212 FR940527-1-00014 The above analysis supports our recommended update to the urban standardized amounts of the market basket rate of increase (that is, 3.6 percent) minus 2.5 percentage points, or 1.1 percent. In addition, we believe a differential update for the standardized amount applicable to rural hospitals is appropriate in order to phase out the differential between the rural and other urban standardized amounts, as required by section 1886(d)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act. We are recommending that the rural standardized amount be updated by the market basket plus 4.8 percentage points for a total update of 8.4 percent. This recommendation is consistent with the President's budget, which includes an update to the standardized amounts for rural hospitals of the market basket rate of increase plus the amount necessary to eliminate the differential between the rural and other urban standardized amounts. We recommend that the hospital-specific rates applicable to sole community hospitals be increased by the update factor that approximates that applicable for urban hospitals. We believe that the considerations used to develop the update recommendations for the rural standardized amounts that would eliminate the difference between the rural and other urban standardized amounts are not a relevant consideration for the hospital-specific rates. Therefore, we are recommending an update to hospital-specific rates of the market basket rate of increase minus 2.2 percentage points, which is consistent with current law and the President's budget. IV. ProPAC Recommendation for Updating the Rate-of-Increase Limits for Excluded Hospitals ProPAC recommends an update factor equal to the market basket rate of increase minus 1.0 percentage point for excluded hospitals and units. The 1.0 percentage point reduction represents a reduction of 1.0 percentage point to account for the forecast error in the FY 1993 market basket rate of increase for excluded units, no increase to reflect the different compensation price proxies used by ProPAC, and no allowance for new technology. ProPAC no longer recommends an additional allowance based on the year the hospital or unit was excluded from the prospective payment system, pending our report to Congress on payment reform for excluded hospitals and units as mandated by Public Law 101- 508. Response: We recommend that hospitals excluded from the prospective payment system receive an update equal to the percentage increase in the market basket that measures input price increases for services furnished by excluded hospitals minus 1.0 percentage point. The reduction is consistent with the updates provided under current law and in the President's Budget. The market basket rate of increase for excluded hospitals is currently forecast at 3.7 percent. Subtracting 1.0 percentage point would result in an update of 2.7 for excluded hospitals and units.
