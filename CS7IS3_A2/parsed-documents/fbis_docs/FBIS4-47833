The IFP leader told an impromptu Ulundi press briefing he would stand by the election results if the other parties did so. Mr Buthelezi said it was "very mean" of the ANC to have made a mountain out of a molehill over claimed IFP irregularities in the voting process. He said he was concerned about the anger which could have generated. Mr Buthelezi said he had entered the all-race elections on the understanding that he would stand by the results. In spite of reservations about the process "I don't think there is any possibility of me turning around, rejecting the results". He said that would be construed as sour grapes.
