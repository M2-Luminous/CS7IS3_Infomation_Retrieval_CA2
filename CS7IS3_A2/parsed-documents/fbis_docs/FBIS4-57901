He said he is concerned about the consequences the new system will have for exports. The minister mentioned studies on taxation modifications and anti-dumping laws, without giving, however, any concrete details. At Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries in Sao Paulo, Ricupero said "what in the past was compensated for with an exchange rate adjustment, should now be compensated for with more efficiency and productivity, and this calls for greater efforts from entrepreneurs." The economic team has already decided to adopt a fixed exchange rate system. When addressing the entrepreneurs, however, the minister preferred to use the expression "stable exchange rate. Fixed is a strong word because as physics has demonstrated, there is nothing fixed in the world. In a stable economy, there is no reason for the exchange rate to be unstable." Yesterday, Ricupero adopted a more categorical position on the economic plan: "We are betting strongly on the stability of the currency and the economy," he said. He refused to debate the inflation rate in real value units or to make any forecast about it: "These are hypotheses that predict failure." [passage omitted]
