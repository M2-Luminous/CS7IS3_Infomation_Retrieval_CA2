The government reviewed the draft resolution it received early on Wednesday [15 June] at a unification and national security policy coordination meeting, and agreed that it was ready to take part in UN consultations, han said at a press conference. The draft gives the DPRK a 30-day grace period to comply unconditionally with the nuclear safeguards agreement and implement the inter-Korean accord on denuclearization. It contains six points, including a mandatory ban on weapons imports and exports, partial diplomatic sanctions, a ban on all flights except regular passenger services, and an embargo on any technical cooperation related to nuclear technology. These are the first phase of sanctions, Han said, with the second phase to include preventing the remittance of funds to the DPRK from abroad and freezing all the DPRK's assets abroad. The second phase would be implemented immediately in the event of any negative action by pyongyang, such as withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), he explained. The U.S. drew up the draft resolution after consultations with South Korea and Japan when the DPRK banned inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) from testing samples of nuclear fuel to determine whether some had been diverted secretly to make atomic weapons. Pyongyang has warned that any sanctions aimed at forcing it to accept inspections will be regarded as a declaration of war. At the same time it has insisted that its nuclear program is strictly peaceful. On Monday, the DPRK announced that it would withdraw immediately from the IAEA, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, and accept no more inspections of its nuclear program. It said this was in retaliation for the agency's own sanctions resolution against Pyongyang providing for an immediate halt to IAEA technical assistance to the DPRK totaling 250,000 U.S. dollars a year. "The draft resolution, if adopted as it is, will be very effective in exerting pressure on the DPRK," said the South Korean foreign minister. Han predicted that it would take two or three weeks for the draft to pass discussion by the United Nations Security Council and to be finally adopted. "As we have said before, the purpose of the resolution is not to impose the sanctions themselves, but to clear up the suspicion about the DPRK's past nuclear activities and secure nuclear transparency," he explained. Before, or even after, the resolution is adopted, the door will remain open for dialogue "if the DPRK fulfills its obligations under the nuclear safeguards accord and cooperates with the IAEA," Han said.
