FBIS4-36511 "drnes111_o_94005" FBIS-NES-94-111 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 SYRIA Papers View Upcoming Christopher Mission, Israel Papers View Upcoming Christopher Mission, Israel JN0906105394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 9 Jun 94 JN0906105394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [From the press review] [Text] Under the headline "The Peace Process and the U.S. Problem," the newspaper AL-BA'TH comments on U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's upcoming tour of the region, saying: What is important is to know how far the peace process has gone, and to evaluate the efforts made by the full partner in this regard. The United States has chosen to play the role of a full partner. This U.S. commitment has placed responsibility on the shoulders of the U.S. Administration. It has made it incumbent on the U.S. Administration to honor the terms of reference agreed upon for the peace process it launched. That is, this commitment requires the U.S. Administration to uphold the relevant UN resolutions, and the principles of international legitimacy, as well. In this regard, there is no room for anything called neutrality, or the role of a mailman. For the United States does not have responsibilities only in its capacity as the actual sponsor of the peace process, but also in its capacity as the greatest power on Earth at present, and as a member of the UN Security Council, not to mention its responsibilities with regard to UN resolutions. Given all this, there is no room for neutrality. The United States can either be a supporter or an opponent of international legitimacy. The paper adds: We in Syria support international resolutions and charters. In the same vein, we support the principles and objectives of the peace process. We have agreed to participate in this process on the basis of the parameters the United States proposed to regional players. We have cooperated to make this process a success, because we actually look forward to attaining a just and comprehensive peace. The paper indicates that Israel, which is opposed to international legitimacy, has defied the international community and rebelled against it. Worse still, it has violated the resolutions of the world body. Hence, the problem lies in the Israeli position. The paper adds: We are not asking the United States to side with either Syria or the Arabs. What we are demanding is that the United States support the terms of reference of the peace initiative it has launched. Moreover, we are asking it to uphold international resolutions. Any departure from this would be a concession to those who have rebelled against such legitimacy and acted against peace. AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: If the U.S. Administration is to play its role as a full partner in the peace process in a convincing manner, it should not succumb to the lame Israeli reasoning, which is grounded in usurpation, occupation, and aggression. This is a must if the region is to be rid of the vicious circle of escalation, tension, wars, and bloodshed. Under the headline "From the Peace Opportunity to War," the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: Israel, which has constantly managed to avert any progress in the stalemated peace talks, has exacerbated the situation and driven the region to the point of explosion under the very nose of the entire world community in order to kill the current peace opportunity once and for all. The paper believes the constant and escalating Israeli aggression against Lebanon poses the greatest challenge to the international community, which has seen how Israel has dealt successive blows to the peace process, which in turn has turned into crossword puzzle entangled by Israeli conditions, excuses, and aggressive practices. The paper urges the international community and the United States to put an end to Israeli belligerence and arrogance, to Israel's disregard for international resolutions and the international community's efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive peace. It also calls upon them to immediately halt all forms of Israeli aggression. Concluding its commentary, the paper says: Unless the international community shoulders its responsibilities by deterring Israeli aggression, this aggression will push the region in the direction of an explosion, whose results are unpredictable. In another commentary entitled "Where is Justice," the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: The situation in southern Lebanon has seen a serious deterioration. It has become a hotbed of tension that threatens to drown the region in an endless whirlpool of violence and chaos, thanks to the constant Israeli attacks on southern Lebanese villages and towns. The paper explains that the continuation of this serious situation in southern Lebanon, caused by the escalation of constant Israeli attacks, will cause the peace process to collapse and dash all the hopes for a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. The paper holds Israeli leaders responsible for this uncomfortable situation, and also for the failure of the stalemated peace process to bear fruit.
