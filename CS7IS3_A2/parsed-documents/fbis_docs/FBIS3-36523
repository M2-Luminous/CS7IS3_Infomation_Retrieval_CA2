The Ministry of Finance will be the only body authorized on behalf of the government to conclude agreements on external loans or to provide guarantees. Systemic transformations 1. The program of privatization in all three directions will be continued. Small-scale privatization will basically see the completion of privatization of businesses in the wholesale and retail trade, public catering, consumer and other services, and also structures linked to them which provide the carriage, storage, and sales of output.

On the basis of national programs the government will take measures to develop priority sectors of the economy. 4. The system of state needs will be of a temporary nature. It will be replaced by a market-oriented system of state purchases based on the principle of freely concluded contracts and taking consideration of exclusively state requirements (hospitals, state administration bodies, education, and defense). 5. The government will focus special attention on eliminating monopolies in the sphere of the wholesale trade and transport and sales services connected with it, and also in the sphere of foreign trade. 6.
