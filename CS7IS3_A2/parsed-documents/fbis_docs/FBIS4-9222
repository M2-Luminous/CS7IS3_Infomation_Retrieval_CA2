The Romanian head of state assessed that the themes to be debated, referring to cooperation and security in the Black Sea area, the political context in Central and Eastern Europe, the prospects of a stable peace in the region, offered the possibility of establishing concrete steps toward the promotion of political dialogue and encouraging the cooperation among and with the countries in Central and Eastern Europe. "In order to attain this purpose, the first-hand knowledge of the deep changes come about in this area in the last four years can eliminate the reserves sometimes shown towards our countries," he stated. ``I hope that the conference participants will have the opportunity these four days to get an image of today's Romania, a country where democracy has been entrenched and where foundations have been laid to the state of law but that, unfortunately, is still living through many economic difficulties. We have committed ourselves to a structural reform, to the end of using to advantage the country's substantive human, industrial, technological and scientific potential. This target can be attained completely and rapidly only through international cooperation and a more sizable presence of the foreign capital in the Romanian market. In this respect, we see that after a period when the realities in Romania were gravely distorted by international mass media, nobody doubts today any longer that Romania has committed itself firmly and definitely on the road to democracy, observance of human rights and specific values of a free world. Besides, the facilities offered to foreign investors rule out any reticence in coming toward the Romanian economy. ``In another sequence of ideas, we hope the Bucharest talks will be a signal for the international community, to the end of assisting the countries in the area, by establishing peace, for avoiding the extension of the conflicts or the emergence of new hotbeds of war. Romania's situation is not an easy one, as it is surrounded by zones of permanent unrest. Therefore, like all countries in Central and Eastern Europe, we are interested in our security," the Romanian head of state said. ``I am taking this opportunity to recall the fact that, by our opinion, the signing of the Partnership for Peace cannot be reduced only to a simple extension of the NATO a few kilometers farther to the East. It means the turning of the North-Atlantic Alliance into a factor of security for all countries in the region, meant to avert the danger of new and arbitrary discriminations among the countries of this region, giving them the opportunity to think out ways of implementing a partnership for development, proposed by us as an extension of the Partnership for Peace in Europe. For European development to become a fact, we should overcome the suspicions and confrontations and understand that the common difficulties can be overcome only through opening and cooperation''.
