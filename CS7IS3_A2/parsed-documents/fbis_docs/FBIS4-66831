Algiers--The emotion aroused by the murder of two French religious--killed in the Casbah district on Sunday 8 May--should induce foreigners "whose presence in Algeria is not essential," as the diplomats put it, to leave the country as quickly as possible. The face of the capital has not changed, however. For the past three weeks, blood and sun have been coexisting, tragedy rubbing shoulders with ordinary routine at intervals of only a few hours or a few kilometers. While death was doing its work in an alley in old Algiers on Sunday, life was in full swing in the port district, which was full of kids, sunlight, and heat. On flowery hillsides and along the highways, families were picnicking on the grass and old people were taking siestas without a glance at the young people flirting not far away. Around Ain Benian west of the capital, the seedy bars in Madrague were crowded again. The mountains of grilled red mullet and swordfish on paper tablecloths were being washed down with rose wine. The nearby beach at Club des Pins was also swarming with girls and boys together. Although the good weather has a lot to do with that springtime exuberance, the security forces have also done their part. The particularly "hot" Islamist fiefs in the Mitidja region--Lakhdaria, Medea, Blida, and Dellys--received a forceful visit from elite units in March and April. Thanks to often ferocious repression, a semblance of calm was restored. Several guerrilla chiefs were reportedly killed and their gangs dismantled. It is true that many questions remain. The insidious warfare between armed Islamist groups and the police remains invisible to ordinary observers. Journalists and diplomats alike generally have no choice but to feel their way in the fog of official communiques, anonymous tracts, personal accounts, and rumors. But the recent "clean-up" operations by the Army have apparently had noticeable results not only in the capital but throughout the Algiers region. In Blida and Medea, not a few women who were still subject to fundamentalist edicts just recently have now decided to put away their "hijab" (veils). How long will the calm last? No one knows. "That is why we must make the most of it: if we're going to die tomorrow anyway, we may as well breathe today," said one Algiers woman with a brave smile. And with the sun as encouragement, foreigners would almost be doing the same. Since the murder of an employee of the Russian Embassy in Algiers on 28 March, none of them had felt the terrorist wrath. Even the death threats were becoming less frequent. That happy period was to be of short duration. Suddenly brought back down to earth by the murder of Sister Helene Saint Raymond and Brother Henri Verges, foreign nationals, especially the French, are again on the alert. The first wave of departures took place last November following the kidnapping of three employees of the French General Consulate in Algiers. The All Saints holiday had provided a good pretext to avoid calling that hasty exodus a "repatriation." The Christmas holidays, preceded by a stream of murderous attacks on foreigners, gave the signal for a second wave of departures. As an indication of that mass exodus, the 1,400 students enrolled in French-language schools last September are now down to a little less than 300 at the Algiers lycee, the other schools having closed their doors in April. For security reasons, the six French cultural centers (in Algiers, Oran, Annaba, Constantine, Tlemcen, and Tizi-Ouzou) have done the same. Their activities have been "suspended" for several weeks now. The political uncertainties weighing on Algeria's future have hardly any chance of reversing that situation. The march by the "reconcilers," which was supposed to rally all the fundamentalist groups, attracted only a few participants. The FLN [National Liberation Front] and the moderate fundamentalists in Hamas [Islamic Society Movement] and Ennahdha were not really able to mobilize anyone besides their own troops. Those who were predicting participation by the former Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) were wasting their breath. The murder of the two French religious, having been perpetrated less than two hours after the demonstration ended, seems to indicate that the terrorist groups, being hostile to all dialogue, are disinclined to drop their guard. Speaking through Rabah Kebir, president of its executive body abroad, the FIS "condemned with the greatest firmness" that double murder, calling it "contrary to Islamic teaching," while Henri Tessier, archbishop of Algiers, stated that despite that "absurd crime," "it was more essential than ever to increase the number of places where Christians and Muslims cooperate in getting to know and respect each other." Are the sorcerer's apprentices to be found exclusively in the Islamist nebula? Common sense would say so. But common sense is not exactly one of the most widely distributed virtues in this bruised country, where the vehemence of passions and the parochial spirit--or perhaps we should say the spirit of the minaret--all too often take the place of a political program.
