FR940706-0-00013 FR940706-0-00001 Comments: The Department received four comments on this provision. The commenters objected to this provision arguing that the HPA prohibits Secretarial review of decisions made by the ALJ. The commenters recommended that the Department delete this provision. Response: The Department has considered these comments but has decided not to adopt the recommendation to forgo Secretarial review of the initial ALJ decision. As discussed under ยง283.17(c)(3), the Department has revised the regulations to provide that the initial decision of the ALJ shall be considered final for purposes of judicial review. However, this would not preclude any party to the appeal from seeing reconsideration by the ALJ or review by the Department's Judicial Officer within 30 days of the ALJ's decision. It is the Department's position that the specific incorporation of section 557 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 557) by section 603 of the HPA necessarily means that the Secretary is authorized to review ALJ decisions. Indeed, the APA expressly provides that an agency action can be final for purposes of the APA, and thus for purposes of judicial review, even though it is subject to reconsideration or appeal to a higher authority within the agency. 5 U.S.C. 704. This interpretation is consistent with both the expressed statutory language and legislative history of section 603 of the HPA. See Memorandum for Alan C. Raul, General Counsel, U.S. Department of Agriculture, from Douglas R. Cox, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, U.S. Department of Justice (February 20, 1991). The Department has also determined that review by the Secretary of issues raised on appeal is a more efficient process for resolving disputes concerning initial ALJ decisions that if such issues were brought to the federal courts without providing the Secretary the opportunity to review and, if necessary, revise such decisions. The Secretary has delegated to the Judicial Officer the authority to act as the final deciding officer in adjudicatory proceedings subject to 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557. Section 283.20 will permit the Judicial Officer, on behalf of the Secretary, to address the party's objections to the initial ALJ decision, to apply expertise on the issues under review, exercise informed discretion, and create a more concise record for any subsequent judicial review. This procedure will also ensure that there is continuity in the decisions which are rendered for cases involving similar issues. Submission of briefs: In ยง283.20(h)(i) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that if the Judicial Officer determined that there were reasonable grounds that additional evidence which is material was not presented to the ALJ, the Judicial Officer shall remand the matter back to the ALJ for disposition. Comment: The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter questioned if it was the Department's intent to limit materials presented to the Judicial Officer. Response: The Department has considered this comment and wishes to clarify that the Judicial Officer reviews the record created before the ALJ. However, if a party to the appeal can persuade the Judicial Officer that there are reasonable grounds why material evidence was not presented to the ALJ, the Judicial Officer shall remand the matter back to the ALJ for further consideration. Section 283.30: Cross Motions for Summary Judgment This section of the NPRM contains the procedures which are to be followed if the appeal is being pursued under subpart C_Summary Procedures for Appeal of QC Claims of Less than $50,000. Comment: The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter expressed a concern that the 35 page limitation on the brief accompanying the motion for summary judgment and the 15 page reply brief limitation were too restricted and recommended that a higher page limit be established. Response: The Department considered this comment but decided not to adopt it. The Department believes that given the authority of the ALJ to increase the size of the brief and reply brief, the page limitations are reasonable. These page limits are consistent with congressional intent to streamline the appeals process. The Department has also made changes to subpart C to conform to the timeframes specified in the Leland Act.
