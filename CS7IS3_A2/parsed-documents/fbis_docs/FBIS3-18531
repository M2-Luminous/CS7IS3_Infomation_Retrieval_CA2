Throughout 1993 the figures arriving on his desk bore witness to booming sales of our products on foreign markets. The overall result, in provisional figures released by the Bank of Italy on Monday [28 February], was a positive balance of 50 trillion lire compared with just 3.8 trillion in 1992. Economist, banker, and minister in charge of privatization in the Amato government, Paolo Baratta is particularly attentive to the manufacturing sector, where the recovery should take root; an approach which inspires a sense of prudence in him. "Exports have grown, but there are obstacles to be overcome and there are still knots which must be untied," he explained, seated in his office. "There will certainly be a recovery, there should be no doubt of this," he adds, but implies that it will not be plain sailing. [Petrini] Minister Baratta, our exports are doing extremely well, and shouts of enthusiasm are coming from every quarter. Are we already out of the trough; are we a country unafraid of rivals on its international markets? [Baratta] We must be very careful not to interpret this data with unwarranted optimism. Let us understand each other: The figures are extremely positive and we are very satisfied. However, if we look at Italy's market shares in the industrialized countries, we realize that these have not grown: In the United States, we have remained at around 2.4 percent, in France, we have fallen from 11.8 percent in 1992 to 9.8 percent in the first 11 months of 1993. In Germany we have fallen from 9.7 to 7.8 percent, and in Japan from 1.8 to 1.6 percent. On our markets, we have still not returned to our 1987 shares. In short, we have increased volume, but this has not served to increase our penetration on Western markets. The opposite, however, is true for the Far East, and in general for all newly industrialized countries, where we have seen a real and genuine boom. [Petrini] Does this mean that the export boom could be short-lived? [Baratta] The danger exists. The fact is that the failure to enlarge our market shares may be because the effects of the lira devaluation have not yet completely worked through. If this was the reason, there would be no need to worry, but would mean that we still have large margins to take advantage of. However, there is also another hypothesis: that our penetration of wealthy and developed markets is not as easy because we still have problems of competitiveness, of technology, and of the organizational structures of our companies. [Petrini] Is our production system able to consolidate our presence abroad? [Baratta] It is here that we win or lose. There are certain factors which allow us to be optimistic. Our businesses, and in particular the small and medium-sized ones, have demonstrated an extraordinary liveliness, the "animal spirits" [words in English] are there. But we have to act politically in order to achieve industrial development within the new framework of international competition: We have to be prepared to invest many more resources in new products, in research and in the human factor. We need to invest more in helping Italian companies access the new markets. [Petrini] What do our entrepreneurs need to do to ensure that the 1993 boom is not wasted? [Baratta] They need to work on enlarging their markets. Move to conquer international demand which is growing, even if very far from home. They need to draw the correct lessons from the devaluation: This is not a chance event, but a stimulus for getting reorganized, for acquiring better technical structures domestically and better sales structures abroad. [Petrini] The lira devaluation has been pointed to as the key factor in the upward movement of our exports. Is this true? [Baratta] Yes, the devaluation has had a major impact. But I would not want to overlook the fact that, in recent years, demand from newly industrialized countries has increased. The fact is that the upward movement in our exports predates the devaluation. Moreover, I would not overlook the agreement on the labor costs which has allowed us to contain the growth of internal costs. [Petrini] Industrial production has picked up in the last three months, exports are moving ahead, and internal costs have been contained. Are these the preconditions for our economy taking off? [Baratta] No, these conditions are not enough. We need to take advantage of all the opportunities which the foreign markets offer. We need therefore to continue to secure international credibility, financial stability, low interest rates. We also need a very tough approach to the management of public finances, in order to have resources available for the numerous actions which are a necessary part of a medium-term policy of supporting public and private investments. In addition, we need to reduce, as soon as possible, taxation on companies, bringing it down to the levels of the most favored European partners. [Petrini] In short, for you the recovery is not then just round the corner. Is this right? [Baratta] One can say that signs of recovery exist. We can say that we are really in an economic recovery when we see new investment decisions. It is certain that the recovery will come, but it is too early to say when and how. [Petrini] You say that small companies are reacting well; however, there remains the question of the major industrial sectors, of chemicals and steel making. Can the old apparatus of previous state intervention contribute to the recovery? [Baratta] The newly privatized industries are in certain cases less interested in exporting. Nonetheless, in this world we have seen a genuine revolution in behavior, a revolution which in fact has sidelined statism as a way of being and thinking. Since the summer of 1992, when the state said that it would not put one lira more of equity into public industry, we have seen a profound "privatization" of behavior. And in the world of the newly-privatized companies, new managers are growing up who, in a few years time, will provide us with positive surprises. [Petrini] And are the major private groups ready? [Baratta] In the last two years there has been a major tightening up coinciding with the European single market. It is no longer possible to have a little reserve in public contracts, and the idea that production can be protected by national legislation has disappeared. Special attention or protection is no longer available. This too has been a revolution.
