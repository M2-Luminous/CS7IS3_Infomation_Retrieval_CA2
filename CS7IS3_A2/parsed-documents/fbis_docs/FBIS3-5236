Today, the Justice Ministry released a statement on the "Government's Position on the National Security Law." In the document, the ministry states: "Continuous mention of a need to abolish the National Security Law, when a delicate security situation prevails because of the North Korean nuclear issue, is not beneficial to our national interests." Regarding the allegation that the National Security Law is abused to violate human rights, the Justice Ministry also said: "When this law was revised in 1991, the purposes of the National Security Law were specified, and the scope of the application of this law was restricted significantly, so that the law ensures that people's basic human rights are defended to the utmost." The ministry added: "The government will strictly execute the law and make continued efforts to prevent the violation of human rights." Dissidents insist that, "The law describes North Korea as an antistate organization, at a time when the North-South agreement has been signed. Therefore, the law stands in the reunification's way." In response, the Justice Ministry says: "The National Security Law does not automatically consider North Korea an antistate organization. Furthermore, the laws on North-South exchange and cooperation positively guarantees peaceful exchange and cooperation." Tbe ministry also said: "If North Korea abandons its strategy on perpetrating a communist revolution in South Korea and if North- South relations develop into relations of reconciliation and cooperation, the government will seriously reexamine the law."
