[Iliescu] After the events in 1989 in the Central and East European countries, the physiognomy of Europe radically changed. Although the Cold War was over, we had to face prejudice and certain tendencies toward the discriminatory treatment of East European countries. I believe that the future Europe should consist of countries that develop relations of cooperation and not confrontation. Last year Romania succeeded in removing the last barriers that affected its image. It became a member of the Council of Europe with full rights and obtained most-favored-nation status from the United States. This year, Romania was the first country to sign the Partnership for Peace with NATO. We propose to keep up this rapid pace of integration in Europe and develop good relations with the United States, the Far East, and other countries of the world. The recent accord not only represents financial support but it is also a moral credit granted to our country. It speaks for itself about the fact that, according to experts, Romania has to play an important role because of its natural resources, its people's high level of education, the efficiency of its government, and its privileged geographical position, which permits control over air routes and waterways that connect Europe and the Middle East and mainly the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal. [Reporter] In the past months, after the political changes stabilized in Central and East Europe, we witnessed the first real signs of redistribution of influence between the major powers. Could you please comment on this? [Iliescu] Unfortunately, I cannot fully agree with you that all political changes in Central and Easter Europe have been stabilized. While this is obvious for such states as Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary, in terms of the former federations, such as Yugoslavia and USSR, the current stabilization is still fragile. Second, I believe that the example of shares of influence of the great powers belongs to an old mentality that is specific to the Cold War rather than to current relations. I rather see the near future of this part of the world in terms of distribution of areas of influence between big and average centers of power. The former socialist countries in Europe should mainly recuperate the technological and managerial deficiency that separates them from West Europe to be able to make full use of its resources, among which I would call human resources as the major one. All this should not turn former socialist countries in competitors for West Europe; on the contrary, we should become equal and solid partners in the act of building a stronger, more stable, and more prosperous Europe. That is why the last thing we need now is a conflict for hegemony, no matter whether we are talking about the attempt of one country to expand its hegemony or the need to defend itself from foreign hegemony. I believe that the Partnership for Peace and the prospects for complete integration of these countries in NATO represents the first step toward the achievement of a greater stability in the area. But this has to be completed with an initiative of the Partnership for Development, according to similar concepts and organized around the same institutions. [Reporter] After the downfall of totalitarian regimes in Europe and after the real abolition of the Warsaw Pact, what do you believe will be the role of NATO in the world and especially in Europe? [Iliescu] Just like all the other East European countries, we are naturally concerned about our security. We regard NATO as a successful alliance, which has been one of the major pillars of security in Europe after World War II. What is really important is the fact that NATO's development should not be reduced to a simple expansion of its umbrella with a few hundred kilometers toward east, but NATO should turn into a factor of security for all countries in this region. The proposal of the Partnership for Peace shirks the danger of establishing new and aimless discrimination among the countries that are candidates to become NATO members and offers equal chance to all these countries. That is why we joined this formula of cooperation and were the first country that took this step. However, our final goal is to become members with full rights of NATO. We suggested the Partnership for Development, as a component of the Partnership for Peace in Europe and the North American region. The European Union can represent an adequate framework for the development of this concept. What is important for us in Europe is to overcome the stage of confrontation and suspicion and understand that the problems that exist both in East as well in West Europe can be solved through a broad opening of gates toward a free circulation of capital, of knowhow, goods, and people. In the long run, through adequate administration, the inevitable phenomenon of a united Europe will lead not to competition among European countries but to cooperation and greater prosperity for everybody. [Reporter] In the less than three years since the Soviet Union ceased to exist, we have witnessed a new situation prevailing among former Soviet republics, which we can see in the military, political, and financial areas. Could you please comment on this? [Iliescu] The situations differ in each case, according to the republics that we refer to, in Asia Minor, in the Caucasus, or the Western republics of the former USSR. However, even among the countries that belong to this last group, things differ, whether it is one of the Slavic republics, one of the Baltic republics, or the republic of Moldova, the only one that has no common borders with the Russian Federation. But, at the same time, all these republics have many common elements. First of all, the high rate of economic integration that prevailed in the former USSR, made these countries economically dependent on each other, but mainly on Russia. Therefore, I believe that in case of most of these countries to expect them to change overnight is not a realistic demand. On the other hand, however, it is essential for them to gradually develop their alternative economic ties, in order to defend their independence and prevent Moscow having a monopoly. Second, unfortunately, all political forces in Russia manifest an increasingly higher degree of nostalgia for its former imperial role. These very conservative, imperial forces are the ones that try to keep strategic control over foreign lands, sometimes even at the cost of war. I am going to give you a very significant example for Europe, especially for the situation in the Balkans: what is the role of the 14th [Russian] Army in Moldova, on the banks of the Dniester River, at a distance of almost 1,000 kilometers from Russia and on the territory of a sovereign state, which is not even Russia's neighbor? The imperial nostalgia affects all the former republics of the USSR, including Russia. Instead of concentrating its efforts on economic and social problems, Russia will waste its efforts in other ways and the result can be none other than the continuation of the decline in the standard of living and in political coherence, with the possible restoration of an anti- democratic regime. Therefore, all of us are and must be interested in strengthening democratic forces and in ensuring the success of economic reform in the Russian Federation. [Reporter] You will visit Greece next week. What do you think Greece could do for Romania's integration in Europe, especially now when Greece holds the presidency of the European Union and, furthermore, Greece is the first country that ratified the treaty of Romania's association to the European Union? [Iliescu] I believe that the official visit to Greece, which will take place on 30 and 31 March, represents an extremely important moment both for our bilateral relations and for developments in the Balkans. The excellent Romanian-Greek relations are based on longstanding traditions and on mutual advantage and support. We are grateful to Greece for the support granted to Romania to achieve its strategic objective of integration in the European Union. As you have mentioned, the Greek Parliament was the first to ratify the Treaty of Romania's association to the European Union. We wish to express thanks again for this act and we sincerely hope that our Greek friends will make all possible efforts to see to it that the respective treaty is ratified by all members of the European Union. Likewise, we appreciate the friendly support granted by Greece for the admittance of Romania to the Council of Europe. We are convinced that Greece can make a new and important contribution in all stages of Romania's integration in Euro-Atlantic structures. And last but not least, we rely on Greece's cooperation in promoting certain economic projects in the Balkans, with the assistance of European financial bodies, for the benefit of all countries in the region, including Romania certainly. [Reporter] How do you view the issue of former Yugoslavia and the Macedonia issue? [Iliescu] The emergence of new states on the territory of the former Yugoslavia is a reality. Most of them have been accepted in the United Nations and recognized by the international community. The promotion of normal relations with these states is an action that makes a contribution to the efforts to overcome tension and increase confidence and stability in our region. The meetings that took place between officials in Romania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, made it possible for us to find solutions to current aspects of cooperation and the movement of our citizens. Therefore, a Romanian Trade Office and Romanian consular office have opened in Skopje. I am convinced that problems facing Greece and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will be solved by both sides through dialogue and understanding, because of the need to have relations of good neighborliness and in the interest of cooperation, mutual confidence, security, and peace in the region.
