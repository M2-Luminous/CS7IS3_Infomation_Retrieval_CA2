They Prefer Young Folks in the Kremlin"] [Text] Aleksandr Lifshits, head of Boris Yeltsin's experts group, has violated the traditions of forming consultative councils (which used to include only academic glitterati) -- economists absolutely unknown to the public have become presidential advisers. On 15 April, the president signed an edict confirming the list of the group's members and rules guiding its work. The group of experts was created a month and a half ago as a structural subdivision of the presidential aides service. It was also then that its director -- Aleksandr Lifshits -- was appointed. The edict that appeared last weekend set the cap on the group: eight persons (six experts and two secretaries), and defined the main areas of its work. Presidential experts in particular are expected to prepare proposals on the implementation of economic policy and to forecast consequences of decisions made by parliament and the government in the socioeconomic sphere. Mr. Lifshits stated that, in addition to himself, five economists, "absolutely unknown to the broad public," work in the group. He declined to identify them by name, obviously fearful of provoking a "star complex" in his charges. At any rate, the group's personal composition is not all that important. Experts name the control function as among the body's more obvious ones -- in regard to parliament's and the government's economic creativity. Mr. Lifshits stated that he "dislikes the commissar function," while the body of experts would hardly avoid this sort of work owing to its status. In this sense "stars on the group of experts would even prove harmful -- each member would try to bring precisely his own opinion to the president. Besides, members of the president's staff do not rule out that the group was created at Sergey Filatov's initiative. The main purport of organizing the group in this case boils down to creating a certain counterbalance to the State Legal Administration [SLA], poorly controlled by Filatov and headed by Ruslan Orekhov. The government, too, is interested in this -- its officials have long been seeing in the SLA, as Justice Minister Yuriy Kalmykov put it, a successor to the Politburo which "without permission" corrects (or even turns down) many departmental plans. Should this version be correct, the composition of the group generally loses sense -- it only suffices to assess the ability of the group's leader to influence decisions made by the president (especially in moments of doubt). Judging by Mr. Lifshits' rapid rise, he enjoys support from rather influential forces in the Kremlin. Hence he is in a position to influence the president.
