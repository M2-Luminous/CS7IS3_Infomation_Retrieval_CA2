Mr. Goh said British businesses had a long relationship with Asia and it would be ironic if Britain is seen in the future as a lesser player in the growing Asian economy. Speaking in London at a banquet hosted by its lord mayor, Mr. Goh said Singapore and Britain have of late, emphasized different priorities. He noted Britain is reorientated towards Europe and Singapore towards its ASEAN neighbors. Mr. Goh said if this trend continues, the historical ties may loosen and this will not be to their advantage. The prime minister said in Asia, Britain enjoys a clear comparative advantage over many of its European partners. Its economic presence in Singapore and Hong Kong is substantial. Mr. Goh assured British investors that Singapore provides ready platform for British companies to launch their business interests in Asia. In his address the lord mayor of London, (Paul Neil), called on Singapore companies and investors to plan for the new and large European markets. He said Singapore and Britain share impeccable credentials of free trading nations.
