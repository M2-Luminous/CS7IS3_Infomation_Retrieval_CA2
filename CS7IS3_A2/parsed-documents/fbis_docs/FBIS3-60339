All the 30 states and Abuja, the Federal Capital, as well as seven Federal Ministries are to be involved in the implementation of the scheme, which is to commence next month. The programme focused essentially on the development of an executive capacity for managing industrial pollution, which had been highlighted under Agenda 21, at the 1992 June summit of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), as a major threat to the environment. The principal sources of industrial pollution are petroleum and petro-chemical industries; manufacturing industries; and agricultural industries, particularly producers of pesticides. Already, a two-member consultancy team has been rounding off preliminary work on the establishment of a programme outline that will involve the scope, priority areas and modalities for executing the programme. The team comprised a New York-based environmental engineer, Mr Larry Quinn, who recently returned home, and a Nigerian specialist in pollution control and analytical chemistry, Professor Oladele Osibanjo. The programme will, however, be executed and co-ordinated by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA), with participation also being drawn from the Ministries of Petroleum Resources; Health and Human Resources; Industries; Water Resources and Agriculture; Mines, Power and Steel; and Transport, which should normally deal with marine pollution control. "Right now, we do not have any marine pollution control. Ships dump anything on our shores and our oceans. We do not have the manpower, though, on paper, they have the responsibility," a source disclosed at the week-end. Specifically, the programme will involve the training of a corps of pollution control managers in all the three tiers of government, who will monitor existing industries and prevent environmentally unfriedly industries from coming into the country. Other aspects of the grant will comprise the supply of scientific and technological equipment towards equipping some of the ministries involved in the programme, training of the personnel to man them, and generation of some of the environmental data base required for the project. The first two years will be used in training staff, but these people will now be used in generating data upon which future planning can be based. Besides the staff development aspects of the consultancy schedule, the specialists were also expected to have drawn up a detailed outline of specific environmental control needs in the country. Key areas of interest already highlighted for documentary review by the consultants are: Control of industrial pollution; management of agrochemicals; control of water pollution; promotion of environmentally sound technology; and monitoring and assessing of the environment and natural resources. The programme itself is a fallout of on-going efforts by the Nigerian Government to establish a comprehensive environmental management support scheme, to be funded both nationally and by donor agencies. Following the outcome of a 1991 multi-sectoral needs assessment exercise, the issue of environmental management had topped the list of identified problem areas requiring support services. These had included development of a programme of natural resources, soil and biodiversity conservation; combating drought and desertification, and stimulation of urban and community development schemes.
