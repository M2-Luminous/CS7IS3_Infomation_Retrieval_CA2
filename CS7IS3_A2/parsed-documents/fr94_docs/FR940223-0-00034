Indian judgment funds include interest and investment income accrued while such funds are so held in trust. This exclusion extends to initial purchases made with Indian judgment funds. This exclusion does not apply to sales or conversions of initial purchases or to subsequent purchases. Note _This exclusion applies to the income of sponsors of aliens only if the alien lives in the sponsor's household. (h) All funds held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior for an Indian tribe and distributed per capita to a member of that tribe are excluded from income under Public Law 98&hyph;64 (25 U.S.C. 117b). Funds held by Alaska Native Regional and Village Corporations (ANRVC) are not held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior and therefore ANRVC dividend distributions are not excluded from countable income under this exclusion. For ANRVC dividend distributions, see paragraph IV(a) of this Appendix. Note _This exclusion applies to the income of sponsors of aliens only if the alien lives in the sponsor's household.
