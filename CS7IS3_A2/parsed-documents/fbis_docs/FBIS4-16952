The correspondent asks Kravchuk about a meeting held by the Sevastopol Town Council, which requested that the Ukrainian president withdraw Ukraine's Armed Forces from the town. Kravchuk replies: "I do not think this is a confrontation or a turning point. I think there will be various points of view and various positions until the problem of the Black Sea Fleet is resolved. We must be calm about this and approach it with understanding. The main thing, however, is to solve the problem. ``I will tell you frankly that I do not see the possibility that the Ukrainian Armed Forces can exist alongside the Russian naval base that could be in Sevastopol on the basis of a leasing agreement that is recognized by the world. I support this idea because I see no other way out at the moment. There will never be accord there if they are together or next to each other. ``For this reason, if the base is to be in Sevastopol--I stress not the town of Sevastopol, because there are various interpretations here--I am not talking about the town, but about the base in the town of Sevastopol. It is a question of interpretation, but it is necessary to be precise. Some people do not observe this, and there are misunderstandings because of this. In this case, there should be a base for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Moreover, the base for the Russian fleet will not be leased in perpetuity but for a specified period that will be determined by documents. ``There is no need to dramatize or imagine that one thing has been agreed and now they are talking about something else. Everybody puts forward his point of view. Until a final document is signed, along with all its attributes and mechanisms, there will be various interpretations. Do not exaggerate the various bits of information, statements, or decisions--even by the Sevastopol Town Council-- because for us this is of a consultative nature. I would not like to prejudice the course of events. I know that a Russian-Ukrainian commission has already starting working on this, but I would like them to complete their work successfully. ``We must resolve the problem of the Black Sea Fleet. We are obliged to do so. Please understand that this is not simply a question of dividing the fleet. It is a political issue. It is considered to be a joint fleet at the moment. In reality, however--without wanting to dramatize it--it is not subordinate to Ukraine. This joint fleet takes some actions as a joint fleet, and we--both Ukraine and Russia--are responsible for these actions. For example, I am not allowed to intervene directly, but I am responsible if it is a joint fleet and I sign a document. For this reason, I consider that we must clearly determine as soon as possible that this is a Russian fleet with Russian laws, regulations, and enforceable enactments. Russia would be responsible for its fleet and Ukraine for its fleet. ``It is necessary to resolve this, and this is the most important thing. We must sit behind a table and resolve it. I insist, insisted, and will insist on this. It is dangerous to drag it out.'' The correspondent says that the Ukrainian Supreme Council will have to ratify the agreement, and Kravchuk adds: "This is not a tragedy. The main thing is that the presidents sign the documents and then submit them to parliament. An important step will have been taken. The presidents and governments make proposals and then submit them to parliament. Parliament expresses its view. I am convinced that the Ukrainian parliament understands the situation. There are realities that, despite all desires, cannot be ignored. They exist today and should be resolved. There is no other way but to resolve this on the basis of wise and constructive principles, with compromises, and in the interests of today, tomorrow, and the distant future. ``If it is a serious policy, then that is how we should act. I know how sensitive this issue is, how you react to it, and how every statement and comment is interpreted differently. There is one principle, however, which is to resolve and settle the issue of the Black Sea Fleet: the issue of a base for the Russian fleet, the division of the fleet, and compensation to Ukraine for our share of the fleet that is being given away to Russia. "These are the main issues. We have already discussed them in detail in Yalta, Zavidovo, and Massandra. We have already worked on this. We only have to sit down and write down the precise formulation on the principles and interests of our states, taking into account international experience. That is all we are talking about. ``Ukraine clearly abides by the provisions that are defined in three documents--and now in the fourth one signed in Moscow. Thus, there are four documents on the Black Sea Fleet. I would like the fifth one to be the last.''
