The congress was an "expanded variant" of the Milli Mejlis, the national parliament, which aspires to the role of expressor of the interests of all the Tatar people. Anyone who bothered to show up, fill out a form and receive a mandate could become a delegate. The task of the congress was to elect a new membership and chairman (reis) of the Milli Mejlis. The previous chairman, Talgat Abdullin, had been given the position of chief administrator of the newly created semi-state bank, "Ak bars." The national parliament handled this task without any significant problems: A membership of the Milli Mejlis consisting of 25 persons was elected, and the rather well-known Fauziya Bayramova, leader of the Tatar party for national independence, "Ittifak," became the chairman. Here, at the congress, Ms. Bayramova was given her first task: To begin collecting signatures demanding "to hold a referendum on the independence of the Republic of Tatarstan." Without a doubt, this decision was a reaction to the 15 February signing of the agreement between Kazan and Moscow, which was evaluated as a "tragedy of the Tatar people" and a "betrayal of the interests of our children." In this connection, the new chairman announced that those who had signed the agreement for Tatariya (President Shaymiyev and Prime Minister Sabirov--SEGODNYA) did not have the authority to give their signatures, since they had not asked the opinion of the people. "As of 15 February, Shaymiyev is not president for us. And in general, the institution of the presidency in Tatarstan must be abolished," said Ms. Bayramova. The delegates to the congress also did not agree with references to the fact that the agreement had been signed in accordance with the constitutions of Russia and Tatariya. "We have no other constitution except the Koran," it was heard from the podium. Moreover, it was specified that the Constitution of Russia "is irrelevant here," since "as of 1552 (the time of taking of Kazan by the forces of Ivan the Terrible--SEGODNYA), we have been in a state of war with Russia." An appeal was adopted calling for the citizens of the "sovereign state of Tatarstan" not to participate in the elections to the Federal Assembly of the "neighboring state of Russia" which were scheduled for 13 March, so as to demonstrate their disagreement with the signing of the agreement. And generally, in the opinion of deputies of the Milli Mejlis, the time has come "to raise the Tatar people up in the struggle for their independence." The delegates elected the scientist-chemist Vil Mirzayanov as honorary member of the Milli Mejlis, and also adopted a resolution expressing their indignation regarding the fact of his arrest. The measure which had passed, in the opinion of local observers, demonstrated even more clearly the schism between the different wings of the once unified Tatar National-Patriotic Movement. For example, delegates from the radical committee, "Sovereignty," and a number of others left the auditorium after the first meeting, while in the auditorium itself there were frequent outbursts of heated debate, turning at times to open swearing and sometimes even to fistfights. Many believe that the reason for the discord within the Tatar national movement is concealed not in political, but in personal differences of the individual leaders. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that in the near future another two or three milli medlis may emerge in Tatariya, and exclusively for the purpose of satisfying the personal ambitions of the "fighters for freedom of the Tatar people." As we know, the sum is not altered when the addends change place. And even if the total weight of the national-patriotic organizations of Tatariya is equal to what it was before, nevertheless the coefficient of their influence on political life in the republic will still be close to zero. Before, President Shaymiyev needed them to frighten Moscow with the possibility of national conflicts. The national-patriots fulfilled their task--with the aid of meetings, by storming government buildings, through extremist slogans, etc. Now the republic's leadership is faced with the task of neutralizing the national-patriots. Having analyzed the conflicts within the All-Tatar Public Center, the "Ittifak" Party and all the other subjects of the Tatar national movement, we may conclude that this process is close to its completion. In the opinion of observers, today the Tatar National-Patriotic Movement can only be saved by a striking personality, although not such an odious one as Fauziya Bayramova. However, it can also not be the former teacher of the history of the CPSU, and today president of one of the wings of the VTOTs [All-Tatar Public Center], Marat Mulyukov. Then again, if we take as truth the fact that the only constitution for the deputies of the Milli Mejlis is the Koran, then among them, who are besieging the buffet tables despite the fast which is to be observed during the current Islamic holy month of Ramazan, we will not be able to find such an individual.
