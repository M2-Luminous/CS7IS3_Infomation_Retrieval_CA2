FR940720-0-00013 FR940720-0-00001 III. Final Action_Changes Included in the Final Rule The NRC is amending its licensing, inspection, and annual fees for FY 1994. OBRA&hyph;90 requires that the NRC recover approximately 100 percent of its FY 1994 budget authority, including the budget authority for its Office of the Inspector General, less the appropriations received from the NWF, by assessing licensing, inspection, and annual fees. For FY 1994, the NRC's budget authority was originally $547.7 million. The Commission, in its effort to streamline operations, proposed a $12.7 million rescission to its original appropriation for FY 1994. Congress approved this NRC-proposed reduction. This resulted in a revised budget authority of $535.0 million. Approximately $22.0 million of the revised budget was appropriated from the NWF. Therefore, OBRA&hyph;90 requires that the NRC collect approximately $513.0 million in FY 1994 through 10 CFR part 170 licensing and inspection fees and 10 CFR part 171 annual fees. This amount to be recovered for FY 1994 is about $6 million less than the total amount to be recovered for FY 1993. The NRC estimates that approximately $120.1 million will be recovered in FY 1994 from the fees assessed under 10 CFR part 170. The remaining $392.9 million will be recovered through the 10 CFR part 171 annual fees established for FY 1994. The NRC has not changed the basic approach, policies, or methodology for calculating the 10 CFR part 170 professional hourly rate, the specific materials licensing and inspection fees in 10 CFR part 170, and the 10 CFR part 171 annual fees set forth in the final rules published July 10, 1991 (56 FR 31472), July 23, 1992 (57 FR 32691), and July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38666), with the following exceptions: (1) The Commission has reinstated the annual fee exemption for nonprofit educational institutions and (2) in this final rule, the NRC has directly assigned additional effort to the reactor and materials programs for the Office of Investigations, the Office of Enforcement, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, and the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste. Resources for these activities had previously been included in overhead but are now assigned directly to the class of licenses that they support. As a result of this direct assignment, the cost per direct FTE is about 3 percent less than it would have been without the additional direct assignment. Under this final rule, fees for most materials and fuel cycle licensees will increase because_
