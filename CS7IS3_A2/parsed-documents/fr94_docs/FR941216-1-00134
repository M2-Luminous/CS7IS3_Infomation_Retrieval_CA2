FR941216-1-00134 FR941216-1-00012 (f) Flashlights and lanterns. Flashlights and hand lanterns powered by low-voltage dry cell batteries and miners' cap lamps, approved as ``Permissible'' by the United States Bureau of Mines or, for class I hazardous locations, by Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc., or other nationally recognized testing agencies, may be used in both class I and class II hazardous locations. ยง184.161 Lightning protection. When lightning protection systems are installed, the installation, inspection, and maintenance shall be in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association, Lightning Protection Code, 17 at a minimum. 17 See footnote 12 to ยง184.259. ยง184.162 Static electricity and grounding. (a) Detailed discussions of the hazards of static electricity and ways of reducing it are published by the National Fire Protection Association, Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc., the United States Department of Commerce, and the Bureau of Mines, U.S. Department of the Interior. Where static spark discharge may be hazardous, NFPA Standard No. 77, 18 Static Electricity, shall apply except as otherwise specified herein. 18 See footnote 12 to ยง184.259.3 (b) Grounding of equipment. Bonding straps shall bridge contact points where oil, paint, or rust could disrupt electrical continuity. Permanent equipment in contact with conductive floors or tabletops is not considered adequately grounded. Static grounds shall not be made to gas, steam, or air lines, dry pipe sprinkler systems, or air terminals of lightning protection systems. They may be made to water pipes, ground cones, buried copper plates, driven ground rods, or to down-conductors of lightning protection systems. All grounds shall be interconnected if a structure is equipped with a lightning protection system. Metallic bonding and grounding cables, straps, or clamps shall be compatible with the explosives being processed. (c) Belts. Conductive belting shall be used wherever static is a hazard. Such belting shall have a resistance to ground not exceeding 600,000 ohms. Static combs shall not be used to drain off static generated from belting or pulleys used in the presence of hazardous concentrations of explosives dust or flammable vapors. (d) Testing equipment grounds. Grounding systems shall be tested for electrical resistance and continuity when installation has been completed and, in the case of active equipment, at locally determined intervals. The ground systems of equipment inactive longer than 1 month shall be tested for resistance and continuity before reactivation. All exposed explosive or hazardous materials shall be removed before testing. All test records should be kept. In ground-resistance testing, equipment should be considered as a unit. All conductive parts of equipment shall be grounded so that resistance does not exceed 25 ohms, unless 10 ohms is required for lightning protection. To ensure compliance with ohmic requirements, resistance of the belting is to be excluded in measuring the total resistance to ground for belt-drive machinery. The rate of static generation should be considered before changes in grounding systems are made. (e) Conductive floors. Conductive floors and conductive shoes shall be used for grounding personnel at operations with exposed explosives with electrostatic sensitivity of 0.1 joule or less, such as primer, initiator, detonator, igniter, tracer, and incendiary mixtures. Materials sensitive to static sparks, easily ignited or detonated, include lead styphnate, lead azide, mercury fulminate, tetrazene, diazodinitrophenol, potassium chlorate-lead styphanate mixtures, igniter compositions, grade B magnesium powder, and exposed layers of black powder dust. Dust from solid propellants can be ignited from spark energy, making conductive floors and shoes necessary where such dust is present. Air and dust mixtures of ammonium picrate, tetryl, tetrytol, and solid propellants are also sensitive to static electricity discharge. Many flammable liquids and air mixtures tested (ethyl ether, ethyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, acetone, and gasoline) can be ignited by human static discharge. Therefore, areas where personnel might come into contact with the kinds of explosives or mixtures enumerated above shall be equipped with conductive floors, except when the hazards of dust/air or flammable vapor/air mixtures are eliminated by adequate housekeeping, dust collection, ventilation, or solvent recovery methods. (1) Conductive floors are also required when operations involve the following: (i) Exposed electro-explosive devices such as squibs, detonators, primers, etc. (ii) Electrically initiated items, such as rockets, with exposed circuitry. (iii) Hazardous materials that could be ignited by human static discharge. (2) When a hazard remains localized, conductive floors and footwear are not required throughout an entire building or room. In such cases, conductive mats or runners may be used. These mats and runners shall meet all the specifications and test requirements that apply to conductive floors. (f) Conductive floor specifications. Conductive floors, made of nonsparking materials such as lead, conductive rubber, or conductive flooring compositions, shall meet the following requirements: (1) The flooring and its grounding system shall provide for electrical resistance not to exceed 1 million ohms. (2) The surface of the installed floor shall be free from cracks and reasonably smooth, and the material shall not slough off, wrinkle, or buckle under operating conditions. Conductive tiles are not recommended for areas where explosives dust can cause contamination, because the large number of joints, and the tendency of tiles to loosen, create areas where explosives dust can lodge, not amenable to normal cleanup procedures. Where conductive floors and shoes are required, the resistance of conductive shoes on a person plus the resistance of floor to ground shall not exceed 1 million ohms total. Tabletops used with exposed explosives or dusts should be covered with a properly grounded conductive material meeting the same requirements as those for the flooring. The conductive floors shall be compatible with the particular materials to be processed. (g) Initial tests of conductive floors shall be followed by others at least semiannually. The test results shall be permanently recorded. Testing shall proceed only when the room is free from exposed explosives and flammable gas mixtures. (1) The resistance of the floor shall be more than 5,000 ohms in areas with 110 volts service and 10,000 ohms in areas with 220 volts service, and less than 1 million ohms in all areas as measured between a permanent ground connection and an electrode placed at any point on the floor and also as measured between two electrodes placed 3 feet apart at any points on the floor. Measurements shall be made at five or more locations in each room and at least two of the points shall be heavily trafficked areas. If the resistance during a measurement changes appreciably with time, the value observed after the voltage has been applied for about 5 seconds shall be considered to be the measured value. These resistance values do not apply to metallic floors. (2) The operation and maintenance of test instruments shall be entrusted to competent personnel. (h) Humidification. Humidification that maintains relative humidity above 60 percent effectively prevents static electricity accumulations and subsequent discharges. This technique involves pre-operational checks and regular monitoring of the humidity levels throughout the day. It cannot be used with metallic powders, some pyrotechnical mixtures, and other materials susceptible to spontaneous ignition in air with 60 percent relative humidity. (i) Ionization. Ionization is electrical neutralization and serves as an effective method of removing static charges from certain processes and operations. Methods of application can be found in NFPA Standard 77, Static Electricity. (j) Neither ionization or humidification may be substituted for conductive floors (where required).
