FBIS4-31509 "dreeu112_h_94014" FBIS-EEU-94-112 Daily Report 11 May 1994 HUNGARY Authorities Raid Illegal Radio Studio Authorities Raid Illegal Radio Studio 94CH0268C Budapest NEPSZABADSAG in Hungarian 11 May 94 p 7 94CH0268C Budapest NEPSZABADSAG Hungarian CSO [Text] Last night, locator vehicles of the Communication Authority identified the illegal broadcasting station of Radio Tilos [Forbidden] in a Budapest apartment on Sziv Street. The police took action, whereupon the representative of the Communication Authority initiated action against an unknown offender for the violation of the press ordinance. As one might recall, Radio Tilos also submitted a bid to launch a local radio station, but the Ministry of Culture and Public Education rejected their bid, together with those of two other community stations. Radio Tilos announced at that time that it would resume its illegal broadcasts. Dr. Eva Balla, leading attorney of the Communication Authority, told NEPSZABADSAG that according to a law, broadcasting without a studio permit requires the involvement of the police and the initiation of proceedings. She said that in the course of yesterday's action it did not come to atrocities, but she regretted that the operators of Radio Tilos refused all cooperation. Thus, criminal proceedings must be started ex officio, and as a result, on the basis of the current law, Radio Tilos will not be able to receive a broadcasting permit for three years. Incidentally, the attorney does not understand why the community station was not granted a permit, because it would have been an colorful addition on the air. (We were unsuccessful in our attempts to interview the illegal radio operators about the events.) We reported in our Monday issue that the Fiksz [Fix] Club wanted to hold a street demonstration to protest the fact that the Ministry of Culture and Public Education [MKM] refused them access to the files of frequency application cases. At the MKM we learned that only access to the files of other petitioners was refused.
