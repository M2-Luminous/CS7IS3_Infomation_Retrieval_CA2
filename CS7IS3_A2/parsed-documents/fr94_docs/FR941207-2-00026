FR941207-2-00026 FR941207-2-00019 [Docket No. CP95&hyph;103&hyph;000] Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, CNG Transmission Corporation, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation; Application December 1, 1994. Take notice that on November 29, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), P.O. Box 2511, Houston, Texas 77252&hyph;2511, CNG Transmission Corporation (CNG), 445 West Main Street, Clarksburg, West Virginia 26301, and National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National Fuel), 10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo, New York 14203, collectively referred to as Applicants, jointly filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;103&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, for permission and approval to abandon an exchange service rendered pursuant to Tennessee's Rate Schedule X&hyph;50, CNG's Rate Schedule X&hyph;10, and National Fuel's Rate Schedule X&hyph;8, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Applicants state that this exchange service was authorized on August 10, 1972 in Docket No. CP72&hyph;203, and amended on July 29, 1976. It is further stated, that this service was performed under the terms of an exchange agreement dated October 28, 1975; under which CNG and National Fuel agreed to deliver up to 15,000 Mcf of natural gas per day to Tennessee. National Fuel would deliver for its affiliate, The Sylvania Corporation, a percentage of the volumes of natural gas from production at the Raisch Unit in the Adrian Pool to Tennessee's 24-inch line through CNG's 1 existing facilities in Steuben County, New York, and receive in turn equivalent volumes of natural gas from Tennessee for the account of Sylvania Corporation at the Ellisburg delivery point in Potter County, Tennessee. All gas delivered to Tennessee by CNG would be considered gas delivered for the account of National Fuel until such time as CNG had returned to National Fuel the volumes of gas reserves owned by Sylvania in the Raisch Unit. 1 CNG's legal name was previously Consolidated Gas Supply Corporation (until 1980) and Consolidated Gas Transmission Corporation (until 1988). No facilities are proposed to be abandoned in this proceeding. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before December 22, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for the Applicants to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
