He reminded of the prevailing opinion in the party council, which is opposed to the party remaining in the coalition: [Begin Peterle recording] In keeping with the obligation by the council, we are working on the possibility of either staying or leaving the government. The latter possibility is definitely stronger. As you will recall, we demanded that Jansa and the Social Democrats be in the government. Once they leave the government, the roughly balanced formula will break down. We have repeated, on several occasions, that we do not intend to stay in the government at all costs and in anybody's company. [end recording]
