Components made of organic materials are of particular interest here. A thin polymer film is to be used for making these components. It will be constructed in two or three separate layers depending on its functions. This polymer film will be between two electrodes made of inorganic materials. The charge-transfer and light-emitting substances will be synthetically produced. The new kind of thin-film construction is to be combined with typical components for system design. At the same time systems will be developed by means of which inner boundaries can be characterized. Mastery of the structure of these boundaries, which are important for transfer processes, is a central mission they say. According to the scientists, still more basic research will have to follow in order to be able to understand the film structures on the molecular scale, changes in them under strong current, and their meaning for charge transfer and luminescence. The merits of ultrathin films lie in their light weight, their pliability and the size of the components that can be made from them. Flat viewing screens measuring several square meters are being conceived of.
