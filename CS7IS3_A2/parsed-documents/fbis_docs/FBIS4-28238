He was speaking during a visit to Western Australia where he was attending a handing over ceremony near Fremantle of the newest Pacific patrol boat to the Fijian Defense Forces. The boat is the 17th built in Australia under a project involving 11 Pacific island nations. Mr. Rabuka says the patrol boat program has a direct bearing on endeavors to strengthen Fiji's economic security, its fight against illicit drugs and contraband, and protection of its marine resources. The Fiji prime minister says the handing over of the boat is a significant event in the bilateral and cooperative approach that Australia and Fiji are adopting in developing their region. Mr. Rabuka says it also symbolizes a firm and abiding commitment by Canberra and Suva to continue to build on a strong friendship based on common and mutual interests in the South Pacific.
