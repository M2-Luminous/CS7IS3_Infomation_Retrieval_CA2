Gasanov arrived here this morning for a three-day official visit as Qian's guest. Qian said, as long ago as 2000 years, the famous "silk road" built a friendship bridge between the two countries. After Azerbaijan's independence and the setting up of China-Azerbaijan diplomatic ties, the bilateral relations have entered a new phase of development. In the past two years the two sides have built up ties in every field and on every level, and the bilateral relationship has got a good beginning, he said. Qian noted that China and Azerbaijan are both Asian countries, and that they share common interests on many fronts. China will try to develop long-term and steady relations with Azerbaijan on the basis of the five principles of co-existence, Qian said. The country will, with the help of Azerbaijan, enrich China- Azerbaijan ties and expand the mutually beneficial co-operation in economy, trade, technology and culture. "We support Azerbaijan in its efforts to maintain its independence and sovereignty, and in its efforts to develop its economy," Qian said. China is also willing to expand its co-operation with Azerbaijan in world affairs, he said, adding that the country supports all efforts aimed at bringing reasonable and peaceful settlements to hot-spots the world over. Gasanov expressed agreement with Qian's view. He said his country attaches importance to its relations with China and that it is willing to expand its friendly ties of co-operation with China in every field. During the meeting Gasanov briefed Qian on the latest developments in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Qian expressed deep concern about the escalating conflict and the heavy casualties and material losses it has incurred. China holds that country-to-country conflicts should be settled through peaceful negotiations, Qian said. It sincerely hopes the parties concerned will settle the conflict through negotiations as soon as possible. This is not only in the interests of the two peoples but conducive to the region's peace and development. "We are willing to promote, with the joint efforts of all sides, the proper settlement of the conflict at an early date," Qian stressed. Qian also briefed Gasanov on China's ties with other member countries of the Commonwealth of Independence States. After the meeting Qian and Gasanov signed four agreements on behalf of their respective governments: An agreement on consultations between the two foreign ministries, a consular agreement, an agreement on visa exemption for public service passport holders, and an agreement on visa exemption tourist groups.
