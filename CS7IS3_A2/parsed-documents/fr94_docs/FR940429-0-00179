FR940429-0-00179 FR940429-0-00015 Every institution that requests a reduction must also demonstrate that it has provided Title IV, HEA program funds to its students based on the academic-year requirements in section 481(d) of the HEA since July 23, 1992, as the requirements became applicable to the various Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes institutions must have made a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of the statute. Institutions that did not comply with the law should not now expect to receive a temporary waiver. Changes: A new ยง668.3 is established, under which, for the purpose of awarding Title IV, HEA funds, the Secretary may reduce the length of an academic year for an institution that submits a written request to the Secretary. The request must identify each educational program for which a reduced academic year is requested and specify the requested length, which may not be less than 26 weeks of instructional time. The Secretary considers requests for reducing an academic year only for educational programs at institutions that provide 2-year and 4-year programs leading to associate degrees or baccalaureate degrees, respectively. In addition, an institution must demonstrate that it has provided Title IV, HEA program funds to its students based on the academic-year requirements in section 481(d) of the HEA since July 23, 1992. In addition, for an institution that currently has an academic year of less than 30 weeks and demonstrates that it is in the process of changing to a 30-week academic year, the Secretary will grant a reduction for a period not to exceed two years. For an institution that meets all of the above requirements other than demonstrating a commitment to changing to a 30-week academic year, the Secretary may grant a reduction for a limited period, on a case-by-case basis, The Secretary considers such factors as approval of the academic year for each educational program by the institution's accrediting agency or State body that legally authorizes the institution to provide postsecondary education, the number of hours of attendance and other coursework that a full-time student is required to complete in the academic year, and any unique circumstances that justify granting the institution's request. Comments: Some commenters supported the proposed definition of a week as a seven-day period of instructional time in which one day of regularly scheduled instruction, examination, or preparation for examination occurs. Some commenters argued that the standard of one day a week was too lax and susceptible to abuse. One commenter suggested that the minimum standard for one week of instructional time should be revised to require one instructional hour per week. Another commenter suggested that the definition of an academic year should be based on the total number of days of scheduled instruction. Discussion: The Secretary agrees with those commenters who were concerned that the proposed definition of a week of instructional time was susceptible to abuse. Based on these comments and on information the Secretary has received regarding abuses in this area, the Secretary believes that the standard of one regularly scheduled instructional day per week needs to be increased to five days of regularly scheduled time per week for educational programs using credit hours and not using a semester, trimester, or quarter system. Under the proposed definition published in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, institutions could structure programs that do not use clock hours or standard academic terms to provide one class a week and permit those classes to be ``made up'' later in the program, in order to maximize the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution. Changes: A change has been made. For an educational program using credit hours but not using a semester, trimester, or quarter system, the Secretary considers a week of instructional time to be any week in which at least five days of regularly scheduled instruction, examinations, or preparation for examinations occurs. A corresponding change has been made to the definition of an eligible program . Comments: A number of commenters suggested that instructional time should include internships. Some commenters suggested including other activities, such as periods of orientation, cooperative education, independent study, special studies, and research. Discussion: The Secretary agrees that internships, cooperative education programs, independent study, and other forms of regularly scheduled instruction can be considered as part of an institution's academic year. In most cases, research is not considered to be regularly scheduled instruction. Orientation programs do not provide educational instruction related to class preparation or examination and must not be included in determining the length of an academic year. Changes: None. Comments: Several commenters argued that the proposed academic year definition would make it difficult for institutions to develop creative programs that allow students to accelerate their educational programs. One commenter believed that, if the Secretary does not account for these types of programs, a student will no longer have an incentive to accelerate his or her educational program, and the Department will expend more Title IV, HEA program funds on longer periods of study. Discussion: Because the cost of a student's education includes living expenses in addition to the cost of tuition and fees, the Secretary believes that students who have an incentive to reduce their costs by accelerating their educational programs will still have a strong incentive to pursue a more concentrated or intensive course load. In addition, the Secretary will consider unique circumstance in determining whether to reduce the academic year for programs that are eligible for such consideration. Changes: None. Comments: A commenter suggested that the Secretary define two-thirds of an academic year as a minimum of 15 weeks of instructional time and one-third of an academic year as 10 weeks of instructional time in order to clarify the procedure for prorating the awards for students attending programs that are less than an academic year.
