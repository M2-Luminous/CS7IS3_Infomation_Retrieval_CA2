In this connection, the TRUD newspaper publishes opinions of some Georgian parliament members. All of them point to the importance of Yeltsin's arrival in Tbilisi. "Ruslan Beridze hopes that the sides will find ways for mutually advantageous relations during the visit," the newspaper stresses. "In addition, Russia, provided there is a desire, can play a decisive role in a just political settlement of the Abkhazian issue." However, the legislator claims, Georgia's admission to the rouble zone would mean for the republic the loss of a main attribute of an independent state -- national currency. In the opinion of Irina Starishvili, the solution of the Abkhazian-Georgian conflict entirely depends on Russia after Georgia joined the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). However, the legislator is against the rouble zone and believes that, even if Georgia joins it, the state will be unable to narrow the gap between prices and wages. "The Russian president's visit to Tbilisi may become one of the most difficult trips in Yeltsin's diplomatic career," the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes. "The rouble threatens to turn from a 'semi-currency' into a mixture of the Belarusian `hare' (Eds: the image of a hare is depicted on Belarusian currency) and the Ukrainian coupon. "Geopolitical successes turn to be futile as soon as attention is focussed on the domestic situation in Russia. Boris Yeltsin goes to the deadend of the Russian policy in the caucasus," the newspaper writes. "The signing of an agreement on the status of Russian border troops in Georgia will be an important element of the visit," the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper notes. "Let us hope that the agreement will put an end to numerous `misunderstandings' with respect to Russian servicemen." The newspaper calls attention to the fact that "short before the arrival of the Russian president, Eduard Shevardnadze issued personal orders to return immediately all flats to Russian Army officers, illegally seized by various armed detachments during the recent strife". Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev stressed in an exclusive interview with the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper on the eve of the Russian president's official visit to Georgia that "the military delegation will raise the question at the talks on the responsibility of nationalist extremist forces whose actions resulted in the death of Russian servicemen". The presidential elections in the Crimea is another important topic discussed by Russian newspapers. In the opinion of the IZVESTIYA newspaper, "Crimeans saw the way out of the crisis in unification with Russia" by electing Yuriy Meshkov as president. "The implementaton of Meshkov's election platform -- accession to the rouble zone, payment of pensions and wages in roubles, a referendum on the status of the Crimea, solution of the problem of the Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol and establishment of a new union state -- will depend on the extent to which the new president will find a common language with statesmen from Kiev and Moscow and the extent to which his proposals will be economically feasible." The newspaper stresses that "two issues -- the problem of Crimean Tatars and the status of the Crimea -- will be sources of tension which the new president will find impossible to avoid or put off". Touching on the coming meeting between Crimean President Meshkov and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA expresses opinion that "Meshkov ducks the question on the need for holding a Crimean referendum on independence. "He also avoids the question of concluding a treaty with Russia on duel citizenship. Local analysts believe that the Crimean president will not change anything in relations with Ukraine in order to avoid unnecessary confrontation," the newspaper writes. "It becomes evident that it will be difficult for Meshkov to implement his election promises." Writing on the same topic, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA notes that "there is no need for dramatising the departure of Bagrov (Eds: Bagrov was a presidential candidate and former speaker of the Crimean parliament before presidential elections) from the political scene. "Meshkov clearly intimated to journalists and voters the next day after his election as president that his position on the key political and economic problems of the Crimea would not differ much from that of his former rival. "He does not intend to make a drastic reshuffling of the government and administrative structures as well as to exacerbate relations with Kiev and hence "to join" the Crimea to Russia." "What is the explanation for the present wave of crime?" This question was addressed to St. Petersburg citizens by the sociological research centre in the city. As many as 40 per cent of respondents attributed rampant crime to dropping living standards, the same number -- to passivity of authorities, 36 per cent -- to the loss of ideals and morals and 30 per cent -- lack of discipline as well as law and order. Publishing the results of the poll, the SANKT PETERBURGSKIE VEDOMOSTI newspaper notes that, although citizens did not single out specially one of the reasons, growing numbers of respondents point to the loss of moral ideals with every passing year. The VECHERNIY PETERBURG newspaper reports that the St. petersburg procurator's office issued a charge against Viktor Kharchenko, the former president of the Baltic shipping line joint stock society. Despite expectations of his numerous supporters, the ex-president of the joint stock society faces "an array" of articles from the criminal code, providing criminal responsibility for abuse of power and office, negligence, forgery, evasion of tax payments in large sums and, last but not least, embezzlement of state and public property on a large scale.
