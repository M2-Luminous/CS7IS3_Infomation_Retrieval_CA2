Under the bilateral status of forces agreement, the U.S. Forces are required to cover 75 percent of compensation payments, while the Japanese Government covers the remaining 25 percent. The Defense Facilities Administration Agency and the Foreign Ministry will soon launch negotiations with the U.S. Forces on how to deal with Washington's fiscal constraints, the officials said. In February last year, the Supreme Court dismissed demands by residents near Yokota Air Base in Tokyo for banning night and early morning flights there, but awarded them 112 million yen in compensation for noise pollution in the past, upholding two lower court decisions. Tokyo, after having paid 160 million yen, including interest, to some 128 Yokota residents by last December, asked the U.S. Forces in March to refund their share of the sum, a demand which was rejected. On March 30 this year the Tokyo High Court, in another Yokota lawsuit, again rejected a ban on night flights but ordered the government to pay 724 million yen in compensation, including interest, to 596 residents near the base, acknowledging that the jet noise inconvenienced them. Both residents and the government accepted the ruling in April. Tokyo will soon urge the U.S. to shoulder its part of the burden for this case too, the officials said. They said the U.S. refusal to pay might be related to anticipated further compensation payments to noise victims near Atsugi Air Base in Kanagawa Prefecture. The Supreme Court, having created a precedent with its Yokota ruling, in February last year ordered the Tokyo High Court, which had turned down compensation claims by Atsugi residents, to hold a retrial over the issue.
