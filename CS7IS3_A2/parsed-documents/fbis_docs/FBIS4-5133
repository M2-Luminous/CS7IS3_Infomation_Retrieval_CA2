Memet says. "Golkar cannot force itself to stand diametrically opposed to the government under the pretext of defending the public interest, because that is essentially the role of the government," Yogi said at a working conference of the ruling political group. "Yet, on the other hand, Golkar must not ever become the government's mouthpiece in mobilizing support for its programs. "Golkar as a socio-political organization has a different function and mission than the government," he added. "Golkar must play out its role as the force that develops both the `bottom-up' and `top-down' approach to development," Yogi told the conference that is scheduled to wind up today. Golkar must have the courage to take a leadership role in many issues, he said. Golkar has been criticized by its opponents for its lack of independence from the government and the Armed Forces (ABRI). [passage omitted] In October, the group broke tradition by electing Harmoko, a civilian, rather than a military man, as chairman. Harmoko, better known a the information minister, has faced dissension from some regional Golkar leaders in recent months and this week's conference seeks to synchronize Golkar's programs in central and regional boards. Officials in Jakarta blamed this dissension on the lack of discipline of its members, a theme that was also hammered home by ABRI Chief General Feisal Tanjung in his address to the conference yesterday. Discipline is an essential criteria to measure the dynamics of an organization, Feisal said. "It must not be viewed as something which curbs freedom, creativity and human rights, but rather it is a measure of a mature behavior which keeps the organization solid and modern," he said. All Golkar members must obey the rulings and procedures underlined in Golkar's statutes, and they must remain loyal to any decisions which have been reached through consensus. This will prevent unnecessary dissension within Golkar in the future, he said. Harmoko himself has warned that the central executive board will not tolerate disciplinary problems and will punish members who step out of line. [passage omitted]
