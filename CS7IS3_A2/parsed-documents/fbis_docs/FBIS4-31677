He said that the protocol for the talks was agreed with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. Krajina official bodies will provide security at the talks. The official Krajina insignia will be displayed in Plitvice except in the conference hall. A single Croatian journalist will be allowed to attend the talks. This is based on the principle of reciprocity since one Krajina reporter was present at the recent talks in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. Asked about the implementation of the Zagreb agreement by the Republic of Croatia, Martic said that he discussed this with Butrus-Ghali's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, and with UNPROFOR's head of civil affairs in Sector South, Enrico Aguillar. Martic said he was given guarantees that Croatia will implement the provisions of the [Zagreb] agreement before the Plitvice round of talks. President Martic also commented on the latest statements by Croatian officials about the reintegration of Krajina into Croatia and their threats about a new war. We are closely following the situation and we are ready to respond to a possible Croatian reaction, Martic said, adding that he received guarantees in Geneva that such behavior by Croatia will be rigorously sanctioned by international factors. The talks in Plitvice will primarily deal with economic issues based on the principle of reciprocity. Certain humanitarian issues should also be discussed, such as pensions blocked by the Republic of Croatia immediately after the outbreak of the war. In the long term there can be no permanent cooperation with Croatia without annulment of UN Security Council resolution 820 which left the Serb nation in the RSK in a specific kind of isolation, Martic said, adding that there can be no political and economic cooperation without the equality of the partners.
