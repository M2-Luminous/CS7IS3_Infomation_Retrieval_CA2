FBIS4-66040 "drweu103_o_94005" FBIS-WEU-94-103 Daily Report 26 May 1994 CYPRUS Further Denktas, Feissel Comments Further Denktas, Feissel Comments TA2605164594 Nicosia Bayrak Radio in Turkish 1530 GMT 26 May 94 TA2605164594 Nicosia Bayrak Radio Turkish BFN [Text] President Rauf Denktas said it is important to the Turkish Cypriot side that it be understood that there are ambiguities with regard to several issues in the confidence-building measures package. Denktas noted that the Turkish Cypriot side is pleased with the recognition that there are still issues that must be discussed. The president met with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's assistant special envoy to Cyprus, for approximately two hours today. In a statement to the press after the meeting, Denktas remarked that the noted ambiguous points must be clarified if the Turkish Cypriot side is to decide on its response to the 21 March nondocument document. Pointing out that there is a second important issue for the Turkish Cypriot side, Denktas noted that this consists of the fact that the nondocument document has been transformed into the UN secretary general's proposals. The Greek Cypriot side has been given the opportunity to hide behind this nonexistent document, Denktas noted, adding that this is a Byzantine trick. Denktas also stated that the ambassadors to Lefkosa [Nicosia] from the UN Security Council permanent member countries are aware that almost none of the Greek Cypriot political party leaders have accepted the confidence-building measures. In reply to a question, Denktas said the UN secretary general's report is being postponed in order to allow for the continuation of the work and not with ulterior motives. There are still aspects for discussion and benefits promised to the Turkish Cypriot side to be solidified and written down, Denktas added. He also hoped that the UN secretary general would act in a balanced way with regard to the report. Stressing that the Turkish Cypriot side never reached the point of saying yes or no, Denktas declared that, if necessary, the Council of Ministers will discuss the issue upon his return from Turkey. In his statement after the meeting, Feissel declared that some of the issues Denktas wanted clarified or confirmed were discussed during the meeting. Feissel did not specify of what these consist. He announced that he is waiting for a Turkish Cypriot response on a few key issues concerning the confidence-buidling measures and he did not receive any replies during today's meeting. Pointing out that the UN secretary general's report will soon be announced, Feissel described the current situation as the most advanced phase of the process and added that he will brief New York on the latest developments. Feissel concluded by saying that he will be in contact with Denktas both before and after the announcement of the report.
