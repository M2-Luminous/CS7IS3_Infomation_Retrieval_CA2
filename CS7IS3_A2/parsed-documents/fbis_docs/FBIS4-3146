FBIS4-3146 "drchi074_n_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-074 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 Economic & Agricultural Spokesman Views First Quarter Economic Performance Spokesman Views First Quarter Economic Performance HK1804115594 Hong Kong AFP in English 0902 GMT 18 Apr 94 HK1804115594 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [By Philippe Massonnet] [Text] Beijing, April 18 (AFP)--China's economy slowed slightly in the first quarter of the year but prices soared, making the government's goal of keeping growth and inflation below 10 percent this year hard to achieve. Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 12.7 percent in the first quarter to 862 billion yuan (99 billion dollars), against 14.1 percent in the same period last year, and 13.4 percent for the whole of 1993, according to the state bureau of statistics. The slowing of the economy is mainly due to weaker industrial growth and more reasonable levels of fixed capital investment, explained bureau spokesman Ye Zhen. Industrial production rose by 16 percent, compared to 25 percent in the first quarter of 1993, while output in heavy industry grew by 15.3 percent and light industry by 16.8 percent. Fixed capital investment -- largely responsible for last year's overheating of the economy which was controlled by austerity measures -- grew by 36.2 percent, or at half the speed of the same period last year. "Generally speaking, there was a drop in the number of local projects," said Ye. "Economic growth has indeed slowed slightly, but it is still running well above the eight or nine percent planned for this year, making the government's task practically impossible," said a western diplomat who specialises in economics. That opinion is shared by most Chinese experts, who reckon on 12 percent growth for the year. "Most worrying is the authorities' inability to control inflation, which is continuing to rise," added the diplomat. In other comments, Ye said, "the main problem is the price increase," referring to the 20-percent rise in prices across the country compared with just eight percent during the 1993 first quarter. In the 35 largest cities, inflation measured an average 24.6 percent, with Haikou in Hainan province in the south of the country, posting the worst result of 34.1 percent. Prices in Beijing rose by 24.1 percent, while Shanghai, China's most populous city, reported inflation of 23.3 percent. Retail sales rose by 25.2 percent, two to three points less than in the first quarter of last year. "We can control the price rises if the local governments implement the measures of the State Council," said Ye, adding that the income of individuals after inflation still rose by 9.3 percent for city dwellers in the first quarter, and by 13.1 percent for peasants. The government's other major problem is the unhealthy condition of state enterprises, which only increased production by 2.2 percent. Of these, 49.6 percent have lost money since the beginning of the year, said Ye. Only one third of state firms were in the same situation in the same period last year. Some saw production decrease because of bad management, while others were hit by fiscal reforms which favour enterprises which perform well, added the spokesman. But he vowed the government would press on with its liberalisation of the economy. "This year will be the year of reforms," he said.
