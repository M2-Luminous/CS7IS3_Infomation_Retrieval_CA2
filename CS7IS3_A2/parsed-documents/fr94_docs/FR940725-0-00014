FR940725-0-00014 FR940725-0-00003 There are approximately 723 Boeing Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 183 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. The inspections that were previously required by AD 90&hyph;01&hyph;07, and retained in this AD, take approximately 14 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these inspection requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $140,910, or $770 per airplane, per inspection cycle. The additional new inspections that are required by this AD will take approximately 82 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these inspection requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $825,330, or $4,510 per airplane, per inspection cycle. The modification required by this AD will take approximately 124 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts will be nominal in cost. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the modification requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,248,060, or $6,820 per airplane. Based on the above figures, the total cost impact of the inspection and modification requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,214,300, or $11,407 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The FAA recognizes that the modification will require a large number of work hours to accomplish. However, the 20,000-landings compliance time specified in paragraph (j) of this AD should allow ample time for the modification of all countersunk fasteners locations to be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39&hyph;6440 (55 FR 255, January 4, 1990), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), amendment 39&hyph;␣␣␣␣, to read as follows: 94&hyph;15&hyph;06 BOEING: Amendment 39&hyph;8977. Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;183&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 90&hyph;01&hyph;07, Amendment 39&hyph;6440. Applicability: Model 747 series airplanes, having line numbers 201 through 814 inclusive, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent reduced structural integrity of the fuselage, accomplish the following: Restatement of Requirements of AD 90&hyph;01&hyph;07, Amendment 39&hyph;6440 (a) For airplanes having line numbers 201 through 765: Conduct a high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspection to detect cracking of the lower lobe lap joints in the vicinity of the wing-to-body fairing, in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53A2312, dated June 12, 1989; or Revision 1, dated March 29, 1990; or Revision 2, dated October 8, 1992; at the time specified in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), or (a)(4) of this AD, as applicable. Repeat this inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 4,000 landings until the inspection required by paragraph (e) of this AD is accomplished. (1) For airplanes that have accumulated less than 11,200 total landings as of February 5, 1990 (the effective date of AD 90&hyph;01&hyph;07): Prior to the accumulation of 11,000 total landings or within the next 1,000 landings after February 5, 1990, whichever occurs later. (2) For airplanes that have accumulated 11,200 or more total landings but less than 15,201 total landings as of February 5, 1990 (the effective date of AD 90&hyph;01&hyph;07):
