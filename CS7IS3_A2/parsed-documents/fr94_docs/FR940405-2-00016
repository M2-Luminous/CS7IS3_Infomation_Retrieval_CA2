FR940405-2-00016 FR940405-2-00007 In addition, Krupp argues that the Department itself declared the rates established in this preliminary determination ``no longer in effect,'' in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Certain Stainless Steel Sheet and Strip Products from the Federal Republic of Germany, 48 FR 20459 (May 6, 1983). Krupp goes on to argue that the Court in Krupp I would have found Krupp's challenge to the Department's petition-based preliminary BIA margin to be ripe for review if the Court thought that the preliminary determination ``could determine the final liquidation rate for Krupp's entries, notwithstanding a final determination.'' The Petitioner states that application of the 27 percent rate in this case represents a reasonable exercise of the Department's discretion to determine, on a case-by-case basis, what is the best information available. The Petitioner argues that 19 CFR 353.37(b) provides for the use of petition information as BIA. The Petitioner further contends that, as discussed in Rhone Poulenc, the statute provides for the Department to presume that the highest prior margin is the most probative when a company is non-responsive to the Department's requests for information, otherwise, the respondent would have provided current information demonstrating that the current margin is less. The Petitioner argues that such a presumption must exist here since the respondent failed to comply with the Department's request for information and in fact destroyed all the records pertaining to the instant period of review. Department's Position: We disagree with Krupp's contentions that, in an LTFV investigation, a preliminary determination rate based upon the best information available_in this instance from information submitted in support of the petition_is not a legitimate margin and, thus, cannot be a ``prior margin'' which may serve as the basis for a final rate in an administrative review. To the contrary, an affirmative preliminary BIA rate, even if based on information submitted in support of the petition, results in the suspension of liquidation and the collection of cash deposits or bond. See section 733(d)(2) of the Tariff Act. In addition, in Daewoo Electronics Co., v. United States, 712 F. Supp. 931 (CIT 1989), the Court upheld the Department's determination that an LTFV preliminary margin serves as a provisional measures rate cap, with respect to merchandise entered between the dates of the preliminary and final determinations. See section 737(a) of the Tariff Act. In fact, because of the importance of the preliminary margin, the Department has promulgated regulations providing for the correction of clerical errors in preliminary determinations of sales at LTFV. See 57 FR 1131 (Jan. 10, 1992). Thus, a preliminary margin, whether it is a calculated rate or is a petition-based BIA rate, has legal force and effect. As such, it serves as a ``prior margin'' to the same extent as a final margin. In this respect, Krupp's reliance on Rhone Poulenc is misplaced. While the Federal Circuit did state that ``it reflects a common sense inference that the highest prior margin is the most probative evidence of the current margins,'' 899 F.2. at 1190, it placed absolutely no qualifications on what constituted the ``highest prior margin.'' The Court went on the explain that if this common sense inference were not so, ``the [respondent], knowing of the rule, would have produced current information showing the margin to be less.'' Id (emphasis in original). Notwithstanding its interpretation of the statutory language and legislative history, even Krupp admits that information submitted in support of the petition can be used as a BIA rate for an administrative review. See Public Hearing Transcript (Apr. 14, 1992) (Transcript) at 42&hyph;43. Krupp, however, attempts to qualify the use of such information by arguing that the petition-based BIA rate must also be the final determination rate of the LTFV investigation. In other words, if the preliminary determination is a BIA rate based on information from the petition but is ``carried forward'' to the final determination, then it becomes a ``prior margin.'' Transcript at 43. Once this has occurred, then according to Krupp, the petition-based BIA rate may serve as the basis for a BIA rate in an administrative review. Id. Such reasoning, however, is based on the faulty premise that a preliminary margin is not a ``real'' margin, and thus cannot be a ``prior margin.'' However, as explained above, a preliminary margin is an actual margin to which legal consequences attach and, thus, is as much a ``prior margin'' as the rate for the final determination. Thus, Krupp's ``carried forward'' theory must be rejected as being without legal foundation.
