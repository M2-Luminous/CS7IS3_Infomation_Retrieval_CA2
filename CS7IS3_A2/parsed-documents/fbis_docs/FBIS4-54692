Karadzic held over three hours of talks in Pale with Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special envoy, and after the talks expressed satisfaction with the outcome. "This is a very good example of cooperation, for we achieved significant progress at the talks today. Primarily, we cleared some problematic aspects of the situation in Sarajevo, Gorazde, and Brcko," Karadzic told reporters. "We offered the Muslim side a truce in the Brcko area, and if they do not accept, it we shall implement it unilaterally. If the Muslims agree to the deployment of military observers on both sides in the Brcko region, it will be a good example of a preventative action aimed at ending the crisis," Karadzic said. Yasushi Akashi said they agreed to continue work on the stabilization of the overall situation, in particular in Gorazde, in accordance with an agreement reached in Belgrade. "We also discussed the events around Tuzla and Brcko, where some military movements have been registered," Akashi said.
