No sooner had 1994 dawned on this land of politics-preoccupied people than they began to talk about the local elections, aided by the speculation, gossip and even idle chat being circulated widely as "political news" in newspapers and on television. There have been suggestions that the government and ruling party will scrap the current system of special cities, like Seoul and Pusan, merging them with rural areas and redrawing election districts in a Korean version of gerrymandering. Immediately, vehement charges were leveled against what apparently was a balloon floated by someone to test the reaction, mainly from opposition parties, to the idea of redistricting. There have also been reports that the government and ruling party are planning to reshuffle provincial governors and large city mayors soon in an attempt to put them in advantageous positions in preparation for the local elections. Surprised at how quickly their political game overheated, the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) and main opposition Democratic Party (DP) hastily called party postholder meetings Tuesday and declared that "It is undesirable to go into the election campaigns already." There are too many items on the political agenda that require immediate attention, they said. But there is a gulf between the DLP and the DP in their views on what they have to do right now and what they would do for the local elections. The ruling party says what it has to do now is to carry out the national policy of President Kim Yong-sam smoothly and help him to strengthen the nation's economic competitive power in the era of globalization. At the same time, the ruling party is tacitly showing that its electoral strength is not so "weak" that it needs to redraw the boundaries of administrative districts. DLP Secretary-general Mun Chong-su said that if his party and the government succeed in reforming and boosting the competitive power of the country, they can even win the mayoral election in Seoul, traditionally a bulwark of the opposition. Meanwhile, the DP has picked three major issues -- inflation, the North Korean nuclear question, and the effects of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations -- as needing quick solutions. In order to discuss these issues, the DP is demanding that the National Assembly hold an extraordinary session in January. The reason for the DP to show a sharp reaction to any suggestion of administrative redistricting is because it is wary of the purpose behind the move by the ruling party and the government, rather than the redistricting itself. Rep. Cho Se-hyong, a member of the Supreme Council of the Democratic Party, alleged that Kim Yong-sam helped "overheat" the election atmosphere from January 1992 in order to win the preidential election that December. "Local elections have to be held normally," he said, without elaborating on what he meant by "normally." In any event, the DP believes that there is a strong possibility that the ruling party and government will redraw the administrative districts in order to put themselves in a better position for the local elections. The DP bases its belief on the fact that Choe Yang-pu, who was recently appointed senior presidential secretary for agricultural affairs, published a book in 1988 that advocates rational administrative redistricting, merging large cities with rural areas. The gist of his idea was to form one special city and 16 provinces. The opposition, while protesting the move for administrative redistricting, is already working on countermeasures, party sources said.
