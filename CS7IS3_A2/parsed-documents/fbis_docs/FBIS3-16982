A ministry official told ITAR-TASS that an official statement of the Foreign Ministry on the matter will follow soon. The catastrophe killing 34 people occured when a Tehran-bound Iranian cargo plane instead of entering the Armenian airspace suddenly changed course due to unknown reasons and hit the ground several miles off Stepanakert, the administrative centre of the disputed Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan.
