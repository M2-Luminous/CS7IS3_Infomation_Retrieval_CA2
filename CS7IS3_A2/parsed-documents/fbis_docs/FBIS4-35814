These people have been given temporary identification cards within the framework of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. He said that every citizen outside the homeland can return. Regarding travel, every citizen who wants to travel abroad has a right to do so without a permit from the self-rule area. Al- Qidrah emphasized that the magnetized ID cards will be abolished in the near future because they are inapplicable in the self-rule area, which now enjoys special powers under the Palestinian National Authority. Engineer Furayj Ahmad al-Khayri, official in charge of the Coordination Committee, said that every time his committee meets with the Israeli counterpart he calls for going back to the rules that were valid before the closure of the Gaza Strip on 29 March 1993, including travel rights for girls under 16 years old and people older than 50 without obtaining permits. He said that these measures are no longer necessary because we now live in a stage of peace, which we as Palestinians recognize. The Israeli side should treat us accordingly, he said. Al-Khayari stressed that trade and economy in the Gaza Strip are in a state of collapse as a result of the occupation. We are doing all we can to build a stable economy and trade to encourage Palestinian, Arab, and foreign financiers to invest. He noted that without Israeli encouragement and confidence there can be no progress. He said that university professors and students should not be denied permits to join their universities and that such pressure will turn them from advocates of peace in the West Bank into fighters confronting the occupation. He added that we want to live in peace.
