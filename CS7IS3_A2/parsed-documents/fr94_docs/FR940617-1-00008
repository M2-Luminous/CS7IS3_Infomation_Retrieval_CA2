FR940617-1-00008 FR940617-1-00002 Under the amended section 8 of the Act, the maximum rate of assessment was raised from 10 cents to 20 cents per case of commercial eggs. The actual assessment rate is prescribed by the Egg Research and Promotion Order and is currently 5 cents per case. Producers owning 30,000 or fewer laying hens are exempt from paying assessments and other provisions of the Act. Section 12 of the Act was amended to increase the exemption level to 75,000 or fewer hens. A proposed rule to raise the exemption level in the Order was published in the Federal Register on March 22, 1994. The new exemption level will become effective after publication of the final rule. The Act amendments provide that AEB may recommend an increase in the assessment rate to the Secretary. The recommendation must be based on a scientific study, marketing analysis, or other evidence demonstrating a need for the increase. Consequently, AEB conducted a marketing analysis and evaluated the advertising and nutrition research programs. Advertising AEB began its first advertising campaign in 1977. For the next 3 years, media expenditures averaged $3.5 million annually. In 1980, the American Association of Advertising Agencies noted that, during that 3-year period, per capita consumption of eggs had increased and consumer attitudes toward eggs had improved. Considering inflation, an estimated $9 million would be required for AEB to conduct a media program in 1994 comparable to that in 1977. Further, because consumers have grown more concerned with a variety of issues affecting egg consumption, an even greater level of funding would be needed to achieve the same results today. AEB's analysis establishes that egg consumption has been steadily declining over many years. In fact, USDA statistics show that per capita consumption dropped from 402 in 1945 to 234 in 1993. In general, the decline is attributed to fewer egg-consuming households and less frequent egg consumption. Eggs face certain barriers in the marketplace which have contributed to the declining consumption. Considered by consumers to be primarily a breakfast food, eggs must compete with a variety of breakfast alternatives: cold cereal; pancakes and waffles; rolls, muffins, and toast; and hot cereal. The total measured media spending for the breakfast food category was $937 million in 1993. Egg industry advertising-including that funded by AEB, State and regional associations, and companies promoting name brands-represents only 0.7 percent of that amount. In addition, consumer concerns with fat and cholesterol have significantly affected consumer eating habits. The judgment that eggs are high in cholesterol has further contributed to consumers using fewer eggs. Overcoming negative consumer attitudes is even more difficult when other breakfast foods are more heavily promoted. AEB's current advertising strategy is three-fold: (1) Educate consumers about eggs and cholesterol by providing facts on egg cholesterol in a healthy diet; (2) remind consumers how much they love the great taste of eggs; and (3) connect eggs with the rich, pleasurable associations people have with eggs and egg-eating occasions. The current ``I Love Eggs'' advertising campaign based on this strategy proved effective in consumer testing. Prior to being exposed to the advertising, 43 percent of consumers tested had extremely positive or very positive attitudes about eggs. This number increased by 13 percent after consumers were exposed to the advertising. Further, almost half of the consumers tested reported an increased likelihood of eating and serving eggs more often. With current funding, AEB has earmarked about $2.8 million for this campaign in 1995. This budget supports 15-second television commercials and 30-second radio spots. A 5-cent increase in the assessment rate would allow for an advertising budget of $7.5 million. This budget would enable the use of more effective 30-second television spots; allow advertising to be aired almost every other week, as opposed to the 10 weeks per year now; and provide for over 1,000 additional commercial announcements. Most significantly, an additional one million target households would be reached by AEB advertising each week. Nutrition Research The nutrition portion of AEB's budget encompasses two programs of importance both for the egg industry and the consuming public-nutrition research and nutrition education. In recent years, an increased amount of the AEB budget has been used for research to evaluate the effects of dietary cholesterol on plasma lipids. Since 1991, $1.3 million has funded research projects at various universities, all of which have focused on this issue. For example, a recently completed study was published in the April issue of the American Heart Association's ``Arteriosclerosis and Thrombosis'' journal. The results of this study found that blood cholesterol levels in young healthy men did not significantly increase when they were fed 1 or 2 eggs per day. Additional funding would allow the egg industry to study the same effects across other population groups. Increased funding also would allow AEB to expand its contacts with scientists, health professionals, and the media in developing nutrition materials, sponsoring scientific symposiums and related forums, and compiling research data.
