FR940317-1-00101 FR940317-1-00013 (d) If there is a remedy against the State and the State refuses to make payment, or there is insurance coverage and the claimant has filed an administrative claim against the United States, forward file with Tort Claim memorandum to the Commander, USARCS; include information on the status of any judicial or administrative action the claimant has taken against the State or its insurer. The Commander, USARCS will determine whether the claimant will be required to exhaust his or her remedy against the State or its insurer, or whether the claim against the United States can be settled without such requirement. If the Commander, USARCS, determines to follow the latter course of action, he or she will also determine whether an assignment of the claim against the State or its insurer will be obtained and whether recovery action will be taken. The State or its insurer will be given appropriate notification in accordance with State law necessary to obtain contribution of indemnification. §536.100 Claims against the ARNG tortfeasor individually. The procedures set forth in §536.29 are applicable. With respect to claims arising before 29 December 1981, an ARNG driver acting pursuant to the authorities cited in §536.94(a) is not protected by the provisions of the Drivers Act (28 U.S.C. 2670(b)); the driver may be sued individually in State court. When this situation occurs, it should be monitored closely by ARNG authorities. If possible an early determination will be made as to whether any private insurance of the ARNG tortfeasor is applicable. Where such insurance is applicable and the claim against the United States is doubtful validity, final actions will be withheld pending resolution of the demand against the NG tortfeasor. If, in the opinion of the claims approving or settlement authority, such insurance is applicable and the claim against the United States is payable in full or in a reduced amount, settlement efforts will be made either together with the insurer or singly by the United States as in §536.99(b). Any settlement will not include amounts recovered or recoverable as in §536.28. If the insurance is not applicable, settlement or disapproval action will proceed without further delay. §536.101 When claims must be presented. A claim may be settled under this subpart only if presented in writing within 2 years after it accrues, except that if it accrues in time of war or armed conflict, or if war or armed conflict intervenes within 2 years after it accrues, and if good cause is shown, the claim may be presented not later than 2 years after war or armed conflict is terminated. As used in this paragraph, war or armed conflict is one in which any Armed Force of the United States is engaged. The dates of commencement and termination of an armed conflict must be established by concurrent resolution of Congress or by determination of the President. §536.102 Where claims must be presented. A claim must be presented to the appropriate Federal agency. Presentment of a written claim to any full time officer or employee of the NG will be considered a receipt. However, the statute of limitations is tolled if a claim is filed with a State agency, the claim purports to be under the NGCA and it is forwarded to the Army within 6 months, or the claimant makes inquiry of the Army concerning the claim within 6 months. If a claim is received by a DA official who is not a claims approval or settlement authority under this regulation, the claim will be transmitted without delay to the nearest approval or settlement authority. §536.103 Procedures. (a) The form of a claim under this Act will be as described in §536.20 (d) and (e). (b) So far as they are not inconsistent with this subpart, the procedures set forth in subpart B, settlement procedures, will be followed in processing a claim under this subpart.
