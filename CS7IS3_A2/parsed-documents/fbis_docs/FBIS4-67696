However, the AIDS epidemic caught them there. Since 1984 30 persons have died from Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in the Province of Azuay. The first person in this series of deaths was an emigrant who returned from the United States with this deadly disease. About 20 persons having the HIV virus are being cared for at home or in health centers in Cuenca. Statistics add an additional 50 AIDS patients over the past decade in the Province of Azuay. Of this total 10 persons were infected with the virus in foreign countries, while the remaining 40 caught the disease in Ecuador. This reveals the growing danger of the epidemic. Oswaldo Munoz, chief of the Department of Epidemiology in the Directorate of Health of the Province of Azuay and professor of health at the University of Cuenca, considers that the Province of Azuay is one of the areas where the incidence of AIDS is a cause for concern, although the situation is less serious than in the Provinces of Guayas, Pichincha, and Manabi. Munoz said that about 90 percent of those who have died from AIDS or suffer from the disease are men, which is explained by the fact that sexual promiscuity is more frequent among men than among women. Although the Ministry of Health requires doctors to report cases of AIDS in a special way, it is impossible to be sure that the available, official information covers all of those suffering from the disease. However, it probably covers the majority of them. The Department of Epidemiology of the Directorate of Health of the Province of Azuay has personnel and an office exclusively devoted to following the AIDS situation. It even holds workshops and distributes reading material with instructions on how to prevent this disease which has so far turned out to be incurable. Munoz recalls that there is no vaccination or treatment for AIDS and recommends taking the only two valid precautions for preventing what is called the disease of the century: sexual fidelity and the use of condoms in extramarital intercourse. Professor Munoz is the author of a guide for family self-instruction on AIDS, a book published by the Ministry of Health under the auspices of the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization. The book contains basic information on the epidemic, its symptoms, and the population most at risk of contracting the disease, among other aspects. The persons suffering from AIDS who have been identified in the Province of Azuay belong to a number of social and economic groups, which proves that AIDS is a disease which is not limited to any special sector of society. Rather, it attacks all groups, without distinction. A high percentage of those infected are people who have traveled abroad in search of a better personal situation, particularly for economic reasons.
