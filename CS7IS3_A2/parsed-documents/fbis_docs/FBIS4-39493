Chernyshev, Ukrainian deputy minister of internal affairs and chief of the Main Administration of Internal Affairs in the Crimea, by Oleg Mashchenko; place and date not given: "My Militias Will Keep Me Safe?"] [Text] The proverb about too many cooks spoiling the broth is well known. We have not reached this number of law enforcement organs yet; for now there are just two of them. However, a common citizen may easily get a black eye on a dark street (or even a well-lit one). Services that are called upon to protect our peace and quiet have ended up dragged into the "tug-of-war" between Simferopol and Kiev against their will. The position of the Crimean authorities with regard to the edicts of L. Kravchuk has been repeatedly covered in the mass media organs. We suggest that the readers familiarize themselves with the opinion of Militia Colonel V. Chernyshev, Ukrainian deputy minister of internal affairs and chief of the Main Administration of Internal Affairs in the Crimea. [Mashchenko] Apparently, it would be legitimate to first learn some more detailed information about you personally. [Chernyshev] I, for one, am a native of Crimea. I was born and grew up here. I am an ethnic Russian. During the 22 years that I have served in the internal affairs organs, I have worked for 14 years on our native peninsula, in Bakhchisarayskiy and Belogorskiy Rayon departments, in various operational and command positions, including as chief of the rayon militia. In recent years, I have served as deputy chief of the department of Administration of Criminal Investigations and as first deputy chief of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD] Main Administration of Criminal Search. [Mashchenko] With a view to filtering out all manner of rumors and fantasies associated with the reorganization of the MVD of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, I would ask you to explain to the readers what the basis for the decisions in question was. [Chernyshev] I would like to note right away that not a single violation of the legislative acts in effect in both the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine was allowed to occur in the process of creating the Main Administration of Internal Affairs in the Crimea. If we turn to specific documents then, on the basis of Article 114-5, Point 7 of the Constitution of Ukraine, the president of the state is entitled to establish, reorganize, and liquidate ministries, departments, and other organs of state executive power in the territory of Ukraine. This is precisely why a reorganization, rather than the breakup of the MVD as certain politicians paint it; the Main Administration of Internal Affairs is a prerogative of the president of Ukraine. The edict of L. Kravchuk dated 18 May of this year is an absolutely lawful document. The crime situation that has remained extremely tense in the Republic of Crimea in recent years was the foundation for this step. Everybody is still talking about quite a number of bloody crimes committed here with the use of automatic weapons. The fact that some subunits, such as the waterway and railway militia that performed their official duties directly on the territory of the autonomous republic were actually managed from Kiev and other cities of Ukraine rather than by the Crimea MVD played quite a role in the reorganization of the Crimea MVD. The efforts of absolutely all Crimea law enforcement organs will now be coordinated by the Crimea Main Administration of Internal Affairs. The management of the militia will be in the strictest compliance with the letter of the law in view of the fact that previously the organs of internal affairs, obeying "pointers from on high," on occasion had to perform functions that are not characteristic of them. At the same time, the confirmation of Reserve Major General V. Kuznetsov in the nonexistent position of minister of internal affairs was conducted in gross violation of legislative acts currently in effect. According to Article 7 of the Ukrainian Law on the Militia and Point 8 of the Regulations on the Republic of Crimea MVD, such an action must mandatorily be coordinated with the Ukrainian minister of foreign affairs. [Mashchenko] Valeriy Serafimovich, how can you as a professional characterize the actions of Major General V. Kuznetsov in the course of leading the internal affairs organs on the peninsula? [Chernyshev] Mr. Kuznetsov is certainly a strong-willed, decisive person. This is not just my personal opinion but also that of the leadership of the Ukrainian MVD. However, we should note in particular that top-notch specialists who have an excellent knowledge of their jobs have been valued the most at all times and in all positions, to say nothing of leadership positions. Reserve Major General V. Kuznetsov does not have the special training that is necessary even for the rank-and-file employees of the internal affairs organs. He is not a lawyer; it is hard for him to make the only correct, legitimate decisions commensurate with the existing situation without any experience in work in the law enforcement organs and without the knowledge of legal legislation. This is not his personal fault. Undoubtedly, the militia must not be politicized. Incompetence brings about, putting it mildly, ill-conceived steps. Let us look, say, at the directive of General Kuznetsov dated 21 May on arming the personnel of the reorganized ministry and the internal affairs organs of the Crimea with automatic weapons and issuing bulletproof vests to personnel. Later followed the command to capture the unarmed servicemen of the Ukrainian National Guard who were on patrol in the vicinity of the TV and radio center in Simferopol, provide reinforced guard details for the buildings of the Supreme Soviet of the Crimea, banks, executive committees, and other important facilities. Unverified (?), simply put false information was the basis for making this crucial decision. It is easy to guess what the consequences of the actions of "Berkut" combatants, armed with assault rifles in the downtown of the main city of the Crimea, could have been. Irreparable events did not occur due only to the self-control of the militia personnel and servicemen of the National Guard of Ukraine. I would like to stress the need to be aware of the fact that the control of armed law enforcement units that continuously operate among the civilian population and accomplish the tasks of protecting public order and combating crime differs fundamentally from the rigid nature of commanding the troops whose most significant mission is to engage in combat. [Mashchenko] As an official, you must trust only the facts. Nonetheless, allow me to ask you a question that derives from rumors. They are talking about the alleged discontinuation of funding for the internal affairs organs of the Republic of Crimea, the forthcoming reshuffle of the cadres, and cutbacks in positions. What is the actual situation? [Chernyshev] I can state with the full weight of responsibility that these are instigative lies. The receipt of monetary funds from the Ukrainian MVD has not ceased. The account of the Crimea Main Administration of Internal Affairs has already been opened; the administration is being funded in amounts sufficient for ensuring its regular operations. This means that the payment of monetary allowances and other allotments to the personnel of the Crimean militia will be made in full, just as before. No unsubstantiated replacements of any kind will be made in the cadre staff. I will personally prevent any reprisals against functionaries fantasies on whose account currently interfere with their regular work. The objective of individuals who spread such disinformation is as clear as can be: to create an unhealthy, nervous situation within the ranks of the internal affairs organs. They are trying to set personnel against lawful decisions of the Ukrainian president, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the Ukrainian minister of internal affairs. A decision on these issues has also been made by the Ukrainian Collegium of the MVD. It says unambiguously that the staff positions of the reorganized Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Crimea will be kept in full within the structure of the Crimea Main Administration of Internal Affairs. The ranks and volume of position pay for our personnel will remain the same. Only the positions of minister and deputy ministers of internal affairs are not envisioned on the staff of the Main Administration of Internal Affairs in the Crimea. Just as before, social protection guarantees envisioned by legislation in effect cover all personnel. In summary, I would like to address all personnel of the internal affairs organs and residents of the Republic of Crimea, taking advantage of the present opportunity. I understand full well the complexity of the situation in which you are finding yourselves when they are trying to hold the militia hostage to someone else's political ambitions and confront it with the unnecessary choice of "who to obey?" Everything possible should be done in order to prevent the law enforcement organs from getting involved in political games; just as before, it is necessary for these organs to remain calm and restrained. At present, our main task is to make a deliberate, offensive effort to step up the fight against crime, and to uncover and put the harshest end to the activities of organized groups of malefactors. Our citizens and the guests of the beautiful land of the Crimea should be confident of their security, which the militia must guarantee for them. I would like to ask my comrades-in-arms to remain faithful to your oath and the tradition of the internal affairs organs.
