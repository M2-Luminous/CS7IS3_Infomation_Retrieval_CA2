L." report: "Alain Lamassoure Calls For Reduction of European Commission Powers"] [Text] An aftershock of the European election? An acknowledgement of the supposed hostility of some 23 percent of right-wing and extreme-right-wing French voters (those who chose the de Villiers and Le Pen lists) toward "Brussels' technocrats?" In any case, since recently, French officials have appeared rather forceful in their determination to take advantage of the 1996 intergovernmental conference on EU political and institutional reform to reduce the powers of the European Commission. "The status of the Commission as de facto exempt from any answerability" (in theory the European Parliament can censure it, but it has never seriously considered such a move) "is outdated, it is dead, it is no longer tolerated by the public," French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure told journalists on Monday 13 June. Speaking on the occasion of the meeting of the Twelve's Council of Ministers, Mr. Lamassoure explained that he did not mean to have the slate wiped clean, that there was much to preserve in the way the Community works, including institutionally, but that the current system had become unbearable, that it was obsolete, and that -- "a true innovation" -- the Commission must be made answerable both to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. This would not be the only reform, and the Commission's powers would be reduced even further. The French have been thinking of establishing, through the Council of Ministers, another authority which would be in charge of the Union's common foreign and security policy and would be headed by a personality with real powers and a clear brief. According to Mr. Lamassoure, the new treaty to be developed in 1996 as a replacement for the one devised in Maastricht should be subjected to a new referendum. "Only a referendum can alter what the people have instituted by means of a referendum; the idea is self-evident."
