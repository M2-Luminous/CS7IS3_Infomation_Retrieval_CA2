FR941031-2-00035 FR941031-2-00031 [Docket No. ER94&hyph;1633&hyph;000] Northern States Power Co.; Notice of Filing October 25, 1994. Take notice that October 14, 1994, Northern States Power Company (Minnesota) (NSP) tendered for filing an Amendment to Connection Agreement No. 53 between NSP and Cooperative Power Association (CPA). NSP has filed this amendment to clarify that the in-service date was September 9, 1994, rather than the tentative date which was stated in our original filing, September 14, 1994. Accordingly, NSP hereby submits its request that the Commission accept this Agreement for filing as of the in-service date of September 9, 1994. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 18 CFR 385.214). All such motions or protests should be filed on or before November 7, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
