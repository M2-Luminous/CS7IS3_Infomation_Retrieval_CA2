The Spring Festival is approaching, but some teachers have not received payment for their work for the entire year. The State Education Commission recently disclosed to the press that new progress has been made nationwide in paying the overdue salaries of primary and middle school teachers. However, ten provinces have made slow progress in this regard. It goes without saying that delaying payment for teachers' salaries is not allowed. Teachers put in a lot of hard work to impart knowledge and educate people. Certainly they deserve payment according to their work. No matter what causes the delay, it is unbearable and unreasonable in terms of common sense and reason. Today, when we value education and respect teachers more and more, such absurd phenomenon must not occur. In principle, the key to solving the problem lies in local governments, particularly major leaders. According to the regulations of China's "Compulsory Education Law," local party committees and governments entrusted with developing China's education are responsible for placing priority on developing education and on truly respecting teachers and valuing education; they also are responsible for taking resolute measures to ensure local input into education. Among these responsibilities is paying salaries to teachers in full and in a timely manner. Governments at all levels should pay close attention to solving this payment arrears problem within a specified time. This is not only an issue of attitude, but also relates to China's educational development. Since the central authorities repeatedly lay injunctions on localities to solve the problem of teachers' overdue salaries, some localities have moved slowly or even made various excuses to postpone action. This is absolutely not allowed. To strictly follow the arrangement made by the central authorities' relevant departments, to adopt feasible measures, and to ensure payment for teachers' overdue salaries by the Spring Festival so middle and primary school teachers can enjoy a happy Spring Festival -- these tasks should be handled thoroughly and importantly by party and government departments in those localities where teachers' overdue salaries have not been paid yet. It is hoped payment for teachers' salaries will no longer be delayed.
