FR940302-2-00049 FR940302-2-00032 [OPP&hyph;180921; FRL 4761&hyph;6] Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption to use Bifenthrin; Solicitation of Public Comment AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA has received a specific exemption request from the California Environmental Protection Agency (hereafter referred to as the ``Applicant'') to use the pesticide bifenthrin [CAS 82657&hyph;04&hyph;3 cis isomer and CAS 83322&hyph;02&hyph;5 trans isomer ] to treat up to 200,000 acres of cucurbits (cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, and squash) to control the sweet potato whitefly. In accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption. DATES: Comments must be received on or before March 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Three copies of written comments, bearing the identification notation ``OPP&hyph;180921,'' should be submitted by mail to: Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. In person, bring comments to: Rm. 1132, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA. Information submitted in any comment concerning this notice may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information.'' Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment that does not contain Confidential Business Information must be provided by the submitter for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice. All written comments filed pursuant to this notice will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1132, Crystal Mall No. 2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Andrea Beard, Registration Division (7505W), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. Office location and telephone number: Floor 6, Crystal Station #1, 2800 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, (703) 308&hyph;8791. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific exemption for the use of bifenthrin on cucurbits to control the sweet potato whitefly. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request. The sweet potato whitefly (SPWF) is a relatively new pest on cucurbits. The SPWF has caused severe economic damage to several other commodities nationwide including cotton, lettuce, squash, beans, peanuts, and ornamentals. SPWF causes damage through feeding activities, and also indirectly through the production of a honeydew, which encourages growth of sooty mold and other fungi. The Applicant claims that adequate control of the SPWF is not being achieved with the currently registered compounds. The Applicant claims that significant economic losses are expected in California cucurbit production if the SPWF is not adequately controlled, and is therefore requesting this use of bifenthrin. The Applicant proposes to apply bifenthrin at a maximum rate of 0.1 lb. active ingredient (a.i.) (6.4 oz. of product) per acre with up to three applications allowed, and a maximum of 0.3 lb. a.i. per acre per season, on a total of 200,000 acres of cucurbits. It is possible to produce two cucurbit crops per calendar year on a given acre, and therefore, the acreage could potentially receive 6 applications, (maximum of 0.6 lb. a.i. per acre) per calendar year. Therefore, use under this exemption could potentially amount to a maximum total of 120,000 lbs. of active ingredient. This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. This is the third time that the Applicant has applied for the use of bifenthrin on cucurbits, and the fourth year that this use has been requested under section 18. The regulations governing section 18 require that the Agency publish notice of receipt in the Federal Register and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption proposing use of a pesticide if an emergency exemption has been requested or granted for that use in any 3 previous years, and a complete application for registration of that use and/or a petition for tolerance for residues in or on the commodity has not been submitted to the Agency [40 CFR 166.24(a)(6)]. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the address above. The Agency will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the California Environmental Protection Agency.
