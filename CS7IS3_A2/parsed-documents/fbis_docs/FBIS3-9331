"But we will only be able to make a definitive assessment after 1995 when the transformation will be completed," he told CTK after he visited the army's General Staff. Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said that the largest amount of work was awaiting the army this year and in the first half of 1995. Havel said he was very pleased "to hear now, when the Dutch queen is visiting the Czech Republic, a report about the very successful joint exercise with a Dutch unit, the first ever exercise with a Western army on our soil." The exercise started in mid-March and is to finish on March 24.
