Mr. Dean Everts, of the WFP, said that the project played an exemplary role showing how to relieve poverty in developing countries. The project, with the free offer of 93,925 tons of wheat from the WFP and 103.73 million yuan of coordinating funds from the Chinese Government, started on February 1, 1991, and is due to be completed in five years' time. The project mainly focuses on building water conservancy facilities, upgrading soil quality, planting trees, developing orchards, constructing roads and technical training. Thanks to the on-going project, the counties have another 10,361 ha of fairly well irrigated farmland and additional 1.6 million kwh. As a result an additional 61,820 tons of grain has been produced. Technical training has also helped more and more surplus local farmers find other jobs, and thus cut down the exodus of labor to other parts of the country.
