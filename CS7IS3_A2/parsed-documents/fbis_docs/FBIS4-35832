[Passage omitted: Yazdi praises the virtues and achievements of Ayatollah Khomeyni] The esteemed leader [Ayatooal Khamene'i] has made several speeches at meetings which have very interesting points, which we have all heard, at meetings with Majlis deputies and dear guests who came to take part in the ceremonies on the fifth anniversary of the Imam's death. [passage omitted] These are the words of the esteemed leader, His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i. [crowd chants slogans in praise of Khamene'i] After the necessary instructions the nation, the government, and the country's officials are alert. But that is not enough. You must be aware and not do anything that would give the enemy hope. [passage omitted] As the esteemed leader said, we have never claimed that there are no difficulties in the country. Or that there are no problems in my own sector, the country's judiciary. We would never claim that. However, fairness is also a good thing. One must open one's eyes to see all the tasks which have been accomplished during the present era when the country is undergoing reconstruction after freeing itself from the burden of the war and managing to find the means for its reconstruction. A lot of work has been carried out in all sectors. In my own area of work, for instance, why is it that when you sit together you are not prepared to mention one single positive point about the judicial apparatus? When a weakness appears in a certain corner, even though the judiciary has dealt with it and has dismissed the offender, you still choose to pretend that the individual is still present in the judiciary, and then tend to judge the whole apparatus on the basis of that individual. Is this fair? When the eminent leader says that you should not do anything which could inspire hope among the enemies, he is obviously referring to such things. That is to say overlooking the positive points at a time when the officials of the country are working hard and rendering their services. When we review the situation in this country, we see all our means of oversight and scrutiny, as well as all our honorable, faithful, pious and religious judges, who constitute high-ranking strata in the society and are engaged in their works with such integrity, sincerity and piety. However, you still tend to pay attention to a particular judge whom we have already arrested on the basis of a special warrant without letting everyone know about it -- as we dealt with the matter in a confidential manner and only informed those whom we had to inform. We have arrested and sacked this judge, and we have also clarified his charges and forced him to pay back to the public funds that he had embezzled. However, when a number of individuals sit together, they still tend to say that the judicial power is such and such. This was an example from my own area of work. The situation regarding the esteemed government is very much the same. Why are you not prepared to mention one single positive aspect of all the work which has been carried out by the government? However, you invariably choose to pick one negative point and dwell on that. The Majlis too has done a great deal of service in creating so much coordination and harmony between the judicial and executive branches, carrying out so much legislation, supervision, research, and dealing with so many complaints based on Article 90. You choose not to see all these services, but you question the Majlis when a certain deputy utters something somewhere. Is this right? [Passage omitted: Yazdi emphasizes parts of guidelines by Khamene'i on importance of constructive criticism and advice] I am cancelling the remainder of my sermon since we are overrunning on time and prayers could be delayed. I have written down one or two sentences in Arabic but before that: Israel and the kidnapping by Israel which does not comply with any of the international regulations and laws and is a blatant violation of all international regulations; a violation of human rights! Unfortunately international forums have not made any comment! And, moreover, this is land and air aggression against state borders! What licence is there for that? Why do those who raise legal issues say nothing? Is the presence of an individual or a group in a third country, whose ideology is against the ideology of the system... [sentence as heard] Can that be a licence for aggression against a country's land and air frontiers? Why has the world kept silent? Then, naturally, we see the recent air attacks, the bombarding of south Lebanon and the martyrdom of Muslims! They think that with such acts the problem will be resolved. History has demonstrated, divine honor has demonstrated that problems cannot be resolved by those means. And we are certain that the area will not be calm until the day when the owners of that land, the true owners of Palestine, return to their homes. [crowd chants: "God is great"; "Khamene'i is the leader"; "Death to Israel"] The last time I stood at this podium I told the British government that if it has any proof regrading its claim let it be given to us for investigation. So far, not only have they had no proof and have not shown anything, but they have also embarked on other action which follows those hegemonist ideas. In short, I tell the British government that that method has become old-fashioned now; the actions you have embarked upon are not right. Mend your ways. The Islamic Republic of Iran has demonstrated in practice that it always seeks a peaceful existence and will never be willing -- despite your behavior -- to embark on actions which are beneath its dignity; even in retaliation. We really say to Afghanistan that it is enough; don't ruin the country any further. We say to some Arab countries which agitate that the Islamic Republic of Iran is not in a situation where it can be affected by such provocation. This government, which has such an alert and vigilant people, is in control of all its aspects and will not allow any power, either in the farthest region of the world or in its nearest neighborhood, to attempt the slightest violation against its independence. [crowd chants: "God is great"; "Khamene'i is the leader"; "death to antirevolutionaries"; "Death to Israel"] [passage omitted]
