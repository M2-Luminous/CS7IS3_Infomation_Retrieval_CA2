The Peasant Party of Russia is faced with a major test. The first elections of the organs of local authority on a multiparty basis are drawing near. Local elections are our elections. Find and nominate candidates for each seat in the oblast duma and in rayon-village organs of authority. Farmers, do not shun your nomination: Leaving authority to the communists will turn into your leaving your own land. Mobilize resources for the election campaign--your own, peasant, and the offerings of sympathizers. Agitation for a candidate should be simple, easy to understand, and take place everywhere. Our leaflet should be in the rural store, and our conversation--at the well, in the farmyard, and in the workshop. Do not go on the defense; the best defense is offense. Your candidates are worthy, respectable, and reliable people; your agitation is just; the farmer movement is liberation. Be able to explain to a kolkhoz woman on pension her benefits from owning a share of land, try to gain the support of all honorable workers, and do not be afraid to talk about the obvious vices of the Agrogulag--the universal theft, drunkenness, laziness, deceit, and corruption. The people know everything, be the yeast in the dough. The party of free peasants will be opposed by the team of communists and agrarian bosses of the refurbished kolkhozes. There are a lot of industrious and knowledgeable people among them, but this does not change the fundamentals. We are for free labor on our own land, and they are for the preservation of the Agrogulag. Rural life is such that the support of one head of administration is dearer than all the president's edicts. A village elder headman elected from the farmer movement can create the conditions of life and labor for hundreds of people. But a loss in the elections can echo with the ruin of strong farms. As it is, bankruptcy among farmers is extremely high. In 1993, 87,100 individual farms were established, which is less than in 1992 by a factor of 1.5, while in 1993, 19,200 farms broke up, which is more than in 1992 by a factor of 3.8. Local elections are a test of our political will and maturity. Do not spare any efforts--victory will come! [Signed] Yuriy Chernichenko, chairman of the Peasant Party of Russia, KPR executive committee.
