FR940406-2-00171 FR940406-2-00095 Applicants must establish a timetable for beginning training activities and demonstrate that key staff and facilities will be available in order to achieve a comprehensive nationwide program within the period of the project. The training project must consult with each of NIDRR's regional Disability and Business Technical Assistance Centers (DBTACs) during the development of its schedule of training activities. To the maximum extent feasible, the training project must conduct its training activities in collaboration with each of the DBTACs. The training project must develop two schedules of regional training activities. The first schedule of training activities must be finalized and training must begin within six months after the award of the grant. The second schedule must be finalized within eighteen months after the award of the grant. The training project must carry out its training activities as equitably as possible across and within each region of the country. The training project must have a staff with expertise on the ADA and training, and carry out its training activities using those staff persons. The training project must not rely primarily on subcontractors to carry out its training activities. The training project must include individuals with disabilities or their family members or representatives to the maximum extent possible in all phases of the project's activities. The training project must submit final drafts of the training materials it produces to NIDRR for review of their legal sufficiency. The training project must submit monthly status reports on its training activities through NIDRR's ADA Technical Assistance Coordination Contract to NIDRR. Each training project must submit its final report to the National Rehabilitation Information Center clearinghouse. The training project must cooperate with other Federal agencies that provide technical assistance and training on the ADA, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB). Priority Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary proposes to give an absolute preference to applications that meet the following priorities. The Secretary proposes to fund under this program only applications that meet these absolute priorities: Proposed Priorities_Americans With Disabilities Act Training Projects Background Public Law 101&hyph;336, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which was enacted on July 26, 1990, prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in employment, public accommodations, transportation, State and local government services, and telecommunications. In 1991 NIDRR established an ADA technical assistance program made up of ten regional Disability and Business Technical Assistance Centers (DBTACs_previously, Disability and Business Accommodation Centers), two national training projects, three materials development projects, and an ADA technical assistance coordination contract. The two national training projects addressed the needs of persons affiliated with independent living centers and peer and family networks. These training projects' which were awarded for three years, will complete their activities in fiscal year (FY) 1994. For FY 1994 Congress provided NIDRR with additional funding which it directed be used ``for training activities related to the implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act'' (1994 Senate Appropriations Committee Report, p. 207). In accordance with this congressional directive, NIDRR proposes to establish six new training projects that will be supported by the additional funding that Congress provided as well as by existing NIDRR funds. The training projects will enhance the capacity of those with rights and duties under the ADA to facilitate its implementation. NIDRR has consulted with a range of relevant Federal agencies, including, but not limited to, DOJ, EEOC, the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB), the Department of Transportation, and the National Council on Disability, as well as representatives from disability organizations, to develop responsive and meaningful training projects that will complement the planned efforts of other public and private agencies. These priorities were developed on the basis of these consultations and relevant information from NIDRR projects, including the ADA technical assistance projects. NIDRR intends to continue to coordinate activities under this program with other Federal agencies and with other public and private initiatives to implement the ADA. Proposed Priority 1: ADA Training for Independent Living Centers Background The more than 400 Independent Living Centers (ILCs) in the United States emphasize consumer control and peer services. These ILCs have a strong incentive to promote the successful implementation of the ADA. ILCs serve as resources not only to persons with disabilities in their communities, but also to individuals and entities with responsibilities under the Act. Preliminary results from a survey conducted by the Independent Living Research Utilization Program (ILRU) of persons associated with ILCs from around the country indicate that knowledge concerning specific sections of the ADA is not high, even among persons who have a direct interest in effective ADA implementation. Initial analysis of these data suggests that a lack of training opportunities and high-turnover among the staff who are trained are factors in the current level of knowledge of persons associated with ILCs. Some ILCs have had opportunities to participate in ADA training activities sponsored by Federal agencies, and many ILCs have developed into sophisticated community resources on the ADA. Training projects for the ILCs have generally taken the form of an ILC sending a representative to attend an intensive ADA training session over a number of days. This approach has some limitations in terms of impact due to the high turnover of ILC staff and multiple or shifting work responsibilities in the ILC. Other ILCs, due in large part to their size or location, have not had ADA training opportunities sponsored by Federal agencies. This group of ILCs is the primary target audience for this training project. The secondary target group for the training project is composed of those ILCs who have lost their ADA-trained staff person. The project is intended to enable both of these groups of ILCs to become experts on the ADA so that their staff, associates and volunteers can answer technical questions, advise individuals on their rights or responsibilities, make referrals, increase awareness of the ADA in their community, and conduct ADA training activities for covered entities in their community.
