He said that scientists and specialists from the Atomic Ministry had already made similar statements many times. Apparently, it would not hurt to make one more: Russia does carry out research in the field of thermonuclear synthesis of heavy hydrogen isotopes, however, such research has absolutely nothing in common with "red mercury". Kaurov announced that in the ministry's opinion, Wednesday's report by the REUTER news agency that Russia has a "miniature neutron bomb", developed by Russian scientists on the basis of "red mercury", and the English television film about the "Russians' discovery" are cheap efforts to create a sensation and have political undertones.
