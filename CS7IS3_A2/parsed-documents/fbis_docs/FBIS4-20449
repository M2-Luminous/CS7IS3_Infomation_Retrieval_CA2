Short-Term Relapse in Rhesus Monkeys Infected With Sporozoites of Plasmodium cynomolgi 40091007G Shanghai ZHONGGUO JISHENGCHONGXUE YU JISHENGCHONGBING ZAZHI [CHINESE JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY & PARASITIC DISEASES] in Chinese Vol 11 No 4, Nov 93 pp 244-247 40091007G Shanghai ZHONGGUO JISHENGCHONGXUE YU JISHENGCHONGBING ZAZHI [CHINESE JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY & PARASITIC DISEASES] Chinese CSO [English abstract of article by Zhang Jiaxun [1728 1367 1053], Lin Baoying [2651 1405 5391], et al. of the Institute of Parasitic Diseases (WHO Collaborating Center for Malaria, Schistosomiasis and Filariasis), Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, Shanghai] [Text] It is believed that the short-term relapse could be artificially made by the application of the experimental method, therefore researchers in this laboratory established the monkey model of the short-term relapse. According to the experimental design, when the parasitemia was detected in rhesus monkeys infected with sporozoites of Plasmodium cynomolgi, a combined therapy of pyronaridine 6 mg/kg body weight, artemether 10 mg/kg and chloroquine 20 mg/kg once daily for 3 days was carried out to clear the erythrocytic parasite and then the short-term relapse was observed in the animal for 100 days. The combined therapy was given again when relapse occurred. One onset of relapse occurred on the 47th day after therapy in monkey M194 infected with sporozoites 11 x 10[.sup]3[/]. In M195 infected with sporozoites 55 x 10[.sup]4[/], relapses occurred for three times on 30, 37 and 51 days respectively after medication, but during a follow-up period of 200 days, no relapse was shown in M192 and M193 infected with sporozoites 50 and 55 x 10[.sup]2[/], respectively. The results showed that the frequency of the short-term relapse was relative to the sporozoites inoculation, and sporozoites less than 11 x 10[.sup]3[/] were not suitable for making short-term relapse in animal model. No long term relapse was seen in all the four monkeys until 400 days. Under existing conditions, the relapse was generally explained with hypnozoite assumption, the establishment of animal model of short-term relapse could be tenable. The reasons were: (1) P. cynomolgi from Vietnam, a parasite with the biological characteristic of short-term relapse, was recognized; (2) A series of studies for the relationship between the parasite and monkey host was carried out and the experimental basis of the model establishment was put forward by the authors; (3) This study did not exclude the hypnozoite assumption. The significance of this animal model study at least included: (1) to innovate the treatment countermeasure of the short-term relapse of malaria; (2) to study the biology of the short-term relapse; and (3) to test the antimalarial drugs for the radical cure of vivax malaria. As for the animal model of the long-term relapse, it will be necessary for study to select the monkey parasite which has the biological characteristic of long-term relapse. The verification of the relative problem, hypnozoite assumption, will also be necessary. Key words: Malaria, short-term relapse, animal model, Plasmodium cynomolgi
