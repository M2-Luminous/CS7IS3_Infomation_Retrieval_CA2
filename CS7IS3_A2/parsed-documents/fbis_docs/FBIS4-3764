FBIS4-3764 "drchi079_v_94006" FBIS-CHI-94-079 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 Taiwan Prosecutor Indicts More Officers in Taiwan Arms Scandal Prosecutor Indicts More Officers in Taiwan Arms Scandal OW2204161894 Taipei CNA in English 1432 GMT 22 Apr 94 OW2204161894 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Benjamin Yeh] [Text] Taipei, April 22 (CNA) -- A Taipei prosecutor on Friday [22 April] indicted seven retired middle-ranking military officers for either illegally obtaining or leaking top military secrets to arms dealers, as the worst military scandal in Taiwan's history continued to unravel. The move brought to 11 the number of people charged for their complicity in the military scandal in which two officers each were indicted in February and April. Three other officers and four civilians also have been arrested for their roles in the scandal, which started to unfold after the mysterious death of Naval Capt. Yin Ching-feng in December. Investigators say Yin was killed because he threatened to expose a pattern of bribery in which arms dealers and retired military officers representing European companies paid active-duty officers for help in winning weapons contracts. The investigators have been helped in tracking down other arms dealers and officers involved in the scandal by information gleaned from classified Navy documents they uncovered during a Christmas Eve raid on the home of Chang Chia-cheng, an arms dealer and former Army colonel who has also been indicted. The classified information, covering the six French-built Lafayette frigates and the two Swordfish submarines the Netherlands has constructed for Taiwan, was allegedly leaked by active-duty officers. The two projects are part of the Navy's military buildup. In addition to Chang, who allegedly bribed officers to obtain the secrets, Liang Kang-hsien, who was suspected of leaking military secrets before he retired as an Air Force major, and Liu Shu, a retired Navy captain, have also been indicted. The three could be sentenced to death if found guilty. Four other people indicted by the prosecutor include Tien Ching- wen and three arms dealers--Wu Yu-cheng, Li Hung-wei, and Wu Pao- tai. They face a punishment of up to seven years in jail if found guilty.
