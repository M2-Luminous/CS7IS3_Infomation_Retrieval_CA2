Kine told TANJUG that those who would have to leave Germany would be the nationals of Serbia and Montenegro (constituent states of the F.R.Y.) who had failed to legally regulate their stay in Germany. He said they were those who either had not sought asylum or had been denied it, or had no other right to stay any further in Germany. The German authorities on Monday confirmed that they would begin to expel Yugoslav nationals on Thursday. Kine added that exempted from this decision were about 230,000 refugees with Yugoslav passports from the ex-Yugoslav Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. "For now, the refugees from the BiH (Bosnia-Herzegovina) are to remain in Germany, while talks are in progress with Croatia about the procedures regarding the return of its refugees," Kine said. The German press, however, had announced that around 200,000 people carrying Yugoslav passports would be expelled. This was practically confirmed by the Interior Ministry of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia when it said that a first flight with 160 expelled would leave Germany on Thursday for the Romanian town of Timisoara, while more flights were scheduled for March 17, 24 and 31. From Timisoara, the expelled would travel by buses to the Yugoslav border. On the list of those to be expelled, as was announced, the predominant number (near under 95 percent) accounts for ethnic Albanians from the Serbian province of Kosovo and Metohija. The expulsion of nationals with Yugoslav passports coincides with a hunt against and arrests of Serbs in Germany over their alleged war crimes in ex-Yugoslav territories. In Germany, the decision on expelling Yugoslav nationals -- which appears to be, among other things, in the service of political pressure -- had spurred on hardly any protest other than that raised by the "Green" party. Of the German papers, it was the FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU alone that commented on the decision on Monday, stressing that "Germany's rush" to expel Yugoslav nationals was "shameful."
