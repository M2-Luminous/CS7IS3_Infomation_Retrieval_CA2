A makeshift laboratory used to make the haul of about 22 kilograms of pure ice was discovered during raids by more than 40 officers from the Narcotics Bureau and the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). Two boys aged about 10 were delivered into the care of the Social Welfare Department yesterday after officers found them living in a Sha Tin flat used by members of the 14K Yee triad to manufacture and store the drugs. "This is the first ice manufacturing case in Hong Kong for 17 years and the second largest seizure ever made," said Detective Chief Inspector Yeung Tak-keung, head of the bureau's export section. The ice was destined for the Philippines, where it would have retailed for about $10 million, compared with a Hong Kong wholesale value of $700,000. Authorities said the busts did not indicate Hong Kong was becoming a burgeoning market for ice. "In the Philippines and Japan, ice is the drug of choice. In Hong Kong, heroin remains the drug of choice. Ice doesn't have a market here," said ICAC Chief Investigator Mike Squires. Mr Squires said four people arrested were members of the 14K Yee triad society whose official meeting place above a shop in North Poin was also uncovered in the raids. In the past, Hong Kong has been mainly used as transit point for ice manufactured in laboratories in southern China and shipped to countries including the Philippines, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Hawaii. "We believe the syndicate has been active in ice trafficking for some time, but we believe we broke it up at the beginning of their plans to manufacture it in Hong Kong," Chief Inspector Yeung said. He said the synthetics used to make the ice had come from a mainland crime group operating near Guangzhou and smuggled to Hong Kong for final processing in the Sha Tin flat. "They were importing the mixture from China and then treating it and combining it with other liquids in Hong Kong until it crystallised and was in its purest form," Chief Inspector Yeung said. The 22 kg of ice and most of the manufacturing paraphernalia were found in the flat with the boys' 42-year-old mother, who was arrested. "The children were living in a flat used as an ice factory, but we do not believed they were using drugs. It's a pity that such things happen to them at that age," Chief Inspector Yeung said. Three men, including the suspected ringleader and self-taught chemist and two would-be couriers, were arrested during raids on Monday night and early yesterday at premises in North Point. Four machete-type knives and a small quantity of heroin were also seized.
