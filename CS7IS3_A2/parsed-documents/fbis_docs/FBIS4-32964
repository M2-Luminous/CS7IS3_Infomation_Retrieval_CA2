Senate Vice President Firmin Jean-Louis indicated he had contacted several legislators who expressed their willingness to participate in the special session, but stated their apprehension with respect to its feasibility. Nevertheless, Jean-Louis disclosed that those parliamentarians contacted "reiterated their recognition of Aristide as legitimate president and expressed their willingness to respond favorably to his summons today and from here on." On the other hand, this Tuesday, Deputy Antoine Joseph, former president of the Chamber of Deputies, stated Aristide is entitled to convene the parliamentarians, but he believed the president should have contacted the parliament's political groups before summoning the National Assembly. The deputy criticized Senate President Jean-Louis, who was in a position to make the contacts prior to the president's summons. Joseph also pointed to the security problems the legislators are having and the unlikelihood the summons will come through. Another reason, Joseph indicated, was the position adopted by Jean-Louis with respect to the 2 March parliamentary resolution that attempted to solve the crisis through Aristide's appointment of a prime minister, the retirement of General Raoul Cedras, and the implementation of an amnesty law. Joseph stressed that the Chamber of Deputies does not recognize the "de facto" government headed by Judge Emile Jonassaint. In a letter dated 26 May and sent to Jean-Louis, Aristide urges the senate president to take the necessary provisions to summon the National Assembly on 1 June to express an opinion on the "11 May charade" and the illegal appointment of Jonassaint as de facto president by a group of senators headed by Bernard Sansaricq. In the meantime, press reports from Haiti point out the deployment of troops on the border with Santo Domingo in response to the Dominican Government's commitment to control the smuggling of crude-oil-related products through the border shared by both Caribbean nations. As a result of these new measures, the price of gasoline increased drastically in the free market, and this Monday and Tuesday, a gallon of gasoline could be purchased for $10. A military source told EFE that the Army has large amounts of gasoline for its military vehicles and those used by the high-ranking officers. On the other hand, if the price of gasoline continues to increase, public transportation will be crippled in a very short while, and private owners will be forced to leave their vehicles parked at home because of the lack of resources to confront rising prices on the black market.
