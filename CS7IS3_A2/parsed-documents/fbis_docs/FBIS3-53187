The cable said: This project enabled our men to hold the key to modern technology through purely national efforts and programmed, creative action. This action displayed the most marvelous pictures of resolve and determination and incorporated boldness and science and knowledge which characterize the sons of Iraq. The cable added that this strategic project will provide raw material to build the national industry, especially in manufacturing tires, batteries, inks, and various dyes. The cable asserted that accomplishing this strategic project means taming [tarwid] crude oil and its derivatives, and even taming the sacred Iraqi soil in its great wealth and abundant water. This project opened up new horizons to the creative Iraqi mind. It is indeed the ax of the creative people that will smash the embargo and teach the enemies a profound lesson and will make them regret their reckless blockade. Staff Gen. Husayn Kamil Hasan said this major project has a capacity of 25,000 tonnes annually. This will meet Iraq's needs of carbon black in various industries. Iraq used to import this material using hard currency, paying $1000-3000 per tonne. This means that Iraq is ready to help its brothers and friends in the oil countries in this field to break the monopoly and activate constructive cooperation and mutual interests.
