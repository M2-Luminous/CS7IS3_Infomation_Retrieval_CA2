This program would involve the refugees themselves, as well as the regions inhabitants. This call was made today by the deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs, the Honorable Augustine Mrema, while he was receiving a donation of 12 vehicles from the Russian Government. These vehicles will be used in helping refugees in the Kagera and Kigoma regions. Mrema stressed that the problem of refugees in these regions is gigantic, and that it required a proper strategy and program to handle it. Mrema thanked the Russian Government for its assistance, and also thanked other countries which had extended various kinds of help for the refugees, most of whom are Rwandans running away from the civil war raging in their country. Twenty other vehicles, donated by the Russian Government, are due in the country during the middle of next month. The ceremony was also attended by Russian Ambassador (Klimatov).
