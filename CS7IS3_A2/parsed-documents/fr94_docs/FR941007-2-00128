FR941007-2-00128 FR941007-2-00077 Federal Railroad Administration Waiver Petition Docket Number SA&hyph;94&hyph;5; Public Hearing The Burlington Northern Railroad Company (BN) has requested a waiver of compliance from certain provisions of the Railroad Safety Appliance Standards (49 CFR part 231) (see FR 39820, August 4, 1994). BN states that it is building one trainset of its ``trough train'' equipment. This train will be composed of 22, 13-section cars. The parking brakes on these cars are of conventional design, but their location is not standard. The unique size and design of one, 13-section car does not allow the conventional application of a handbrake. The BN is seeking a waiver of compliance with ยง231.1(a)1, 231.1(a)(3)(i), and 231.1(a)(3)(ii). Section 231.1(a)(1) requires that there be one efficient handbrake which shall operate in harmony with the power brake installed on the car. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has determined that a public hearing be held in this matter. Accordingly a public hearing is hereby set for 10:00 a.m. on November 15, 1994, at the Nebraska Public Service Commission, 300 The Atrium, 1200 N Street, Lincoln, Nebraska. The hearing will be an informal one and will be conducted in accordance with Rule 25 of the FRA Rules of Practice (49 CFR Part 211.25), by a representative designated by the FRA. The hearing will be a nonadversary proceeding in which all interested parties will be given the opportunity to express their views regarding this waiver petition. Issued in Washington, D.C. on October 3, 1994. Phil Olekszyk, Acting Deputy Associate Administrator for Safety Compliance and Program Implementation.
