Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, former Economy Minister Boris Fedorov, Viktor Gerashchenko, president of the central bank, and Anatoliy Chubays, deputy prime minister responsible for privatizations, clashed through contradictory statements. Speaking to the press on Saturday [29 January], Viktor Chernomyrdin forcefully expressed his intention to continue the transformation of the economy and Russian society. Questioned on his government's monetary policy, the prime minister gave as his objective keeping inflation to between 15 and 18 percent until September. Mr. Fedorov's Criticisms Accompanied by two former economics advisers to the Russian Government, Boris Fedorov strongly criticized the present government's policy on Monday. The former economy minister, who resigned on 20 January, predicted the failure of a policy consisting of reviving production by a massive injection of capital. This measure is fueling inflation and delaying the stabilization of the economy, which is the only thing that would make development possible. Inflation is prompting both poor and rich to hoard strong currencies. The spread of special stores in which you pay in foreign currency is prompting the former minister to fear a "dangerous polarization of society." He thinks that the inflationist policy currently being pursued would increase pressure in favor of the reformers. "Boris Yeltsin has distanced himself from this government, he has the means of changing it when the alarm signals are too strong." Anatoliy Chubays Is Voting for Fedorov Anatoliy Chubays made a thinly veiled criticism of Viktor Chernomyrdin by stating to the press on Monday that Mr. Fedorov's resignation could have been avoided. "Being a minister in this government, I regret it," he added. The deputy prime minister, who is regarded as ultraliberal, said no political power could block the privatizations. He clearly advocated a monetarist policy, by defining the dangers threatening privatization. "If the economic situation remains unstable, investments will be rare, and companies are likely to go bankrupt." Limits for Foreign Banks Finally, Viktor Gerashchenko, president of the Central Bank, told AFP on Monday that the activity of foreign banks on Russian territory would be limited. "We need to promote our own commercial banks." Mr. Gerashchenko said that the money supply plays an "insignificant" role in inflation in Russia. "Without a government policy of investment, the fight against inflation by monetarist means would be ineffective," he added.
