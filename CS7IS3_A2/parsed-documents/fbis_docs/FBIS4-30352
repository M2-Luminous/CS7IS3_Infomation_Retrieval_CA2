The interview, conducted in the NHK Tokyo studio, is moderated by NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto and guest commentator Naoki Tanaka. Yamamoto begins the interview by asking Murayama: "In reference to the issue of forming a new government, it appears that the SDPJ holds a key to it. Which party do you intend to begin negotiations with -- the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] or the ruling coalition parties?" Murayama replies: "We have to recognize the past. We should return to the position we had at the time of forming the coalition in August last year. I think the correct order to proceed by is that all the people who participated at that time return to that position and restart from zero in discussing how the government should be formed." "What you are saying is that you will begin with the ruling coalition parties, right?" Yamamoto asks. Murayama replies, "Yes." The moderator notes: "But the coalition parties are saying they want to watch the negotiations taking place between the LDP and the SDPJ. They say their negotiations with the SDPJ on policy adjustments have been terminated." Murayama responds: "That may be what they are saying, but as far as we are concerned, we have to think about the past history, and about what the people of the nation expect us to do and what they want from us. We have to proceed with negotiations based on this thinking. I think the people of the nation still strongly expect us to end the LDP governance that continued for 38 years and to begin a new government. We need to respond to these expectations. When we recognize this, we come to realize we should form a coalition government once again." The SDPJ head adds, "But after all, negotiations need another party to talk to. If the negotiations do not go well, of course, then, it may be possible that we will think about what we should do next." Yamamoto asserts that the coalition parties appear to have changed their position on the SDPJ as a possible coalition partner and asks for Murayama's comment. Murayama replies: "It is only natural that we should think about the next course of action if the negotiations do not go well. Yesterday, Mr. Yohei Kono and Mr. Ryutaro Hashimoto [of the LDP] came to me and handed me a paper on the party's concept for forming a new government. I told them I would like to have time to study it. Since I have to think about the next course, I would like to keep the door open for talks with other parties." Guest commentator Tanaka points out: "Watching the SDPJ over the past several days, I have noticed considerable differences of view within the SDPJ. For you, the most urgent issue right now is not to let the party break up." Murayama says: "No, no. What is urgent for me is how we can respond to the people's expectations, by forming a new government." The commentator then asks: "Specifically, there is said to be two groups in the party -- one that attaches importance to maintaining the coalition and the other group does not. This is one of the reasons for the chaotic political situation." The SDPJ chairman responds: "This should not be viewed as the party being divided into two groups -- of one that attaches importance to the coalition and the other that does not. It should be taken as differences of view existing on conditions to rejoining the coalition." Tanaka asks if Murayama thinks the next government will be a caretaker government that will serve until the next general election or a full-fledged government. Murayama says: "It will depend on how the government will be composed, but it is possible that the government will be a temporary one that will serve until the next election." Tanaka asks if Murayama thinks the LDP has changed its way of thinking. Murayama says: "This question was once discussed within my party too. At that time, I said that the fact that Mr. Kono was elected its president shows the party recognized the party's mood, which is looking for change." Murayama adds: "There are people who are considered doves in the LDP. I think we can talk to or cooperate with them." Tanaka asks Murayama if there is a possibility of the SDPJ cooperating with the LDP in forming a new government in case negotiations with the coalition parties fail. Murayama says: "Umm, yes. The Diet session closes 29 June. If possible, we would like to name a prime minister and form a cabinet by then -- so that it will be able to get ready for the summit. We have a political task to form a new government. But if there is no way of doing that by 29 June, then we may have to extend the Diet session a little. That is what I think." Yamamoto says some people in Sakigake [Harbinger] think they should push for Murayama as the next prime minister, and asks for Murayama's comment. Murayama says: "This will be a coalition government. Its prime minister needs to be agreed on by the parties that participate in the coalition. Hence, I think we should not talk about who should be prime minister." He then says: "I do not think I am fit for that [position]. If my party is asked to form a cabinet, there are many people who are fit for that." The interview with Murayama ends at 0025 GMT.
