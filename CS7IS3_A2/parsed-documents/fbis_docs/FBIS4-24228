Mr. Noudjalbaye Ngaryana, a police commissioner, is a close relative of former President Francois Tombalbaye. The post of health minister has remained vacant since the decision made by the son of the first Chadian head of state, Ngarta Tombalbaye, not to be part of "a government that will only increase the sufferings of the Chadian people," according to his own statement. Meanwhile, Abderamane Dadi, former managing director of the National School of Magistrates and Administration, has also been appointed secretary general of the government to replace Dono Horngar Neldita. The replacement of the government secretary general follows the arrest on 18 June of Prime Minister Delwa Kassire Koumakoye by the Higher Transitional Council [CST] for "anomalies" in the 1994 budget. Some members of the CST, the transitional Chadian parliament, had called for the dismissal of Dono Horngar, who they charged with "tampering" with the text.
