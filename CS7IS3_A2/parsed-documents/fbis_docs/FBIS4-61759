Arnfolgu: "Investigation Completed"] [Text] On the even of the second anniversary of the fall of Shusha a briefing was held in the republic procuracy. Procurator General of Azerbaijan Ali Omarov reported that the investigation of the case of the betrayal of the city of Shusha to the enemy had been completed. More than 4,000 witnesses had been questioned and more than 400 expert appraisals conducted. The accused are the former defense minister, Ragim Gaziyev, the regimental commander Nail Kyazimov, and self-defense battalion commanders Fakhraddin Safarov and Tofig Oguz and another individual whose name A. Omarov refused to give. R. Gaziyev is being accused of abuse of power, appropriation of state property in especially large amounts, and also illegal acquisition of weapons. N. Kyazimov and F. Safarov are being accused of insubordination and willful departure from their positions during combat actions. The last two are no longer living. The investigation established that on the eve of the seizure of Shusha half of the 1,500 personnel of the Azerbaijan army were absent. To the question of who gave the order to withdraw the combat equipment from the city the leader of the investigatory group, an investigator of especially important cases under the Procuracy General, Medzhid Khasyyev, answered: "The technical equipment was not withdrawn from the city, it was in unfit condition." A. Omarov stated that he deliberately did not use the word "treason" because he does not believe that anyone could betray the Motherland. In his opinion, the city fell as a result of the cowardice and negligent attitude toward their duties on the part of individuals responsible for its defense. But in society there has long been the conviction that Shusha and Lachin were victims of betrayal and political intrigues. As M. Khasyyev noted, the seizure of Shusha and Lachin must be regarded in the context of the events and processes taking place in the republic at the time. He suggested that journalists ask the question why the parliament had not yet given a political-legal assessment of the occupation of these regions.
