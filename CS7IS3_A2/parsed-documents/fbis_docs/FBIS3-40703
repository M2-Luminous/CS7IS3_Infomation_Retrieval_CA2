UAE Economy and Trade Minister Sa'id Ghabbash told AL-HAYAH that his ministry is currently drafting a study on the GATT agreement for submission to the Cabinet so that the later can decide whether the UAE will join GATT. He added that the study will elucidate how joining GATT would be to the UAE's advantage. He said that the UAE has observer status in GATT and participates in all of its meetings. Economic sources assert that joining GATT would provide many benefits for the UAE, because taxes in the UAE on imports are very low; they do not exceed 4 percent and are as low as 1 percent for many commodities and imports. If it joins GATT, the UAE will be compensated by a drop in taxes and customs duties levied on UAE exports to other countries of the world. Representatives of 117 countries approved the agreement on 15 December 1993. The OECD expects that international trade will grow by 6.5 percent in 1995 as a result of the agreement reached in the Uruguay Round. Ghabbash said that the effect of the UAE's entry into GATT on UAE ready-made clothing exports to the United States would not be quickly felt, because the transition to implementation of the agreement regarding clothes and textiles will last 10 years. He said that the export of ready-made, UAE-made clothes to the United States will be governed by a bilateral agreement between the two countries. He added that it was decided to extend this agreement for two years as of 1 January 1994 following negotiations between the Economy and Trade Ministry and the U.S. trade office. The UAE Cabinet has approved a memorandum of understanding stipulating an extension of the agreement with the United States. This approval was conveyed to the U.S. Ambassador in Abu Dhabi early this week. Ghabbash told AL-HAYAH that he expects a memorandum of understanding exchange between the ministry and the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi next week. He said that the agreement will regulate new quotas of ready-made clothing exports to the United States, and that it includes joint measures to stop producers outside of the UAE from circumventing the provisions of the agreement. Ghabbash stressed that the Economy and Trade Ministry will cooperate with the Finance and Industry Ministry and pertinent UAE customs authorities to establish regulations that provide for effective supervision, ensure compliance by economic units in the UAE with decrees concerning the export of ready-made clothes, and eliminate the circumvention practiced by exporters to the United States. An U.S. delegation recently visited ready-made clothing factories in the UAE with a view toward ascertaining their capabilities and production capacities and stopping violations regarding the export of their products to the United States. Ghabbash said that the UAE will demonstrate greater concern with stopping erroneous practices on the part of foreign exporters of ready-made clothes through the UAE. He added that the ministry held a course last October on "Controlling Export Operations" for representatives of the Economy and Trade Ministry, Finance and Industry Ministry, and other pertinent agencies in the UAE. Economic circles indicate that, as of June 1993, the spun thread, textiles, and clothing sector had the fourth-largest number of factories registered in the UAE (116 factories or 12.8 percent of the total number of factories in the UAE). In addition, factories have been built in the Jabal 'Ali free zone to enjoy the advantages which this zone offers to exporters. The Finance and Industry Ministry recently decided to stop issuing new licenses for ready-made clothing factories. It is preparing a comprehensive study commissioned by the cabinet on the position of this industry. The ministry stresses the unfeasibility of establishing new factories in this sector at present.
