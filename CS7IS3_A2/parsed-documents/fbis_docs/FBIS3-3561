Local sources said the average income of farmers in 14 villages within the zone increased by 142 yuan to reach 1,092 yuan in 1993. In some villages, the income of each farmer exceeded 4,000 yuan, the sources said. A total 17.51 million yuan was put into the zone in 1993 to finance 12 agricultural high-tech projects. Model farms of fruit, vegetables, aquatic products and edible fungus have been set up under these projects. They involve more than 100 new farm species and 18 new processing technologies. A technological service network covering the whole zone and 100 professional societies have been established. They provide farmers with technological services as well as market information, the sources said. Based on detailed investigations, the zone has chosen to develop grass-eating cows, sheep and geese instead of grain-consuming pigs, and rare fruit with better market prospects.
