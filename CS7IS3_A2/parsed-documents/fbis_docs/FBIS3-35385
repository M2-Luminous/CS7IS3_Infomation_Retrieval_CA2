Addressing a press conference on Tuesday at a local hotel, he said that Indian oppression in Kashmir had risen to alarming proportion during the last three months and Indian forces even penetrated in the Sopore area which was known to be the fort of the freedom fighters. He said that Indian attacks on exact target showed that Indian forces got specific information. Keeping in view the prevailing situation and the prime minister's recent `confession' regarding her help to Rajiv Gandhi to crush the Sikh movement in the East Punjab, one could suspect that she was also helping the present Indian government in connection with the freedom movement in Kashmir, Nawaz alleged. Nawaz Sharif has charged that the prime minister was 'a security risk' for Pakistan. "Following the confession of the prime minister in a BBC interview last week that she helped former Indian premier late Rajiv Gandhi against the Sikh movement in the Indian Punjab, she has become a security risk for the country" he said. Nawaz Sharif said the prime minister must make her position clear to the nation in this matter as it was more serious an issue than the Watergate affair. He said the cause of Pakistan has been compromised by the prime minister. The PML-N [Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz] chief said that India never helped Pakistan in our hours of need nor it fulfilled promises made to the Kashmiri people. In fact India was responsible for the dismemberment of Pakistan in 1971. Moreover, Indian intelligence agency RAW [Research and Analysis Wing] has been working to weaken Pakistan, he added. He said that prime minister has been sidetracking the main issue and did not answered the questions asked in his February 19 letter to her. He questioned as to which principle made it binding for Pakistan to help its enemy and added that those who demolished Babri Mosque deserved no help. "I will take her to the court of the people," said Nawaz. Replying to a question whether he would bring all these things into the notice of the president and the chief of army staff he said that he would keep on playing his national, constitutional, legal and moral duty. He said that his party would consider withdrawing its members from the Kashmir Committee of the National Assembly keeping in view the "government's lukewarm attitude over the issue." He said he would strive for protecting the interests of the country and would not hesitate in taking any legal and constitutional step towards this end.
