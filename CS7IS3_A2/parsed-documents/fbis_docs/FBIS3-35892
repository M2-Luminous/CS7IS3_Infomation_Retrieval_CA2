Combat operations on NKR's front lines have continued for nearly two weeks. Azerbaijan's leaders and military command headquarters are trying to resolve the Karabakh problem through the use of force. Thousands of mercenaries are fighting on Azerbaijan's side. Although the Azerbaijan National Army [ANA] units have succeeded in placing several areas under their control as a result of the violent clashes between the two sides, they have been unable to significantly change the situation. In fact, they have suffered many casualties and lost a significant amount of military equipment. More than 10,000 Azerbaijani troops and mercenaries from various countries were killed at the NKR front line during the past two weeks. Many times more were wounded. The ANA units lost a large quantity of military equipment. For example, 19 of their armored vehicles were either captured or destroyed until 25 January. Meanwhile, 16 tanks were destroyed. The ANA units lost two T-72 tanks and 70 men in the clashes that took place in the vicinity of Martuni on 27 January. The enemy units were forced to retreat. Obviously, the loss the ANA units have suffered is significant. The NKR Defense Headquarters has disclosed that combat operations are taking place on all battlefronts at the present time. Violent fighting took place in the northern part of Kelbadzharskiy Rayon on 30 January. The NKR units not only beat off the attacks but also counterattacked and forced the enemy to retreat. Combat operations are also taking place in Mardakertskiy Rayon. The Armenian fighters have repulsed the occupationist attacks and forced their units to retreat. Meanwhile, the situation in Agdamskiy and Fizulinskiy Rayons is tense. Several observers believe that the ANA units have failed to achieve their objective despite making some advances. As we mentioned earlier, the ANA units' success has cost them significant casualties and loss of equipment. Azerbaijan will be forced to mobilize 45-year-old or 50-year-old men if the present state of affairs continues. [passage omitted] Regrettably, a peaceful situation has not been effectively established on Armenia's border with Azerbaijan. The neighboring republic's military units have frequently fired on Armenian residential areas close to the border with various types of arms. The Armenian Ministry of Defense's Press Service has disclosed that the occupationist ANA units violated Armenia's border once again early this morning. Several enemy patrols attacked Movses in Tavushskiy Rayon at 0310. The Armenian border guards took retaliatory measures. The fighting continued until 0630 this morning. A significant blow was inflicted on the enemy units, which were evicted from the area. The Azerbaijani units lost several men. No one was hurt on our side. No other incident occurred along Armenia's border until this afternoon. However, serious tension continues to exist in the region.
