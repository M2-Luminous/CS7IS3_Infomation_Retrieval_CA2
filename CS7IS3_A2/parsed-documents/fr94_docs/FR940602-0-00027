FR940602-0-00027 FR940602-0-00010 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 81 [OH44&hyph;1&hyph;5936; FRL&hyph;4890&hyph;2] Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; Ohio AGENCY: United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). ACTION: Final rulemaking. SUMMARY: USEPA is deleting all total suspended particulate (TSP) area designations in the State of Ohio. This direct final action was prompted by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency's request to redesignate all areas in the State, except for Cuyahoga County and a portion of Jefferson County, from TSP nonattainment to attainment. Section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) authorizes USEPA to eliminate all area TSP designations once the increments for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 microns are promulgated. On June 3, 1993 (58 FR 31622), USEPA published the final rulemaking revising the prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) particulate matter increments so that the increments are measured in terms of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 10 microns (respirable particulate matter). The June 3, 1993 final rulemaking also establishes the method by which USEPA deletes such TSP designations. Today's action becomes effective on June 3, 1994, the effective date of the respirable particulate matter increments. Please note that for this action, the term ``respirable particulate matter'' only applies to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 10 microns. ``Respirable particulate matter'' is not to be confused with particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 microns. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rulemaking will become effective on June 3, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In 1971, USEPA promulgated primary and secondary national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter to be measured as TSP. On July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24634), USEPA revised the NAAQS for particulate matter, replacing the TSP indicator with the respirable particulate matter indicator. The particulate matter standard was revised under the authority of Section 109(d) of the CAA, which requires periodic review and, if appropriate, revision of existing criteria and standards. In a related rulemaking published in the July 1, 1987, Federal Register (52 FR 24672), the Agency determined that the respirable particulate matter standard would be implemented pursuant to section 110 of the CAA. As a result, the area designation process of section 107 and the nonattainment provisions of Part D did not apply to the respirable particulate matter NAAQS. Consequently, TSP designations were retained as a means of differentiating areas needing nonattainment area new source review as opposed to attainment area prevention of significant deterioration review and to provide for attainment area increment tracking. In the 1990 amendments to the CAA, section 107 established designations of attainment status for respirable particulate matter. In addition, section 107(d)(4)(B) expressly states that any designation for particulate matter (measured in terms of TSP) that the Administrator promulgated prior to enactment of the 1990 Amendments shall remain in effect for purposes of implementing the particulate matter (measured in terms of TSP) increments until the Administrator determines that such designation is no longer necessary for that purpose. Section 166(f) authorizes USEPA to replace the TSP increment with respirable particulate matter increments. Upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Cuyahoga County and a portion of Jefferson County were designated as nonattainment areas for respirable particulate matter. These two areas, as well as seven other areas within the State, had previously been designated TSP nonattainment areas. Cuyahoga County and a portion of Jefferson County will remain designated as nonattainment areas for respirable particulate matter.
