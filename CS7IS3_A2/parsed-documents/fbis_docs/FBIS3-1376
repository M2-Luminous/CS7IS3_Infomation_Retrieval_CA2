The envoy is Cameroon's culture minister, who brought a personal message from President Biya to President Henri Konan Bedie. Noufe Nabi brings you this report: [Nabi] Foreign affairs Minister Essy Amara and the Cameroonian ambassador to Cote d'Ivoire were present at the audience, which lasted about 30 minutes. Talks during the audience centered mainly on the Bakassi Peninsula border conflict between Cameroon and Nigeria. Professor Joseph-Marie Bipoun Woum, President Biya's envoy, reaffirmed Cameroon's claim to ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula, and hoped that the current problem would be resolved peacefully. [Begin Woum recording] Yes, Cameroon is confident of its rightful claim to this peninsula, and is engaged in the search for a solution to this problem by peaceful means. We advocate a peaceful solution to the conflict through regional and international intermediaries, as our claim over this peninsula is backed by a series of documents and legal instruments which date as far back as 1885 [words indistinct]. In all we have a total of 23 legal documents, including [word indistinct], protocols, agreements, declarations, and other documents established by our joint border commissions. So, these legal instruments cannot be disputed today and we are ready to defend them wherever necessary to back our legal claims. Naturally, in view of the broad outlook and global experience of President Henri Bedie, as well as the friendly and fraternal relations that have always existed between our two countries since their respective independence, Cameroon hopes that Cote d'Ivoire will contribute to efforts to find a peaceful solution to this conflict.
