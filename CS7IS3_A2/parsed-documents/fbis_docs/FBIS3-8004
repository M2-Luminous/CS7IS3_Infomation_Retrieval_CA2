"Tension increased with heavy shelling in the morning and in the afternoon" of Wednesday, said the sources in central Bosnia. Some 250 shells exploded over the worst-hit area, the Bosnian army-held Gradacac and Brcko zone, 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Tuzla, while 190 shells rained down on a "confrontation line" about five kilometers (three miles) east of Lukavac, near Tuzla. Automatic gun fire and and mortar fire was reported at the front lines, the sources added. In central Bosnia, the ceasefire signed Friday by Bosnian Croats and Moslems appeared to have been generally respected. In the southern city of Mostar, the truce was "almost respected." Five shells hit the Croat-besieged eastern part of the town, where some 50,000 Moslems are holed up. A joint Croat and Moslem committee is to meet around midday Thursday at Gornji Vakuf, 60 kilometers (35 miles) west of Sarajevo. It will be their third meeting since the truce was signed a week ago. Gornji Vakuf marks the front line between Croat forces and the Bosnian Army in southern Bosnia and is where the situation is considered "most volatile," the sources said. However the sources were unable Thursday to confirm a report that the Bosnian Army had launched an offensive Wednesday in the east of the war-torn town. The sources said they believed the Bosnian Army might try to grab more territory before the joint committee, presided over by the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), firmly established where the front lines lay.
