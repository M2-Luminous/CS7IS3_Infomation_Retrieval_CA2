According to the Saeima press service, during the meeting Anatolijs Gorbunovs pointed out that the two countries in recent years had succeeded in forging close cooperation in political and economic matters. He praised the role of the German embassy, as well as that of the support group for Latvia set up in German Bundestag, in stepping up the process. The ambassador on his part stressed that Latvia was a part of Europe and the process of its integration into European structures had to be continued. He said Latvian politicians had yet to face two major problems, notably, withdrawal of Russian troops and passing the law on citizenship. Anatolijs Gorbunovs stated that Latvia should push forward with its efforts to reach a concrete agreement on Russian troops pull-out, which would include conditions set by Latvian negotiators. The chairman of the Saeima also said he considered it an urgent necessity to find the best formula for solving the citizenship controversy, which would be acceptable for the majority of people of this country. Asked to comment on the recent remarks on the Latvian draft law on citizenship voiced by the high commissioner with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Max Van der Stoel, Anatolijs Gorbunovs noted that he personally still did not see arguments which would ease anxiety about the future fate of their nation, felt by majority of the Latvians. Asked about his opinion on another controversy of the day, namely, of including non-citizens into electorate eligible to participate in the local elections, scheduled to be held in late May, the speaker of the Saeima pointed out that the decision which provided a vote for Latvian citizens only, proved to be the right one at the last summer's parliamentary elections. He added that the decision had ensured legitimacy of the sitting legislature, as well as had endorsed it with rights to solve any problem of national interest. Latvia is threading the right path in resolving its political problems, the newly appointed German Ambassador to Latvia Reinhard Holubek told reporters after his meeting with the Chairman of the Saeima Anatolijs Gorbunovs. The ambassador said he was certain this year was going to be of great importance for Latvia, marked with significant events both in adopting key legislations and in settling relations with its neighbours, notably with Russia. Holubek pledged his country would spare no efforts to seek closer ties to be forged between Latvia and the European Community.
