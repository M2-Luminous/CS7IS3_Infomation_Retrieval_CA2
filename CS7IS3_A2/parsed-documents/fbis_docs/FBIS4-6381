FBIS4-6381 "dreas076_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-076 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 North Korea Hanminjon Urges Greenpeace: Probe ROK Dumping Hanminjon Urges Greenpeace: Probe ROK Dumping SK2004082894 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0443 GMT 20 Apr 94 SK2004082894 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Greenpeace Called Upon To Bring Action Against Nuclear Waste Dumping by South Korean Authorities" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) in a letter to the headquarters of the Greenpeace, an international environmental movement organisation, on April 13 said the South Korean people who are exposed to radioactive substances from atomic reactors used for development of nuclear weapons and exposed to constant nuclear threats by a nuclear powder magazine of the United States, hope that the Greenpeace will make a thorough probe into the nuclear waste dumping by the South Korean authorities and their nuclear arms development and bring an action against them before the world, the Seoul-based Radio Voice of National Salvation reported. Recalling that the South Korean authorities dumped into the East Sea of Korea nuclear wastes amounting to 11,000 trillion becquerels in the period from 1986 to 1992, the letter says: "When their such criminal dumping began to be called in question, arousing world public opinion, the South Korean authorities started a socalled `joint survey' in the East Sea of Korea with Russia and Japan, accomplices in nuclear waste dumping, and will reportedly notify the International Atomic Energy Agency of its results. "This cannot be construed otherwise than an attempt to conceal their nuclear waste dumping with the backing of some biased officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency who have already conspired with them in their nuclear racket against the North, shunning the observation of the Greenpeace. "The board of governors of the IAEA, while taking issue with the North over its pilot reactor, branding it as one intended for the development of nuclear weapons, is overlooking heavy water reactors and multi-purpose research reactors for military purposes of the South, and has never published even any results of its inspection to speak of. "Amidst of such biased clamor for nuclear inspection by the IAEA board of governors, the South Korean authorities have accelerated nuclear arms development and are now openly claiming `nuclear sovereignty' to justify their nuclear armament. "If such nuclear development is overlooked, it will not only destroy the natural ecology but may inflict a grave nuclear calamity upon our people and nation. "Our Hanminjon will in the future, too, notify the Greenpeace about data on the criminal nuclear waste dumping and nuclear arms development by the South Korean authorities."
