"The just-formulated measures are intended for a sweeping change of our public works bidding system and are historic in light of their effect on our social and economic structures," Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura quoted the premier as telling a cabinet meeting. Hosokawa also sought further cooperation of cabinet ministers in smoothly implementing the action program to open Japan's large-scale public works projects to foreign bidders, the top government spokesman told a news conference. Takemura said he believes the scheme marks a major shift in the collusive nature of some practices in Japan, such as illegal prearranged bidding for public works projects.
