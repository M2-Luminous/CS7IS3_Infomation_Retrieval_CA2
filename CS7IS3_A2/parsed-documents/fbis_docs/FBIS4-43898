This was agreed by FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) and Italian Defense Minister Cesare Previti (Forza Italia) in Bonn on Tuesday [21 June]. French Defense Minister Francois Leotard, who had arrived on the previous evening, also agreed to it, Previti said at a joint news conference with Ruehe. Both ministers welcomed Russia's signing of the NATO Partnership for Peace, planned for this Wednesday in Brussels, as a "historic event." Ruehe paid tribute to Italy's cooperation in the development of the European Armament Agency. "There is still a very long way to go. What matters is who advances things," he said. Major armament projects can no longer be carried out on a national level. Germany and France have already cooperated very closely in standardizing armament systems, above all by their joint Eurocorps. Previti said that Berlusconi's government insists on Italy bringing more authority to bear in this respect. He is convinced that in the next few months an international task force will be formed by Italy, France, and Spain. Then it will be possible to employ it within the framework of NATO or the Western European Union. Referring to Italy's possible participation in a military action in Rwanda, Previti affirmed Italy's known position: Italy will wait for the UN decision and then decide. The condition is an international supreme command and a humanitarian objective. Italy will not participate in France's individual actions. During his first visit to Bonn, Previti was received with military honors. Ruehe paid tribute to the good cooperation exhibited during the first German UN mission in Somalia.
