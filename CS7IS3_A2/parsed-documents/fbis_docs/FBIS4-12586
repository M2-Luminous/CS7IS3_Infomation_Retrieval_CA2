At the end of the meeting, the mayor said he hopes the observers will be able to separate the Arab residents of Hebron and the settlers. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that Khalid 'Amayirah, the chief Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] spokesman, attacked the presence of the observers in the city and said this is merely a public relations stunt. He warned that if the residents of Hebron do not feel a change in their security, the force might be in danger. The head of the Norwegian delegation said that his men were received warmly in Hebron and that the mayor briefed him on the city's problems. He expressed the hope that the observers force will be able to start working soon.
