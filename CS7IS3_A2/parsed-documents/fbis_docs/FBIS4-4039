This is the first time Zhu has been given the title "acting Premier" (dai zongli) which -- according to China-watchers -- may signal an important shift in the politics at Zhongnanhai (party headquarters). Zhu's new title was quietly announced at a meeting with the Australian Governor-General, Bill Hayden, last week, causing a storm of speculation in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Observers said it could signal that Zhu will continue to handle many of the Premier's functions after Li returns from the Far West tomorrow. Last year, when Li was put out of action by a heart attack, Zhu took over chairing national work meetings and greeting foreign dignitaries, but his status was referred to as "entrusted by the Premier" (shou zongli weituo). Since then, Zhu and the other vice-premiers have used this title when standing in for Li. China-watchers are divided on whether Zhu's star has been rising or falling recently, but most agree that being given the nod as acting Premier shows an improvement in his status. The same title was often used by a former vice-premier, Yao Yilin, before his retirement last year. A revolutionary war hero and contemporary of the party patriarch, Deng Xiaoping, Yao -- who was at that time also a member of the politburo standing committee -- had far higher seniority in the party hierarchy and considerably greater influence in the corridors of power than Li. Alone among the current vice-premiers, Zhu also claims the distinction of membership in the politburo standing committee, the supreme decision-making body of the Communist Party. But with only three years experience as a vice-premier and no previous ministerial posts before he took over the reins at the People's Bank of China last July, Zhu remains a relative outsider in Zhongnanhai. In addition, he carries a stigma within the party for having been labeled a "rightist" during the 1957 Hundred Flowers campaign -- for which he was expelled from the party and served five years in a reform through-labour camp. Among those betting on Zhu's rise, the acting Premier designation reflects moves to set the stage for the next premier in the light of Deng's deteriorating health. "The Chinese denied last year that Zhu was the first among equals," Maurice Brosseau of the Chinese University of Hong Kong said. "But in the last few months, things have been changing fast in preparation for something, maybe the death of Deng Xiaoping." In Brosseau's view, the acting Premier title shows that Zhu is clearly tipped as the successor to Li, who is approaching the end of his stint at the top of the civil government hierarchy. "Nobody can deny Zhu the right to take the leadership now," he said. Zhu's successful handling of the financial crisis last summer and tax reform earlier this year was the testing ground on which he proved himself worthy to be Premier, Brosseau believes. "He solved most of the problems which emerged in the country since 1989, which is more than Li Peng could do," he said. Zhu showed he was willing to take the rap for unpopular policies when his crude efficiency in the crackdown on excessive investment and tax issues stirred resentment. This was appreciated by some conservative senior party members, including Li's own protector and mentor, Chen Yun. "It shows he has emerged from the eclipse. Calling him acting Premier shows he is back in the running," Peter Zheung, of Hong Kong University, said.
