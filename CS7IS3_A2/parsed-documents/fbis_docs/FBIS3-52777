India is interested in sharing China's experience and technology in mechanized long-wall mining in underground mines. Greater emphasis is now being laid on underground mines, as over 70 percent of Indian coal is coming from open-cast mines at present. Underground mining is necessary to increase the production of superior grade coal as well as coking coal whose deposits are available at deeper levels. Specific areas of collaboration between the two countries are expected to be finalized during the visit of a high-level delegation led by the coal minister, Mr. Ajit Kumar Panja, to China beginning from Sunday [9 January].
