Fahrudin Orucevic, an electronics engineer, is the director of a military institute. He was recognized by a collegue from work who was watching the SKY NEWS program. The footage, broadcast by Belgrade Television on Tuesday, shows Orucevic trying to avoid a British reporter who asked him what he was doing at the market as he was seen measuring something. He then walked away, ran across the street and entered a parked vehicle. His former collegue, who asked not to be named in order not to jeopardize the security of a number of people from the institute, categorically claims that Orucevic could have been in charge of a timer -- part of the mine which exploded at the Sarajevo market. He claims that, before the war, Orucevic was employed in Sarajevo's firm SDU which manufacutred remote control systems, and that one year before the start of the war he was in Turkey as the manager of the remote control in a mine. As soon as the war broke out, Orucevic was appointed as director of the Unis Institute, one of the numerous military factories in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina which manufacture weapons and ammunition for the Moslem army. Unis was founded and managed by current Moslem Presidency Vice-Presidemt Ejup Ganic who is one of the leading ideologists of the fundamentalist Islamic followers of Alija Izetbegovic.
