One out of two Italians polled has no doubt: it is Silvio Berlusconi, who came in ahead of Wojtyla and Agnelli, the winners of previous competitions. Among the losers, Achille Occhetto and Umberto Bossi received record negative ratings. Who is the most powerful person in Italy? The responses vary. The opinions obtained in these polls change rapidly, just as the mood of the voters does. "Gianni Agnelli," was the almost monotonous response given by Italians in past years to the Demoskopea and DOXA interviewers. There are no doubts expressed this year either, but the name has changed. "Silvio Berlusconi" is the response given by a chorus of voices to the SWG [Integrated Research Services] of Trieste] interviewers in the poll conducted for IL MONDO. Was it because of the election results? Was it because of Berlusconi's showmanship as a politician and because he holds the office of prime minister? Surveys of public opinion have always been useful primarily for understanding the basic trends--the significant shifts--in public opinion, irrespective of the quantitative data, which may have been influenced by various factors. It was then discovered that the transition from the First to the Second Republic has also made politics a powerful factor. Moreover, the fact that for the first time in our history the head of government is also one of the nation's leading entrepreneurs and the owner of a large segment of the media serves to explain why one out of every two Italians (49.6 percent) in the sample responded to the question, "Which public figure has the most power in Italy today?" by assigning primacy to the TV mogul. Power, his adversaries say, to condition public opinion even through the medium of public opinion research--of surveys that bombard the public with Forza Italia's siren song and thereby help to create a positive halo around Berlusconi. According to this theory, even a public opinion poll is in effect a political spot [preceding word in English]. The fact that the owner of Fininvest is the leader [preceding word in English] who possesses the greatest communications skills is acknowledged even by his severest critics. These critics, however, might be surprised to read a poll--similar to IL MONDO's poll--that was published by OGGI in 1988, at a time when Berlusconi was certainly less well-known and therefore merely a big businessman. In the OGGI poll, 34 percent voted for Agnelli; 20 percent for Berlusconi; 15 percent for Pope Wojtyla; and 10 percent for Bettino Craxi (the highest-rated politician), who came in ahead of Ciriaco De Mita, 7 percent; Francesco Cossiga, 4 percent; Giovanni Spadolini, 2 percent; and Nilde Iotti, 1 percent. These results were wiped out by the bribery scandal and by the new politics, except that the top three votegetters merely changed places. But the Seniors Remain Faithful to the Polish Pope Here is the latest update: Berlusconi, way out in front with 49.6 percent; second, Pope Karol Wojtyla with 19.7 percent; third, Agnelli with 7.4 percent. President of the Republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro came in fourth with 7 percent--a much higher rating than that received by his predecessor in Palazzo Quirinale, Francesco Cossiga. Fifth place (3.3 percent) went to a distinct newcomer, someone who could defeat anyone in the city [preceding word in English] of Milan and who is becoming increasingly better known even outside his profession: Enrico Cuccia, distinguished president of Mediobanca, the financial institution that has brought into its orbit the two big IRI [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] banks that were privatized--Comit [Italian Commercial Bank] and Credit [Italian Credit Bank]. The power attributed to the judiciary, however, proved to be illusory. Despite the fact that the Clean Hands pool [previous word in English] played a significant role in diluting the previous rankings of the powerful, the chief public prosecutor for Milan, Francesco Saverio Borrelli--who figured prominently in the TV reports of recent weeks--came in only sixth with a 3.2 percent approval rating, which was slightly lower than that of Cuccia and slightly higher than that of Occhetto, the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] secretary who has come under fire since the election defeat of the progressive alignment. Occhetto, however, did come in far ahead of Northern League leader Umberto Bossi (despite his theatrical performance at the negotiating table, Bossi's rating failed to rise). And Deputy Public Prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro, the judge most beloved by the Italian people, did very poorly and was relegated--together with Craxi and National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini--to the small group of "others," which received a marginal rating of 0.8 percent. In this connection it should be pointed out that the poll was conducted by telephone using a sample that consisted of 600 adults--a sample that although representative in terms of age, geographic area, and vocation did reflect various tendencies. For example, Berlusconi received a majority of the votes of young people; residents of the northeast; students; and white-collar workers of the private sector. On the other hand, support for the Pope increased in proportion to the increase in the age of the person interviewed, especially among pensioners and the residents of the south and the islands. Diminished Role of the Federated Labor Unions and the PDS It is futile to look for confirmation of this statistical distribution in reality. Which public figure has undergone a decline in influence in Italy? Game, set, and match went in this case to Occhetto, who was far in front with 41.2 percent of the responses, followed by Bossi with 16.7 percent and Head of State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro with 9.3 percent. Also losing influence, albeit to a lesser extent, were Agnelli (6.9 percent of the responses), followed by Wojtyla, Borrelli, Berlusconi, Cuccia, and Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio. The Clean Hands pool got its revenge when the most powerful organizations were ranked rather than the most powerful public figures. The Milan judges received 13.4 percent for third place, behind Forza Italia in second place--formerly occupied by the DC [Christian Democratic Party]--with 16 percent (the coalition of Forza Italia, Lega Nord and the National Alliance took fourth place with 11.4 percent) and most notably behind the Mafia, which took first place with 23.9 percent. The Vatican came in only fifth, with 7.1 percent. Mediobanca made its debut in sixth place with 5.8 percent, well ahead of the Bank of Italy (3.8 percent) and Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry] (3.4 percent). The labor unions (CGIL-CISL-UIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor-Italian Confederation of Trade Unions-Italian Federation of Trade Unions] (3.3 percent), the League (1.6 percent), and the PDS (0.9 percent) came in last but came in first in the follow-up questionnaire concerning the organizations that have lost influence in Italy, Here, the results of this questionnaire were predictable but not their dimensions, for the responses indicated a dramatic loss of influence by the CGIL-CISL-UIL (29.4 percent of the responses), by the PDS (20.1 percent), and even by the Mafia (12.4 percent)--an indication that the action of the judiciary, together with the phenomenon of the penitents, are cause for hope that the phenomenon of the Mafia can be contained. Even League lost influence, according to the poll. Agnelli's revenge, however, derives from a homogeneous sample of 100 entrepreneurs and managers who are qualified to give informed answers to a specific question, i.e., Which public figure possesses the greatest economic power in Italy today? Businessmen in particular felt sure they knew, and gave the president of FIAT 36.1 percent of their votes. Enrico Cuccia's reputation, however, has been rising sharply ever since the most recent operations in which his Mediobanca was at the center of the negotiations and was the only merchant banking [preceding two words in English] group capable of managing companies that were in crisis as well as managing the restructuration of holding companies, acquisitions carried out in foreign countries, and privatizations. This great director of Italian finance obtained 33.7 percent of the votes, mostly from managers. The current prime minister could do no better than third (26.5 percent), for Berlusconi is considered to be less of a "heavyweight" for the purposes of this target [preceding word in English]. Not much was left for Confindustria President Luigi Abete, who received only 1.2 percent of the votes.
