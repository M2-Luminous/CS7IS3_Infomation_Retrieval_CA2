FR940303-2-00164 FR940303-2-00092 Environmental Impact Statement: Prince of Wales Island, Alaska February 22, 1994. AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Cancellation of Notice of Intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. Reference FHWA Notice 6640.19, April 27, 1993. SUMMARY: The FHWA is issuing this notice to inform the public that an environmental impact statement (EIS) will not be prepared for a proposed road improvement project on Prince of Wales Island in Alaska. The scope of the proposed improvements to the North Prince of Wales Highway has been significantly reduced. An EIS will not be prepared because of the reduced potential for significant environmental impacts to result from this project. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Walter Langlitz, Project Manager, Federal Highway Administration/Western Federal Lands Highway Division, 610 East Fifth Street, Vancouver, Washington 98661, Phone: 206/696&hyph;7528. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The new project scope involves reconstruction of the section of North Prince of Wales Road between Coffman Cove junction (M.P. 68.78) and the Naukati junction (M.P. 76.75). This project will correct substandard road features such as narrow width, poor alignment, poor road surface, and unsafe roadside conditions in the project area. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is considering two alternatives in addition to a ``no action'' alternative. One alternative would widen and realign this section to an 60 km/h (40 MPH) standard. The other alternative would widen and realign the section to a 80 km/h (50 MPH) standards. Both alternatives include resurfacing the roadbeds with gravel. This revised proposal is based on written comments and the results of public meetings held in 1993 regarding improvement of roads on Prince of Wales Island. Members of the public and agency representatives discussed potential alternatives and identified relevant issues at these meetings. Input received indicates there is not strong support at this time for new road construction on the east side of the island to meet the stated need. A Scoping Report is available from FHWA which documents the meetings held by FHWA and input received. Issued on: February 23, 1994. Richard Wasill, Planning and Coordination Engineer, Federal Highway Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4885 Filed 3&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;22&hyph;M
