The Vatican diplomat revealed that the Holy See received signals in December that an attack against a Christian target in the Middle East was inevitable. He added: We feared attacks against Christian targets in the Middle East. He noted that the earliest signs of such a possibility emerged around Christmas, when the agreement between the Vatican and the State of Israel was signed.
