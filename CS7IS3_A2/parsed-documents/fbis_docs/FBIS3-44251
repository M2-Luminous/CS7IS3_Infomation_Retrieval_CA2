Accompanied by ANC Election Commission Chairman Popo Molefe and other senior officials, Mr Sisulu is scheduled to address a rally with Namibian President Sam Nujoma on Thursday night. He returns to South Africa on Saturday, leaving the other officials to address rallies and meetings across Namibia next week. SWAPO, which has been at pains to stress the campaign is organised by the party and not the government, said it was supporting the ANC as the only way towards regional peace and stability. SWAPO Secretary-General Moses Garoeb said Namibian independence rested on peace in South Africa, and that this could only be attained under an ANC government. He appealed to all South Africans in Namibia to register and vote in the April elections.
