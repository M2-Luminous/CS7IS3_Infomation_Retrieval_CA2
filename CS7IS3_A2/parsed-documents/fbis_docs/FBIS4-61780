But this is optical fiber. It is only 125 microns thick. Yet it is possible to transmit up to 15,000 calls along this very thin fiber. The technology and equipment for the production of optical fiber was developed in the southern Urals, at the Federal Nuclear Center in the closed city of Chelyabinsk-70. Several years ago, the Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic Power and Industry approved the state conversion program "Russia's Fiber-Optic Communication Systems." The main part of the job fell to the Urals nuclear scientists, who have acquitted themselves brilliantly. They proposed that, unlike foreign firms using natural quartz which is very expensive and in short supply, we should use artificial quartz, which is purer and as a result makes it possible to increase the throughput of information and enhance reliability. Yet listening to Anatoliy Barulin, general designer of our system for the production of optic fiber, you cannot but be amazed. Why is a Swedish fiber-optics line being installed in St. Petersburg and a Japanese one in the Far East, when our system has a great number of advantages recognized in the West.
