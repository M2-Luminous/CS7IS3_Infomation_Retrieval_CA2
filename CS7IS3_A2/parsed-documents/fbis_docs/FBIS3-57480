Border troops estimate that infiltrators are using the tactic of entering in groups and conducting constant radar and visual observation of Russian border vessels, leaving the territorial waters when they appear. The smugglers from Japan ignore signals by border guards to stop, including warning shots. The press service notes that the ships and aircraft of the Russian border troops will take all measures envisaged under the law on the state border of the Russian Federation to protect Russian interests in its territorial waters and economic zone.
