The ITAR-TASS News Agency quoted Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev as saying that Russia would join the "Partnership for Peace" program NATO has offered former Soviet Republics only if NATO approves Russia's proposals. The approval came after the 16-member NATO offered a "special partnership" to Russia on Wednesday to encourage the country to join its "partnership for peace" program. "Russia is interested in a more serious and substantive form of relations with NATO than envisaged by the Partnership for Peace program," said Grachev, who is due to visit NATO next week. Russia has insisted that the "Partnership for Peace" does not offer Russia the status it deserves as a big nuclear power. Reports quoted President Boris Yeltsin as saying NATO may acknowledge Russia's special status in a protocol within the framework of the "partnership for peace" or in a separate bilateral document. Grachev said he intends to submit Russia's new vision of European security at next Tuesday's meeting of NATO and former Warsaw Pact defense ministers in Brussels. According to ITAR-TASS, Grachev will also make a report on provisions of Russia's military doctrine, which was approved in November 1993.
