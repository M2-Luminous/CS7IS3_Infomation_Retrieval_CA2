The decision of the Russian leadership to declare James Morris, counsellor at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, persona non grata, became known Monday evening. The U.S. CIA resident, who was working under diplomatic cover, was instructed to leave Russia within seven days. Let us recall that Aleksandr Lysenko, the 56-year old Russian Foreign Intelligence Service representative who was expelled from the United States, received exactly the same "term." Thus, the sides kind of traded blows and exchanged figures on the board where the invisible dispute between the intelligence services is being conducted. According to our experts, Lysenko's expulsion testifies to the weakness of the accusation against the Ameses, who are being accused of espionage for Moscow's benefit, and the insufficiency and obvious weakness of the evidence against them. First of all, Lysenko, who only arrived in the United States in July of last year, would not have been able, even if he had wanted to, to "blow his cover" in contacts with Aldrich Ames so quickly. If such contacts really existed. In that case, our intelligence agents who ran the Ameses should be expelled. But at the moment they are not being touched. Obviously, the Americans have either been unable to establish their contacts, or, what is more likely, there were no such contacts at all. This version is also corroborated by the fact that Lysenko, in accordance with a previously reached agreement between the Russian and U.S. intelligence services, was known to CIA staffers. Just as Morris was known to the Foreign Intelligence Service. This was done for the purposes of better cooperation between the two intelligence services in spheres like the struggle against drugs trafficking and the monitoring of the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. But, by expelling Lysenko, the Americans have violated the gentlemen's agreement on not divulging the department to which the employees of their special services belong. Second, even the U.S. press is talking about the insufficiency and obvious weakness of the accusation against the Ameses. Evidently, in order to somehow compensate for this failing, a sensation is deliberately being whipped up in the United States over the Ames' arrest. Since there is little evidence, all kinds of rumors are being circulated. For example, Ames is already being accused of cooperating with the drug mafia. (As we know, Aldrich Ames recently worked in the department for the struggle against drug trafficking). Neil Gerardo, president of the U.S. corporation "Gerardo International," which is involved in the development of secret weapons systems to Pentagon orders, even claims that Ames could have passed secrets to Moscow about the production of the company's latest invention -- the so called MRX defense technology. According to experts, all this is rank disinformation, circulated with only one aim -- to create the impression of the monstrous guilt of the Ameses despite obviously insufficient evidence. As has become known, the decision on Lysenko's expulsion was adopted after two high-ranking CIA representatives visited Moscow last week. According to our experts' assessments, they rank third and fifth respectively in this organization's intelligence hierarchy. The purpose of their visit to Moscow was to attempt to persuade our intelligence agents (Foreign Intelligence Service Director Yevgeniy Primakov was in Slovakia at that time) to take the blame upon themselves and recall Aleksandr Lysenko nicely, as well as give up any countermeasures or comments in the press. Comments really did appear in the press, and our intelligence officers could not assume responsibility and kind of admit their guilt by agreeing to Lysenko's recall. And they particularly could not fail to respond adequately to the expulsion of our intelligence officer. The desire to move the affair of exposing someone's agent from a generally speaking routine level in the intelligence world onto a political level, onto the level of Russian-U.S. relations, and the desire to create a pause in relations between our countries, is obvious. This is confirmed by relevant articles in the U.S. press. In particular, statements about the reawakened Russian bear, and about some intrigues or other on Russia's part, apparently undermining the United States' national security, have been appearing. These are sometimes being presented in a way suggesting that the U.S, tax payer is virtually financing Russian spies. At the same time, the impression is created that behind all the Americans' demands, there lies the naive certainty that only they have the right to conduct intelligence activities, while Russia no longer has this right.
