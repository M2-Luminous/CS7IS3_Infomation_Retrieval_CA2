Ghassan al-Khatib, one of the party leaders, told our correspondent Linda Sherzer that he did not believe 'Arafat would be able to muster a majority for the agreement in the Executive Committee. The PPP contends that the Cairo agreement is based on the Israeli demands, and the arrangements stipulated in it are liable to last long after the interim period. The party, which supported the Oslo agreement, is particularly opposed to the arrangements at the border terminals and the security roads leading to the Gaza Strip settlements.
