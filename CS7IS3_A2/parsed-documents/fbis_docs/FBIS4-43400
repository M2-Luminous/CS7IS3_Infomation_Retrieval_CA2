This cabinet's policy provides strong arguments for those who are opposed to to the partial transfer of the conducting of foreign policy from the president to the cabinet. The real core of the problem is that the cabinet needs to govern and blaze the way if it is to be given additional authority in foreign policy. The way that the cabinet has handled the situation that has arisen after the negotiations between the European Union [EU] and Finland has not been encouraging, but it underscores those very problems that are to be feared in the operations of future cabinets also. The most important decision in our country's history that is to be made under normal conditions, after calm deliberations, i.e., the EU membership decision, has been badly confused with domestic policies and the inner turmoil within one political party. In addition to this, the way that the domestic subsidy plan has been dealt with is coming close to making the entire issue a labor market issue. The reluctance of leading ministers of the cabinet, or, more accurately, of the Center Party, to commit themselves to the result they themselves negotiated, their sour expressions as well as evasive, sometimes even misleading statements have astonished even foreign ambassadors who have long tenure in Helsinki and are amicably disposed toward Finland. The impressions gained by foreign countries can be corrected with precise statements. Finns are in a more difficult position. The citizenry has clearly expressed a desire for more information. The media organs are offering enormous amounts of it, but cabinet statements would push anyone at all into a state of uncertainty. The cabinet has not even voided the statement of its own negotiator, Esa Harmala, that Finland's domestic agricultural plan can be approved here only after the EU commission has approved it. This is not the case. The EU commission only makes statements to members and Finland is not a member. The details of a domestic plan are neither conditions for, nor obstacles to membership. At its worst, uncertainty nourishes doubts expressed in tavern discussions that the cabinet is trying to use its waffling and confusing information to force wage earners into opposing the membership, thus making the entire membership project null and void. Anyone at all can conceptualize endless hypothetical examples of the kinds of difficulties the country is faced with if foreign policy is demoted to be a part of an internal power struggle within one political party. As an extreme situation, one can even imagine a situation in which a national defense decision is postponed due to the inner conflicts within one of the leading governing parties. Simply put: Foreign policy is a matter in which a small country cannot afford to play political bumper pool in the same way as with domestic income distribution issues or details of social policy. The cabinet must define its objectives, realize them, and stand behind the results. Order must reign in foreign policy. Else, the country's credibility will waver. Minister of Development Cooperation Toimi Kankaanniemi is a different matter altogether. He is a hostage of the cabinet so that his party cannot too seriously erode support for the bigger governing parties. He is opposed to the EU membership push, in other words, cabinet policy. His staying in the cabinet is assured by well-chosen words that do not prevent his preaching against integration. In conditions reminiscent of an ice hockey match, it is strange that one member of the team is trying to shoot in the opposite goal. In addition to this, Kankaanniemi has become involved in the dispute about the status of Jerusalem, again contrary to the policy of the Finnish cabinet. The Middle East crisis is complicated enough without a noncomprehending and uninformed Finnish minister's becoming involved in a dispute on which Israel has not been able to get the backing of even its staunchest Western supporters. Continuing to hang on to Kankaanniemi as a cabinet member adds to the atmosphere of confusion. The drafting of foreign policy has been made more difficult already by the emergence of new concentrations of authority. The president of the Republic has his own staff, so does the prime minister. The foreign ministry bunker is as old as the hills and will not change into anything else. Construction of yet a fourth fortress is well under way as the Armed Forces are making more efficient their operations in political wrangling over national defense policy. The United States is a superpower and can afford the legendary vying for supremacy between the White House, the State Department, and the Department of Defense. Russia also recalls its greatness and absorbs two foreign policies, the president's and the military's. A small country cannot afford any confusion.
