A Japanese auto maker sent this invitation to the parts manufacturers with whom they did business during the middle of April. At the exhibit, the parts of the Neon, which surprised the industry by their low price, were displayed divided into two sections, drive related and body related. The parts of the sponsoring manufacturer's car also were displayed, and the plan was to compare the differences in design of the two cars. The parts of the Neon in front of their eyes gave a fresh shock to the various parts companies of Japan. The president of one parts manufacturer raised a voice of admiration, "This truly is reengineering and it is hard to believe that the workmanship is U.S. made." For example, there is the muffler joint. It is a one-touch slip-on type. The Japanese-made joint requires four bolts, but bolts are unnecessary with this method. The attachment of the gasoline tank is simple and it is said that "places that use several parts in the Japanese-made section are held to a few. If the bumper could be made a unit to this extent, it would reduce the number of parts." Of course, if analyzed from the professional standpoint that "the underside of the car is rusted" or "there are gaps around the various instruments," the defects also are conspicuous. However, insofar as Chrysler says "we made it with the intention of competing with Japanese carmakers," the Japanese frankly admit "there are many things to study." Efforts are under way to thoroughly investigate parts costs, and the various Japanese companies now say in unison that "design capability determines 70 percent of manufacturing costs." The sluggish demand has been prolonged and in addition to rationalization, the greatest task for the various companies is "a fundamental review of design." Making use of "the cheap dollar" in "design capability" which Neon symbolizes, the major U.S. parts manufacturers are storming "the Japanese car market." Cherry Corporation (Illinois; president, Grant Hollett), a major auto switch company, established a Japanese branch in Yokohama at the end of last year, and is pushing uniquely designed switches to Japanese firms. "Japanese carmakers will not touch them with the cost superiority of a few percent for U.S. products. They will use them for the first time when there is more of a difference adding transport, evaluation, and design costs. Cost superiority of some tens of percent will be necessary for that." The eloquence of branch president Hoshino is backed by self-confidence. U.S. Cherry products are considered modules with the switch base parts standardized, and a metal part called a "twist lock" of the module runs electricity to the switch knob. It is a unique mechanism of the company, soldering is not required, and it can be connected with one touch. The module can be adapted to any switch, and mass production of 1 million a month will be possible. The part that meets the needs of the individual client is just the knob which corresponds to the switch contact part, and it just has to be redesigned and again produced. According to branch president Hoshino, Japanese parts manufacturers use some common parts, but basically, the whole switch is designed for the individual client. The more types of cars, the more they are compelled to have many part types and small quantity production, and it becomes a factor in increasing costs. ITT Automotive (Michigan; president, Timothy Luriette), a major U.S. parts manufacturer, points out that "So long as the Japanese car maker's own company specs are satisfied, the position of the supplier with cost superiority becomes clear" (Tomokazu Ataka, manager, business development department, Japanese office of the company). Department manager Ataka discloses that "If procurement is made within Japan, parts which are $200 each end up $80 each when made by ITT." This is the price when supplied in the United States, but even if upgraded and exported to Japan, it can be supplied to the Japanese market at $120. That calculates to 40 percent cheaper than the Japanese-made part. What is the strategy to counter U.S.-made parts which are expanding with unique "design capability"? President Akio Ono of Car Sonic hastens to instruct employees, "Let's design so that they can be employed in light cars also." They only have some dealings with Fuji Heavy Industry for light cars for the aluminum radiators which are the forte of the company. President Ono says, "Just being used in light cars will hold down price and since we must handle it by conserving space, a change from previous concepts is unavoidable." In the 1980's, U.S. carmakers and parts manufacturers vied with each other in studying Japanese cars and absorbing manufacturing know-how. Japanese manufacturers one and all now are studying the "design capability" of U.S. makers.
