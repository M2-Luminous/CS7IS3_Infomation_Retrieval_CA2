Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for Hamas, the biggest faction within the APF, said that a delegation of all the leaders from the opposition factions recently returned from an official visit to the Libyan capital Tripoli. He added that this is the first visit of its kind. In a statement to QUDS PRESS, Ghawshah said that the leaders of the alliance visited Libya at the invitation of Libyan President Mu'ammar Qadhdhafi. He noted that the delegation included George Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP]; Colonel Muhammad Musa, alias Abu-Musa, secretary of the central committee of the Palestine National Liberation Movement, Fatah-The Uprising; Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, leader of the Islamic Jihad Movement; Talal Naji, assistant secretary general of the PFLP-General Command; 'Arabi 'Awwad, secretary general of the Revolutionary Communist Party; Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP]; 'Isam al-Qadi [secretary general of the Popular Liberation War Vanguards Organization-Al-Sa'iqah]; Abu-Nidal al-Ashqar [member of the Palestine Liberation Front Political Bureau]; Khalid 'Abd-al-Majid [secretary general of the splinter group Palestinian Popular Struggle Front]; in addition to Ghawshah himself and Khalid Mash'al from Hamas. The spokesman said that the delegation held a two-hour meeting with leader Qadhdhafi in Surt. The delegation demanded that al-Qadhdhafi support the intifadah and the mujahidin and work on stopping attempts of normalization with the Zionist enemy, as he said he would. The Palestinian official said that last Saturday, the delegation met with Colonel Abu-Bakr Yunus, the Libyan Chief of Staff and member of the ruling Revolution Command Council. Ghawshah described the visit as useful and fruitful. He said: It is a gain in itself to exchange views and agree on common denominators dealing with Arab and official interests. He noted that Libya promised to offer more moral and financial support for the liberation of Palestine. He added that he expects the APF leadership to visit Iran on a date that has not yet been fixed.
