More soldiers are refusing to continue their military service, particularly in southern and northern Iraq. Saddam's regime has tried frantically to contain this phenomenon. It has allocated a reward of 3,000 dinars to anyone who provides information about a deserter from military service. If the informer guides the authorities to the deserter's location the reward becomes 10,000 dinars. The regime's measures follow attempts to control desertion that failed despite its seizing the movable and immovable properties of deserters and punishing the families that give them refuge.
