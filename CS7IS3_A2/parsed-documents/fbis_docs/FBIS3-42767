Migranyan from Galina Sidorova, policy adviser to the minister of foreign affairs of Russia: "What Should Russia Be Doing in the Near Abroad?"] [Text] Esteemed Andranik Movsesovich, henceforward I, like other readers of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of 12 January, know who saved Russia, its foreign minister, the Presidential Council, and the president himself from the great delusion, to which, as follows from your publication, all had succumbed simultaneously under the leadership of the Foreign Ministry. The delusion or, as you go on to specify, the policy of Yeltsin and Kozyrev, was "expressed in relief" and "formed the basis of the report of Foreign Minister Kozyrev and Supreme Soviet Chairman Khasbulatov at a conference organized by the Foreign Ministry in February 1992 at the Moscow State International Relations Institute." It, I quote from your article, "was that Russia should turn inward within the borders of the Russian Federation, leave all the former republics of the USSR, and not get pulled into interethnic and regional conflicts of the former Union..., thereby publicly having renounced all special rights and interests in the post-Soviet space." It is nice to know that there are people who are not afraid to assume responsibility and to open the eyes of the public. "I formulated for the first time," you boldly acknowledge, "the central idea which subsequently came to be determining in an understanding of Russia's role and place in the post-Soviet space among all leading politicians of Russia, from the president through Foreign Minister Kozyrev. It amounts to the fact that the entire geopolitical space of the former Soviet Union is a sphere of Russia's vital interests." While not in the least disputing your contribution to the elaboration of policy in this most important field, I would like merely to call your attention to certain nuances which you either failed to hear or failed to read through to the end. First, A.V. Kozyrev and R.I. Khasbulatov delivered, for all that, at the said conference not one common but each his own report. And whereas the chairman of the Supreme Soviet really did let slip that "Russia should not permit itself to be pulled into interethnic conflicts; even acting the part of arbiter on these issues on the territory of other countries of the CIS is dangerous for it for these issues are not resolved in a short historical period," the foreign minister in his speech (see the journal MEZHDUNARODNAYA ZHIZN, issue for March-April 1992) said literally the following: "The formation of the CIS occupies a special place in Russia's foreign policy. Here lies our paramount vital interest, if you will. Fundamental questions of Russia's reconstitution in the civilized world.... In this area also Russia will defend its interests firmly, `strictly,' where necessary, making use of all the opportunities available to us. Exclusively on a legal basis, of course.... Our special attention to human rights and to the rights of Russians, in the countries of the CIS included and in particular." And, further: "Understandably, the fate of the CIS will largely be decided not only in the European direction but in the south of the Commonwealth also. It is not a matter of indifference to Russia what kind of path the development of the former Union republics, now independent states, located there takes, who will influence this development and how...." Second, I would also like to remind you, Andranik Movsesovich, of certain statements of the president pertaining to this time and also of some things that were said by A.V. Kozyrev both before and in development of the speech to which you refer. "Russia recognizes the full extent of its responsibility for the Commonwealth of Independent States becoming a ponderable factor of stability in the world" (from B.N. Yeltsin's speech at the top-level UN Security Council session on 31 January 1992). "The 25 million of our compatriots in these states must not and will not be forgotten by Russia.... An agreement on the creation of a peacekeeping force in the Commonwealth has already been signed within the framework of the CIS.... "But the legal mechanisms of the formation and use of this force have yet to be worked out and legalized (the Supreme Soviet was in no hurry here--G.S.)" (from B.N. Yeltsin's speech at the Sixth Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian Federation of 7 April 1992). "The Commonwealth is in the formation phase, which is proceeding in extremely painful and contradictory fashion. The position of our compatriots in the CIS countries.... will largely depend on how stable the Commonwealth is. It has to be frankly acknowledged that we are doing an inadequate job of protecting our compatriots as yet. At the same time, on the other hand, attempting to resolve such problems with the aid of force and ultimatums, via armed confrontation with the republics even more, as some people are proposing, is nothing other than political recklessness. Agreeing to this would mean knowingly putting our fellow citizens in the position of enemies and inciting an avalanche of violence against them" (which, unfortunately, we observed as a result of the activity of former Vice President Rutskoy in the Dniester region and in a number of other regions--G.S.) (from B.N. Yeltsin's speech at the Sixth Congress of People's Deputies of 21 April 1992). "The main priority of Russian diplomacy is the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States.... We cannot deny ... the entire complex set of problems connected with the processes of the acquisition of independence by all of us. It is for this reason that a transitional period, which would make it possible to avoid a repetition of rash Bolshevik decisions and afford opportunities for the smooth transition of the totalitarian empire to a commonwealth of democratic independent states, is needed. "Equality does not absolve Russia of its special responsibility entrusted to it by history" (from A.V. Kozyrev's article in IZVESTIYA of 2 January 1992). "Essentially the CIS is the sole possible form of renewal of the Union, which you advocated in the historic Declaration of State Sovereignty.... The real choice, which we can and must make, is between the arduous and multistage process of formation of the CIS and continued uncontrolled collapse and the exacerbation of relations with neighbors, a choice between the addition brick by brick of a belt of good-neighborliness around Russia and the `Yugoslav option' of the hopeless and devastating use of force. "...If we ourselves wish to live in a democratic state at the highest standard, we must build in exactly the same way also the relations with our neighbor CIS states without any allowances and without attempts to return to the idea that we have not yet matured to democratic standards. This does not, however, mean that we should not apply quite strict methods, power methods included, of the defense of Russian interests and human rights, on the contrary, it implies a mastery of such levers, but strictly in accordance with contemporary rules of international law and ideas. ... The fact that Russia is becoming firmly established in its integral statehood in the Commonwealth is also a factor of political reality" (from A.V. Kozyrev's speech at the Sixth Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian Federation of 18 April 1992). "Two extremes--the reckless withdrawal of troops from the former Union republics, particularly Asia and the Transcaucasus, especially with provision not having been made for their new living arrangements, and, on the other hand, continuation of the present situation--cannot be allowed. The Foreign Ministry sees as the solution a base strategy on treaty principles. The main thing is that we simply cannot walk away from this historical geopolitical and humanitarian sphere of our vital interests and responsibility" (from A.V. Kozyrev's speech at the Council for Foreign Policy on 27 November 1992). "It would be desirable for us to speed up and approve the submittal to the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation of a bill prepared by the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Defense and already approved by the Supreme Soviet Presidium on the principles and mechanisms of Russia's participation in peacemaking operations along CIS, CSCE, and UN lines" (which was not done--G.S.) (from A.V. Kozyrev's speech at an enlarged session of the International Affairs Committee of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation on 26 January 1993). Please excuse the lengthy quotation. But I would like to hope for a more attentive attitude toward what is actually being said and done by the Foreign Ministry on the part of experts and also the new parliament. For under the old one Smolenskaya Square missed a professional discussion about foreign policy not burdened by political games.
