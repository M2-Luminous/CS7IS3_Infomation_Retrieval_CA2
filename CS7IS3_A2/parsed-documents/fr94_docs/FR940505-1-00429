The owner or operator shall subsequently comply with the limit once it is established. The ppm CO emissions shall be corrected to 3 percent volume stack gas O 2 on a dry basis averaged over a period of 15 consecutive minutes. (C) Demonstrate initial compliance with the NO X and CO emission standards specified in paragraphs (u)(3)(i) (A) and (B) of this section in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (u)(6)(i)(C) and (u)(7)(i) of this section. (D) Units with a rated heat input capacity equal to or greater than 5 mmBtu/hr and less than 40 mmBtu/hr shall demonstrate compliance with the NO X and CO emission standards specified in paragraphs (u)(3)(i) (A) and (B) of this section in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (u)(7)(i) of this section not less than once every 24 months since the previous compliance test. (E) Units with a rated heat input capacity greater than 40 mmBtu/hr and less than 100 mmBtu/hr shall demonstrate compliance with the NO X and CO emission standards specified in paragraphs (u)(3)(i) (A) and (B) of this section in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (u)(7)(i) of this section not less than once every 12 months since the previous compliance test. (F) Units with a rated heat input capacity equal to or greater than 100 mmBtu/hr shall demonstrate compliance with the NO X and CO emission standards specified in paragraphs (u)(3)(i) (A) and (B) of this section in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (u)(6)(ii)(A) of this section. (ii) Any owner or operator that operates a unit with an annual heat input rate less than 9 × 10 9 Btu/yr shall comply with one of the following: (A) The unit shall be tuned once every 6 months or after 750 hours of operation since the previous tuneup, whichever occurs last, but in no case less than once per calendar year. The unit shall be tuned in accordance with the procedures described in paragraph (u)(7)(ii) of this section; or (B) The unit shall be operated in a manner that maintains stack gas oxygen concentrations at less than or equal to 3 percent on a dry basis for any 15 consecutive minute averaging period; or (C) The unit shall be operated using a stack gas oxygen trim system set at 3 percent oxygen. The tolerance of the setting shall be # 5 percent; or (D) Demonstrate compliance with the NO X and CO emission standards specified in paragraphs (u)(3)(i) (A) and (B) of this section in accordance with the applicable requirements of paragraphs (u)(3)(i)(D), (E), or (F) of this section. (E) Any owner or operator of a unit subject to the requirements of paragraph (u)(3)(ii) of this section shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (u)(3)(i) of this section if the unit is ever operated during any rolling 12 calendar month period at a total annual heat input rate equal to or greater than 9 × 10 9 Btu/yr. (4) Exemptions. (i) The requirements of paragraphs (u)(3), (u)(5), (u)(6), and (u)(7) of this section shall not apply to any owner or operator of a unit with a rated heat input capacity of less than 5 mmBtu/hr. (ii) The requirements of paragraph (u)(3)(i)(A)( 1 ) of this section shall not apply to any owner or operator of a unit normally operated on gaseous fuel under the following conditions: (A) Non-gaseous fuel use is required due to the curtailment of natural gas service to the individual unit by the natural gas supplier. Non-gaseous fuel use in this case shall not exceed the period of natural gas curtailment. (B) Non-gaseous fuel use is required to maintain the non-gaseous fuel system. Non-gaseous fuel use in this case shall not exceed 50 hours per year. (C) Any owner or operator that claims an exemption under paragraph (u)(4)(ii) of this section shall comply with the recordkeeping requirements specified under paragraph (u)(6)(iii)(I) of this section. (5) Compliance schedule. (i) Any owner or operator of a unit in existence prior to [Insert date of publication of the final rule] that does not need to retrofit the unit or install new control equipment to comply with the requirements of paragraph (u)(3) of this section shall demonstrate compliance with all of the applicable requirements of paragraph (u) of this section by May 15, 1995.
