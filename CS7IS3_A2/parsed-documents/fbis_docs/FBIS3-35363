They are not friends, and condolences can be sent in a telegram that will travel the same indirect way he and his friends were to travel to Damascus -- through a third country and bearing no Israeli markings. The Solan Communications Company would gladly do this service for him, even for free. In his trip, Darawshah wished to make a political move that would seem like a Syrian gesture toward Israel. I am afraid, however, that his trick will yield just the opposite result. The main Syrian condition was that the delegation be made of strictly "our Arab brothers." In other words, al-Asad wants a Jew-free delegation. In doing so, he made the same mistake he made in Geneva when he prevented the participation of Israeli reporters in his joint news conference with President Clinton. We said then and we say today: This is no way to win the Israelis' hearts. The wise guys will ask: Did you ask to travel to Damascus to express condolences? Well, the answer is no. Nevertheless, over the past weeks and months, some of the most prominent Israeli reporters have asked to be received by him. I told Darawshah last week that I am willing to convert to Islam if only he promised to take me with him. "Next time perhaps," he said with a smile. This, however, is not the point. The point is that not only journalists, but also the president of Israel, and mainly the prime minister and seniors on his behalf have repeatedly asked through every possible channel to meet with al-Asad or his trustee to discuss ways to secure peace at the highest possible levels. Al-Asad has refused and is refusing even now, after the summit with Clinton. He simply does not want, or is unable, to make himself stand face to face with Israeli Jews; not even to receive the Golan Heights back. He missed opportunities before Geneva; he missed one in Geneva; and he is doing it again now. He invited the delegation of Israeli Arabs at a very late date (the 40 days of mourning are nearly over), under humiliating traveling conditions, without Israeli passports, not through the al-Qunaytirah but via a third country, and under a series of restrictions on the issues they may and may not discuss with him. Even the American anti-Semitic clubs have at least one token Jew, for appearance sakes. Darawshah's delegation will not even include a symbolic Jew. The problem has always been, and still is, al-Asad's lack of understanding for the Israeli mentality and psychology. Now, when we are conducting peace negotiations and there is a little opening of goodwill for concessions on Israel's part, childish excuses to talk to al-Asad are not required. In fact, he has a standing offer to meet Rabin or a senior envoy on his behalf and close a deal on the principles of the nature of the agreement they will sign. Al- Asad does not have too much time, and he is not as sophisticated as is often believed. If he does not hurry up, the status quo will continue and many, perhaps even Rabin, will sigh with relief. Instead of using this shortcut, al-Asad is wasting valuable time instructing his envoy in Washington not to discuss security arrangements or the nature of peace, only withdrawal: Pull out first, then we will talk of peace and security arrangements. This waste of time is particularly intolerable now, when terror against Israelis is becoming more brutal every day. The more appalling killings are committed and the more funerals take place, the less the public will support making concessions in return for peace. We might reach a point at which the Israelis will ask themselves: If terror continues despite our willingness to give up the territories, why not keep them? The security arrangements and or personal security are the magic keys for peace. In this fragile time it is particularly important to repel the skepticism that has started crawling into our hearts. The ping pong games that led to the breakthrough in U.S.-PRC relations do not suit the Middle East pace. It is important that a central figure such as al-Asad use big words in talking to us. He should flood us with words of peace and with gestures. After all, it serves him as well -- we have the goods. It is with us, Jews, that he has to make peace, not with the Arabs. Darawshah's delegation will make no difference, or as Rabin reportedly said: No big deal.
