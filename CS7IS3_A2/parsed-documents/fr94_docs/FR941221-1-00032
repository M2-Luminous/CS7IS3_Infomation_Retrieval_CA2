FR941221-1-00032 FR941221-1-00012 F. December 20, 1991 final rule In the December 20, 1991 final rule responding to petitions for reconsideration in Docket HM&hyph;181, RSPA agreed with NSWMA that medical waste containing an infectious substance should be treated differently than other infectious substances. RSPA had no basis, however, to except from regulation medical waste containing an infectious substance, and stated ``*␣*␣* since the majority of these wastes are untreated and, thus, may potentially contain infectious substances, RSPA strongly believes that the public and transport personnel be protected from the hazards of these materials during transportation'' (56 FR 66142). Accordingly, RSPA revised the regulations (49 CFR 173.197 (1991)) to specify ``*␣*␣* less rigorous requirements for infectious substances that are `regulated medical wastes''' (56 FR 66131). RSPA observed that EPA's regulations on medical waste in 40 CFR Part 259 had applied in only five States and had expired on June 22, 1991, with the end of a 2-year demonstration program that EPA had established under the Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 (MWTA; Pub.L. 100&hyph;582). To provide less rigorous requirements for medical waste containing infectious substances, RSPA turned to the expired EPA regulations as a model that could be adapted, with some modifications, to the HMR. RSPA wanted to take advantage of the technical expertise and knowledge of the medical waste industry that EPA had developed during its demonstration project under the MWTA. Accordingly, RSPA adopted a definition of ``regulated medical waste'' (to distinguish between all medical waste and medical waste containing an infectious substance) and specified packaging requirements for regulated medical waste (RMW) that were consistent with those contained in the expired EPA regulations. RSPA thus identified a subcategory of Division 6.2 (infectious substances) materials, i.e., RMW, which is an infectious substance that is contained in or constitutes medical waste, and provided packaging requirements for RMW that were less rigorous than those for other infectious substances. Under the December 1991 rule, if an infectious substance is offered for transportation or transported, the infectious substance must be labeled, packaged, and offered for transportation in accordance with the HMR, unless it meets one of the exceptions from regulation. The 1991 rule provided that if the infectious substance was a medical waste, or was contained in medical waste, then a shipper could use the less rigorous packaging requirements that were provided for RMW. If RSPA had not provided this measure of regulatory relief in response to petitions, all infectious substances, regardless of how they are generated, would be classified and described as Division 6.2 materials, and would be subject to the full extent of regulation provided in the HMR. G. Petitions for reconsideration and comments received in response to the December 20, 1991 rule Following issuance of the December 1991 rule, RSPA received additional petitions for reconsideration and a number of requests for clarification and additional comments concerning the provisions for infectious substances and regulated medical waste. The petitioners requested a stay in the effectiveness of the final rule and the reopening of the rulemaking for additional public input. Petitions were submitted by the American Hospital Association (AHA), the Association for Practitioners in Infection Control, Inc. (APIC), and the Conference on Safe Transportation of Hazardous Articles, Inc. (COSTHA). The petitioners asserted that RSPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553; ``APA'') by adopting new requirements for medical waste in the December 20, 1991 rule without providing an opportunity for comment; did not adequately assess the risks associated with RMW in transportation and the costs and benefits of regulation; and did not coordinate with other Federal agencies to prevent imposition of conflicting regulations. Petitioners also contended that the RMW requirements in the HMR conflict with information contained in the report entitled ``The Public Health Implications on Medical Waste: A Report to Congress,'' prepared in 1990 by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) on the Medical Waste Tracking Act. The ATSDR Report contains a compilation of information obtained from several State health and environmental departments on the amount and types of medical waste generated and health and environmental implications of medical waste in the United States. The report concludes that infection outside the health care setting is not likely, and public health is not likely to be adversely affected by medical waste in transportation. COSTHA also asserted that RSPA changed the definition of infectious substances to include substances ``infectious to animals only'' without providing an opportunity to comment.
