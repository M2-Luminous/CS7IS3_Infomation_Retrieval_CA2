FBIS4-28009 "dreas110_i_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-110 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 Cambodia Report on Forest Destruction, Economic Issues Report on Forest Destruction, Economic Issues BK0606135394 BK0606135394 BFN [Editorial Report] Phnom Penh REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA in Cambodian on 4 June carries the following reports in its business section: Concerning the domestic transportation of timber, the paper says that 30 barges carrying processed wood to Phnom Penh have been stranded at the Kratie provincial port for nearly a month because the province's Department of Forestry and Wildlife has refused to issue a permit. No reason has been given. The paper calls on the department to explain its action, saying that the government has not banned the transportation of processed wood for local use and that the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Wildlife, and Fisheries has even taken bids for the exploitation of 29 forest lots across the country. Citing the extra fees that the timber merchants are forced to pay because of the ban, the paper calls on the department to announce future transportation bans in advance. In a report on the privatization of state-owned factories, the paper says that of the 59 factories put into operation since 1979, 42 have been rented, 10 have been sold to the local private sector and foreign investors, and seven remain under government control. The paper cites the director of the Industry Ministry's Planning Department as saying that many businessmen are interested in renting the remaining seven factories, but are hesitant because of the many preconditions and problems. For example, they must hire all of the current workers in each factory and do not have the right to fire any of them, even if they break the rules or refuse to work. Also, they need to renovate and modify the factories and the machines -- which are not in good condition -- but the import of spare parts is time consuming and involves many procedures. On the destruction of Cambodia's forests, the paper blames the government for granting logging concessions to foreign companies. It says that although a log export ban has been in effect since 30 March 1994, many foreign companies are still cutting Cambodian trees and transporting logs out of the forests. As an example, it cites a joint venture between Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore located at Prek Prasap Leu village in Prek Prasap District of Kratie Province. The paper says the government and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Wildlife, and Fisheries might not know about the activities of this company because even the Kratie provincial governor and Prek Prasap District governor have pretended not to hear about it. About 40,000 cubic meters of logs already cut by this company are being transported out of the province. Forestry officials have revealed that after the government imposed the log export ban, the company stored logs temporarily at Prek Phnoeu and is looking for other ways to get the logs out of Cambodia. The company plans to export a total of 90,000 cubic meters of logs in the 1993-94 period.
