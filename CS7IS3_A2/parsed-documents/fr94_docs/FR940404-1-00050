SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The fishery for Pacific halibut ( Hippoglossus stenolepis ) off the coasts of Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California is governed by the Convention for the Preservation of the Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea (Convention) signed by the United States and Canada in 1953. The Convention is carried out by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC), which develops regulations to manage the fishery. The United States and Canada amended the Convention in 1979. The Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 (Halibut Act, Pub. L. 97&hyph;176) was subsequently enacted to give effect to the 1979 Protocol.
