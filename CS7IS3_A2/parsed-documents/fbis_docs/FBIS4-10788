I believe Portal's detailed explanation satisfies all questions, doubts, criticisms, and complaints on the generating capacity, particularly in Havana City, where in past weeks, unscheduled outages have seriously intensified. Portal explained the reasons for the increase in outages and the reasons why it is impossible to adhere to a plan of scheduled outages. Tomorrow, Sunday, at 1630 local time Tele Rebelde will rebroadcast that interview. Those who were unable to hear Minister Portal's explanations should listen to the words of the Minister of the Basic Industry. I believe he spoke clearly without rhetoric, without euphoria, and with specific facts. I am not going to summarize his words. It is better that you listen to them without an intermediary. I am going to refer to one aspect of Marco Portal's discourse regarding the exploration and extraction of Cuban oil. He announced that the drilling of oil wells will begin in diverse areas assigned to well-known foreign enterprises through exploration agreements with the state at their own risk. In other words, the enterprises cover all the expenses until oil is found, if there is any, and after complex research. It is obvious that these costs are very high. They range from millions to hundreds of millions of dollars. The drilling of oil wells is done only when the research yields positive results. Similarly expensive, and when the existence of oil is confirmed, the phase of preparing conditions for oil exploitation begins next. The fact is that the drilling process in several places is about to begin. Another fact that to me is of singular importance is that there are several contracts with diverse foreign firms, many of which are European, which are experienced in this type of work. As Portal said, this guarantees that when the United States decides to lift the blockade, U.S. enterprises, many of which are currently very interested in establishing this type of contract, can do so and will join those that already exist. Therefore we will follow a strategy -- and I am paraphrasing -- that would seem to mark the tone for our foreign economic relations: Never again depend on just one market for supplies to our country or to sell our products. History has demonstrated how risky that can be, especially if that market of buyers or sellers is the U.S. market. Cuba will not reject U.S. investments that adjust to our laws, but we want to maintain a broad range and never again have only one source. Furthermore, when U.S. enterprises are authorized by their government to trade with Cuba, in other words when the blockade is someday lifted, Cuba will respect the contracts with foreign enterprises that made the investments when the United States prohibited such transactions. It is a principle of ethics and of knowing how to honor the responsibilities acquired.
