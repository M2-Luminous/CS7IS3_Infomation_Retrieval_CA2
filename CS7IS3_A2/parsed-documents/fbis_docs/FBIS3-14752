"If our cooperation is limited to questions of security systems or foreign policy, everything may remain at the level of mere rhetoric," Meri noted. He said the Baltic states must realize that, under their geopolitical conditions, issues of security and foreign policy can be solved only if they have a common economic basis. In Meri's opinion, the Baltic states' cooperation must proceed from integrating their energy systems, which would set them free from dependence on Russia. "Realization of our independence would allow us to regard Russia in a considerably friendlier light," the Estonian president stated.
