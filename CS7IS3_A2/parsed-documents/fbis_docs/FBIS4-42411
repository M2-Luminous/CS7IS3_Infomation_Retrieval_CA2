The nation's GDP should grow by 1.3 percent in the current year and by two percent in 1995 but employment will shrink further in 1994, by one percent, according to ISCO [National Institute for the Study of the Economic Situation], the short and medium-term economic studies institute which urged Italy to better exploit present and coming opportunities associated with recovery. An ISCO report on the economic trend issued today said under consideration were forecasts based on no changes in economic policy. What surfaces, said the document, "is a picture in which not all opportunities, which do exist, are fully utilized. Economic growth would not acquire, therefore, the pace necessary to activate an additional commitment of productive factors, despite the presence of the improved financing capabilities of enterprise." The institute said the rate of inflation can be expected to come down further but that Italy's low will still be above the rates in the other European Union nations and that the public debt can be reduced only in terms of the percentage of GNP. The recent past, said ISCO, has shown the recovery signals are being consolidated as a result of reductions applied to the Bank of Italy's key discount rate, meaning a lower cost of money, and the generalized improvement of the world economy. However, the outlook for all of 1994 and '95 confirms that growth this year "does not appear to reach the consistency needed to revive investments and employment in a satisfactory way," the report added. Following is a table of ISCO forecasts covering the major economic indicators with the percentages shown in real terms, that is, net of price variations: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1994 |1995 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |gross domestic product |+ 1.3 |+ 2.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |imports |+ 3.5 |+ 5.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |exports |+ 7.0 |+ 7.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |domestic demand |+ 0.3 |+ 1.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |household consumption |0.0 |+ 1.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |total consumption |+ 0.2 |+ 0.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |gross fixed investments |- 0.7 |+ 2.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Inflation is expected to continue downwards, slowly, to 3.9 percent by the end of the year and to 3.5 percent in 1995. Despite the "very modest dynamics" on the cost-of-labor front, the employment picture will not brighten, said ISCO which reported that the cost of labor per unit of production should increase by about one percent this year and by 2.5 percent in 1995.
