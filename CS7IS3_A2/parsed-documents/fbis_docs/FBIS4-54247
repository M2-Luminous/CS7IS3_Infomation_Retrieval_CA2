Fiji's cabinet this week decided that only Fiji nationals will sit on the 11-member commission drawn from all the political parties. The opposition parties had demanded an independent head to review the constitution which discriminated against Fiji Indians giving them only 27 seats in the 70-seat parliament. The commission's final report is due by the end of 1996.
