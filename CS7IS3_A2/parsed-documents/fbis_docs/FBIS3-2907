They are important missions facing governments at various levels. Leading comrades at various levels must be of one mind, must be concerned with the overall situation, and must resolutely restrain [kong zhi 2235 0455] price indices within the prescribed targets for 1994. Arriving at the Hunan Lounge of the Great Hall of the People this morning as a deputy to the National People's Congress [NPC] from Hunan Province, Zhu Rongji joined all Hunan NPC deputies in a group discussion on Premier Li Peng's "Government Work Report." While earnestly listening to the speeches of more than 10 deputies, he constantly interrupted and exchanged views with them. His cheerful and humorous remarks enlivened the atmosphere of the meeting. Zhu Rongji fully affirmed Hunan Province's achievements in 1993, particularly its work in eliminating "IOU's" to peasants, in reducing peasants' burdens, and in rectifying "the rush to establish development zones." Later, he made specific remarks on issues concerning stabilizing the market and prices which are of the greatest interest to the deputies. He stated: Prices began to rise in some localities in China in November 1993, and gradually price increases spread across the country. The party Central Committee and State Council noticed the situation, promptly took effective measures, and stopped prices from rising too rapidly. However, the problem has not been resolved once and for all. Since the beginning of 1994, the broad masses of people have been generally concerned with the tendency that prices have been rising monthly. Zhu Rongji said: Some people attribute the current price increase to reform measures introduced this year. It is a gross misunderstanding. He pointed out: Inflation, which started before reform measures were introduced and which was an inevitable result of the excessive money supply in circulation in the first half of 1993, has had little to do with this year's reform measures. After reform measures were introduced for more than two months in the beginning of 1994, the national economy has shown an unexpectedly good performance. First, government revenues increased more than 30 percent in the January-February period of 1994 over that of the same period in 1993. Second, the money supply in circulation has been under effective control and has been reduced to a prescribed range in accordance with macroeconomic regulation and control. Presently the reduction of the circulating money supply has been progressing favorably. Seventy percent of the extra money supply provided prior to the Spring Festival has been retracted; the rest is expected to be taken back by the end of March. Third, simultaneous reform in foreign currency transactions has been progressing smoothly. Exchange rates between reminbi and foreign currencies have remained stable, and China's foreign exchange reserve has increased quite considerably. Fourth, the supply of market commodities is extremely abundant, and most commodities are oversupplied. The overall national economy is much better than that of 1993. It shows the results of macroeconomic regulation and control facilitated by the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and the State Council. It also proves this year's reform measures are feasible and very effective. Zhu Rongji stressed: The major reasons for the currently rising market prices follow: Many departments, localities, and enterprises have been maintaining excessive psychological expectations on growth rates and investment scales, and have misunderstood the meaning of "market economy." They mistakenly thought that under a market economy, the government will totally let go of prices, and enterprises can increase prices at will. Therefore, the main reason for the current unstable market is not an imbalance between supply and demand. As long as we take correct measures, we can curb price increases. Therefore, the party Central Committee and State Council have decided to take the following four measures: First, we will strictly "restrict expansion in two aspects," including excessively increased investments in fixed assets and overly expanded consumption funds. In 1994 we will not, in principle, introduce new construction projects. All projects which are to begin urgently must be under overall state programs. No bank loans shall be given to any project not listed in overall state programs, including projects which have been broken down into smaller ones from previously larger undertakings. Organs at various levels and various institutions and enterprises shall not indiscriminately increase wages, wantonly issue awards and bonuses, or sell public housing units at low prices. We should facilitate tax revenue reforms and social security systems to resolve uneven income discrepancies among various people and trades. Second, governments at various levels should earnestly and properly handle agricultural and "vegetable basket" projects; should stabilize grain-producing acreage, grain output, and grain storage; and should also ensure the supply of non- staple food for residents. We should regard the work progress in these tasks as the main criteria of evaluating the work performance of leaders at various levels. Third, the government should strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control over market prices. Governments at various levels should conduct a general inspection of commodity prices in the near future; should oppose indiscriminate price increases under the pretext of heavier tax burdens; and should oppose excessive profits and price-fixing under monopolistic practices. We should pay attention to checking prices of means of production which are important and transacted under monopolistic systems, including steel, electricity, coal, oil and chemical fertilizer; prices of consumer goods which concern the national economy and the people's livelihood, including grain and edible oil; and prices of public utilities and services. We must specify that even under a market economy, the state cannot abandon its functions in price management, nor can it refrain from subsidizing public welfare undertakings. The government cannot pass the commitment of giving subsidies, which it should rightly shoulder, in the form of a financial burden to the common people. We should make proper arrangements for people's livelihoods, even at the expense of funding a smaller number of construction projects. Fourth, we should expeditiously take a series of economic measures in the near future to curb price increases. To check price increases on certain commodities which are temporarily in short supply in the market and which contract excessive price increases, we should use the state inventory, increase the supply, and publicize price reduction while supporting enterprises to produce such commodities at full capacity. Zhu Rongji stated at the end: So long as the entire party comes to a common understanding, helps one another, realistically undertakes actual tasks, and refrains from rhetoric, we definitely have the confidence to stabilize market prices; to properly perform various tasks in 1994; and under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, to achieve greater accomplishments in reform and development.
