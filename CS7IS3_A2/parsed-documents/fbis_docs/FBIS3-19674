In a memorandum given to its European Union [EU] partners during a meeting of finance ministers, France said the EU should pursue "resolutely offensive" policies in concert with the United States. Financial services were excluded from the Uruguay Round GATT trade accord wrapped up in Geneva last December, mainly because of what the United States judged to be insufficient offers from Japan and other Asian countries. Negotiations will resume in 1995. The U.S. authorities, in the meanwhile, are following a policy of opening up the American market only to financial services from countries offering similar access. The French memorandum said the EU should maintain similar reciprocal pressure in financial services. If the Union failed to do so, it would lose a lever to open up foreign markets and lose ground to U.S. competition, it said. "We should use the threat of reciprocity to incite countries which have commitments to open up their financial services markets to undertake the appropriate reforms and indulge in less protectionism," it said.
