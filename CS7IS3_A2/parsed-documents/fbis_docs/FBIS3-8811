[Tusk] Probably because UD received more votes. To vote for the KLD, one has to have firm ideological and economic views. UD's electorate consists of all kinds of people. [Milewicz] UD got into the Sejm because its image is not so distinct as that of the KLD? [Tusk] Every party in Poland has its own image. We appear as schemers and thieves, Center Accord appears as a collection of iconoclasts and dullards, and the Christian-National Union appears as a party of clericalists. [Milewicz] And UD? Perhaps it appears as a collection of mummies? [Tusk] Indeed. [Milewicz] Perhaps people prefer dull political parties to vociferous ones? [Tusk] Such a view would be an insult to UD. The KLD is more avant-garde, less embedded in Polish life. [Milewicz] Less embedded in the life of this Poland. [Tusk] Yes. The KLD is alien to the life of Poland in 1993 and 1994. Despite everything, UD is more at home. [Milewicz] So the KLD is merging with UD in order to avoid oblivion? [Tusk] That is certainly one of the reasons. I fear being pushed out into the fringe. I would like to see a revitalization of the KLD's principles. [Milewicz] What? You mean you want to experience a parliamentary "afterlife"? [Tusk] The KLD needs to be revitalized because liberal values are not enshrined in our lives. Thanks to the merger, liberal views will have a greater chance of survival. After all, there is no shortage of liberals in UD. The second reason for the merger is to make life easier for our electorate. People do not want to be forever faced with the decision of who to vote for, the KLD or UD. [Milewicz] But there are people who would prefer to have a "pure KLD" and a "pure UD". [Tusk] But there are more and more people who want a clear political situation--in other words, not more than three or four parties competing in the elections. [passage omitted] [Milewicz] If it were the KLD that had won seats in the Sejm instead of UD, would you still be in favor of a merger? [Tusk] I have never thought about that. [Milewicz] Would you not have told UD: Serves you right? [Tusk] I probably would have done so. But that is natural. There have been a lot of bitter moments in our mutual relations. A television election broadcast on behalf of UD told the viewers not to vote for small parties like us. It was not the KLD's idea to merge. The signal came from UD. I wish to dispel the myth that it is only the liberals that stand to gain something from the merger, and that UD will only lose. We should all gain something. I am sure that will be the case.
