Research into the project, which was undertaken by the Hebei Provincial Institute of Water Conservancy and the Yanghe beach development headquarters of Xuanhua County, has utilized the excess water to serve local farmers, according to local officials. The achievement has passed a provincial appraisal and is believed to have reached the international advanced level. The Yanghe River is a major tributary on the upper reaches of the Yongding River. In the rainy season floods used to wash down the river large quantities of silt, destroy houses and leave the farmland along the river banks seriously damaged. In particular, a huge amount of silt used to be washed into the Guanting Reservoir, which supplies water to Beijing. In 1989 researchers began to make observations and collect data from experimental zones, aiming at making scientific use of the floodwaters. After some four years of research and experiment they helped local farmers to build 3,000 m [meters] of dikes and 46,100 m of canals, and used the floodwaters to irrigate 8,226 ha and grow 160,000 trees. So far, the efforts have brought about increases in the outputs of maize and rice in the locality, and stopped 1.62 million tons of silt from entering the Guanting Reservoir.
