During his visit [to Jordan] where he met with the prime minister, Nayif Hawatimah expressed displeasure with the meticulous search of his car. Prime Minister al-Majali explained to Nayif Hawatimah that he was not personally targeted by this search but that the Jordanian security authorities at the border posts have started to carefully search all incoming vehicles to Jordan, whether private or official. Al-Majali explained to Hawatimah that Jordan was forced to do this out of its fear that these vehicles might be used to transport weapons into Jordan as had taken place with the car of George Habash [the secretary general of the Popular Front the Liberation of Palestine, PFLP]. The Jordanian version says that during Habash's recent visit to Jordan, his car was searched and various types of weapons and silencers were found in it. On the other hand, the security forces have stepped up their surveillance of all the Jordanian border posts to foil any arms smuggling operation, particularly after the two cinema explosions.
