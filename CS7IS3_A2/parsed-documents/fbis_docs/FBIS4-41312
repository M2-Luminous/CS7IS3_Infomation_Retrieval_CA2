The commission which is co-chaired by Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin drafted several agreements between the two countries over the two days of its work. Their signing ceremony was held on Thursday at the conference hall of the administration complex adjoining the White House. Chernomyrdin and Gore put their signatures under the Russian- American agreement in the sphere of ecology, the statement on the principles of information exchange, the agreement on closing down plutonium-producing reactors as well as the joint statement on cooperation in building an orbital station. The sides signed another 22 documents opening prospects for cooperation between the two countries in various spheres, including a 400-million-dollar contract on financing the shuttle-Mir programme. Praising the results of the session, the U.S. Vice-President stressed that the two countries have established close and fruitful relations at many levels. The United States as a Russian partner and friend operates jointly with the Russian Federation for the sake of continuing progress, he added. Gore called the agreement on the participation of U.S. oil companies Marathon oil and Mcdermott in developing the oil and gas deposits on Sakhalin shelf as the largest American investment in Russia. The project is worth ten billion dollars. This is a very positive signal to American investors that they can successfuly do business in Russia, he continued. The Vice-President called as very important the agreement on closing down the plutonium-producing reactors in Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk. This document is graphic evidence of mutual determination to act jointly to strengthen the regime of nuclear non-proliferation, he stressed. He announced that the next, fourth session of the Russian- American commission on economic and technological cooperation will be held in Moscow next winter. For his part, Chernomyrdin noted that Russia and the U.S. now face the task of filling up the reached agreements with concrete content. "Our meetings were held in an atmosphere of mutual understanding," he continued. "indeed, there were difficulties, but we have overcome them. The achieved agreements are landmarks in relations between our states. However, we should now start work so that these agreements should yield practical results." Appraising the results of a meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton which was held at the White House earlier in the day, Chernomyrdin said that it was "very useful and fruitful". "We discussed the results of the Russian-American commission on economic and technological cooperation," he noted. "We also discussed the G7 summit in Naples next July to be attended by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Some issues examined at the present session of the Russian-American commission will possibly be discussed at the Naples session." The premier expressed confidence that President Clinton and he "established mutual understanding on issues under discussion". "I do not think that we have such problems which could not be resolved," Chernomyrdin stressed. Dealing with cooperation between the two countries in space explorations, he noted that it is being carried "on an equal footing". "We have a potential in some areas and are ready to share it with other countries. "The United States also can share their possibilities, and the two countries will only benefit by this." Turning to prospects for cooperation between the two countries in science, the premier said that "the sphere of operations of the Russian-American commission will be boosted", and questions of public health will be put on the agenda of the next session to be held in Moscow. "If we can pool our resources in this sphere, the two nations will undoubtedly benefit by this," he added. Participants in the news conference which was held on the results of the Russian-American commission, raised the question on the nuclear programme of North Korea and the role played by Russia in a search for settling this problem. The U.S. Administration praises Russia's assistance and cooperation in attempts to settle the question of North Korea's nuclear programme, Gore noted. According to the Vice-President, contacts between Russian and U.S. foreign ministries on North Korea's nuclear programme as well as discussions held at other levels were very useful. "The freezing" of North Korea's nuclear programme and agreement to hold a meeting between the leaders of the North and South Koreas are a very positive development of events, the Vice-President noted. He expressed hope for a settlement of this problem. "Measures taken in this respect are an achievement as it is," the Russian premier said in turn. "It should be noted that all this was achieved with the participation of Russia." Chernomyrdin pointed to the need for broad international cooperation in settling this problem. Speaking of prospects for a Bosnian settlement, Chernomyrdin expressed opinion that Russia, the U.S. and other countries should find a solution to this problem. "We should extinguish the flames which can develop into a fire at any time." The Russian premier expressed confidence that Russia and the U.S. "are marching in the right direction", looking for possibilities of a settlement in Bosnia and added that a solution of this problem is not far away.
