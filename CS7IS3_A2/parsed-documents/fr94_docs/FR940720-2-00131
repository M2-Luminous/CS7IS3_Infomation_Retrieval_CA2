FR940720-2-00131 FR940720-2-00073 C. The Boston Stock Exchange's Request for Exemption The Plan does not provide for market identifiers for Limited Participant transaction reports or Limited Participant consolidated best bid and offer quotations. Subsection (b)(2)(viii) of Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 under the Act, however, requires any transaction reporting plan submitted to the Commission to provide market identifiers for transaction reports or last sale data made available to vendors. The BSE, as the only Limited Participant under the Plan, requested in 1990 that the Commission exempt it from this requirement. Prior to 1990, the BSE stated that it had signed the Plan only because it seeks to continue providing trading facilities for dually listed ( i.e. , listed on the BSE and traded in Nasdaq) stocks that it listed prior to the date the Plan was filed with the Commission and does not wish to apply for OTC/UTP. 17 To accommodate the BSE, the Plan Participants created the category of ``Limited Participants,'' which do not pay any of the development costs of modifying NASDAQ to accommodate OTC/UTP and have limited voting rights under the Plan. Limited Participants are not permitted to expand the number of dually listed issues or to apply for OTC/UTP. The Plan provides that the BSE's quotations and trade reports will not have a BSE market identifier, but will instead be identified by Nasdaq's market symbol. 17 Id . The Participants have requested that the Commission extend, for an additional year, this exemptive relief to the BSE from Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1(b)(2)(viii) under the Act. The Commission is unaware of any negative impact that this exemption has had on the marketplace, and believes that the extension of exemptive relief through July 12, 1995, is appropriate under these limited circumstances. D. Written Understandings of Agreements Relating to Interpretation of, or Participation in, the Plan The pilot program, as originally approved and memorialized in an Undertaking dated April 1, 1989, provides that, for the one-year period following the date on which the UTP Processor commences operations, each initial entry or update of quotation information in Eligible Securities shall be effected by an individual at a computer terminal and shall not be programmed or automated. 18 No Participant has submitted a request to the Commission that this Undertaking be extended. This agreement, therefore, expired July 12, 1994. 18 In the 1990 Plan Approval Order, the Commission stated that after the pilot program had been operating for one year, the Commission would review the issues presented by this Undertaking. A copy of the Undertaking is attached to the original filing, S7&hyph;24&hyph;89, that was approved by the Commission in the 1990 Plan Approval Order. Among other matters, this Undertaking operated to forbid exchange Participants from effecting automated quote updates or tracking of inside quotations ( e.g. by the use of ``autoquote'' systems) in the Nasdaq system. The Participants, however, have not requested that the Undertaking be extended and have not supplied the Commission with any data or commentary concerning this issue with respect to the Plan. Thus, the Commission has no new information to review in this area, and finds no cause to extend an undertaking for which no request to extend has been submitted to the Commission. E. Intermarket Trading Linkage and Trade-Through Rule The Commission has stated in several instances that it believes the Participants should work toward developing an intermarket trading linkage and an accompanying trade-through rule with respect to OTC/UTP. 19 The Commission is unaware of any recent efforts made by the Participants in this regard. 19 The Commission's most recent statement in this regard was made in 1993: The Commission stated in our 1992 Phlx Pilot Order that the Participants should develop an intermarket trading linkage and an accompanying trade-through rule. The Commission believes that the Participants should continue working toward these goals. 1993 Phlx Pilot Extension Order, at n.14, supra note 11. While the Commission understands that the Participant meetings concerning the Plan primarily have dealt with financial matters, the Commission believes that efficient executions of securities transactions and customer protection concerns must be considered with respect to the operation of the Plan. Accordingly, the Commission requests each Participant to submit to the Commission, no later than September 30, 1994, a statement concerning the effects that an intermarket trading linkage and/or a trade-through rule would have on market efficiency and/or customer protection. 20 The Commission will be particularly interested in comments concerning the Participants' experience under the pilot program under the Plan and/or the Chx Interim Plan. The Commission also requests each Participant to include in its submission a statement concerning the appropriate course of action to ensure that the Participants routinely evaluate market quality and customer protection matters as transactions continue to be effected pursuant to the Commission's temporary or permanent approval of the Plan. 20 Specifically, the Commission requests that the Participants evaluate the existing pilot and the probable effects that an intermarket linkage and/or trade-through rule would have on the markets with respect to furthering certain Congressional directives, among others, found in Section 11A of the Act: economically efficient execution of securities transactions; fair competition among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets; and, the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities. F. Commission's Previous Directive for Quantitative Assessment of Plan's Effects In the 1990 Plan Approval Order, the Commission stated: Plan Participants are hereby directed, in connection with any request for extension of the pilot or for permanent approval of the Plan, to provide the Commission with a quantitative assessment of the effects, if any, of unlisted trading privileges and the Plan on the width of quotation spreads and on price continuity in trading in OTC/UTP securities. The Commission has not received any Participant's assessment of these effects. While the Commission believes that a 6-month extension of the pilot program is warranted and appropriate under the Act, the Commission believes that receipt of the above referenced quantitative assessments is essential to the Commission's evaluation of the pilot program. Thus, the Commission directs the Participants to submit to the Commission, on or before September 30, 1994, the quantitative assessments described above. The Commission expects these assessments to be based on statistical studies. 21 21 In the 1990 Plan Approval Order, the Commission also stated that, at the end of the one year pilot period, the Commission would review the bases on which firms decide to which markets to send customer orders for execution. The Commission directs each Participant to submit to the Commission, on or before September 30, 1994, statements describing the bases on which firms decide to which markets to send customer orders for execution.
