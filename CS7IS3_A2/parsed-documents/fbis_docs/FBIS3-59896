At his latest press conference President Bill Clinton did not specify whether the consultations had gotten far. Russian state institutions are also refraining from comment. The Russian and U.S. presidents are examining at least two ways of implementing the initiative suggested in April by Boris Yeltsin to President Clinton in Vancouver. According to one option it is planned to retarget ballistic missiles, designed by Russia and the United States for mutual destruction, on godforsaken corners of the world ocean. According to unconfirmed reports 24 desert regions have already been identified as suitable for the role of false targets. Another option envisages not targeting the missiles anywhere. "The idea of retargeting has long been discussed in academic circles," a staffer at a Russian department said. "It is useful and it is good that we are moving from theory to practice. Russia and the United States are no longer adversaries yet to this day they have been keeping each other in their sights." What will the implementation of the Russian idea provide? If there is an unsanctioned launch there will not be mass human casualties or a retaliatory nuclear missile strike. Because of its military-technical flaws the agreement could become a touchstone of the sincerity of the friendship between Moscow and Washington and a confidence-building measure. After all, apart from secret agents there are no other means which would allow us to assure ourselves of the honesty of our partner and his fulfillment of his commitments. In addition it takes only about 15 minutes to retarget individually targeted missiles and warheads. You only have to put the necessary programs into the computers. Nonetheless it is better to have "disoriented" missiles than missiles which "know" precisely the point which has been targeted in the United States or Russia. In given circumstances the time necessary for reprogramming could save mankind.
