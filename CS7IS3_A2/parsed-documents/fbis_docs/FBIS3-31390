The agreements contain the legal regulation of responsibility for nuclear damage in countries which already have the relevant legislation. Their aim is the creation of an international system of responsibility and harmonization of nuclear legislation, and a system offering the public protection and ensuring fast and effective compensation to those damaged. Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy (ODA) said that acceding to the agreement would, among other things, eliminate the possibility of international conflicts. The Vienna Agreement, concluded on May 21, 1963 is open to all UN states, and has 19 members. The Paris Agreement, valid as of April 1, 1968, associates 16 states. The two agreements have fundamentally the same principles, but differ in their wording in some places. They also differ as to the amount payable for damages.
