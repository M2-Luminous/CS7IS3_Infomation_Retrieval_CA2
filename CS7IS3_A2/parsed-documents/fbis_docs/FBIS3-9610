The command asserts that the Srpska republic army did not respond when Muslim forces this morning shelled Srbobran from positions in the direction of Bugojno, which is 12 km away. In reaction to UNPROFOR's report on the wounding of two British soldiers in Bugojno, Serb military sources in Srbobran claim that this was a result of the inter-Muslim fighting that has been going on in Bugojno over the past few days.
