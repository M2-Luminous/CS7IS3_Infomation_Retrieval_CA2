Although the dollar dropped to the Y100 level last August, significance of breaking the psychological barrier is not small. The yen-dollar exchange rate, which started at Y360 to the dollar when Japan was in ruins after World War II, finally dropped to lower than the Y100 level after going through the Nixon shock, shift to a floating exchange rate system, Plaza agreement, and other changes. Since yen's exchange rate reflects Japan's competitive power, some people may take pride in the rapid rise in yen's value. However, we are certain that many businessmen have no reason to take pride. Such a high exchange rate, if it takes root, will shrink export companies' revenues and will have an effect of retarding the economic recovery, which is about to bottom out at long last. A rapid rise in yen's value lowers stock prices and hampers financial organizations' efforts to deal with bad debts. The issue of bad debts may come up to the surface again and undermine the financial system. We cannot rule out the possibility of industrial stagnation either. Following the rise in yen's value last year, quantity of imported goods has increased rapidly. On the other hand, companies, which produced goods for export, are quickly moving abroad. While major domestic auto makers are being forced to shut down some of their plants, foreign auto sale in Japan is rapidly expanding. The market share of foreign cars reached 8.6 percent in May. It is possible that some 30 percent of new cars sold in Japan may be foreign cars and the Japanese auto market may become like that of the United States in the near future. It is quite natural that amount of import increases and the industrial relocation overseas progresses as the economy grows. The only thing we can do to make up for such a deindustrialization is to create new jobs. In the case of Japan, however, we should not forget the fact that our economic structure is distorted. Due to government regulations and traditional business practices, prices of imported goods do not go down enough. Export industries do not hesitate to export goods without making profit just to keep their employees. Because of these, the yen's exchange rate tends to rise higher than its actual value and thereby forces industries, which can remain in Japan, to move abroad. Despite the Bank of Japan's intervention in Tokyo market on 22 June, the yen's exchange rate against the dollar reached the highest in the postwar era. The government is trying to lower the yen's value through coordinated intervention with other industrial nations in foreign exchange markets. However, it is said that the United States is skeptical about the effect of such cooperation. Market intervention may temporarily stop the trend of money market but it cannot change it. The government should exert more efforts to correct causes of the excessively high value of the yen. It publicly promised that it would map out economic measures, centered around the idea of increasing public investments and easing regulations, by the end of this month. It has no choice but to firmly promote the process of deregulation to correct the distortion of the current economy. The dollar dipped below Y100 following the fall of its value against European currencies. The weak dollar against major currencies is the cause of strong yen. Funds, which change hands from one country to another by seeking profit, grew big. It is said that money, which amounts to $1 trillion, was invested in British pound and Italian lira at the time of the 1992 European currency crisis. Due to concerns about the future of U.S. economy, this money has begun to change hands from dollars to other currencies. For fear of possible inflation in the United States and huge amount of its deficit in the current account balance, the money is now being invested in the yen and European currencies. The dollar's further decline will not be beneficial to the United States either. However, further interest rate hike may create a crash like the Black Monday. The United States is also in a difficult situation. There is no remedy for the U.S. economy. It seems that the only things the United States can do to emerge out of the difficult situation is to steadily reduce its financial deficit and to increase its savings rate.
