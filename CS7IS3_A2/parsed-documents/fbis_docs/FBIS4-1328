Inkatha expects at most to win 23 percent of the votes nationally, with its list of provincial candidates almost equalling that of the combined regional and national component for the national assembly. It is fielding 76 candidates to contest the 400 seats. Most opinion polls have given Inkatha about 13 percent of the votes nationally, although the latest Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) report gave it only about 7 percent, which would result in the top 20 making it into Parliament on the national list. President Mangosuthu Buthelezi heads the national list followed by former SACP [South African Communist Party] member Joe Matthews and hardliner Walter Felgate. Positions five, six and eight are held by former NP [National Party] members Koos van der Merwe, Jurie Mentz and Hennie Bekker. Press officer Sue Vos will also make it into Parliament at number seven. At number nine is information director Ziba Jiyane with Velaphi Ndlovu at 11 and former Independent Broadcasting Authority member Harriet Ngubane at number 12. Chief negotiator Ben Ngubane heads a strong list of candidates on the regional list, the safest route to election. HSRC director Lawrie Schlemmer estimates that Inkatha could manage 25 percent support in KwaZulu/Natal, giving about 15 candidates from that region a good chance. Among these are Dennis Madide, Faith Gasa Forouk Cassim, Kisten Rajoo, Peter Smith of the information department, Natal Red Cross director Inka Mars, Ben Skosana and Philip Powell. For its KwaZulu/Natal Provincial legislature, Inkatha has its chairman Frank Mdlalose as premier candidate followed by Jeffrey Mtetwa and two royal family members Gideon and Vincent Zulu. Also high on the list are former DP [Democratic Party] MPs Mike Tarr and Peter Miller, with Arthur Konigkramer in ninth and Sue Felgate at 15. Maritzburg mayor Patrick Cornell occupies the number 20 slot and Lindelane warlord Thomas Shabalala is at number 26. In its second strongest region, the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], Inkatha has chosen Transvaal leader Themba Khoza to head the list for the national assembly. He is likely to get into Parliament. At number nine is Charles Loliwe, who called on Inkatha members to march on the ANC offices at Shell House recently. Inkatha's choice for PWV premier is Musa Myeni with Hennie Bekker's wife, Gerda, occupying fourth position before Ruth Felgate. Mungo Soggot reports that Inkatha's 11th hour decision to take part in the poll has triggered the frantic printing of 88-million labels. Jackstadt MD [managing director] Ken Steyn said his company, which printed the stickers, had delivered 40 [metric] tons of label stock to printing company Self-Adhering Products. It, in turn, had printed 22-million labels a day since last Wednesday.
