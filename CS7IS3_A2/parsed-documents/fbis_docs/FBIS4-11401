Four or five people were shot during this raid in the slum area of Raboteau. According to a police source, the operation was held to find some unidentified armed people. A witness reports the facts to Clarence Renois: [Begin recording] [Unidentified witness ] "The situation is not at all good for the people in Raboteau. Since last weekend, the people have been dealing with a massacre. For instance, on the night of 17 April to 18 April, the military came into the area because they were looking for a man called Arnault Mtayer, also known as "El Cubano." According to the police, he is armed and leads a small, heavily armed group. They have been searching for these men for a long time in order to arrest them. ``The police want to know from where they get their weapons? Police never got to arrest these men, and innocent people paid for it. Many people were beaten by FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti] members who came with the military. Many people were arrested, and on 19 April, the police released some of them after interrogating them. They did not go to court. The people were asked questions, then released between 19 and 20 April. ``On 22 April, while the population was carrying on its daily activities, police arrived in the area. People who lived near the abattoir [as heard] took to the sea to escape, but even the sea was full of military and heavy weapons." [Renois] "All of that took place in Raboteau?" [Witness] "It took place in Raboteau over the past weekend. Some people died. On Saturday, another body was found, making it four people dead. Other corpses might be soon found because many fishermen, who were just returning from fishing, were reportedly shot down by the military, according to people from the area. ``The people have abandoned Raboteau for some other towns near Gonaives. It is a total massacre that the people in Raboteau are facing, with the police searching for Mtayer, also known as `El Cubano.'" [Renois] "What do the police accuse those wanted people of doing?" [Witness] "The police say those people carry weapons. So the police want to arrest them in order to find out where those weapons come from." [Renois] "What kind of actions did the unidentified armed men take? Are they criminal actions or political acts that they would be involved in?" [Witness] "I believe that if they were criminal actions, people from the area would have stopped them instead of letting the police search for them. I believe if the people in the area did not stop those armed people, it is because they do not have any problem with the people living in this area." [end recording]
