Speaking to reporters shortly after being appointed to the post, Filkus said no miracles could be expected of the new government. "Slovakia must reach a market economy as quickly as possible," he said and added "we must stop indulging in reveries about the existence of some third way (of economic development)". Filkus said it would be necessary to de-politicize the privatization process which, he said, had become a tool for the political concentration of power. The law on large privatization ought therefore to be amended, he said. Referring to the state budget deficit, Filkus said that budget revenues had considerable reserves in the form of unpaid taxes, duties and in the area of financial control. Filkus said he expected soon "to visit all necessary ministers and friends in the Czech government".
