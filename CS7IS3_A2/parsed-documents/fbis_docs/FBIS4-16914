Russian officers of the Oshsk garrison located in the south of Kyrgyzstan said in an open letter addressed to President Akayev that recently, departments of the military prosecutor's office have begun to ouster Russian-speaking commanders from the Army "contrary to the will of Kyrgyz Defence Minister Myrzakan Subanov." "In our opinion, military judicial bodies who have been looking for thieves stealing military and state property among Russian officers believe that if we have not gone home yet we have some sources of income encouraging us to stay. This is nonsense. We remain here because we swore allegiance here," says the letter signed by over 100 Russian officers, which was published by the "KYRGYZSTAN'S WORD" newspaper today. Russian commanders put the blame for the situation in the Army on Chief Military Prosecutor Kubat Kozhonaliyev. Officers demanded that the president and commander in chief of the Kyrgyz Army Askar Akayev give guarantees that Russian officers will be able to perform their duties under normal conditions.
