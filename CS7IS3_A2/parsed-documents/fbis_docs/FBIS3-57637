The chairman of the right-wing extremist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), which surprisingly came out on top in last December's elections, said that a "Berlin-Moscow axis," to be extended to the Indian capital Delhi, should secure stability in Europe and Asia. At a joint press conference with Munich publisher and chairman of the extreme right-wing German People's Union (DVU), Gerhard Frey, Zhirinovskiy said he is in favor of large-scale joint German-Russian projects. This should include a highway from Berlin via Kaliningrad and Moscow to Vladivostok. He also demanded more German language teaching in Russian schools. The LDPR leader spoke out against ethnic German Russians leaving the country. They should be kept in Russia, where there is plenty of space for more settlers from Germany. Together with Frey, Zhirinovskiy laid a wreath at the memorial of the soldiers killed in the war against Napoleon's troops, to commemorate the Russians "who liberated Europe together with the Germans." Again, Zhirinovskiy demanded the resignation of Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Economics Minister Alexandr Shokhin, and the head of the privatization authority, Anatoliy Chubays, the last reformer in the cabinet. According to Zhirinovskiy, all three are politicians who want to keep Russia down. Kozyrev could only save his skin if he took a "clear pro-Serbian position" immediately. Also, the government must demand an end to the international blockade of Serbia, Libya, and Iraq. It should, furthermore, reintegrate the Crimea into the Russian Federation because the people there no longer want to be part of Ukraine. According to the Russian news agencies, the Public Prosecutor in Moscow has instituted proceedings against Zhirinovskiy, accusing him of warmongering. Zhirinovskiy called these reports a "hoax." According to INTERFAX, the proceedings were instituted following inquiries by various public authorities, mass media, and private individuals.
