On his assessment of the current military and political situations, al-Bid said: When unity started facing problems we sought dialogue and the quest for solutions with others in a peaceful and democratic way, and that will remain our position. When war was imposed on us we had to defend ourselves. After the agreement was signed, the other side found itself unable to implement it. It was not convinced of the agreement to begin with, and that is why it did what it did. That did not surprise us because he ('Ali 'Abdallah Salih) does not understand that approach. What surprised us was the position of the other forces around him, including the patriotic forces and influential figures we had a dialogue with for long months. How did they agree to go along with him or remain silent after what has happened? Despite that, we will continue to offer our grounds for dialogue once we finish with this war which was imposed on us and in which our army which was in the north was hit. We are now defending ourselves in our homes after the intensity of the aggression, plunder, looting, and murder reached a climax in Abyan, Shabwah, and every other point they [the northern forces] reached. Militarily, they have not been able to achieve any more than they achieved in the first few days. They are in a to-and-fro situation around Aden at a distance of 70-120 km. When we said to al-Bid that the figure of 30 km from Aden had been mentioned, he replied: If they were 30 km from Aden the city would be under relentless artillery fire. Had the city been within the range of their artillery, life would have come to a standstill in Aden but that has not happened. On the statements made by Yemeni Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani and President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih about penetration of Aden and al-Mukalla soon if the negotiations fail, al-Bid laughed and said: They are welcome to try. On the possibility of penetration and occupation of Aden and al-Mukalla, al-Bid ruled it out, and added: Personally, I have no problem with penetration. How would he maintain his army and occupation if such a penetration did occur? The problem is not breaching a place but keeping it. Would he be able to do that? We are at war and war is advance and retreat and constant motion, but when the logic of occupation prevails then such occupation is rejected. The people would reject and resist it. It would not then be a question of military balance or of a brigade facing another because the people would reject annexation and occupation and everyone would therefore cooperate with the armed forces. You should bear in mind that it would be very difficult for them to penetrate Aden or al-Mukalla, and if they did, the price would be very high. I do not believe that they would be able to pay such a price. We would resist and it would be difficult for them to pay the price. Are Aden and al-Mukalla considered red lines? Al-Bid replied: Yes, they are red lines. On the initiative submitted to the Security Council and the possibility of UN forces moving in to disengage the combatants, al-Bid said: I am in favor of stopping the war by any means even if that means the entry of UN forces. In this war there is no victor and vanquished. The Yemeni people are the only loser. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that over 3,000 fighters have arrived in Aden from the camps around al-Mukalla, coming from the Shabwah area. They are now being reassembled and redeployed in areas from al-Mukalla to Mayfa'ah in the direction of the city of 'Ataq. The next few days are expected to witness a fierce battle for the recapture of the positions lost by the southern forces in Shabwah.
