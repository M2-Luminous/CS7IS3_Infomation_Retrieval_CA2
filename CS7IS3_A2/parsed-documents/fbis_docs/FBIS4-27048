The Chinese premier made the remarks while meeting the press prior to his departure for an official three European nation tour that will cover Austria, Germany and Romania. Asked to comment on the prospects of the development of Sino- French relations, the premier said that he was personally satisfied with the current state of development. Earlier this year, China and France signed a memorandum on the improvement of relations between the two countries. In April, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur paid a visit to China, he recalled. During his visit here, Prime Minister Balladur conveyed from the French president an invitation to Chinese President Jiang Zemin. At present, the two governments are discussing the exchange of visits between the two countries' leaders, Li said. On Sino-British links, Li noted that there are quite big differences in the views of China and Britain on the Hong Kong issue, so much as that they have affected the overall relations between the two countries. "But the responsibility does not lie with China," he stressed. Recalling his recent meeting with a British entrepreneur, Li said China hopes that the economic and trade relations between China and Britain would develop normally, but it is impossible that such relations would not be affected by the political relations between the two countries. "What we should do is to try as far as possible to avoid the negative effect," he said.
