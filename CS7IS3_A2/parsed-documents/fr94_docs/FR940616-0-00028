FR940616-0-00028 FR940616-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Railroad Administration 49 CFR Part 214 FRA Docket No. ROS&hyph;2, Notice No. 4 RIN 2130&hyph;AA91 Bridge Worker Safety Rules AGENCY: Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), DOT. ACTION: Final Rule; correction and petition for reconsideration. SUMMARY: On June 24, 1992, FRA published safety standards for the protection of those who work on railroad bridges (49 CFR Part 214). FRA now corrects certain sections of that regulation, and changes or clarifies certain requirements in response to a petition for reconsideration filed by the Association of American Railroads (AAR). First, three sections have been corrected by adding citations to reflect the most recent American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards for personal protective equipment. Second, the rule now sets forth conditions under which employees specially-designated as bridge inspectors may work without fall protection. Third, the rule no longer requires toeboards on walkways, and in certain instances permits work without fall protection on roadways attached to a railroad bridge. Finally, FRA clarifies that railroads and their contractors must require the use of protective footwear, but need not necessarily furnish it, which reflects current practice in the railroad, construction, and other industries where such equipment is necessary. DATES: Effective Date: The effective date of this regulation is on July 18, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in this regulation is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Any petition for reconsideration should be submitted to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William O'Sullivan, Chief, Office of Safety Track Division, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 (Telephone: 202&hyph;366&hyph;0499), Gordon Davids, Office of Safety Enforcement, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 (Telephone: 202&hyph;366&hyph;0499), or Christine Beyer, Trial Attorney, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 (Telephone: 202&hyph;366&hyph;0621). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 24, 1992, FRA published the Bridge Worker Safety Rules (57 FR 28116) that established requirements for the protection of those railroad and railroad contractor employees who work on railroad bridges. The rule included provisions for personal fall arrest systems, safety nets, personal protective equipment (head, face, eye, and foot equipment), contingencies for working adjacent to water, and standards for walkways, railings, and scaffolds. The regulations went into effect on September 24, 1992. However, in order to provide the industry additional time to obtain complying equipment and adequately train workers, FRA suspended the effective date of the sections requiring fall protection ( i.e., sections 214.103 and 214.105) until November 24, 1992. (57 FR 45326.) On August 10, 1992, the AAR filed a petition seeking reconsideration (petition) of the bridge worker safety rules. In that petition, the AAR sought reconsideration of 49 CFR 214.101(d), 214.103(b), and 214.103(c). After careful consideration and for the reasons set forth below, FRA denied the AAR's request with respect to section 214.101(d), partially granted the request with respect to section 214.103(b), and granted the request with respect to section 214.103(c). (FRA formally responded to the petition by letter to the AAR dated January 11, 1993, a copy of which is in the docket of this matter.) The AAR petition first suggests that section 214.101(d) violates the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988 (RSIA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and therefore should be withdrawn. Section 214.101(d) states that ``[A]ny working conditions involving the protection of railroad employees working on railroad bridges not within the subject matter addressed by this Chapter'' shall be governed by the regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). This section is merely a restatement of the law as it stands with respect to occupational safety and health matters in the railroad environment, and was added to the final rule in order to alleviate the jurisdictional confusion expressed by rail labor and management prior to promulgation of the rule. FRA has explained the complementary jurisdiction it shares with OSHA with respect to health and safety matters in the railroad industry in its Statement of Policy (Policy Statement) (43 FR 10583) published in 1978, more recently in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) (56 FR 3434) in this proceeding, and on numerous other occasions. However, a discussion of the statutory jurisdiction each agency possesses and the exercise of that authority is necessary to explain the basis for FRA's response to this aspect of the AAR's petition.
