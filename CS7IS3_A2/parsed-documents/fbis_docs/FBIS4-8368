How do the Austrian partners perceive our chances? [Weiss] The Slovak Republic naturally wants to become integrated into the EU. I believe that it is necessary to be well prepared for entry practically, legally, and economically. The Slovak Republic, too, could file a formal application for EU membership within a few days. That is not what matters, however. I am in favor of preparing a well-thought-out strategy of preparing Slovakia for this entry, which should be based on the Agreement on Association With the EU. [Vargova] Have you discussed within the framework of the coalition the possibility of the present government filing such an application? [Weiss] No, we have not discussed this issue. [Vargova] At the news conference in Vienna, you said that you would like to become prime minister after the elections. Could you specify your reply? [Weiss] I said that every party naturally wants to win elections and have the prime minister. [Vargova] If the SDL should win the election, has a decision already been made in your party that you would be its candidate for this post? [Weiss] No decision on this issue has yet been made by SDL bodies. In the case of our electoral victory, we would definitely nominate the prime minister.
