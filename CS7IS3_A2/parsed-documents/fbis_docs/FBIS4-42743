Kok himself and D66 leader Van Mierlo did not wish to make any comment on the matter this morning [6 June]. Before the coalition negotiations between the PvdA, the VVD, and the D66 could go further in the First Chamber this morning, Bolkestein said: "I think that the present coalition, if it at least works, will govern during the next four years under the leadership of Mr. Kok. That seems rather obvious." Bolkestein was reacting to the outcome of a survey carried out last weekend by the firm Infomart ISM at the request of the television program "Focal Point" news show which showed that 53 percent of VVD voters would have no problem with a PvdA prime minister. In addition, 80 percent of the VVD voters support a coalition with the PvdA and the D66. Bolkestein concluded this morning by saying that this means that he can go ahead with the negotiations on a coalition with the PvdA and the D66. During a VVD congress last week, the party leader was already receiving the support of the VVD party officials. Bolkestein said: "So I can go ahead, on the condition of course that the right policy comes out of this. In any case, I do not notice any reluctance among my supporters or my party with regard to the negotiations currently under way." It is expected that some links will be forged this week on the social, economic, and financial fronts. If that is indeed the case, then it will not be long until we have a definitive coalition agreement. There should be no talk of ideological differences in any of the points currently being negotiated. The survey among VVD supporters also shows which points in the VVD platform must, according to the VVD voters, remain in the policy of a "purple" government. Combating crime was named by 85 percent as being essential, while 80 percent of the VVD voters felt that asylum policy was essential. Of the surveyed, 48 percent felt that budget cuts of 9 billion guilders were essential and 40 percent felt that a "minimal" social security system was needed. Otherwise, 21 percent of the surveyed VVD supporters said that they supported a PvdA prime minister. Of the opponents, 39 percent would prefer Bolkestein, 21 percent Van Mierlo, and 14 percent would like Wiegel back. H. Vonhoff, the Groningen police chief and prominent VVD supporter, expressed his surprise yesterday in the same broadcast of "Focal Point" news show about the popularity of a "purple" coalition among the VVD voters. He felt that the chances were good that a "purple" coalition would be set up. "If there is a time when such a coalition could exist, then the chances for it over the past 25 years have not been great." According to Vonhoff, the choice of a PvdA prime minister is a sign of "political realism" among VVD supporters. "There is a great deal of confidence in Bolkestein; I am convinced of that. However, nobody is committed to the impossible, and VVD supporters understand that quite well." He feels it is understandable that the VVD supporters want to retain a number of essential points. "If you win such a stunning victory on the back of such a clear platform, then naturally you must not distance yourself from these points."
