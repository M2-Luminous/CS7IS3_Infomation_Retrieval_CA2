The Chairman of the session, Rasul Guliyev, said that Milli Majlis will discuss the final variant of the resolution on 31 March at 1200. However, the deputies were against this resolution. Prime-Minister, Suret Guseynov, was irritated by the position of his opponents and said "I feel sorry because last summer I did not hang you at Baku's central square." Deputy Etibar Mamedov addressed to President Aliyev: "You and your supporters as well as those who headed Azeri government in 1990 bear responsibility for the events of 20 January." Under the resolution, only Moscow, the former leadership of Azerbaijan and the Popular Front are responsible for those bloody events. But President Aliyev's supporters, which actively participated there, are not guilty. "The time will pass and those who will come to power in Baku will annul this resolution since it does not serve Azerbaijan's interests but the interests of the present authorities", said one of the deputies to the speaker of Parliament.
