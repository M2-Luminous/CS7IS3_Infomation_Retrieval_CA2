Braz; place and date not given: ``Sandor Papp Views the State of Our Environmental Protection''] [Text] Braz: Hungary is the waste pipe in the Carpathian basin: Pollution and oil spills from the rivers of neighboring countries are flowing into Hungary, while the wind is carrying in acid rain. We asked Sandor Papp, deputy chairman of Parliament's Environmental Protection Committee, to comment on the consequences of all this on the state of Hungary's environment. Papp: From the state's viewpoint, the most important issue is that more than 90 percent of surface waters and rivers flow into Hungary from neighboring countries. Therefore, we can also say that we are exposed to pollution originating from neighboring countries. This draws attention to a very important fact -- that the Carpathian basin is ecologically a uniform region. Therefore, we can only protect the environment if we develop adequate relations with neighboring countries to prevent damages. Braz: What are these relations like at the moment? Are they insufficient, sufficient, or do they need improvement? Papp: These relations cannot be described in one word. For example, our relations with Austria are good. We have certain problems with Slovakia, Ukraine, and Romania. For example, oil spills often flow into the Koros River from Romania, and we cannot pinpoint the origin of these spills. Another frequent case is when Hungarian experts try, and fail, to contact Romanian experts and, in such cases, irrespective of the size of the pollution, the issue automatically turns into a political issue because it is impossible to treat the subject differently. Braz: How does the environmental state of individual countries affect Hungary's current economic and market restructuring? How does the appearance of foreign capital affect environmental protection? Papp: An environmental debt and damage has accumulated in Hungary in the past two or three decades, and the size of this debt is approximately equivalent to Hungary's foreign debt -- namely $20-22 billion. This amount derives from the following calculation: Economic activity causes an environmental burden equivalent to 4-6 percent of the gross national product [GNP] annually, and we use 1 percent of the GNP for cleaning up the damage. It is obvious that one cannot eliminate this environmental damage overnight, even with the best law. We need a proper environmental law, but this is not a sufficient condition for mending our environment. This issue obviously affects the flow of foreign capital. However, foreign investors are primarily disturbed by the uncertain, unregulated, and unpredictable economic situation rather than by the well-defined tasks and environmental protection regulations. We know that the auditing of environmental tasks is also carried out in the process of privatization. Thus, it is possible to deduct the sums allocated to the elimination of environmental damages from the purchasing prices. One of the most negative examples is the Lehel Refrigeration company of Jaszbereny where the new owners discovered environmental damages on the premises after the purchase, and the elimination of these damages would have cost the equivalent of the factory's entire purchasing price. I would like to stress that foreign enterprises are most worried about the unregulated and unforeseeable economic situation rather than about the state of the environment.
