When he returned to Guatemala, De Leon told the press that the six countries agreed that in the future there will be no bilateral negotiations, except in very special cases, because from now on everything will be done as a single bloc. In discussing specific achievements, he mentioned the capitalization of the Central American Bank of Economic Integration (BCIE) with the support of Argentina (which will contribute $70 million), while Colombia and Venezuela are awaiting final approval of contributions of $70 million and $122 million, respectively. The Central American presidents also met with the leaders of Chile, Spain, and Mexico, but they had to cancel their meeting with Brazilian counterpart Itamar Franco, who had to leave early. Mexico is already an extra-regional partner which has contributed $122 million to the region. De Leon said the Central American bloc was looking for $700 million to strengthen "our financial arm" and to carry out the region's Alliance for Sustainable Development project.
