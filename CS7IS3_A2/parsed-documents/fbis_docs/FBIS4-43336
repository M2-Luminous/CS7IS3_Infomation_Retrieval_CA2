In Berlin on Tuesday [14 June], Kohl told the 15th Regular Federal Congress of the German Trade Union Federation (DGB) that this is a contribution to the reduction of unemployment. The chancellor stressed that changing one's way of thinking continues to be the dictate of reason. The greatest challenge is securing existing jobs and creating new ones. Kohl paid tribute to late DGB Chairman Heinz-Werner Meyer, calling him a "great patriot." At the same time, he offered the new DGB chairman "talks in the near future." The DGB congress will elect a new chairman on Tuesday afternoon. The only candidate is Metal Union Executive Committee member Dieter Schulte. The 600 DGB delegates received Kohl with some hooting and booing, but also with applause. Labor Minister Norbert Bluem, who accompanied Kohl, was clearly hooted and booed at. The chancellor expressed his conviction "that we will solve the social and economic problems in the new laender." He admitted that the adjustment of living conditions will take some years longer than he had expected. "I demand a clear priority regulation for investments in the new laender," even if there are problems in the west, the Christian Democratic Union chairman said. Despite the incipient upswing, Kohl thinks Germany's problems as a business location have not been solved. The efforts to secure one's economic power must not slacken off, he said.
