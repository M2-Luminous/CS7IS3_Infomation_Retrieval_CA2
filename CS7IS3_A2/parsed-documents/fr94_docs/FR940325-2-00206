New England Electric System, et al. (70&hyph;8303) New England Electric System (``NEES''), a registered holding company, and its nonutility subsidiary company, New England Electric Resources, Inc. (``NEERI''), both located at 25 Research Drive, Westborough, Massachusetts 01582, have filed an application-declaration under sections 9(a), 10 and 12(b) of the Act and Rule 45 thereunder. NEES states that, in early 1993, it was approached by Quality Power Systems, Inc. (``QPS'') to contribute funds for the development of certain patented technology for a low harmonic distortion uninterruptible power system (UPS). QPS intends to develop, manufacture and market UPS and is committed to locating its manufacturing facility for UPS in either Massachusetts or New Hampshire within the retail electric service territory of NEES's retail electric company subsidiaries. In mid 1993, NEES made a research and development grant of $250,000 to QPS to assist in the development of UPS. In return for this grant and to encourage the continued support, QPS and New England Power Service Company (``NEPSCO), a service company subsidiary of NEES, entered into an agreement, under which QPS gave NEPSCO the right to receive at no cost $250,000 of QPS's convertible debentures (``Debentures''). NEPSCO has assigned this right to NEERI effective January 1, 1994. The applicants state that, upon Commission authorization to receive the debentures, all rights to receive a product grant of two UPS per year for the first four years of commercial production would terminate. The Debentures would pay quarterly interest after June 1, 1994, at the Bank of Boston base rate plus 2% and would have a maturity of ten years from date of issuance. The Debentures would not have sinking fund provisions nor prepayment provisions nor general voting rights. NEERI would be allowed to have one member on the Board of Directors of QPS. The Board would have six or seven members. NEERI requests authority to exercise its right to the Debentures on or before July 1, 1994, and if it so elects, to convert the Debentures on or before December 31, 1995 to 9.9% of the common stock of QPS (990 shares of a total of 10,000 shares, no par value). In addition, NEERI requests the authority to invest up to an additional $100,000 in QPS on or before December 31, 1995, in the form of subordinated loans having an interest rate no lower than the Bank of Boston base rate plus 2% and a maturity not in excess of five years. NEERI will not be directly involved in the manufacture, marketing or selling of the UPS. However, it may offer marketing advise and consulting services to QPS and permit its name to be used as part of marketing efforts. The $250,000 grant made to QPS is currently carried on NEES's books as an investment. NEES proposes to transfer this amount to NEERI's books and NEERI would treat it as an investment in QPS. NEES further proposes that such capital contribution be authorized in addition to the $1 million previously authorized by Commission order dated September 4, 1992 (HCAR No. 25621). If NEERI invests up to an additional $100,000 in QPS, NEERI may use funds from NEES provided under its existing $1 million authority. Metropolitan Edison Company (70&hyph;8319) Metropolitan Edison Company (``Met-Ed''), 2800 Pottsville Pike, Reading, Pennsylvania 19440, an electric public-utility subsidiary company of General Public Utilities Corporation, a registered holding company, has filed a declaration under sections 9(a), 10 and 12(c) of the Act and Rule 42 thereunder. Met-Ed intends to issue and sell up to $100 million aggregate stated value of one or more new series of its cumulative preferred stock, each issue having a stated value not to exceed $100 per share (``Preferred'') under Rule 52 of the Act. Met-Ed requests authorization to acquire or redeem through the operation of such sinking fund or optional redemption provision up to the entire amount of the Preferred to be issued and sold. Met-Ed would acquire shares of the Preferred through sinking fund and redemption provisions. Specifically, shares of the Preferred would be redeemable, under certain conditions, at Met-Ed's option in connection with any merger or consolidation to which Met-Ed may be a party. Any such redemption would be at a price equal to the stated value of those shares of the Preferred being redeemed, together with accrued dividends to the date of redemption, plus a premium of up to 100% of the dividend rate.
