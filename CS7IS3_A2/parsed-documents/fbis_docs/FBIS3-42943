It was precisely at these rallies in 1988 that the political biography of current President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrosyan began. He made his way from learned secretary of the Institute of Ancient Manuscripts to the first president of an independent Armenia not only through the crowds of democrats but also through the corridors of Butyrki Prison. Together with like-minded people, Ter-Petrosyan began to knock the already loose bricks out of the foundation of the Soviet party and state system, which was still quite strong at the time. Whether he is good or bad at present as the head of state is another question. However, Levon Ter-Petrosyan has passed the test of power. Recently, he told journalists: "If my personality becomes an obstacle to the democratic development of the republic, you do not have to worry: The people will find an opportunity to get rid of me." To be sure, Ter-Petrosyan now appeals to the people on extremely rare occasions, nor does he like contacts with the press. The authority of the president has been shaken considerably over the last two years, and few people at present call him "ours." A rampage of crime and the lack of legal and social protection for a majority of citizens are the reasons. Perhaps nothing remains of the romantic revolutionary spirit that animated the people of Armenia as recently as a couple of years ago. Apparently, we may talk about the phenomenon of Levon Ter-Petrosyan only in one area: At present he is perhaps the only head of a state-former republic of the disintegrated Soviet Union who has not shared the fate of similar politicians from other former republics: Landsbergis, Elchibey, Gamsakhurdia. He has managed not to lose to any of his opponents. Many people are ready to give their votes to Levon even now, no matter how strong the nostalgic mood is in Armenian society and no matter how much people want order, heat, and bread. This is happening despite the direct association between the president and the activities of the ruling AOD [Armenian National Movement]. Judging from public opinion polls, confidence in the AOD is close to the zero mark. The president is "hanging on" due to his authority, and the AOD--due to the president. The political fiasco of the AOD was built in long before it came to power. It has its origins in the active struggle of many AOD figures for ecology, the wisdom of which was actually sacrificed to political ambitions. Rallies, hunger strikes, and strikes brought about the closure of the largest chemical and metallurgical production facilities. The campaign for mothballing the Armenian "nuke" became the first baptism by fire for many of the current political leaders. Thus the breakdown of the economy of the republic was started; in the absence of the energy sector and industry, the independence of the republic became a mere formality. The burden of these problems subsequently devolved on the president and his team, and they began increasingly often to act against their better judgment. One of the AOD leaders stated: "We proceeded toward power and at times did not reckon with the price at which it was secured." Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who assumed the reins of government in the republic in 1990 first as chairman of the Supreme Council, and subsequently as president, faced two tasks: reinforcing state independence and resolving the Karabakh issue. His refusal to hold the all-Union referendum in Armenia and reluctance to maintain contacts with a communist Moscow gave certain forces the pretext to accuse Levon Ter-Petrosyan of political immaturity, which allegedly became the reason for military pressure on Karabakh. The opposition and the independent press, which criticize the policy of Ter-Petrosyan without restraint, frequently pay attention to the cadre issue. The selection and assignment of cadres became the "Achilles' heel" of the Armenian president. On one occasion he himself admitted that he had relied on his advisers too much and had made erroneous choices. This was quite natural: On coming to power, AOD figures were in a hurry to pay up on the I.O.U.'s produced by yesterday's brethren in struggle, and it nearly came to the replacement of the entire director corps of the country. To this day it is easy to find nonprofessionals, ambitious amateurs, and at times simply ignoramuses prepared to serve the AOD and the president faithfully holding executive positions in state organs. The nomenklatura is mostly selected on the principle of personal devotion. Only on one occasion did the president abandon this approach by appointing his political adversary Vazgen Manukyan as minister of defense. Manukyan, the "godfather" of the AOD, an ex-prime minister, and an energetic person, succeeded in creating a disciplined and well-armed national army. However, ultimately the president showed his character and relieved the minister from his position because Manukyan's authority had grown to a level that was dangerous to Ter-Petrosyan. When it comes to the activities of the Armenian opposition, observers evaluate it variously. Some call it weak and helpless; others voice the opinion that the opposition does not even strive for power and therefore does not show itself fully. Undoubtedly, the conditions in which Armenia lives, labors, and fights for Karabakh are absolutely unfavorable for taking power. No matter how calamitous the situation of the republic, which is actually in the clutches of a blockade and deprived of light and gas, might be, external factors--the military situation in Karabakh and the political situation in Russia--influence the fate of its leadership tremendously. The opposition accuses the president of an attempt to usurp power by foisting on the people his draft of the Constitution. The new Main Law gives the president extensive rights: He will dissolve the parliament, appoint the prime minister, judges, and so on. Of course, such a Constitution cannot suit the opposition. It is preparing to do battle, which will begin as soon as the president sets the date of a referendum. However, the president is in no hurry. Peculiarities of political life in Armenia shine through in a complete absence of pro-government forces. All parties, of which there are about 30, prefer to remain in opposition. The Armenian Revolutionary Federation Dashnaktsutyun and the Democratic-Liberal Party Ramkavar-Azatakan are the most powerful of them. From the time of the first Armenian republic of 1918-1920 until recently, these parties existed in emigration but continued to operate. On returning to the motherland, the Ramkavar-Azatakan Party first supported the president and then went into "soft opposition." The Dashnak Party, whose orientation is socialist, became the main opposing force. The causes of enmity between the president and the Dashnaktsutyun are found in differing approaches to the historic fate of the people rather than in a struggle for power. The AOD concept is based on gradually breaking down the geopolitical traditionalism of Armenians, which is associated with the problem of Armenian lands taken away by fire and sword, through mass genocide. In the opinion of AOD leaders, including the conviction of Levon Ter-Petrosyan, Armenia must live in the present and not use the tragic pages of its history as a political weapon. The foreign policy concept of the AOD does not recognize geopolitics based on specific orientations; the AOD maintains: We have neither eternal enemies (Turkey) nor eternal friends (Russia). The Dashnaktsutyun, which comes out against breaking down the Armenian national mentality, espouses the exact opposite point of view. At present, domestic political stability is preserved in Armenia due to the powerful Karabakh factor. This issue is perhaps the only area of politics with regard to which a consensus continues to exist between the authorities and the opposition. The efforts of Levon Ter-Petrosyan to solve the problem by political means enjoy complete support in the republic. Instead, the opposition has an opportunity to make its presence known on another issue: It demands that the authorities ensure elementary social guarantees for the people. After all, Armenia is going through a second terrifying winter--there is no electricity, no heat; the average salary may buy 1.5 liters of kerosene or a kilogram of meat. At a recent extraordinary session of the parliament, the president proposed from the rostrum that the people eat only bread. A wave of outrage swept the republic; the opposition threatened a revolt. On the day of the parliamentary battle, Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who clearly was out of sorts, nonetheless agreed to answer several of my questions, refusing however to touch on the topics of big-time politics and relations between Armenia and Russia. [Mkrtchyan] Mr. President, what is your assessment of the situation that exists in the republic? [Ter-Petrosyan] It is very complicated, contradictory, and uncertain. I am not in a position to characterize it unambiguously, although it is clear that it has emerged as a consequence of a multitude of piled-up causes which are characteristic of the period of transition. All of us--myself, the leader of the state, state officials, and businessmen--are to some degree like schoolchildren in the process of asserting independent statehood: We are learning to live under new conditions. [Mkrtchyan] What are the reasons for this unprecedented socioeconomic crisis? [Ter-Petrosyan] On one hand, the reasons are of a purely objective nature. As far as subjective aspects are concerned, I can note the main point: The legal and legislative foundation is imperfect here. We have not been able to develop clear-cut mechanisms for adopting laws; current legislation fails to keep up with life and causes chaos and disorder. I agree that at many levels professionalism is lacking in the accomplishment of particular tasks. However, we are entitled to a mistake en route on an unknown path. My personal decisions may also be erroneous. [Mkrtchyan] What has been your main mistake? [Ter-Petrosyan] I admit that I do not always feel the timeliness of a particular decision I make. This is particularly the case with the issue of reforms in the economic and social spheres. [Mkrtchyan] Mr. President, what is your attitude toward the concept of creating a coalition government? [Ter-Petrosyan] If life commands, there will be a coalition government; there will also be new elections, perhaps early elections. However, for now the political situation in the republic is developing in such a way that it is absolutely not necessary to go for this. [Mkrtchyan] Will you go for improving your relations with the opposition? What complaints do you have about the opposition? [Ter-Petrosyan] I do not have complaints about it. The opposition does what it considers correct, and decides itself what it is to do. It is not up to me to instruct it.
