While it recognizes the primary political character of the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM] issue and the Greek measures of 16 February, in principle, it chooses the legal route to deal with the problem. Within this framework, we should note: First, the EU Commission is holding back until 13 April. Second, the EU Commission is officially calling on Skopje to amend its Constitution and flag. The Greek Government expresses its regret, because this contradictory position by the EU Commission does not take into account the recent report from the UN secretary general to the Security Council or the mediation of Cyrus Vance. The relevant political initiatives by the European Union, which the Commission sees moving in parallel with Vance's work, and the mission of Matthew Nimetz [U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy on FYROM] are being jeopardized. And there is the additional danger that the EU Commission's decision today will encourage the intransigence of the Skopjean Government, which, due to its stance, should be on the receiving end of the international community's pressure. The possibility of the EU Commission appealing to the European Court is of secondary importance. In the final analysis, such a development will provide the opportunity for Greece's rich and strong legal arguments to unfold, arguments that complement the political base of the Greek positions. The government spokesman's statement concludes: The Greek Government hopes that by 13 April and given that Vance has already issued his invitation for 11 April, the EU Commission can reach a more specific position that will aim to safeguard peace and stability in the region and reinforce the EU's common foreign policy.
