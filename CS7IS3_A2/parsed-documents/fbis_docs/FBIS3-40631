Pandit: "Congress (I) is Fighting Over Dunkel Proposals"] [Text] The Dunkel proposals have enveloped the government in such a way that the prime minister and the cabinet members are at their wits ends. The Lok Sabha chairman and the Rajya Sabha vice chairman have been waiting all week for the government to resolve this issue since the Parliament's activities could not be stopped indefinitely. Finally, on Friday, the opposition dissatisfied even after the statement issued by the Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji in the presence of the prime minister walked out of the Lok Sabha. In the Rajya Sabha, Vice Chairperson Nazma Heptullah very smartly announced adjourning the meeting until Monday as soon as the commerce minister had finished his speech. The opposition was still demanding that Prime Minister Narasimha Rao must clarify the whole issue himself. The opposition, however, did not even let the proceeding go as far as questions session. Mr. Mukerhji says that the government's decision is appropriate because this will help improve the country's economy and this is the only way to improve our trade. In the Lok Sabha, he opened his mouth only once in the presence of the prime minister to say that the unity of the developing countries did not last long in the talks over international trade and tariff. In the Rajya Sabha, the prime minister stood up only for a second to deny an opposition accusation that the government did not want to discuss this international agreement in the House. Mr. Pranab Mukherji also clarified that government's approving the Dunkel proposals does not mean that we have mortgaged the autonomy of our country. Mr. Mukherji's clarification raised the question as to how 117 countries in the world have agreed to this proposal. The question is based on one point on which the whole opposition is arguing: How will the farmers benefit from it? Mr. Pranab Mukherji responded that it was true the farmer could use their own seeds but will not have the right to sell them. Similarly, Mr. Mukherji admitted that prices of some drugs will increase. However, he said, this will not cause much of a problem because controlled rate shops will be opened and special agreement made for distribution of fertilizers. The government subsidy policy will not be affected by this agreement. The government assured us that if the business of a multi-national company proved to be against the nation's interests the government could always use its right to close that company's business here. Both houses of the Parliament were very active from Monday to Friday discussing the GATT and Dunkel issues. These discussions have been postponed until Monday after the clarifications made by the commerce minister and the prime minister on Friday. However, it seems that the Dunkel affair will quiet down in the Parliament and out of it. It appears that Lok Sabha Chairperson Shivraj Patil must have pulled off a miracle, because it was hinted at the beginning of the discussion that only Mr. Mukherji would respond to the questions, and the prime minister could interrupt him if necessary. The commerce minister could not give satisfactory answers to questions posed by veteran opposition leaders such as Somnath Chaterji, Inderjit Gupta, Nitish Kumar, and George. This indicates that the strategy formed by the veteran opposition leaders on this issue has been suspended for a while. They will cause additional problems for the government, however, by raising this issue in a new format since the winter session of the Parliament will continue for one more week. The BJP sent a letter to President Shankar Dayal Sharma the same day. It accused the government of signing the GATT agreement under international pressure and of tying down the future generation of the nation in the knots of unfair international trade system. In this letter, the BJP also said that the arrest of its leaders was motivated by the government's malicious and improper attitude.
