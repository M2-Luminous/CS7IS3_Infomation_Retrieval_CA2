FR940414-0-00046 FR940414-0-00018 40 CFR Part 180 [OPP&hyph;300334; FRL&hyph;4768&hyph;9] RIN No. 2070&hyph;AB78 Tolerance Exemption for Trimethylolpropane; Technical Amendment AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule; Technical amendment. SUMMARY: This document makes a technical amendment to a regulation establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of trimethylolpropane (CAS Registry No. 77-99-6) when used as an inert ingredient (component of water-soluble film) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops only. A limitation of 15% of the formulation that was inadvertently listed is changed to the intended 15% of the film limitation. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Tina Levine, Registration Support Branch, Reregistration Division (7505W), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: 6th Floor, CS #1, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA, (703)-308-8393. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of August 25, 1993 (58 FR 44766), EPA issued a regulation adding trimethylolpropane (CAS Reg. No. 77-99-6), a component in water-soluble film, to 40 CFR 180.1001(d) as an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for pesticides under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a). The exemption included with the limit ``Not to exceed 5% by weight of the film.'' In the preamble to the final rule, EPA discussed a comment requesting that the 5% limit be raised and announced that it would be addressed in a separate notice. A proposal to raise the limit to 15% was published in the Federal Register of November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62071), and the amendment was finalized on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 2751). Although the discussion in the preamble of the November 24th proposal indicated clearly that trimethylolpropane was used in water-soluble films at levels up to approximately 15%, all expressions of the limits in the proposed and final rules on the amendment to the exemption were as percentages ``of the formulation.'' Even the previous final rule was incorrectly described in the November 24th proposal as having ``a limitation that it will not exceed 5% of the pesticide formulation.'' This document corrects this error by delineating the appropriate limits so that the exemption will be correctly listed in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). EPA is issuing this technical amendment without notice and comment periods because it is merely a technical change which restores the scope of the exemption to what was intended by EPA, the original petitioner, the commenter who sought to raise the limit, and all other commenters on this exemption.
