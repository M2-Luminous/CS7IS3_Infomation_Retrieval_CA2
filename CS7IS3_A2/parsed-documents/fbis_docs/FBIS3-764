Addressing about 3,000 civil servants in Mmabatho's civic theatre on Monday [14 March] morning, Dr van der Walt said: "The South African Government guarantees the salary and pension privileges of every civil servant, including those who were dismissed in the past." He then promised parity of salaries with South African civil servants' pay grades "as soon as possible". "Your salaries will be paid at th? end of the month, but do your jobs," Dr van der Walt told his cheering audience. Dr van der Walt said in spite of the sad events and atrocities of last week's unrest, "we'll get Bophuthatswana moving like never before". "We'll make Bophuthatswana the backbone of the north-west as part and parcel of the new South Africa." Dr van der Walt said he had warned the South African Government last year about the "grassroots unrest" in Boputhatswana. The "sad fact was that, humanely speaking, the loss of life and property in the homeland could have been been prevented. But we are here to pick up the pieces". The people of Bophuthatswana could now regard themselves as South African citizens and participate in the elections. Dr van der Walt said he took full responsibility for calling in the South African Defence Force to stabilise the situation in the troubled homeland, and apologised for the right-wing insurgence into Bophuthatswana last week, saying the SA Government was not responsible for this. He told the civil servants the security situation was under control and nobody needed to feel intimidated or threatened. Dr van der Walt's remark that he had informed Bophuthatswana's former President Lucas Mangope on Saturday night that his presidency was no longer recognised, was applauded loudly by the audience. He also promised the civil servants the government would "carefully consider" civil servants' concerns and "look sympathetically" at all reasonable demands. Dr van der Walt said he had been in touch with Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler, who had told him the IEC was drawing up a plan of action for free and fair political activities in Bophuthatswana for the April elections. Contact with community leaders at the weekend would continue. Calling on the civil servants to "return to normality as soon as possible", Dr van der Walt said outside experts would be brought in to help the Bophuthatswana civil service get back on its feet.
