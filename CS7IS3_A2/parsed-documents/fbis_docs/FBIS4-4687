FBIS4-4687 "dreas065__a94016" FBIS-EAS-94-065-A Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan LDP's Watanabe on Politics, Party Realignment LDP's Watanabe on Politics, Party Realignment OW0504094494 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 4 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0504094494 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and foreign minister, made an appearance on a program broadcast by the FNN Television Network on 3 April and commented on such issues as Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's controversial 100 million yen loan from the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin trucking group which has caused a delay in Diet deliberations on the fiscal year 1994 draft budget. Watanabe said: "Although there may be arguments against my opinion, I feel that everyone will make efforts to resolve the situation this week. I plan to do my part." He thus indicated that the situation should be resolved this week in order to normalize the Diet's deliberations on the draft budget. Concerning rumors regarding the possible dissolution of the lower house of the Diet and the resignation of the entire cabinet as a result of this, Watanabe said: "A dissolution of the lower house rarely occurs, but it cannot be ruled out." As for the resignation of the entire cabinet, however, Watanabe said, "It is true that the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] intends to corner the cabinet into resigning altogether, but the party needs to think a little more about what to do afterwards." He thus indicated that the party should take a more cautious approach, taking into account the possibility of forming a cabinet "supported by the whole nation," in which the LDP would also participate. In this connection, Watanabe also made a comment regarding the LDP's cooperation with the ruling coalition government. He said: "If requested to do so by the government, and should our demands be adopted, it is only natural for the party to cooperate. We also have the option of providing support from outside or within the cabinet." Regarding the possibility of a further political realignment taking place this year, Watanabe said, "I think there is a 70-percent chance of this happening." He added, however: "In case an emergency should arise concerning the Korean peninsula issue, it will be necessary to make prompt decisions (regarding how the government intends to deal with the situation). It (further political realignment) will not happen if the government fails to carry out political measures and merely continues to remain a lazy, diabetic cabinet (in responding only to symptoms while putting off the real problem)." He thus pointed out the possibility that a further political realignment could be triggered by a split between the ruling coalition parties regarding foreign affairs and other policies. As for the emergence of moves within the LDP recommending that Watanabe assume the post of party vice president, Watanabe said, "Although I have not been directly requested to do so (by LDP President Yohei Kono), I have heard about them."
