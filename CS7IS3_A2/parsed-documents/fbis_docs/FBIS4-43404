In a statement after a ceremony to receive the credentials of the new Portuguese ambassador, Kliridhis mentioned that he expects Clinton and Major to reply to his letter. He added that he has some indications of the way the two leaders will react. Commenting on the resolution that the UN Security Council adopted yesterday to renew the UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] mandate, the president noted that the resolution sends out the correct messages because it stresses the need to implement the confidence-building measures, not to continue the talks on them. He added it is important that a new, detailed revision of the Cyprus issue be made according to yesterday's resolution, and that all of the alternatives that are listed in the UN secretary general's report be examined. The president said he does not rule out that Butrus-Ghali's options will be simultaneously studied with the confidence-building measures procedure if Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas accepts the 21 March UN document.
