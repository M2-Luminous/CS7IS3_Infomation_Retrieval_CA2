Indian and Polish leaders today held wide-ranging political discussions encompassing issues of bilateral and multilateral interests. The talks, in the presence of the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, and the visiting polish President, Mr. Lech Walesa, resulted in three tentative agreements. Finding a common view on the need to reform the U.N. system, the two countries decided to explore the possibility of jointly forwarding proposals for changes in the U.N. system, including a "change in the status of some countries." Mr. Walesa later told presspersons that Poland shared the Indian view that there was need for a reform of the U.N., including making it more effective. In this context, Mr. Walesa announced that the representatives of the two countries at the U.N. would present a report on how the positions of the two countries could be coordinated and a joint initiative launched in this regard. The second agreement on coordination at an international forum was in the context of the GATT. Here, the two decided to consult each other on specific issues, especially in the case of textiles in which India has substantial interests. The third was in respect of jointly exploring business opportunities in third countries by pooling respective strengths. The private sector in the two countries would prepare the report in this context and present it to the respective Governments. Giving a resume of his discussions with Indian leader's, Mr. Walesa said detailed talks had revealed that there were no areas of differences between the two countries. On the other hand, prospects of economic cooperation were immense and these should be exploited for mutual benefit. On issues of nuclear weapons, the Polish President reiterated the position that his country was for a stop to nuclear proliferation after which the world should attempt to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction. "I know it is a difficult task and may not be achieved in my time. The next generation will have to strive for it," Mr. Walesa added. Similarly, on human rights, Mr. Walesa said Poland was against violation of human rights in any part of the world. With Indian leaders, he said the discussions on this subject were general in nature and no specific instances or places were mentioned. The best system The Polish President was repeatedly asked for his views on the trade union movement and the future of communism. To every query he stated that he believed in a strong trade union movement which could put pressure on the owners, either private or the State. "But the pressure should not be so strong as to kill the enterprise, like bacteria which eats away the vitals of the body," he added. Mr. Walesa was also categorical in stating that he believed that the capitalist form of development was the best system, but not brutal capitalism which had exploitation as its main plank. "Some call it capitalism with a human face. That, I think, is what is needed." Investment invited Earlier, the Polish President had a meeting with Indian industrialists where he invited investment. Stating that his country could serve as a stepping stone to the European market, he assured the industrialists that "every penny invested in Poland will fetch high returns." Till the mid-eighties, Poland was one of the major trading partners in the Socialist bloc. However, with that country pulling out of the rupee trade agreement, bilateral trade shrank considerably. Mr. Walesa expressed the hope that with his visit to India, bilateral trade and investment would go up considerably. The investment climate there was quite friendly and foreign investment was allowed in various segments of the economy, including portfolio investments, the industrialists were told.
