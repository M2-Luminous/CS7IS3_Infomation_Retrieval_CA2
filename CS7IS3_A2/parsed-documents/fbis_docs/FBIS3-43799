The latter will have to be appointed within the next two weeks by the High Council of the Republic, which will also include President Mobutu's political allies. Two candidates will stand, Etienne Tshisekedi and Mulumba Lukoji. Lukoji has already held this post; he inaugurated the national conference two years ago. He is the candidate of the parties close to the Presidency, whereas Etienne Tshisekedi remains the candidate of the opposition. On the opposition's side, the president's speech has provoked anger and outrage. For the Christian Democrat PDCS [Democratic and Social Christian Party], this is merely a constitutional coup. There has been another reaction, that of the UDPS [Union for Democracy and Social Progress], Etienne Tshisekedi's party, which is the hard core of the Radical Sacred Union of the opposition. Herve de Guelinck spoke to Justine Kasavubu: [Begin recording] [Kasavubu] It is an extra obstacle. You may remember that Mobutu said a few days ago that he agreed to a prime minister from the opposition. That has now been shown to be a lie. He has given Mulumba Lokoji a leg-up, which means that after Mulumba Lokoji, we will still have Mungul Diaka [presidium chairman of Alliance of Independent Forces for Integral Change] and Nguza Karl-I-Bond. This is the Mobutist carousel. [Guelinck] Yet it will be up to the transitional parliament to appoint the candidate, won't it? [Kasavubu] But the transitional parliament never said that Mr. Tshisekedi was out of bounds, so I think that the counsellors of the Republic will be keen to set Mr. Tshisekedi back to work [as heard] and to tell Mobutu once and for all that the comedy is over.
