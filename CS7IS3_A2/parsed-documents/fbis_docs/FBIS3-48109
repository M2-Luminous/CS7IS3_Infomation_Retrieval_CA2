The masses were attended by monks of the temples, believers and clergymen from the Central Committee of the Korean Buddhists Federation and its provincial, city and county committees. The preachers said that in order to realise the idea of "getting rid of the pain and attaining happiness," the basic idea of Buddhists, it was imperative to reunify the country at an early date. They stressed that the country should be reunified in the form of a confederation and the best way to it was to implement "10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country" laid down by respected President Kim Il-song. They called on all the Buddhists in the North, South and overseas to closely unite with each other under the banner of great national unity and make a tangible contribution to the cause of national reunification, thus achieving the reunification in the '90s without fail.
