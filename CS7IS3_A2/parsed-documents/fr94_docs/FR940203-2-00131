FR940203-2-00131 FR940203-2-00068 Discussion: An important goal of the School-to-Work Opportunities program is to facilitate the employment of young Americans in high-skill, high-wage occupations. Enhancing the ability of job applicants to demonstrate that they possess high quality skills is one way to promote access to such employment. A skill certificate can provide that credential and thereby enhance job prospects. Therefore, the Secretaries believe that this is a crucial component and should be a required outcome. Participation in both the proposed Goals 2000 program and the School-to-Work Opportunities program is entirely voluntary. However, should a State elect to participate, the Secretaries expect that skill certificates will be awarded and that they will take into account the criteria proposed in Goals 2000 as well as the work of the National Skills Standards Board. These criteria are intended to promote the highest quality and most internationally competitive standards possible, in order to facilitate high-wage, high-skill employment. Changes: None. Comment: One commenter supported the linking of skill certificates to the National Skill Standards Board and observed that these standards should be the direct goal of each State's efforts, otherwise the skills standards would have little use. This commenter believed that the standards should also be linked to the academic standards of the National Council of Teachers of Math (NCTM) and the National Council of Teachers of Science (NCTS). Discussion: The Secretaries agree that input from the NCTM and NCTS would be helpful and expect that they will be a part of the process under which academic standards are set. Changes: None. Priority_Opportunities for All Students Comments: Several commenters requested that the Secretaries expand upon the requirement in paragraph (b)(6) of the October 14, 1993 notice (redesignated as (b)(7) of this notice), under which States must describe how they will ensure opportunities for participation for all students. The commenters requested that this be done by requiring States to describe how opportunities will be provided, particularly to low-achieving, disabled, and limited-English proficient students. One commenter noted that paragraph (b)(8) of the October 14, 1993 notice should be redrafted in a manner similar to paragraph (b)(7) of the October 14, 1993 notice, under which States were required to describe the manner in which opportunities will be provided for young women to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities programs in a manner leading to meaningful employment opportunities. Discussion: The Secretaries intend the requirement in paragraph (b)(8), redesignated as (b)(9) of this notice, relating to low-achieving students, students with disabilities, and dropouts, to provide the same threshold for serving those students, as the language in redesignated paragraph (b)(8) of the final priority, with regard to serving young women. In both paragraphs, the Secretaries intend to seek descriptions from States as to how they will ensure opportunities for students to participate in a meaningful and productive manner in the School-to-Work Opportunities program.
