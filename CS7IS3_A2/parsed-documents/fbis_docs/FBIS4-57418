The OAS report stated that "in several municipalities, citizens who had their identification cards could not vote due to irregularities in the official voters lists." In other words, the names of those citizens were not in the electoral register previously delivered to the political parties. The report added: "The OAS electoral mission, along with two other international delegations, immediately presented this serious concern to the Central Electoral Board (JCE) authorities. At the moment, we are not in a position to evaluate the magnitude or the implications of the irregularities in the electoral register." The OAS observers hope the Dominican authorities will make an effort to determine "the identity of the persons responsible for the irregularities in the electoral registry." Finally, the OAS stressed "the preliminary status of the observations. Several members of the electoral mission will remain in the Dominican Republic to prepare a final report to be presented to the OAS Permanent Council as soon as possible." Prior to the report's issuance, representatives from the U.S. National Democratic Institute for Foreign Affairs and members of Socialist International, SI, made similar observations, expressed in even stronger terms. A spokesman for President Ballaguer's Social Christian Reformist Party today described the SI observers as "insolent," adding that "none of them have any right to meddle in our national politics."
