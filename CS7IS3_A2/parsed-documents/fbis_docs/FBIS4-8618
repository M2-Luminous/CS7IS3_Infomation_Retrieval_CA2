[Zubak] At the same time we discussed the measures and activities that need to be undertaken to implement the Washington agreement, that is, the constitution adopted by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly. [Cumurovic] Kresimir Zubak also said that some very significant issues were raised today, for example, how to reorganize the government so that it can function as the government of Bosnia- Herzegovina and the government of the federation, the question of the leading functions in the federation and how to organize the next session of the Constituent Assembly. [Zubak] We agreed today to hold the next session of the Constituent Assembly sometime between the 28th and 30th of this month. We expect that by that time we will have agreed on the issues that we discussed today. Today we agreed on the basic principles in connection with the determination and nomination of candidates for president and vice president of the republic, and the prime minister and deputy prime minister. As Mr. Silajdzic said, in about seven days we will hold another session at the same level, when, I am certain, we will reach complete agreement. Then we will nominate the candidates, and the assembly session will be scheduled for the period of 28-30 April. I believe that the assembly [words indistinct] and we will confirm [words indistinct]. [Cumurovic] Dr. Haris Silajdzic explained the results of today's talks with the following words: [Silajdzic] Our listeners and viewers will probably be interested in what we agreed on for the interim period in order to find an urgent solution to the problems of everyday life. We (?agreed on the opening) of the entire energy system of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the repair of all the transmission systems; therefore, on [words indistinct] Rama, turning on the hydroelectric power station (?Globovica), on the delivery of all the necessary materials for the full functioning of the thermal power stations Kakanj and Tuzla. We discussed the problem of the return of refugees, and we agreed, of course, on how to enable people to return to their last abode of residence. That is of course the view held before, only now it has been confirmed. We are talking here about issues that have been covered before at the meetings of the commissions, and at today's meeting all this was confirmed. Priority should be given to the reconstruction of destroyed railroad bridges -- we believe that is the priority on the Neretva River -- and the repair of the railroad line from Stolac toward the west. The construction of a bridge across the Sava River between Orasje and Zupanja has to be taken most seriously. The telephone lines from the south to Sarajevo have to be established, and thus the shattered communications system reestablished. Telephone lines have to be reintroduced to the left bank of Mostar, and the entire left bank of Mostar has to be supplied with water, including the reintroduction of the Studenac spring into the system. At least two megawatts of electricity have to be allowed into that part of the city. There is the question of coordinating the entire humanitarian system, and placing that system in the hands [words indistinct]. [Cumurovic] The talks between the two delegations led by Dr. Haris Silajdzic and Kresimir Zubak were attended by Victor Jakovich, U.S. ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Zdravko Pancevic, Croatian ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina. After making his statement on the results of today's meeting, Dr. Silajdzic answered several questions asked by foreign reporters about the fierce chetnik attacks on civilians and members of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]. Addressing that issue, he said that he was astonished at the enormity of the evil happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina, without getting any real reaction from the international community. He stressed that the people who destroyed Bosnia-Herzegovina, people who murdered 200,000 citizens, people who were attacking safe havens and UNPROFOR are still referred to as a side in the conflict. He wondered what else they would have to do to trigger any real action. And we would like to cite the following part of Silajdzic's statement: I would like to send a message to those Serbs on the occupied territories who might be deceived into joining Karadzic. They can now see the Croats and the Bosnian Muslims living and working together in a normal democratic state. If they want to join us, they are welcome.
