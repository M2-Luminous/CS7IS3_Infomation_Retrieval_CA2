The strength of the republic's airborne troops has been significantly weakened by a mass exodus to Russia; over 300 officers changed their place of service. The paper also reports that about 2,500 officers are trying to leave for Russia in the near future. Over half the Belarusians who are graduating from Russian military schools this year have already signed contracts to do their service in the Russian Armed Forces. The newspaper believes that a higher level of social guarantees for servicemen of the Russian Army is the main reason for this.
