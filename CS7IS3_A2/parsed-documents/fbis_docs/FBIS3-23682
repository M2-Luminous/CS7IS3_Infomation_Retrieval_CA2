It has the world's largest optical telescope (6 meters) and the world's largest radiotelescope (the 600-meter RATAN-600). Together, the two telescopes can perform virtually any ground-based astrophysical experiment in the optical, centimeter, and decimeter ranges. The 6-meter telescope is used to study number of phenomena, including the chemical composition, magnetic fields, and atmospheres of stars and the spectral and polarimetric characteristics of relativistic objects such as black holes and neutron stars. The RATAN-600 has a wide range of uses, such as studies of the interstellar medium and star formation. More than 20 organizations from Russia and the near-abroad make use of the RATAN-600, and in 1989 alone, it found 14,000 objects. Like other facilities of the Academy of Sciences, however, the observatory is having difficulty getting money for even minimum maintenance. The RATAN-600 is particularly troubled in that regard and has been operating at 10-percent capacity in recent months. Figures 2, references 2 (Russian).
