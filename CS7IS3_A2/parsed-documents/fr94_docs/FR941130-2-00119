On the same day, Investors would use the proceeds to purchase the appropriate number of shares of PCM Voyager Fund. 11. The Substitution would take place at relative net asset values of the CIGNA Funds and the PCM Funds, with no change in the amount of any policyholder's account value under either the Account I or the INA/Putnam Policies. 12. It is expected that the CIGNA Funds will incur brokerage fees and expenses in connection with the redemption by Investors of the shares of the CIGNA Funds. These expenses would be charged to the applicable portfolio of the CIGNA Funds. To alleviate the potential impact of such brokerage fees and expenses upon the CIGNA Funds, CII and the CIGNA Funds have proposed to Investors that the redemption of the shares of the CIGNA Funds be accomplished, in part, by ``in kind'' payments. Under the proposal, the CIGNA Funds would transfer to Investors cash and/or securities held by the CIGNA Funds at the effective date of the Substitution, and Investors would use such cash and/or securities to purchase shares of the applicable portfolio of the PCM Funds. Investors has indicated that it would be agreeable to the ``in kind'' aspect of the proposal, on the conditions that: (i) The CIGNA Funds identify prior to the effective date of the Substitution the securities to be included in the ``in kind'' transfer; and (ii) the PCM Funds and Putnam, in its capacity as investment adviser to the PCM Funds, agree to accept the securities so identified in payment for the purchase by Investors of shares of PCM Funds to effectuate the Substitution. The valuation of any ``in kind'' transfers will be on a basis consistent with the valuation of the assets of the CIGNA Funds and the normal valuation procedures of the PCM Funds. 13. Following the Substitution, the fees and expenses imposed by Investors under the Account I Policies and the INA/Putnam Policies would remain the same as currently in effect. In addition, the Substitution would not impose any federal income tax liability on owners of Account I Policies or INA/Putnam Policies. 14. Following the Substitution, Account I Policy owners would have the right to transfer account values among the divisions of Account I for which the four PCM Funds described above serve as the underlying investment vehicle. INA/Putnam Policy owners would have the right to transfer account values among the divisions of the INA/Putnam Account for which three PCM funds (the PCM Money Market Fund, the PCM U.S. Government High Quality Bond Fund, and the PCM Growth and Income Fund) serve as the underlying investment vehicles. In addition, INA/Putnam Policy owners who currently utilize one or more of the Putnam Funds as their underlying investment vehicle(s) would be able to transfer such values amongst the PCM Money Market Fund, the PCM U.S. Government and High Quality Bond Fund, and the PCM Growth and Income Fund. The current provisions of the INA/Putnam Policies which prevent a policyholder who transfers values from the Putnam Funds to the CIGNA Funds from subsequently transferring such values back to the Putnam Funds would continue in effect, with the restriction applying to PCM Funds in place of the CIGNA Funds. 15. Following the Substitution, Investors intends to redeem its investment of seed money. However, the timing of such withdrawal has not been established and will be at the discretion of Investors. By making this withdrawal after the Substitution, Investors anticipates that the brokerage and related expenses incurred by the underlying fund would have a substantially reduced impact, if any, upon Policy owners, as a result of the larger overall size of the applicable PCM Funds. 16. Investors has been advised by CII that, following the Substitution and the redemption of CIGNA Funds shares by Investors, the CIGNA Funds intends to file an application under Section 8(f) of the 1940 Act, requesting an order that it has ceased to be an investment company. Following the issuance of such an order, the CIGNA Funds will dissolve, pursuant to the applicable provisions of Massachusetts law.
