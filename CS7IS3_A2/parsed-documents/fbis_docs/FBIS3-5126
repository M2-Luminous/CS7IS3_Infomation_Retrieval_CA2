Present there were Premier of the Administration Council Kang Song-san and Vice-President Yi Chong-ok who are Politburo members of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and other senior party and state officials. Kang Hyon-su, member of the C.C. [Central Committee], the WPK, chief secretary of the Pyongyang municipal committee of the WPK and chairman of the Pyongyang municipal people's committee, delivered a report titled "Let us accelerate the ultimate solution to the socialist rural question under the leadership of the party." He said the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, in his historic letter "For the ultimate solution of the rural question under the banner of the socialist rural theses" addressed to the National Agricultural Conference, reviewed with pride the decisive victory won in the implementation of the socialist rural theses and clearly indicated tasks to finally solve the socialist rural question and ways for their fulfilment. He stressed that the letter of the great leader is a militant banner of weighty historic significance in triumphantly solving the socialist rural question and thus consolidating man-centred socialism of our style and further exalting its might and successfully discharging the noble duty we have assumed for the times and history. The reporter called for maintaining a constant upsurge in rural construction and agricultural production through energetic efforts for the thorough implementation of the highly important tasks laid down in the letter. He laid emphasis on the need to develop in depth the ideological, cultural and technical revolutions in the countryside in compliance with the requirements of socialist rural construction on a new, higher stage. "If the socialist agricultural cooperative economy is to be consolidated and developed still further and the conversion of cooperative property into all-people property is to be realised smoothly without any deviations, it is essential to increase the support of the towns to the countryside and material and technical assistance of industry to agriculture, further enhance the role of the county in socialist rural construction and give full play to the advantages and vitality of the chuche-based agricultural guidance system of our style," he said, and continued: "Now the imperialists and reactionaries are making desperate efforts to isolate and stifle our Republic politically, economically and militarily. But all the agricultural working people should believe and follow only the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and become a fortress and a shield defending the party and the leader politically and ideologically and with their lives." Speeches were made and a resolution was adopted at the rally. At the end of the rally hundreds of lorries loaded with farming materials left for rural villages around the city.
