MPLA Central Committee spokesman Norberto dos Santos said: [Begin Santos recording] We think that our negotiating team is doing good work. It is defending the interests of our country and the government and we encourage it to continue on this path. The government has made an offer. It has already expressed its stand on UNITA's participation in the government, the special status for Jonas Savimbi, and the mandate of the UN Angola Verification Mission. These issues are on the negotiating table, waiting for UNITA to adopt a stand. Our delegation will therefore continue to deal with these issues. The MPLA Central Committee has restated that it is necessary to find a just and lasting peace in Lusaka that will defend the interests of the Angolan people. [end recording]
