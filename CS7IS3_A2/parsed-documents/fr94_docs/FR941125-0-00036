FR941125-0-00036 FR941125-0-00016 It is the policy of the Service (59 FR 34272) to identify to the maximum extent practicable those activities that would or would not constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act at the time of listing. The intent of this policy is to increase public awareness of the effect of the listing on proposed or ongoing activities. Of the seven known localities of Pleodendron macranthum all are located on public lands and of the five known localities of Eugenia haematocarpa all but one are located on public lands. Collection, damage or destruction of these species on Federal lands is prohibited, although in appropriate cases a Federal endangered species permit may be issued to allow collection. Such activities on non-Federal lands would constitute a violation of section 9 if conducted in violation of Commonwealth law. Section 15.01(b) of the Commonwealth ``Regulation to Govern the Management of Threatened and Endangered Species in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,'' states: ``It is illegal to take, cut, mutilate, uproot, burn or excavate any endangered plant species or part thereof within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.'' The Service is not aware of any otherwise lawful activities being conducted or proposed by the public that will be affected by this listing and result in a violation of section 9. Questions regarding whether specific activities will constitute a violation of section 9 should be directed to the Field Supervisor of the Service's Caribbean Office (see ADDRESSES section). Requests for copies of the regulations on listed species and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits should be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services (TE), 1875 Century Boulevard, Atlanta, Georgia 30345&hyph;3301 (phone 404/679&hyph;7096, facsimile 404/679&hyph;7081). National Environmental Policy Act The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). References Cited Ayensu, E.S., and R. A. DeFilipps. 1978.
