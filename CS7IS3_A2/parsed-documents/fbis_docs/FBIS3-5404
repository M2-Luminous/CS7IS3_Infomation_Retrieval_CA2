Recalling that the traitor Kim Yong-sam clique recently cracked down on a demonstration of the participants in a rally marking the 75th anniversary of the March 1st popular uprising at the point of bayonet and is continuing to suppress the righteous struggle of people of all walks of life for independence, democracy and reunification including the struggle against rice market opening, the information said: Such suppression, which was committed at a time when the traitor Kim Yong-sam issued an order to crack down on the right struggle of the South Korean people, labelling it "illegal" and "violent" one, is a clear proof that the South Korean puppets are throwing away even the formal "civilian" veil, openly resorting to the sword-brandishing fascist rule. The suppression at the point of bayonet cannot save the Kim Yong-sam group from the crisis of power. As long as the traitor Kim Yong-sam as crafty as a fox remains in power, independence and democracy can neither be realized nor can existence itself be kept. The South Korean people should rise up in the struggle to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam group.
