But during the past few weeks, there have been increasing signs of a strain in the Brotherhood's relationship with the government. The first sign was an anti-government demonstration, in protest at the death in police custody of a lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, staged by members of the Brotherhood-controlled Bar Association and which police dispersed immediately. Thirty-six lawyers were arrested. A few days later, Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, a prominent Islamic scholar, was instructed by security authorities not to deliver a sermon during prayers marking 'Id al-Adha at the Mustafa Mahmud mosque in Muhandisin. Al-Ghazali was later received by Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi, in what was viewed as a conciliatory gesture. Around the same time, 84-year-old Shaykh Hamid Abu-al-Nasr, the supreme guide of the Brotherhood, was summoned for questioning by prosecution authorities after leaflets bearing his name were seized during the 'Id prayers. The ailing Shaykh did not comply and the order was subsequently cancelled. On Monday, Al-Alfi announced that "a group of Brotherhood members have been arrested for anti-state activity." The newspaper AL- SHA'B, mouthpiece of the Islamist-oriented Labour Party, put their number at eight and said their arrest was "part of the escalating government campaign against the Brotherhood." The eight, who include Ibrahim Sharaf, the private secretary of the supreme guide, were remanded in custody for 15 days, the newspaper said. Mustafa Mashhur, a deputy of the supreme guide, told AL-AHRAM WEEKLY he was surprised by the government's actions because "we are exercising all our activities, whether in the People's Assembly or in professional syndicates or teachers' cubs, within the framework of the constitution and under the umbrella of the law." He said the Brotherhood has not been involved in any act of violence since it resurfaced during the 1970s. "We even condemned such acts," he said. The reason for the clampdown, Mashhur said, could be the anti- government slogans shouted by lawyers during their demonstration. But Mashhur denied that those lawyers were Brotherhood members. Another reason, Mashhur said, could be the government's intention to deny the Brotherhood the right to establish a political party. "They think that if we have an Islamic party, the Copts will demand a party of their own and this will lead to civil strife. But this is not true." Despite the latest arrests, the Brotherhood is carrying on with its normal activities and "will not be involved in any escalation, even if the government steps up its measures," Mashhur said. 'Isam al-'Aryan, secretary-general of the Doctors Union and a leading member of the Brotherhood, said he was not worried by the latest arrests because "this is a pattern to which previous governments resorted on previous occasions." The reason for the clampdown, he said, could be a government attempt to bar the Brotherhood from the national dialogue or from parliamentary elections scheduled for next year. Muhammad Salim al-'Awwa, a lawyer described as a representative of the moderate Islamic trend, said he was surprised by recent events because the Brotherhood has distributed leaflets for years and they were never confiscated and the supreme guide was never summoned for questioning. He described the government's actions as a "political and religious mistake" because the Brotherhood is a "strong political and religious supporter of the constitutional system." Political analyst Muhammad Sid-Ahmad believes the motive behind the government clampdown is to exclude the Brotherhood from the national dialogue. "There are two reasons for this. First, the government is not prepared to recognise it to prevent the emergence of an Islamic party, then a Christian party etc. The second reason is the government's wish to maintain the legitimacy of the dialogue" by excluding illegal organisations, he said. But Sid-Ahmad believes the Brotherhood will be indirectly represented at the dialogue via Ibrahim Shukri, leader of the Labour Party. Another political analyst, Tagammu [National Progressive Unionist Grouping] secretary-general Rif'at al-Sa'id, who keeps a close watch on the Islamist movement, said the government has tolerated the Brotherhood for years because it considered it harmless but was waking up to its "danger." "There is no moderation in the Islamist current. The Brotherhood is an extremist organisation that calls for the establishment of an Islamic state. The violent history of the Brotherhood speaks for itself," al-Sa'id added. The Brotherhood instigated the lawyers' demonstration to cover up for "severe financial malpractices" by the Bar Association's Council, he continued. The demonstration as well as televised statements by repentant terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi, implicating the Brotherhood in acts of terrorism, made the government wake up to the "danger" of the Brotherhood, he commented. Asked if the Brotherhood was expected to retaliate for the government clampdown, Al-Sa'id replied negatively. "On the contrary, they will kneel down in order to be accepted."
