Some have accused you of trying to drag or persuade the Gulf states to normalize relations with Israel. What is your reaction to these charges? [Bin-'Abdallah] That criticism did not come as a surprise to us. On the contrary, we see it as something natural and expected. We are aware of the phrases used in that criticism. We view it as a part of the serious thinking about the peace process. That criticism was made because of these states' interest in establishing peace. [passage omitted] As I said, we are not annoyed by such criticism which we believe is natural. It will not affect our relations, links, and absolute support for the other Arab states, especially Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Palestinians. We do so despite the fact that the press in these states criticized the presence of an Israeli delegation in Muscat as part of the international working team within the Water Committee. We do not have a complex about such criticism. I believe that the fraternal states adjacent to Israel have to say these things because their cricumstances and political positions on the peace process necessitate such statements by them. ['Abd-al-Ghani] You have held direct meetings with the Israeli delegation.... It has been claimed that Oman might start establishing bilateral relations with Israel gradually, say by exchanging delegations, particularly in the spheres of water and agriculture. Has an agreement to that effect been reached between you and Israel, and have you kept a channel of contact open? [Bin-'Abdallah] The talks with the Israeli delegation did not go beyond the multilateral negotiations. We were crystal clear and meant to be so. In my interview with the Israeli press and television I stated very clearly that the Israeli leaders should not expect such steps by the Arab states before a comprehensive and lasting peace is established with the neighboring Arab states. I believe there is no room for confusion or misunderstanding at all. We explained clearly that neither Oman, the Arab Gulf states, nor any other Arab state would be willing to establish any kind of diplomatic contacts with Israel before the latter honors its commitments under the peace process and before withdrawal (from the occupied territories) and implementation of the Security Council resolutions agreed upon in the context of the peace process. ['Abd-al-Ghani] Oman got the Water Committee's approval for it to set up an international center for the development of water desalination technology. Will you permit the presence of Israeli experts in it or the use of Israeli research and technology in its activities before the political peace process through the bilateral committees is completed? [Bin-'Abdallah] It is going to be an international water research center. All the Arab and other states in the Middle East will benefit from it. We do not expect results regarding that center in the immediate future. There are separate advanced research activities in the United States, Japan, Russia, and Western Europe. It has also been reported that there are advanced desalination researches in Israel and South Africa. I mean that the advanced industrial states have researches in this fields and we intend to benefit from all that and turn the theoretical part of them into applied technology. If there is some useful research in Israel then that would be a scientific issue and has nothing to do with politics, and we separate scientific issues from political issues. I believe that this matter will take some time and we expect the peace process to be completed before we can get these separate technologies. [passge omitted] ['Abd-al-Ghani] Are there any differences within the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] over the question of some states hosting meetings of multilateral committees with the participation of Israeli delegations? [Bin-'Abdallah] I will not be saying anything new in this connection. It had been understood in the Madrid context that Israel wished the meetings to be held in the Middle East but the Arab states were not convinced. Then there was an understanding that the multilateral negotiations could be moved to the Middle East once practical steps were taken in the bilateral negotiations. It was not specified whether such steps should be taken collectively on all fronts or separately. When the Declaration of Principles between the PLO and Israel was signed, that was seen as a positive step in the right direction in the direct negotiations...and it was seen as a pointer and as a step on the basis of which multilateral negotiations could be moved to the Middle East, and that is what happened. [passage omitted] There are no differences on this matter but perhaps the willingness to host such conferences in the presence of an Israeli delegation within the committees differs from one state to another because of different circumstances and concepts but there is absolutely no disagreement within the GCC on the issue of hosting multilateral committees. ['Abd-al-Ghani] The question of your relations with Israel is linked to the vision of the region's future you once outlined, which was quoted by an Egyptian paper, to the effect that the Arabic language, Arabism, and the Arab system were finished and that the geographical reality which should be addressed was now the Middle East. Does this mean that you now seek abolition of the Arab regional system and institutions such as the Arab League and wish to replace them with a Middle Eastern system including non-Arab states such as Iran, Israel, and Turkey? [Bin-'Abdallah] First of all, what the Egyptian paper AL-JUMHURIYAH published in the name of its editor did not quote me accurately. The Arabic language exists. It is the language of the Koran. Nobody can deny that, but what I said then was that our use of the Arabic language was not up to the ideal level, and if we maintain that the Arabic language is the leading ideological and political language then we use it better in order to be able to express ourselves clearly like the other now international languages. AL-JUMHURIYAH confused the Middle East concept with the Arabic language concept. What I mean to say is that the Middle East concept does not negate the Arab concept. On the contrary, the Arabs own the Middle East but we should not appear to be racist, and Arab nationalism or Arabism should not appear to be a racist phenomenon. [passage omitted] ['Abd-al-Ghani] In other words, you are not calling for the abolition of the Arab League? [Bin-'Abdallah] The Arab League is still the right institution for the Arabs. We all agree on that but it may not be able to fulfill Arab needs in the next century in view of the international groupings. Although we established the Arab League over 40 years ago, we have been unable to create common interests for the Arab League. The Arab league was originally formed for the liberation of Palestine. [passage omitted] Now that the Palestinian question and the Middle East conflict are on their way to a settlement in harmony with the new world, the Arab League should not remain within the confines of the past, otherwise it would be ineffective once the Palestinian question and the Arab-Israeli conflict are resolved. The Arab League would be ineffective if it does not develop. ['Abd-al-Ghani] You have agreed to lift the indirect boycott of Israel at some levels. Have you in Oman actually begun abolishing the the second and third degree boycott measures? Do you believe that interests should replace pan-Arab links in the region and that your relations with Israel, for instance, should be on an equal level with your relations with the Arab states if the interests were the same? [Bin-'Abdallah] First of all, interests should be the basis of relations between states, even between the Arab states, because common interests are the basis of the links between them. Second, the issue of the second- and third-level boycott has no direct connection with Israel. These were measures taken by the Arab states to underscore their dissatisfaction with the way other states treated Israel. But the situation now is quite different. The Western states, the United States, and the industrial states in general have now passed legislation forbidding all industrial and commercial establishments from responding to the second and third Arab boycott levels. That means that if we maintain the second and third boycott levels against foreign companies which deal with Israel, we would be halting the wheel of development in our own countries. That would be highly detrimental to our countries. We are developing countries whose industrial progress depends primarily on the machines, equipment, and expertise we import from the major industrial states. So we have had to respond to the legislations introduced in these states. ['Abd-al-Ghani] Oman's position on the situation in the Gulf region is known, particularly the need to reconsider the position on Iraq. How do you now view Iraq's chances of getting approval for a gradual lifting of the sanctions imposed on it, particularly as it has complied with most UN resolutions and renounced its claims to Kuwait? [Bin-'Abdallah] The lifting of the sanctions against Iraq falls within the jurisdiction of the Security Council and we know that the power there is in the hands of the permanent members. Lifting the sanctions requires a Security Council resolution. It is quite clear that the members are not prepared to lift the sanctions in one go before Iraq fully complies with all the resolutions and conditions of the Council. [passage omitted] It is true that Iraq has indicated in one way or another recently that it no longer considers Kuwait to be a part of Iraq, but is that enough, politically? It may be important to understand that such statements are perhaps seen as politically insufficient to end the existing differences between the GCC states and Iraq. We believe that Iraq should do more. We do not wish to get into an argument as to which comes first, the cart or the horse. Kuwait is an independent sovereign state with internationally recognized borders confirmed by the Security Council. These matters are not open to discussion or argument and cannot be questioned or reconsidered. Iraq should realize that its protection from the various dangers which they call "foreign plots" would depend on Arab support for Iraq. Such support appears to be nonexistent at present. Iraq should fully reconsider its Arab policies and its concept of inter-Arab relations. If it does that and if it commits itself to new policies toward the Gulf states and the other Arab states, Iraq would then be able to feel that the Arab states could provide it with the cover that might help it avert the so-called foreign plots. [passage omitted] ['Abd-al-Ghani] Some people believe that the Arab states have not done enough to prevent what appears to be "international tampering" with Iraq's unity. Do you in Oman have any worries regarding the Kurdish government in northern Iraq? Have you received or met with any Iraqi opposition delegations? [Bin-'Abdallah] The first responsibility falls on the shoulders of Iraq and not the Arab states. That is why we say: If Iraq reassesses its Arab relations and policies in a manner that would make the Arabs trust these policies and not see them as just tactics, we believe that the Arab states would then become an element of strength in that respect. As regards the Kurdish issue, it is full of complications, and views on it differ. True, if northern Iraq is separate from the country, the matter would not stop there, it would continue, particularly as there are various minorities in the region, but nobody would feel happy about anything of that kind. Iraq's current circumstances, however, mean such matters are to be expected. If it did occur, it would not occur easily and would lead to new tragedies. We in the GCC have, in every session, declared that we are against any violation of Iraq's unity and territorial integrity. That is a firm principle. As regards the Iraqi opposition, the firm principle in the general policy of the Sultanate of Oman is that we do not interfere in the internal affairs of others even if we disagree with them. [passage omitted] ['Abd-al-Ghani] There has been no improvement in Iranian-Gulf relations. That expectation for which you in Oman made great efforts, has not materialized. In fact, there may have been a deterioration since the islands crisis with the United Arab Emirates [UAE]. [Bin-'Abdallah] The GCC states and Iran always express a genuine desire to develop bilateral relations to levels that would be in their mutual interests. That is the constant policy. As regards differences between GCC states and Iran, that is normal. Differences do occur between neighboring states. What is important is the ability to prevent it from reaching the point of explosion. On all the disputed issues between the GCC states and Iran, there is a desire to settle them by peaceful means and at bilateral levels. So, there is no deterioration, but the agreement that every state should tackle its issues with Iran bilaterally perhaps gives the impression that there is no collective action. ['Abd-al-Ghani] Do Oman's decision to withdraw its members from the military committee in Yemen and your statement after the Salalah meeting between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid mean that the Sultanate is washing its hands of the attempts to resolve the Yemeni crisis? Will you support the Egyptian-UAE initiative? [Bin-'Abdallah] It is not true that Oman has washed its hands of helping to resolve the Yemeni crisis. We have never said that. It was a press allegation. We ended our work in the military committee because that work was completed. That is a Yemeni committee which continues to exist but the work left for it to do is up to the Yemeni side. There is no longer a need for the presence of Oman and Jordanian officers. [passage omitted] We would support any Arab efforts by the brothers in Egypt, Oman, or any other country. What is important to us is that Yemen should remain united and stable. [passage omitted]
