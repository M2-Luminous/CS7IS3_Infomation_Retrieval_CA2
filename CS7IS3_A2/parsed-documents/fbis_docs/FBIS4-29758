Among factors behind the central bank's views were strong investment in the housing and public sectors, bottoming out of industrial production and steady progress in inventory adjustment, as well as recovering personal consumption, the report said. The report, however, noted corporate capital spending continues to decline in the manufacturing sector as a whole, while that in the nonmanufacturing sector remains stagnant. In the labor market, growth in the number of employees continues to slow due to limited recruitment of new graduates, though the ratio of job offers to job applicants has stopped decreasing, the report said. As to the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the January-March quarter, just released by the Economic Planning Agency, Kagehide Kaku, research and statistics director at the central bank, told reporters the figures are within expectations and in line with the bank's judgments. Asked about the possible impact of the yen's recent strengthening against the dollar on a burgeoning economic recovery, Kaku only said, "we are paying significant attention" to the yen's appreciation. In this regard, Kaku reiterated the bank's view that the economy seems to have taken one step forward toward recovery, but ups and downs are expected amid remaining risks such as the yen's resurgence.
