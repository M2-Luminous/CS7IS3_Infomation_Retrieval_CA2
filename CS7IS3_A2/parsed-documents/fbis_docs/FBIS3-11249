He was referring to Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa, Escuintla, and San Lucas Toliman municipalities, Solola Department, whose residents seek the withdrawal of security forces. Upon returning from a three-day trip to Mexico, De Leon Carpio attributed the residents' dissatisfaction with the authorities to several causes, including social corruption, and the fact that justice is not properly managed. The president explained that many of the irregularities that delay law enforcement will be corrected when the new Penal Code goes into effect, but he emphasized that the problem lies not only in the laws but in the human element as well. We have training programs for law enforcement personnel which will guarantee a change in the current situation, but there are other elements outside justice management that prevent the normal governing of the country. The people's discontent in those areas where the security forces have been asked to withdraw is understandable if we consider that the citizens' attitudes are affected by other factors such as poverty, injustice, and social disorder. The president described his trip to Mexico as positive in every respect and said he worked with a full agenda for several exhausting but satisfying days to achieve the benefits obtained for our country.
