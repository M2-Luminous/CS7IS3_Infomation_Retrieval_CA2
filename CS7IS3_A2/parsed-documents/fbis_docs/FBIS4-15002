The tasks ahead are too complicated and difficult to squander the strength of society in political confrontation. There will be no victors in an irreconcilable struggle. There can only be one result of such struggle -- the destruction of Russia and suffering of millions of Russian people. There are no such problems in Russia which cannot be resolved without intensifying tension in society or resorting to violence or riding rough shod over the laws and common sense. Dialogue, consultations and negotiations, the search for meeting points and common positions and sensible compromises should become the fundamental norm of public and political life. Civic accord should be reached on the basis of respect for various world views, political convictions, national and cultural traditions, and the dignity of the individual. In order to reach civic accord the president of the Russian Federation, the Federal Assembly, the goverment, the constituent parts of the Russian Federation, political parties, trade unions and other public organizations conclude this agreement. I. Political Life in Society 1. In their activities the sides pledge to adhere strictly to the principles of democracy, civic society, federalism, law-governed state, the separation of powers and the priority of human rights and liberties. The sides view the Russian Federation Constitution in force as the foundation of Russia's legal system and statehood. Emphasizing the necessity to observe the constitution, the sides will make use of the multilateral conciliation procedures to study and disseminate the experience of its application and to coordinate the elaboration of constitutional amendments. In order to ensure civic accord the sides pledge to refrain from introducing into the Constitution such amendments as would destabilize the situation in society. 2. The sides regard as the foremost task a joint elaboration of electoral laws, the law on parties and the law on referendum. The sides take upon themselves the obligation not to initiate political campaigns in order to carry out early elections of federal bodies of power not provided for in the Constitution currently in force. 3. In all their activities, including political activities, the sides pledge to renounce violence in all its forms as a means of resolving problems that emerge in society. The sides pledge not to appeal for violence, nor to kindle social, national or religious strife, nor to suppress or oppress those of dissenting views nor to incite citizens to it. Those who organize rallies, demonstrations or strikes assume responsibility for a peaceful nature of these events and for staging them in strict compliance with the laws. The sides regard it as their duty to prompt all forces in society to get involved in the process of ensuring there is calm in the country and that a spirit of cooperation is created. 4. The sides pledge to refuse to use the mass media in an uncivilised or an incorrect manner in order to further their political interests. 5. With due consideration for the grandeur of Russian history, its heroic and tragic pages, the contribution of the generations of our citizens who gave their strengths to serving the Fatherland, the sides will avoid offensive assessments of the past and mud slinging. The sides appeal not to use assessments of the events in August 1991 and in September and October 1993 as reasons to deepen confrontation and opposition. II. Regional policy 1. The sides regard it as necessary immediately to take measures to: - Strengthen the unity of Russia's economic, political and legal space; - coordinate the activities of regional authorities in the solution of tasks which go beyond the remit of individual regions; - establish a single labor market on the basis of an unswerving observance of the code of labor laws, conventions and recommendations of the International Labor Organization throughout the country; - to compensate the regions from the budget for the consequences of the decisions by the federal state bodies in such cases when regional interests have been made to suffer in the process of pursuing statewide interests. 2. the sides agree that it is necessary to adopt the following federal laws: - On the general principles of organizing representative and executive power in the components of the federation; - on the principles of the demarcation of powers and areas of authority between the federal level and the components of the federation; - on the principles of local self-government. 3. The parties recognize the need to widen the economic independence of the components of the federation by means of strengthening the taxation base of their budgets and federal guarantees of the per-capita minimum of the region's budget through the federal subsidy fund. At the same time the responsibility of the power bodies of the components of the federation for collecting federal taxes on their territories is being enhanced. 4. The parties emphasize that implementation of the rights of the components of the federation is possible only if the country's state integrity and its political, economic and legal unity are guaranteed. To this end the components of the federation agree to refrain from altering their constitutional status in the course of two years. The constitutions, charters and other legislative acts of the subjects of the federation will be drawn up in accordance with -- and elaborated anew in strict accordance with -- the federal Constitution. The federal and regional power bodies declare a moratorium on the signing of bilateral treaties between them on the demarcation of areas of authority and powers until the adoption of a federal law on the principles of the demarcation of powers and areas of authority between the federal and regional bodies of state power. 5. The parties emphasize that, with the objective of strengthening local self-government, a package of federal laws should be elaborated and adopted in the first half-year, envisaging as follows: - The general principles of the organization and functioning of bodies of local self-government; - the guarantees of the independence of local self-government bodies in solving local issues; - the provision by local self-government of an independent taxation base and the right to establish the normatives of payments into their own budget, with guarantees of a budget minimum on the part of the state; - the rights of local self-government bodies to participate in solving problems common to the regions and to Russia as a whole. III. Ethnic Policy 1. The sides pledge that they will abide strictly by the principle whereby the source of power in component parts of the federation is their multi-ethnic population; representatives of no ethnic community have the exclusive right to assume control over the territory, institutes of power or resources. 2. The sides will support various specific forms of self-organization in the ethnic communities, excluding those which are destructive to state unity and territorial integrity of the Russian Federation. The sides think that national associations [natsionalnyye assotsiatsii], unions [ob'yedineniya], fellowships [zemlyachestva] and other types of national-cultural unions are in need of a special state support scheme. 3. The sides stress that the carrying out of social and economic changes in the areas inhibited by small peoples and ethnic groups should be accompanied by a complex of measures aimed at retaining their traditional lifestyle. 4. The sides think that it is necessary to reinforce state and public supervision of the observance of human rights as far as nationalities' matters are concerned, not to allow and to avert any manifestations of ethnic, racial or religious discrimination. 5. The sides call upon national movements and parties to declare a moratorium on demanding border changes and the established administrative and territorial division. 6. The sides acknowledge their obligation to protect actively the rights and interests of Russians living in other states, and to receive and make provision for compatriots resettling in Russia, providing them with all-round support. IV. Socioeconomic Policy The sides agree that their joint efforts should be directed toward overcoming the socioeconomic crisis and continuation of the economic reform in the interests of Russia's population. In order to stabilize the socioeconomic situation in 1994 the following urgent problems must be solved: - Achieving a steady, predictable and controllable level of inflation; - overcoming the nonpayments crisis; - ensuring the necessary level of social protection, the efficiency and precise targeting of social aid; - stopping the general decline of production levels before the year ends; - starting the positive structural transformations and increasing investment activity; - strengthening economic cooperation within the CIS framework; - strengthening the country's position in the world market. The sides believe that a standing economic conference should be set up in order to elaborate the agreed proposals in the sphere of economic policy for the period this agreement remains in force. Those attending it should be representatives of the president, the government, the Central Bank of Russia, the Federation Council, the State Duma, the main professional associations of the working people and the associations of manufacturers and entrepreneurs. Over the next two months the economic conference is to prepare specific proposals on current problems in economic policy, which will be submitted to the president and the Federation Council. For the duration of the economic stabilization measures: 1. The trade unions, their associations and organizations of their members undertake not to carry out and not to take part in organizing strikes for the purpose of redistributing budget finances or allocating subsidies or benefits from state credits or taxation to individual industries or territories, or for other purposes having nothing directly to do with wages, working conditions or saving jobs. 2. Associations of manufacturers and entrepreneurs and their members undertake to refrain from unjustified stoppages of activities and production, the breaking of commitments to suppliers and customers, to the budget and banks, and the misuse of state investment resources. 3. Organs of state power, associations of manufacturers and entrepreneurs and their members undertake to attend conciliation procedures for the settlement of labor disputes, to provide the trade unions with sufficient information about the state of the relevant budgets and the position of enterprises, and to ensure that the trade unions have the organizational back-up for their statutory activities. V. The Security of Citizens and the State 1.

The parties pledge to prevent: - The irreversible technological lagging behind and isolation of the country's economy from the world economy; - the social regression and disintegration of society and the destruction of the environment; - the reduction in defense capability and the weakening of the social protection of military servicemen, persons discharged to the reserve and members of their families. 3. The parties oppose the creation of any kind of armed and militarized formations by political parties and movements and public and commercial organizations, and should they be so created to call for their immediate disbandment. 4.

Spiritual, Moral, Ethical and Cultural Values The sides emphasise that the love for the Fatherland, freedom and the moral duty to the country and society, religious and humanistic values and creative work should become the basis for the resurrection of Russia. To reassert these values tirelessly is a matter not just for every member of society, but for the state. The sides pledge: 1. To restore and propagate Russia's ancient spiritual and moral traditions, to assert by words and deeds the norms of moral conduct in politics, the economy and social life.

In subsidizing these establishments, preference is to be given to structures which implement priority state programs and which do not have alternative sources of financing that would ensure the survival of these structures. 5.
