The daily DIENA cites the opinion expressed on the matter by Aleksandrs Kirsteins, head of the parliamentarian Foreign Committee, who claims that there were numerous discrepancies between the documents which have been initialled by the two delegations, and the draft agreements which earlier have been presented for a closer examination of members of parliament. The rights to be granted to the retired Russian militaries under the agreements Kirsteins described as "anticonstitutional". He indicated that initialing of the package of the agreements was partly a result of pressure inflicted on Russia by the United States and the Conference on Security and Cooperation (CSCE), while the government of the ruling parliamentarian faction "Latvijas Cels" ("Latvian Way") "automatically puts its signature under all the demands put forward by Russia". The leader of the nationalist "Latvia's National Independence Movement" faction holds the view that those at least 70 thousand officers of the KGB secret police and commissioned officers of Russian Army which have come to Latvia en masse, notably in the past recent years after combat actions in so called "hot spots", are much more dangerous for Latvia than those several thousand Russian troops. Kirsteins underscores that the two parties have not reached any agreement which would provide for the future development of relations between Russia and Latvia for the next 20 years. The Latvian negotiators did not even raise the issue about Russia's recognizing occupation of Latvia, which had already been done in 1991 by the then Supreme Council of the former Soviet Union. Kirsteins pointed out that the lack of agreements to this effect showed there were no basis laid out for guarantees providing a compensation to be paid for Latvia's property and for the Abrene region annexed by Russia. Meanwhile, Latvian Justice Minister Egils Levits said that the accord with Russia was "an important achievement of Latvian diplomats". The minister said he was certain that historians would evaluate the agreement as a successful move, citing the course of events with the pact of Latvia and Russia signed in 1920. The package of initialled agreements between Russia and Latvia were needed by Latvian President in order to receive an entrance ticket to the St. George hall of the Kremlin, indicates an analyst with the Russian-language newspaper SM-SEGODNYA. The daily says that it was a high time for Latvian President to visit his Russian counterpart, otherwise his image of the popular figure and reconcilator can somewhat fade out, despite the urgent need for the liberals of the "Latvian Way" party to demonstrate clearly to the West, notably to the American friends, their good will towards normalization of relations with Russia. The evening daily RIGAS BALSS has published a public opinion poll conducted among 1,000 residents of Latvia. The participants of the poll had to chose optional answers to the question whether performance of Saeima or parliament and that of the ministers cabinet of Latvia were in accordance with interests of the Latvian people. The option "fully corresponds" was chosen by 1.3 percent of people in relation to the parliament, and by 1.2 percent - in regard to the ministers cabinet. 15.2 percent of people said that activities of both parliament and government were "generally corresponding" to the interests of the Latvian people.
