Korean Workers' Struggle Cannot Be Checked" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 1 (KCNA) -- The South Korean workers will surely have their just demand met by more staunchly struggling to frustrate the crafty tricks of the Kim Yong-sam group and win democratic freedom and vital rights, stresses a NODONG SINMUN commentary today. The analyst says: Recently, trade unions of big businesses in South Korea including the Hyundai Heavy Industries and the Daewoo Shipbuilding on Koje Island declared that they would start a full-dressed struggle in June demanding wage hike, the reinstatement of expelled workers and the participation of trade unions in management. It is fully justifiable because it reflects their strong will and resolution to win vital rights and democracy without fail. South Korean workers are now subjected to medieval toil for 13-16 hours a day to be paid low wages far below the minimum living cost. The analyst further says: When he came to power, the traitor Kim Yong-sam committed himself to build "a society where people who sweat are well off." But he has driven them to the bottom of destitution by freezing their wages with the doctrine of "sharing sufferings." The Kim Yong-sam group is urging the workers to obey the demand of the businesses, blaring that this year will be made "the first year without labour-capital dispute" and "labour-capital cooperation" is necessary to win the competition. The massive struggle declared by the South Korean workers again, however, clearly indicates that any threat and crafty trick can never break their will to win their vital rights and democracy through struggle.
