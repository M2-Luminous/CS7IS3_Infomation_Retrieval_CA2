FR940217-1-00124 FR940217-1-00015 Regulation 26 requires that plans be prepared according to the guidelines developed by IMO and written in the working language of the ship's master and officers. Plans must consist at least of_ (1) The procedure to be followed by the master or other persons having charge of the ship to report an oil pollution incident, as required in article 8 and Protocol I of MARPOL 73/78; (2) The list of authorities or persons to be contacted in the event of an oil pollution incident; (3) A detailed description of the actions to be taken immediately by persons on board to reduce or control the discharge of oil following the incident; and (4) The procedures and point of contact on the ship for coordinating shipboard activities with national and local authorities in responding to the pollution. The Regulation 26 guidelines expand on the four mandatory provisions of Regulation 26, and also address the following non-mandatory provisions: Plans and diagrams, ship-carried response equipment, public affairs, recordkeeping, plan review, and plan testing. Definitions The proposed regulations would be inserted in part 151 of title 33 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which implements other provisions of MARPOL 73/78. Most of the terms used in the proposal are currently defined in 33 CFR 151.05. Some of the more important definitions are repeated here as an aid to understanding this proposal. Ship means a vessel of any type whatsoever, operating in the marine environment. This includes hydrofoils, air-cushion vehicles, submersibles, floating craft whether self-propelled or not, and fixed or floating drilling rigs and other platforms. Oceangoing ship means a ship that_ (1) Is operated under the authority of the United States and engages in international voyages; (2) Is operated under the authority of the United States and is certificated for ocean service; (3) Is operated under the authority of the United States and is certificated for coastwise service beyond 3 miles from land; (4) Is operated under the authority of the United States and operates at any time seaward of the outermost boundary of the territorial sea of the United States as defined in 33 CFR 2.05; or (5) Is operated under the authority of a country other than the United States. The term ``oceangoing'' ship is used to apply MARPOL 73/78 requirements in 33 CFR parts 151 and 155, while the term ``seagoing'' ship is used in 33 CFR part 157. Both terms have been used to implement the Act, which applies Annexes I and II of MARPOL 73/78 only to ``seagoing'' vessels in 33 U.S.C. 1903. For the purposes of this proposed regulation, the two terms are synonymous.
