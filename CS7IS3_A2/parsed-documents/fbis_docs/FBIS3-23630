They will probably tell you how they fled from lectures on protection from a "sudden nuclear, chemical, or bacteriological attack by the probably enemy." The attitude toward civil defense, formed on the basis of "brilliant" training films and busy practical classes was, and in some places still is, one-sided. Incidentally, there would be nothing surprising in this if they still practiced that extremely simplistic, even dilettantish approach to the perception of everything that was included in the concept of "civil defense." Today, possibly, such a phrase might seem somewhat pretentious to some. Others might even doubt the very fact of the existence of civil defense in Ukraine. Both types should recall that 3 February 1993 marked the adoption of the Law "On Civil Defense of Ukraine," which says that "citizens of Ukraine have the right to protection of their life and health from the consequences of accidents, catastrophes, large fires, and natural disasters and to demand of the Government of Ukraine and other organs of state executive power and the administrations of enterprises, institutions, and organizations, regardless of their forms of ownership and management, a guarantee that it will be enforced. "The state, as the guarantor of this right, creates a civil defense system whose objective is to protect the population from dangerous consequences of accidents and catastrophes of a technogenic, ecological, natural, and military nature." During Cold War times some of the most zealous military analysts of the West tried to include USSR civil defense forces with the full-fledged infantry troops. They used this as an argument for letting the appetites of their military department grow. Still, it was impossible not to advertise the semantic difference between the words "defense" and "protection" (contributing to defense, which, undoubtedly, expresses more precisely the character of the tasks performed by civil defense). According to the law in our country, "civil defense forces are troops and specialized and nonspecialized formations. Civil defense troops are under the jurisdiction of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Their direct leadership is provided by the chief of staff of civil defense of Ukraine." This is Lieutenant General Viktor Grechaninov. The civil defense of Ukraine and its troops are still very young--they are not even a year old. Nonetheless their "combat path" began considerably before the official date of the adoption of the law. The stages of this path were Chernobyl and work in the "off-limits zone," the rendering of aid to the population of western rayons of Ukraine which ended up in the flooded zone, participation in putting out the forest fires in the Crimea where, largely thanks to the efficient interaction between civil defense forces and local formations organized by the State Commission on Emergencies (it included the first deputy chief of staff of civil defense of Ukraine, Major General Nikolay Kapustyan), areas where fire broke out were localized and considerable areas of forest were saved. There was work for radioactive decontamination of areas in the city of Korostena and constant excursions for mine clearing. Finally, the last example: Work in the flooded areas of Transcarpathia. All this was done by civil defense forces... But nonetheless, its formations are still "unknown forces" to many of us. A bright burst and the thunder of an explosion--an accident at a chemical enterprise. It is located on the edge of the city, which is living its ordinary life and not suspecting that the countdown to a possible tragedy had already begun. Major Vladimir Mukhanov's first emergency-rescue battalion with its attached subdivisions (a fire-fighting company, an excavator company, and a chemical protection company) arrived in the region of the accident. The task was to reconnoiter the site, to rescue and evacuate the wounded, and to localize individual outbreaks of fire. Since the source of the explosions was a container of prussic acid, the military servicemen of Captain Grigoriy Khablov's rescue company, the firemen of Captain Grigoriy Piven's fire-fighting company, and the military servicemen of other specialties work with individual means of protection. Evacuation of the wounded was organized immediately. The firemen of Sergeant Nikolay Prisyazhnyuk's compression section, Privates A. Kramaranko and I. Pogrebnyak and Junior Sergeant E. Gavich, had to put out the fires and remove obstructions in order literally to beat their way through to the victims. According to information from the enterprise's chief engineer, a work shift consisting of three people was in one of the shops. The entrance was blocked. Emergency evacuation was necessary. And the jack hammers of the compressor team were again put to work. Within 20 minutes they had drilled through a concrete structure about 40 centimeters wide and the workers were released from their captivity. The troops operate smoothly and efficiently. Excavators and other specialized equipment are used. The rescue workers carefully inspect the premises of the shops and conduct searches for workers who may have fallen under the rubble. The victims are given first aid and quickly evacuated out of the danger zone... This time it was a demonstration class in the organization and actions of emergency-rescue battalions at the facilities, which was conducted at the final training sessions for commanders of civil defense units. But if, God forbid, all this had really happened, it would be they--the men of the "unknown forces"--who would be first to enter into hand-to-hand combat with danger. As for the officers, warrant officers, and enlisted men of the first emergency-rescue battalion, they have to their personal credit participation in the search and rescue work after last year's well-known disaster with the Ruslan aircraft. For three months this year the troops worked to decontaminate areas around the city of Korosten. When there was an accident with the Kiev purification installations they conducted the decontamination--they removed the coastal earth to a depth of 40 centimeters, loaded it into containers, and transported it to the place designated for it. They worked quickly, knowing what an important task had been assigned to them. Is there any need to mention that they performed the hardest ecological work on the Lybed River, on an area of three or four kilometers? Overall, in Kiev alone there are 47 potentially dangerous facilities that have been "assigned" to civil defense forces. They are prepared at any time of the day, under any weather conditions, to come to our aid and spare us from disaster. And problems--civil defense forces have them too. They have inadequate means of small-scale mechanization and sometimes a very serious shortage. They do not even have enough rack jacks. Even though in Donetsk there is an enterprise which produces very good pneumatic equipment--convenient, practical, and small, which could lift concrete slabs weighing up to three tonnes. This is something that is needed. But, alas, they are expensive and there is no money. Just as is the acquisition of new instruments for chemical reconnaissance. So they use what they have, or what they have so far. Some are also manufacturing their own. And they do not complain about life. Even though theirs is not very sweet. Most of the officers of civil defense units do not have housing either; they take care of their families as well as their financial capabilities will allow. Here in the first emergency-rescue battalion, half of the 14 officers and warrant officers do not have apartments. It would seem that formations directly under the Cabinet of Ministers should not have to go begging. Alas, local authorities at all levels are rather stingy in dealing with their civil defense. But if there is ever any natural disaster or large emergency--the State Committee on Emergency Situations convenes, possibly headed by a deputy prime minister (the main person in charge of civil defense) right in the situation room (the President of the United States in the White House is not the only one to have such a thing, there is also one in the headquarters of the civil defense of Ukraine), in order to make important and crucial decisions. And there they receive exhaustive clear information about emergency situations. Incidentally, this room is an object of legitimate pride. And especially for Grigoriy Dovbysh--the chief of the department for the automated control system of the staff of the civil defense of Ukraine. It is equipped with computers, and their memory contains, for example, a program of the five main prognosticatory-modeling systems for emergency situations. They include Proton (nuclear power plant accident), Zaryad (for chemical facilities), Vulkan (earthquakes and their consequences), Kaskad (catastrophic floods), and Buran (nuclear strikes). All these names were given not to frighten people but as a confirmation of how serious and crucial is the work entrusted to civil defense. They are the first to be sent to the most dangerous places--to clean up after accidents, catastrophes, and natural disasters. And they are frequently forgotten when the time comes to solve their problems--even the most immediate ones.
