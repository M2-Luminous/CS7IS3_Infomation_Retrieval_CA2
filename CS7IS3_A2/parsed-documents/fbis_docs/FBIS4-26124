Some of these countries have expressed the hope that they be included in an expanded North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which links the U.S., Canada and Mexico. With fast-track authority, sought by the administration when negotiating NAFTA and the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade, the trade agreement negotiated by the administration allows no congressional amendment. Sources said bilateral negotiations between the U.S. and Chile on the latter's joining of NAFTA will begin later this year. Chile reportedly hoped the agreement can be concluded by early 1995.
