To develop forestry, China has enacted and carried out a series policies, laws, regulations, and measures, which enable China's forestry construction to embark on a course of steady development. On World Environment Day, this correspondent interviewed Forestry Minister Xu Youfang to hear his views on environmental protection and development. Every year for more than a decade, leaders of the central government, in their capacity as ordinary citizens, have taken the lead to participate in afforestation activities, and their acts have set a good example for people throughout the country. The joint efforts of people throughout the country have brought about great and historic changes in the construction of China's forest industry, and great achievements have been made in afforestation and forest protection. Since 1981, a total of 3.4 billion people have taken part in tree-planting activities on various occasions and 18 billion trees have been planted. Over the past few years, some 80 million mu of land have been afforested each year. By now, three provinces -- Guangdong, Fujian, and Hunan -- have afforested all barren land that can be planted with trees, and they have been commended by the party Central Committee and the State Council. This year, some other provinces will accomplish the task, too. Major achievements have been made in the construction of a 100-million-mu base of fast-growing timber, the "three norths" (north China, northeast China, and northwest China) shelterbelt networks, the shelterbelt networks in the middle and upper reaches of the Chang Jiang, the coastal shelterbelt networks, the farmland shelterbelt networks on the plains, the Taihang Shan afforestation project, and the national desert control project, all of which form the basic framework of China's ecological improvement efforts. While the scale of afforestation is expanding continuously, close attention also has been given to raising its quality. The verified total acreage of man-made forests that are up to the state requirements has reached 285 million mu, and the yield has gone up from 65.6 percent in 1988 to 84.5 percent in 1992. The consumption of forest resources also has been brought under effective control. According to the second national survey of forest resources (1977-81), the annual average consumption of forest resources was 294 million cubic meters, while annual average growth was 275 million cubic meters, with an annual average deficit of 18.75 million cubic meters. In the third national survey of forest resources (1984-88), annual average consumption was 344 million cubic meters and annual average growth was 366 million cubic meters. By the time of the fourth national survey (1989-93), annual average consumption was down to 320 million cubic meters, while annual average growth went up to 400 million cubic meters. These figures show that China's forest resources are increasing steadily. In a situation in which forest resources in the world as a whole are on the decrease, the increase in China's forest resources can be considered an important contribution China has made to the development of forestry and the protection of the world's natural environment. China, however, still faces an arduous task in building up its forest industry. On the one hand, it is still a country with a shortage of forests. Its percentage of forest coverage is 13.92 percent, lower than the world average, and its per capita average of forests is even lower. There are still large tracts of mountains and wasteland which need to be afforested, and large areas of desert and land threatened by desert which need to be improved. On the other hand, owing to the insufficient forest coverage, the problem of the natural environment remains serious. Taking the country as a whole, half of the population, one-third of the cultivated land, and one-third of the major cities are situated below the flood-warning line of rivers, and areas that generate two-thirds of the country's total industrial and agricultural output value are threatened by floods. According to statistics, there is an average of about 500 million mu of farmland under the constant menace of natural disaster, of which that caused by drought accounts for 61 percent; that by flooding, 24 percent; that by hailstorms, 9 percent; and that by frost, 6 percent. In addition, there are the calamities of dry and hot winds and low temperatures. To effect a fundamental change in this situation, the most important thing is to further sharpen the whole society's sense of ecology and a better environment, make great efforts to develop the forest industry, continuously expand the green canopy, and bring into full play the role of forests as an ecological shelterbelt with their multiple functions. Minister Xu pointed out: In the world today, the cry for the development of forestry is growing louder and louder, and China's modernization drive has imposed higher and higher demands on the forest industry. As a major task and the chief content of environmental construction, forestry must make its contribution not only to the improvement of the natural environment, but also -- in conjunction with the readjustment of the industrial setup in the countryside and the local economy -- to improving the livelihood of people in mountainous areas, to improving the investment environment in the drive to open up to the outside world, and to promoting spiritual civilization. China will adhere to its own road for the development of the forest industry, and taking as its objective the development of highly efficient and sustained forestry that provides greater and better yields and focusing closely on the two major tasks of reform and development, will comprehensively accomplish the goal for the development of forestry in the 1990s -- that is, to fulfill the predetermined national afforestation tasks one or two years before the turn of this century. By 1995, 13 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) will basically accomplish the task of afforesting all their barren mountains where trees can be planted, and by 2000, the number of provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) will reach 21, and the percentage of forest coverage in the country will be raised to around 15.3 percent. By then, the total output value of the forest industry will increase from the current 140 billion yuan to 304 billion yuan.
