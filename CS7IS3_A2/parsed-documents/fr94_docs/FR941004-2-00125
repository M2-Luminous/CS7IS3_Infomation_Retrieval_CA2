FR941004-2-00125 FR941004-2-00073 Drug Enforcement Administration [Docket No. 92&hyph;42] Alra Laboratories, Inc., Denial of Application for Registration On March 4, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), directed an Order to Show Cause to Alra Laboratories, Inc. (Respondent), proposing to deny its application for registration as a manufacturer of controlled substances, on grounds that: (1) during an on-site inspection in July 1990 DEA investigators determined that although it was not registered to do so, Respondent continued to distribute and possess controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and 843(a)(2), had failed to comply with inventory and recordkeeping requirements regarding these controlled substances, and had improperly stored controlled substances together with non-controlled drugs and other materials; (2) in April 1987 Respondent was cited for failure to file periodic ARCOS reports for 1985, 1986, and the first quarter of 1987; (3) as the result of a November 1987 inspection, Respondent was issued a Letter of Admonition citing its failure to file ARCOS reports as required by 21 U.S.C. 827(d) and 21 CFR 1304.35, an accurate biennial inventory in violation of 21 U.S.C. 827(a) and 21 CFR 1304.11, and its failure to maintain effective controls against the diversion of controlled substances as required by 21 CFR 1301.71; (4) in 1986, 1988, and 1989 Respondent did not timely renew its registration; and (5) Respondent has a history of violating Food and Drug Administration [FDA] requirements pertaining to recordkeeping, documentation and good manufacturing practices. Respondent, by counsel, filed a request for hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause, and the matter was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held in Chicago, Illinois, on August 18 and 19, 1992. On July 30, 1993, in her opinion and recommended ruling, findings of fact, conclusions of law and decision, the administrative law judge recommended that Respondent's application for registration be granted, contingent upon a satisfactory pre-registration investigation and upon Respondent arranging at its own expense for annual independent audits of its controlled substance handling for a period of five years after registration is granted. No exceptions were filed by either party, and on August 30, 1993, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Administrator. On October 13, 1993, the DEA Chief Counsel filed a request for remand with the Administrator, and on October 27, 1993, then-Administrator Robert C. Bonner remanded the case to the administrative law judge for further proceedings, noting that an indictment had been filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that Respondent's owner had violated the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C) with respect to the manufacture and distribution of prescription drugs. On November 3, 1993, the administrative law judge rescinded her July 30, 1993 decision, reopened the record, and directed the parties to submit statements specifying the additional evidence that they wished to produce. A hearing on remand was scheduled, but canceled after the Government advised that it had no further evidence other than the indictment itself. Respondent submitted additional documents and both parties submitted argument on remand. On May 12, 1994, Judge Bittner issued her supplemental opinion and recommended ruling, findings of fact, conclusions of law and decision, in which she found that the Government had shown probable cause that Respondent's owners had committed the acts alleged, but that the Government had failed to show the criminal conduct alleged by a preponderance of the evidence. Accordingly, Judge Bittner found that there was no basis to modify her previous conclusions set forth in her July 1993 decision, and therefore she reissued that decision. No exceptions were filed by either party. On June 17, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the entire reord, including her original and supplemental opinions, to the Deputy Administrator. The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, hereby issues his final order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth.
