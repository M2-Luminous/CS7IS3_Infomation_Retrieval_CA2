The city, situated on the middle reaches of the Chang Jiang, is divided into three parts -- Hankou (the business center), Wuchang, (the political and educational center) and Hanyang -- by the river and its tributary, the Hanshui River. When the spring flood arrived this year local officials led workers in different groups to check the 286.2 km of embankments along the Chang Jiang and removed a dozen hidden perils. By early June different localities had already invested 300,000 yuan to buy gunny sacks and straw bags, and prepared more than 650 tons of petrol, diesel oil, and rolled steel. In addition, they mobilized some 50,000 people to fight possible big floods. Major floods on the Chang Jiang usually occur in late July and early August. While summing up past experiences in fighting floods and improving some of the rules concerning flood control, this year the city started to assign local officials to participate in concrete flood fighting work to different sections of the embankments, with clear tasks and targets. In addition, areas and institutions which exercise jurisdiction over some sections of embankments are also given concrete tasks in the case of severe floods.
