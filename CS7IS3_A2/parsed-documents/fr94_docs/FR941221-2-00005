FR941221-2-00005 FR941221-2-00003 Nolin Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation; Finding of No Significant Impact AGENCY: Rural Utilities Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice of Finding of No Significant Impact. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the Rural Utilities Service (RUS), has made a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) with respect to the potential environmental impact resulting from a proposal by Nolin Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation (Nolin RECC), to construct a new headquarters facility in Hardin County, Kentucky. The FONSI is based on the Borrower's Environmental Report (BER) prepared for Nolin RECC by Gilpin Group Environmental Consulting and Planning. RUS conducted an independent evaluation of the report and concurs with its scope and content. In accordance with Environmental Policies and Procedures, published by the Rural Electrification Administration, the predecessor of RUS, at 7 CFR 1794.61, RUS has adopted the Nolin RECC's BER as the Environmental Assessment (EA) for the project. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lawrence R. Wolfe, Chief, Environmental Compliance Branch, Electric Staff Division, room 1246, South Agriculture Building, Rural Utilities Service, Washington, DC 20250&hyph;1500, telephone (202) 720&hyph;1784. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposed project will utilize approximately 15 acres of a 40 acre site and will include the following facilities: a 36,500 square foot one story administrative office building, an attached 18,000 square foot warehouse building, a 1,300 square foot building for PCB testing and the storage of grounds maintenance equipment, a 37,500 square foot gravel covered pole storage yard, a fuel depot for gasoline and diesel fuel with two pumps and two above ground fuel storage tanks with a capacity of 2,000 gallons each, a radio antenna, a storm water retention pond, a small emergency standby diesel electric generating unit with a maximum capacity of 50 kilowatts, paved entrance and exit drives, and paved vehicle parking areas. Alternatives examined for the proposed project include no action, renovating the existing headquarters building, and constructing the facility at alternative sites. Based on an independent analysis of the adopted BER, RUS has concluded that the construction of the proposed project will have no significant impact on air quality, water quality, the 100-year floodplain, wetlands, existing land uses, prime and important farmland, historic properties, Federally-listed threatened and endangered species, species proposed for listing, or designated critical habitat. One archaeological site was identified during the Phase I archaeological survey conducted on Nolin RECC's preferred site. However, Nolin RECC has determined that proposed construction activities will not impact the site. In addition, the site will be flagged to insure that the archaeological site is not disturbed. No other potential significant impacts resulting from the construction and use of the proposed facilities at the preferred site have been identified. Copies of the EA and FONSI are available for review at, or can be obtained from, RUS at the address provided herein or from Nolin Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation, 612 East Dixie, Elizabethtown, Kentucky 42701&hyph;1094. Dated: December 13, 1994. Adam M. Golodner, Deputy Administrator, Program Operations. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31340 Filed 12&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am]. BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;15&hyph;P
