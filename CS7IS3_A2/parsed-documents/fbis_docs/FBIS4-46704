General Part 1. This Statute defines the procedure for state registration and reregistration of subjects of entrepreneurial activity, regardless of their organizational forms and forms of ownership, with the exception of certain types of subjects of entrepreneurship (banks, mass information media, stock exchanges, and others) for which legislative enactments of Ukraine have established special rules of state registration. 2. State registration of subjects of entrepreneurial activity is done at the executive committee of the city or urban rayon soviet of people's deputies or in the rayon or urban rayon administration of the cities of Kiev and Sevastopol at their location (place of residence). 3. The location of a subject of entrepreneurial activity which is a legal entity is considered the location (siting) of its permanent management organ (governing board, board of directors, and others). The place of residence of a citizen-entrepreneur is the permanent place of residence registered following established procedures. II. State Registration of Subjects of Entrepreneurial Activity 4. For state registration of a subject of entrepreneurial activity which is a legal entity, the owner (or owners) or the person (petitioner) authorized by him (or them) submits the following to the state registration organ: a) the charter documents: the decision of the owner of the property or the organ authorized by him to create the subject of entrepreneurial activity. If there are two or more owners or organs authorized by them, the charter agreement is this document; the charter (if this is necessary for the organizational form of the subject of entrepreneurship being created); b) the registration card; c) the document certifying payment of the registration fee. In the event a private enterprise is registered, the owner's decision is not submitted. If the owner (or one of the owners) of the subject of entrepreneurial activity is a legal entity, a notarized copy of the certificate of state registration of this legal entity is submitted in addition. A foreign legal entity submits the document certifying its registration in the country of location (an excerpt from the trade, bank, or judicial register, and others). This document must be notarized at the place it was issued, translated into the Ukrainian language, and legalized at a Ukrainian consular institution, unless otherwise envisioned by international treaties in which Ukraine takes part. This document may also be certified at the embassy of the corresponding state in Ukraine and legalized at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. In the event physical persons are the owners of the subject of entrepreneurial activity, their signatures on the charter documents must be notarized. 5. The originals of the charter documents are submitted to conduct the registration. Charter documents must not contain provisions which contradict existing legislation. The petitioner bears responsibility for the charter documents' conformance with existing legislation. 6. The charter documents are compiled in the official or other language in accordance with Article 11 of the UkSSR Law "On Languages in the Ukrainian SSR" and are signed by the petitioner, perforated, and numbered. 7. A citizen who has the intention of conducting entrepreneurial activity without creating a legal entity (the petitioner) submits the registration card and the document certifying payment of the registration fee to the state registration organ and also submits a document certifying his identity. 8. The registration card is filled out in three copies (in addition to the identification code) and signed by the petitioner. The completed registration card is at the same time the petition for state registration. The state registration organ when necessary offers the petitioner help in filling out the card. The petitioner is responsible for making sure the information on the registration card is correct. 9. The state registration organ does not have the right to demand other documents from the petitioner and documents filled out according to requirements different from those defined in this Statute or that the charter documents be reconciled with the organs of state executive power or other organs. 10. The state registration organ records the date the documents are received. When all documents indicated in points 4 and 7 of this Statute are received, within five working days the state registration organ is obliged to conduct the state registration of the subject of entrepreneurial activity and issue the petitioner a certificate as shown in the model in the appendix. 11. The number of the state registration certificate of the subject of entrepreneurial activity must correspond to the identification code by which this subject is included in the State Register of Reporting Statistical Units. The certificate of state registration is the only document which gives the subject of entrepreneurial activity the right to open current, foreign currency, and other accounts in banking institutions and to produce seals and stamps. The number of the state registration certificate of the subject of entrepreneurial activity must be shown on the seals and stamps. 12. Within 10 days from the day of state registration of the subject of entrepreneurial activity, the state registration organ is obliged to submit one copy of the registration card to the appropriate state tax inspection office and one to the state statistics organ. 13. Branches (divisions) and offices created by a subject of entrepreneurial activity do not require state registration. The subject of entrepreneurial activity informs the state registration organ of the creation of these subdivisions by inserting the corresponding information on his registration card. 14. The state registration organ keeps a record of the subjects of entrepreneurial activity starting from the date of registration or the date of appeal to the state registration organ at the new location in accordance with Point 23 of this Statute. III. Reregistration of Subjects of Entrepreneurial Activity 15. Reregistration of subjects of entrepreneurial activity is handled in the manner established for their registration. 16. Reregistration is done if the name of the subject of entrepreneurial activity is changed; if the form of ownership is changed; \ if the organizational form of the subject of entrepreneurial activity is changed. 17. In the event the owner (or owners) of the subject of entrepreneurial activity is changed, assuming this did not result in the form of ownership changing, reregistration does not take place. IV. Making Changes (or Additions) to the Charter Documents 18. Changes (or additions) to the charter documents are made official by individual appendices to it or by putting them in a new edition while complying with the requirements defined by points 4-6 of this Statute. 19. In the event changes (or additions) related to a change in the name, form of ownership, or organizational form of the subject of entrepreneurial activity are made, it is reregistered following procedures envisioned by this Statute. 20. In the event changes (or additions) which do not require reregistration of the subject of entrepreneurial activity but involve the need to make changes (or additions) to the registration card are made to the charter documents, within 10 days from the day the decision is made to make these changes (or additions), the petitioner must submit one copy, notarized following established procedures, of each of the copies of the documents in which these changes (or additions) are shown to the state registration organ and enter them on his registration card. If these changes (or additions) are significant in scope, the petitioner fills out a new registration card blank in three copies after putting his identification code by which the subject of entrepreneurial activity is included in the State Register of Reporting Statistical Units on it. Only the information on which the changes (or additions) were made is cited on the new blank. The petitioner crosses out the outdated information on the registration card filled out before and affixes his signature.

When the location (or place of residence) is changed, within 7 days of the day this change is made, the subject of entrepreneurial activity must do the following: in writing inform the state registration organ of the new location (or place of residence). Failing to fulfill this requirement within the time period indicated is grounds for the state registration organ to go to court or arbitration court and ask for cancellation of the state registration; make the corresponding changes in his registration card; submit a certificate of state registration for making these changes. 22. The state registration organ does the following: makes changes in the certificate of state registration of the subject of entrepreneurial activity in which the date the change was made and his new location (or place of residence) are indicated.
