"At the same time we have reason to believe that the North is prepared now to meet again with the South" in order to carry out the denuclearization agreement, said Lynn Davis, undersecretary of state for international security affairs, at a State Department news briefing. Davis described the development as "very good news," saying a third round of discussions between the United States and the DPRK would take place after those two steps would have been taken. The United States and the DPRK held two rounds of discussions separately in June and July last year and they also held five informal meetings last December in New York. "So the most immediate step at this point is for the North Koreans to meet with the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) and work out the details of those inspections of the seven declared sites," Davis said. In the third round of discussions, Davis claimed, "we will be seeking to bring the North Koreans into full compliance with their obligations under the Nonproliferation Treaty, including the requirement to receive inspections at the two non-declared nuclear sites." For the United States, it will "find ways to resolve once and for all our outstanding issues with respect to the nuclear policies of North Korea," Davis added.
