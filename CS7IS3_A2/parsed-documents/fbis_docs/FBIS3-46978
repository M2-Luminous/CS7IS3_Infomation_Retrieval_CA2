Deputy Home Minister Megat Junid Megat Ayob said the directive was issued by Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed, who is also Home Minister, at a meeting with officials of the ministry, immigration department and police Thursday. The freeze is also to enable the government to assess the total levy that can be collected from foreign workers, he said to reporters after closing a national seminar on education for parent-teacher associations here. However, he said, the employment of professionals could still be considered as there was a shortage in the country. He said there were now an estimated 200,000 illegal immigrants either working without work permits or roaming in the country without valid travel documents. In addition, there were foreigners being held at temporary immigration detention centres for working without valid permits. He said the police and immigration department would soon step up operations to detect illegal immigrants in estates, construction sites and factories. Those caught without any travel documents will be deported as soon as possible, he said.
