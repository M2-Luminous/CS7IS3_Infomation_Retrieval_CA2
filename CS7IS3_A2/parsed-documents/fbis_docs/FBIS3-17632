The hands of the clocks will be moved one hour forward on 27 March in the far east and the far west of the Ukraine. Earlier, the state commission for single time and standard frequency came to the conclusion that it is inexpedient and disadvantageous for the state to introduce two or three time zones in the country. At the same time, Kiev has proposed to regions to introduce their own timetable for the beginning of work for enterprises: from 0700 hours in the morning for five eastern regions, from 0730 hours for 11 central regions, and from 0800 hours for five western regions. This will allow people to use the light day maximum efficiently.
