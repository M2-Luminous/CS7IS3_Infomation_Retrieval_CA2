FBIS3-7025 "dreas057_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-057 Document Type:Daily Report 23 Mar 1994 North Korea Patriot Deployment Termed `Extremely Agitating' SK2403060394 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2200 GMT 23 Mar 94 SK2403060394 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2200 GMT 23 Mar 94 Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [Text] According to reports, the United States is deliberately driving the situation of the Korean peninsula to a war phase [kyehoekchoguro chosonbandoui chongserul chonjaeng kungmyonero moragago issumnida] after rupturing the DPRK-U.S. talks. As has been learned, the United States completely turned over [chonmyon twijibo opko] the agreement reached at the New York DPRK-U.S. contact and broke up [patansikigo] the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks. Nevertheless, the United States poses open [nogolhwa] military threats and pressure against us under unjust pretexts, shifting the responsibility for the rupture of the talks to us. U.S. President Clinton made a very provocative order [maeu tobalchogin myongnyong] to deploy 192 Patriot missiles in South Korea as soon as the DPRK-U.S. talks came to a rupture, as though he had been waiting for it. The U.S. Department of Defense said that a Patriot missile battalion with some 40 missile launching ramps and 850 soldiers was going to move from Texas, the United States, to South Korea, according to the order. The U.S. measure of deploying Patriot missiles in South Korea is threatening and extremely agitating [simhi chaguk]. It is a kind of declaration of overall confrontation with us [urie taehan ilchongui chonmyon taegyol sonon], a declaration of war. According to the U.S. newspaper WASHINGTON POST dated 22 March, the U.S. Administration is plotting a scheme to take next-stage military steps against us [urirul pandaehanun taum tangyeui kunsajok chochidurul chwiharyogo hoekchukhago issumnida]. Following the decision to deploy Patriot missiles, the U.S. Administration is trying to dispatch additional U.S. military forces to South Korea, to move and deploy U.S. aircraft carriers along the coastline of the Korean peninsula, and to arm the U.S. Forces in South Korea and the South Korean puppet Army with new military equipment. The British newspaper EVENING STANDARD reported that a U.S. naval fleet with 30 naval vessels was approaching an area where it can reach our country's coast in 24 hours. This fleet has two mobile aircraft carrier units and landing operations forces, including the Marine Corps, aboard. According to Japan's MAINICHI SHIMBUN dated 19 March, the U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Carl Vinson lately departed from Japan's Yokosuka Port with six escort ships and is maintaining a mobile posture heading toward the Korean peninsula. Prior to this, the U.S. aircraft carrier Independence led by the Mobile Bay, an Aegis missile cruiser; (?Bainbridge), a guided missile cruiser; and two frigates had called at Port Yokosuka. They are also preparing against a possible case by standing by within the reach of the Korean peninsula. Meanwhile, the U.S. warmongers are openly disclosing its plot to resume the Team Spirit nuclear war exercise, and the bellicose remarks on the Team Spirit continue to resound from the Congress. The Democratic whip leader in the House of Representatives and the Republican whip leader in the Senate, in an interview with NBC Television, raved that the United States should resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise so as to impose pressure on North Korea by actually carrying it out. We cannot but say such ill-boding military moves, containing the danger of a war provocation, will only bring out vigilance [undanghan kyonggaesim].
