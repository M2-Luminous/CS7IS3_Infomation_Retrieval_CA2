Sarel Cilliers, and honorable fellow countrymen. Tonight we stand at the same point where our people stood on 31 May 1902 when they lost their freedom after much sacrifice, much loss of life, much struggle, but also after much faith and deep nationalism, and the desire for freedom which drove them. Friends, at midnight tonight, with the inauguration of the new constitution and the lowering of the South African flag, we have once again lost our freedom. According to this constitution, we are again a subjected people who will be governed by a foreign government. Friends, just as in 1902 when President Kruger, in exile in Switzerland, received the news that the war had been lost, that freedom had been lost, and with that message weighing down on him, he raised himself and sent his final message to his people. At that moment, when the nation was at its lowest point, he said: Build, because the future belongs to you. Friends, President Kruger was able to utter those words because he firmly believed that his people and all the peoples of the world are ruled by the Holy Trinity, and therefore in the course of the century our people again got back their freedom. I say to you tonight, this great crowd of people gathered here at this early hour of the morning, I say to you that what you are doing here is what President Kruger did. When the flag was lowered, when we lost our freedom, that was the first great step on the road to reclaiming our freedom, when you once again raised our flag, and when you once again raised the flag of freedom. Friends, that is the first step. It says to the world and to South Africa and to all who would listen that from this moment on, the desire for freedom and the struggle for freedom and the ideals of the Afrikaner will burn more strongly every moment, every day until that freedom has been regained and we are once again free in our own fatherland. We say today that step by step, bit by bit, we will reclaim our victory. We will keep that which rightfully belongs to us -- our schools, our hospitals, our local authorities. We will reclaim them until we once again are a truly free people with our own constitution, our own elections, in our own homeland, and where the Afrikaner nation's flag will once again flutter over us. Friends, the Afrikaner nation is in the vanguard, carrying the freedom flame, because we know that after this election, and in the months ahead, nationalism and ethnicity will once again flare up, as is happening at this moment in Namibia/South-West Africa. There, six peoples are in the process of breaking away from the unitary state and from the subjection. They are in the process of restoring their kingdoms, claiming their self-determination and their land. Some of them, like the Basters, are already headed for the World Court. That nationalism is reawakening and breaking down the unitary state. Here in South Africa, friends, the Afrikaner is in the vanguard. We are not going to wait for 3 or 4 years before stepping onto the road to freedom. We are beginning right at this moment, with our feet firmly on that road. Because we have our feet on that road, and because we have refused to sign our freedom away and because we have refused to allow others to decide on our future, thereby lowering ourselves to the level of advisers on our own future, because we refused to sign away that freedom, our hands are clean and we can demand the right of a free people in our own fatherland with a clean conscience [applause]. Friends, we did not sign for a subordinate position, and that is why I believe that the Afrikaner nation, through what it has done until tonight, and what it will do henceforth is not only going to be in the interest of our people; it will not only bring our people's freedom; and that freedom which we are striving for, friends, is not a freedom at the expense of others. We have no desire to rule over another nation. Absent too, however, is the possibility that another nation can rule over us and we accept it without putting up a fight. Because friends, we cannot be made slaves, because as freely as the eagle flies, such is the flight of our spirit, because the spaces of this country have fed our spirit. And that is why, friends, I believe that what we are in the process of doing now, the road we have chosen, the successes which we are going to achieve, they will also be to the advantage of other nations, because the precedent that we have set, they too can reap good from it. But friends, it will not only benefit our nation and the people of South Africa, but it will also benefit all the nations in the world who are peace-loving and who want to be free, because world communism, which does not only want to dominate South Africa alone, which says that once this system has been established here -- which is their objective -- then they will stir up the impoverished southern world against the rich north to strike the final blow in subjecting the world to a communist government. And that is why I believe that what we are doing is right. We believe it is divinely arranged -- that nations have to be free, that their places of abode and eras have been predetermined. And that is why we know it will be in the interest of the rest of the world. But friends, it will also -- at the highest level -- be to the honor of the Holy Trinity whose name we will always profess so that the anti-Christ will be destroyed. This befits a Christian nation. And friends, I want to tell you tonight: We are entering the process of trials and tribulations; we are entering an era during which we will be tested, and this is already evident. We have always trusted people, we have always trusted other nations. But tonight the Afrikaner nation is standing alone before God, where it belongs. That is where we belong. For that reason, friends, I want to tell you tonight, in our history there has never been a power, another nation, no one who came to our nation's rescue. We only had one refuge, and each time we turned to that refuge, to the King of Kings. When we turned to Him, our nation rose again out of the depths and was placed on the highest levels. And that is why I say to you tonight, we are again standing there -- before our God. And friends, I want to ask you tonight, do we not find ourselves tonight in the most privileged position? While we were in the depths of darkness during the last decade, we knew where our salvation was. Once more we again know before whom we must bow. Now we know we may not place our trust in the world, in horses, in military vehicles and worldly forces. We must trust in God, the three in one. And friends, is a nation not at its pinnacle when it bows before its God when times are bad? That is where we are standing tonight. And that is why we have no doubts in the future. That is why we know, because the master of the world, because He is in control. We know there is a future. That is why we can tell each other tonight: Rise. Walk on the big road of South Africa. Build, because the future is ours. Friends, let it be so, that this hour becomes the biggest hour in our history. Because in the hour that we were subjected, the nation turned to God; and in that hour the nation found the power, the will and the endurance to get up and act, and it attained its freedom. Thank you very much.
