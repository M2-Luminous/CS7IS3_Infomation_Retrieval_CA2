FR940907-2-00045 FR940907-2-00030 [OPP&hyph;300357; FRL&hyph;4906&hyph;6] Bacteriophages of Xanthomonas campestris subsp. vesicatoria; Establishment of Temporary Exemption from Tolerance AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA has established an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for bacteriophages isolated from Xanthomonas campestris subsp. vesicatoria in or on the raw agricultural commodities tomatoes and peppers. This exemption has been established by the Agency on its own initiative. DATES : This temporary exemption expires August 15, 1996. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Steve Robbins, Acting Product Manager (PM) 21, Registration Division (7505C), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 227, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703) 305&hyph;6900. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA received from AgriPhi, Inc., 160 North Main, Logan, Utah 84321, an application for an Experimental Use Permit for proposed field testing of the efficacy of a product containing bacteriophages isolated from bacterial lesions on tomato and pepper plants produced by Xanthomonas campestris subsp. vesicatoria . In order to further the research efforts of this small company in the development of innovative biological pest control technology, the Agency has established a temporary exemption from the requirement for a tolerance of these bacteriophages in or on the raw agricultural commodities tomatoes and peppers. This temporary exemption will permit the marketing of the above raw agricultural commodities when treated in accordance with the provisions of the Experimental Use Permit 67986&hyph;EUP&hyph;1 which is being issued under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended (Pub. L. 95&hyph;396, 92 Stat. 819; 7 U.S.C. 136). The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated and it was determined that establishment of a temporary tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Public literature citations were referenced which indicate that bacteriophages are specific to their bacterial host and present no unique toxicity hazards to humans or wildlife. Research has been conducted on bacteriophages for the past 80 years with no documented cases of adverse effects to man or the environment. Bacteriophages are commonly occurring in nature and would normally be found on raw agricultural commodities. Therefore, a temporary tolerance has been established on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the Experimental Use Permit and with the following provisions: 1.␣ The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the Experimental Use Permit. 2.␣ AgriPhi, Inc., must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing on safety. The company must also keep records of production, distribution and performance and on request make the records available to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. This temporary exemption from tolerance requirements expires August 15, 1996. Residues remaining in or on the raw agricultural commodity after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit. This tolerance exemption may be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on this biological pesticide indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirement of section 2 of Executive order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346(j). List of Subjects Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: August 29, 1994.
