FR941216-2-00060 FR941216-2-00040 [FRL&hyph;5122&hyph;2] Public Water System Supervision Program Revision for the State of Utah AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Public notice is hereby given in accordance with the provisions of section 1413 of the Safe Drinking Water Act as amended, 42 U.S.C. 300g&hyph;2, and 40 CFR part 142, Subpart B&hyph;Primary Enforcement Responsibility, that the State of Utah has revised its Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) Primacy Program. Utah's PWSS program, administered by the Utah Division of Drinking Water, has adopted regulations for Phase II (7 inorganic and 26 organic chemicals), Phase IIb (1 inorganic and 4 organic chemicals), Phase V (5 inorganic and 18 organic chemicals), and lead and copper that correspond to the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR) in 40 CFR part 141 for Phase II ( Federal Register Vol. 56, No. 20, January 30, 1991, Pg. 3526&hyph;3597), Phase IIb ( Federal Register Vol. 56, No. 126, July 1, 1991, Pg. 30266&hyph;30281), Phase V ( Federal Register Vol. 57, No. 138, July 17, 1992, Pg. 31776&hyph;31849), and for lead and copper ( Federal Register Vol. 56, No. 110, June 7, 1991, Pg. 26460&hyph;26564). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has completed its review of Utah's primacy revisions and has determined that they are no less stringent than the NPDWRs. EPA therefore approves Utah's primacy revisions for the Phase II, IIb, V, and Lead and Copper Rules. This determination shall become effective January 17, 1995.
