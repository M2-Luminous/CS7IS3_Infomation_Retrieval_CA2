Despite overall improvement in the working environment for women, problems have recurred, especially in sectors where there is less State surveillance, such as some township, private enterprises and joint ventures. China now boasts one of the world's most complete legal codes regarding working conditions for women, according to Yang Yuchen, official from the Women Workers Department under the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU). The code consists of the Regulation on Women's Labour Security, the Regulation on Women's Labour Contraindication and the Regulation on Women Workers' Health Care. This network of regulations ensures the physical well-being of women of all ages. In its July survey of 2,000 enterprises, mostly State-owned, in 19 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, the ACFTU found 94.5 percent of the business have full- or part-time persons hired to monitor the working conditions of employees. Nearly 95 percent of the enterprises surveyed offered routine gynecological examinations for their female employees. Pregnant workers in 87 percent of the enterprises received prenatal examinations. Breaks for breast-feeding and one or two-day menstruation leaves for women on jobs requiring heavy labour were also guaranteed in most enterprises. However, the changing economic system often causes infringements of the women's rights and safety. Pregnant and lactating women workers tend to be the first to be laid-off by employers obsessed with production efficiency. Women at unprofitable and bankrupt enterprises cannot expect to have hospitalization for child-birth paid by their employers. Workers at many foreign-invested and private businesses are facing an even tougher situation. During the past couple years, the ACFTU has investigated 1,058 foreign-funded and township enterprises. Nearly half did not grant child-birth leaves. Exposure to dangerous substances, far beyond State mandated limits, overtime work without compensatory pay, random salary deductions and sexual harassment were also prevalent. Some workers were even deprived of basic human rights. Abuses included strip searches and even an instance in which a woman suspected of theft being locked in a dog cage. Some 59 of the 60 persons who died in a fire in a Taiwan-invested textile factory in Fujian Province last month were rural women. To improve the situation, the ACFTU's Women Workers' Committee suggests four measures: -- Disseminate information regarding the State regulations on working conditions. Rural workers, as well as the heads of many township enterprises, are ignorant of the labour laws. -- Strengthen the enforcement of existing labour regulations. In addition, the future Labour Law, which is expected to be submitted to the legislature this year, should stress all the enterprises within China must observe these laws. -- Establish a labour security inspection organization that caters to the needs of women workers. -- Speed the foundation of a social security system for child birth, in which all of the society would shoulder the cost of deliveries, not the individual enterprises.
