However, due to repeated occurrences of similar incidents, relevant state departments have begun to attach high importance to such incidents. In a telephone interview with the station's Nightly News editor today over the importing of chemical wastes at Nanjing Port and of industrial waste at Ningbo Port, Wang Yangzu, deputy director of the State Environmental Protection Bureau, reiterated that as early as 1991, the State Environmental Protection Bureau and the General Administration of Customs had issued a circular on controlling the import of hazardous wastes. Wang Yangzu called on relevant departments in localities to strictly handle matters according to the guidelines set forth in the circular and called on them to mete out severe punishment to units and individuals who import hazardous wastes without authorization.
