The government announced a package of external economic measures in March, and Foreign Minister Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor are set to hold talks in Morocco. Just when the two countries were about to take steps to resume the framework talks, the prime minister expressed his intention to step down. A majority of Japanese officials in Kasumigaseki believe that with the prime minister announcing his resignation, "clues to the resumption of the framework talks have disappeared and the prime minister's resignation is a negative factor in improving Japan-U.S. relations" (according to a senior MITI official). The possibility is growing that Japan-U.S. tensions sparked by their trade friction could be prolonged. It remains unclear whether Foreign Minister Hata will now visit Morocco. A senior Foreign Ministry official said, "even if the foreign minister goes ahead with his planned visit to Morocco, we do not know how the United States will treat a foreign minister who is about to resign." A top MITI official said if a new foreign minister visits Morocco, "he would be hard pressed to negotiate with Mr. Kantor." In any case, the prime minister's resignation is inevitably expected to have an adverse impact on resumption of the framework talks. The Japanese Government had intended to use the Hata-Kantor talks as an opportunity to sound out Mr. Kantor, who is in charge of the framework talks, on the U.S. assessment of the package of external economic measures; how it plans to resume the framework talks; and specifically how Japan should move forward the three priority sectors of insurance, government procurement, and automobiles-auto parts to satisfy U.S. demands for resuming the framework talks. The Foreign Ministry takes the view that if the Hata-Kantor talks are shelved, there will be no cabinet ministerial contact between the two countries before "June, when the ministerial talks of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are held" (according to a senior Foreign Ministry official). Hence, momentum for resuming the framework talks is likely to come a long time after. The government has planned to map out a package of other external measures by the end of June, but the future of the package remains unclear. Continued tax cuts and deregulation are an issue, the solution of which requires a difficult process of opinion coordination and political leadership. A Foreign Ministry official said, "There is growing concern that if the government is unstable, it will have an adverse impact on mapping out the package." The personal relationship between Prime Minister Hosokawa and President Clinton was good because they took office on the platform of "reforms." Although the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks broke off, it has not hurt their personal relationship of trust, and the U.S. administration takes the rather firm view that "Japanese bureaucrats stand in the way of resolving bilateral issues." There is a possibility, however, that the United States will step up its criticism of Japanese bureaucrats after Mr. Hosokawa resigns as prime minister, clouding prospects for improved Japan-U.S. relations.
