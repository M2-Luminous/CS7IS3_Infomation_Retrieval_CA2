The foreign minister said they have received assurances from the Cuban Government that no reprisals will be taken against the eight persons, including a woman and a 12-year-old child whose parents are not in the group. Cuba reiterated to Chilean authorities that it does not accept the forceful entry into diplomatic missions as a form of pressure to obtain a visa to leave the country, the foreign minister added. Figueroa noted that Cuban President Fidel Castro and Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina assured them that once the people had left the embassy, they could request whatever visas they wished. Since it involves a consulate, Chile cannot grant them asylum, rather "humanitarian refuge," Figueroa said, noting that the topic is being discussed simultaneously with the occupiers and the Cuban Government. Chile and Cuba severed diplomatic relations following the 11 September 1973 military coup and resumed ties at the consular level as of 1991. Figueroa explained that thus far, relations between the two nations "are adequate," and Chile is not demanding that political changes occur on the island as a condition for the establishment of diplomatic ties, but that it is studying the situation. "We have never established conditions at any time," the foreign minister stated, adding that his Cuban colleague Roberto Robaina will visit Chile in August. "I hope that before he arrives, the topic (of the consulate occupants) will be resolved," he said.
