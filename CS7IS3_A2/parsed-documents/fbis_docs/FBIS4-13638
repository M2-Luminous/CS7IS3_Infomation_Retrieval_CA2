He said that the two sides have come very close to reaching an agreement on implementing self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. At a news conference today before his departure from Cairo, Shahaq said that during this round an agreement was reached on several issues but that certain issues have not yet been settled. He voiced his hope that next week will be the end of the talks on implementing the Palestinian self-rule. He refused to set a date for signing the agreement on self-rule, but noted that the time is not far away. Gen. Shahaq said that the Civilian Affairs Committee has nearly finished numerous issues submitted to it, such as water and communications. He noted that certain issues have not yet been settled, such as stamps and telephone codes. He pointed out that the Security Committee settled a working paper related to the Palestinian police, but certain issues remain to be worked out. Regarding the Legal Affairs Committee, he voiced his hope that progress will be achieved in the work of this committee next week. Gen. Shahaq stated that an agreement was reached on the legal jurisdictions, but he declined to define the points of the agreement, noting that certain topics will be postponed to be discussed by higher echelons. He noted that the Palestinian and Israeli delegations are waiting for the resolutions of the Economic Affairs Committee currently meeting in Paris, which has not yet finished its work. He said that the resolutions that will be reached in Paris will be annexed to the other resolutions to work out a general agreement that will be implemented in Gaza and Jericho. Gen. Shahaq pointed out that there are still issues on which the two sides disagree; they will be postponed until after the signing of the executive agreement on Gaza and Jericho. Responding to a question on the Jericho area maps and the reservations shown by the Palestinian delegation on this issue, Shahaq said that what was signed in the "Cairo agreement" will not be broached or negotiated again. Regarding the Palestinian delegation's statement that there is an understanding on the release of all Palestinian detainees without distinction, Gen. Shahaq said: "This is what the Palestinians are saying, not the Israelis." He noted that an agreement was reached to release 5,000 out of 8,400 detainees in two stages. Regarding the legal jurisdiction and its limits if a Palestinian citizen should commit a crime in Israel and flee to Gaza, Gen. Shahaq said that in such a case he would be handed over to Israel to stand trial. Concluding his news conference, Gen. Shahaq pointed out that an agreement was reached on all issues related to the crossing points between the self-rule areas and Israel. He noted that no agreement has been reached regarding the Palestinian authority at sea and in the air, which is under the Security Committee.
