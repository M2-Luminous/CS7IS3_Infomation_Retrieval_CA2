The Georgian delegation is led by a special representative of the Georgian head of state, the Chairman of the Committee on Ethnic Minorities Issues and Human Rights Aleksandr Kavsadze, and the Abkhazian - by a special representative of the chairman of the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet Andrey Djerghenia. Pastukhov also said that on Sunday the UN Secretary-General's emissary for Abkhazia Eduard Brunner would be expected to arrive in Moscow to play a role in the negotiating process.

In addition to Georgia and Abkhazia, Russia and an emissary of the UN High Commissioner on Refugees are to sign the agreement. Russia gave has seen the inflow of many refugees from Abkhazia.
