Accounts of diplomatic mission violations, departures by sea, temporary trips without return, and Guantanamo Base infiltrations followed. Experts on the subject say that the absence of a real U.S. immigration policy has been obvious for more than 30 years and the Cuban case evidently receives preferential status. [Begin Antonio Aja, assistant director of Havana University's Center of Studies and Political Alternatives, recording] Unlike other immigrants who arrive on the Florida coast and are deported to their countries, this does not happen in the case of Cubans. Why? Because there is a U.S. law that functions parallel to the normal general immigration law -- the Cuban Quota Adjustment Law, which dates back to 1966. This legislation categorizes Cubans arriving on the Florida coasts, or the U.S. coasts in general, as political refugees, whether or not they are political refugees. As we have discussed in this regard, if these people basically have an economic or social motivation, or if their goal is a family reunion, they do not qualify as political refugees. Furthermore, they have no... [end recording] The U.S. immigration policy toward Cuba is closely linked to a vast propaganda campaign supported by the media, which manipulates public opinion and, in many cases, magnifies the events. [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] The U.S. Coast Guard has reported that 37 Cubans were rescued in the Gulf as they approached Florida. Arturo Cobo, director of the Stock Island Refugee Center, gives some of the newly arrived persons' names. [passage indistinct] [Aja] Floridian press and radio stations refer to the topic of the rafters, the human problem involved. It is true that they publish the number of people who arrive; it is also true that they give weather reports and sea conditions for navigation on the coast. It is also true that they talk about Hands to the Rescue, an organization that reportedly exists to rescue those who try to illegally emigrate by sea. In other words, a series of subliminal messages are sent from Florida by the press and radio; and logically, this.... [end recording] Aja's opinion and this reporter's information are not enough. It is also necessary to include the views of those who leave their lives to fate and decide to embark on the sea adventure. A northwest-bound floating craft leaves under cover of darkness. Who are they? No one knows. Their goal? To go beyond the 90-mile barrier and reach the United States. [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] We leave the coast behind. We are tense. We think of nothing. We are tense because we do not know what might happen. We row all night long [words indistinct]. Dawn comes and we are far away. We can see the shore by then. [Costales] Did not you think about your family and their concern about you? [Unidentified speaker] Yes, of course. I left here without saying where I was going. Later, when we were rowing, we were tense and looking around in case something was coming, or someone was coming to rescue us. I decided to leave on the spur of the moment. Later, I realized [words indistinct]. Also, I did not feel good here. There is no hope, there is no future. [end recording] The Cuban Government has been receptive and has implemented a process that renders emigration laws more flexible. The United States, however, continues to close its doors to legal immigrations, but is willing to maintain a flow of illegal immigrations as an argument to maintain its stance against Cuba.
