According to party officials, they reached the agreement at a meeting of directors of the lower house's steering committee. If Hata fails to survive the no-confidence motion introduced by the leading opposition liberal party, he must either resign with his entire cabinet or dissolve the lower house for a snap election. Talks between leaders of the ruling coalition and the second largest opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] are now under way, but prospects seem to be dim for an agreement on a future re-alliance. If the coalition's efforts fail to entice the SDP back into the governing camp, the SDP may support the no-confidence motion, which means it would be readily approved in the lower chamber. The SDP and the ruling coalition remain at odds over the resignation of Hata and the formation of a new government. The ruling coalition has rejected demands from the SDP that Hata and his cabinet resign en masse, the principle condition set by the SDP for returning to the fold.
