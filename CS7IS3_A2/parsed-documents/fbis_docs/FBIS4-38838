Replying to a question from ITAR-TASS, the Chinese diplomat remarked that reports of Russian weapons experts helping his country to modernize its armaments crop up from time to time in the U.S. media. He laughed at the magazine's citing of U.S. intelligence sources. "U.S. intelligence always gets it wrong," he said. On Wednesday, the U.S. magazine's story was denied by a senior official from the Russian Foreign Ministry. "I suppose there are some contracts for our technical specialists to go to China," he told ITAR-TASS, "but I very much doubt their number is as high as that, especially in such a delicate and sensitive area of cooperation. I think that it does happen, but in single figures." "Thousands of them--that is a crazy figure," ITAR-TASS was told on the same day by a qualified source at the Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service. "Until recently," he added, "we had no instances of anybody working in arms production." According to other sources, Russian specialists, especially in aircraft construction, are attracting great attention from Beijing. These are mainly middle-ranking technicians whose pay in China would as a rule not exceed 1,000 dollars a month. That is considerably less than they would get in the West, but a lot more than in Russia.
