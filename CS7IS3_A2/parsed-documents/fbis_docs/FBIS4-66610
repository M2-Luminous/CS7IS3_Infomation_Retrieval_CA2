In a review of the external sector of the economy, the survey says performance during the year has amply demonstrated the benefits of the reforms and this should strengthen the resolve to press ahead with them. The survey finds that a sound basis has been created to further deregulate the external sector and rationalise the tariff structure. It expects export growth to be 20 percent in dollar terms during 1993-94 and the year to end with foreign exchange reserves close to $12 billion. With a substantially lower increase in imports, the trade deficit and also the current account deficit would narrow significantly compared to the previous years. The financing gap will, therefore, also be correspondingly smaller. It has, however, a word of caution as well. Debt-serve payments are likely to increase in the next three years. Debt-servicing is expected to peak in 1996-97 and because of the large interest and principal repayments, a substantial financing gap may be expected to remain in the coming three years. In the context of this challenge, the survey moots certain policy measures. It says rapid and sustained export growth remains the key to long-term viability of BoP and the reduction of foreign debt. The policy bias against exports provided by import licensing and high tariffs has, therefore, to be eliminated over time. The country's agricultural and allied exports continue to be severely constrained by policy-imposed restrictions. Asserting that these exports posed no threat to the objective of food security, the survey calls for removal of these curbs which will provide farmers with fresh incentives to increase output. On the other hand, a major share of bulk imports continues to be canalised and more than a third of the tariff lines are still covered by some form of import licensing. Quantitative restrictions on import of consumer goods provide very high levels of effective protection to these sectors. This results in misallocation of investible resources from sectors where the country may process a competitive advantage. Policy reforms in these areas, the survey says, "merit urgent and co-ordinated government action." Moreover, there is a need to augment infrastructural facilities for exports. The survey notes that with the Indian economy increasingly integrated with the world economy, the management of the BoP will pose major challenges. Careful attention will need to be given to exchange rate policy, external debt strategy and foreign exchange reserve management. Policy must ensure that exchange rate developments do not weaken the competitiveness of Indian exports. The large stock of external debt has to be carefully managed to minimise the potential for sudden pressures on liquidity of the kind that disrupted the economy in 1990-91. Foreign exchange reserves must be held at levels commensurate with growing trade and capital flows and the increasing diversity and flexibility of such flows. Anticipatory actions will have to be taken to guard against shocks such as a sudden rise in global petroleum prices or an agricultural drought. On the performance in the external sector, the survey projects import growth to be limited to 4 percent during 1993-94 despite large-scale liberalisation of import policy. The trade deficit in the first nine months of 1993-94 was only $732 million which was less than one-fourth of the level in the corresponding period of 1992-93. The current account deficit in 1993-94 is expected to be less than 0.5 percent of the GDP (little over $1 billion). The year has also seen a sharp increase in inflow of foreign investment. The total quantum of foreign investment flows could be about $3 billion compared to $585 million during 1992-93 and $148 million in 1991-92. Foreign exchange reserves had built up to $10.9 billion on February 4, 1994. It is expected that there will be a build-up of about $5.5 billion in reserves during 1993-94, taking these close to $12 billion. "The year under review has, therefore, seen the country emerge decisively out of its BoP crisis of the past three years," the survey noted. The survey makes some interesting observation on the foreign trade trends during 1993-94. Manufacturers, which had a share of 74.6 percent in 1991-92 and 76.3 percent in 1992-93 in the country's exports, are loosing their predominance during the current year. Agricultural exports increased by 38 percent while manufactured exports grew by only 19 percent during the first half of 1993-94. The survey, however, views this as a "positive trend" which needs to be strengthened as it generates backward linkages within the domestic economy and stimulates growth. Similarly, the survey offers an explanation for decline in imports which have baffled many. It says the fall in imports cannot be explained away by pointing towards the slow recovery in industrial output. Fertiliser imports have declined as a result of decontrol of prices of phosphatic and potassic fertilisers. Imports of other commodities, which are largely in the nature of intermediate inputs, may have declined on account of weak industrial recovery but perhaps more so because of exchange rate changes. At the new exchange rates, domestic substitutes, whose quality is improving, have become more economical. For the first time the survey reports on the developments in the hawala foreign exchange market. It says the premium in the hawala market for the U.S. dollar had come down sharply by the end of 1992-93 to about 10 percent. It reached its historically lowest level of 6 percent in mid-June 1993. This was a result of exchange rate policy and the liberalisation of bullion imports. The premium temporarily went up during August to October 1993 when it reached 13 percent. It has declined during the subsequent months.
