Hoj. Nuri said parliamentary relations between the two countries are helpful for the expansion of mutual ties in other areas. During the meeting the speaker also warned the U.S. against any moves which tend to breach the international norms. "The U.S. should take lessons from the collapse of the former superpower of the Soviet Union, and should not violate international norms simply because it has no rival anymore." Referring to the dual attitude of international organizations towards the killings of the innocent people of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the racist Serbs as well as the carnage of the Palestinian Muslim worshipers by the criminal Zionists, the Majlis speaker called on the world countries to take serious action vis-a-vis such crimes. Stressing Iran's determination to maintain security and stability in the Persian Gulf region, Nuri said that the U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf is a threat to the security of the region. Qian in reply said that Iran served as a bridge between Asia and Europe, and termed Iran's role in the strategic and sensitive region of the Persian Gulf as "positive and constructive". He also said expansion of the mutual parliamentary relations would strengthen the two countries' ties in other areas.
