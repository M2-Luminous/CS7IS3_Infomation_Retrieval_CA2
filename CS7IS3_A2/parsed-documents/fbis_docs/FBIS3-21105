Finally, on 2 December, France's Snecma and Great Britain's TI Group signed the agreement to merge the landing gear operations of their respective subsidiaries, Messier-Bugatti and Dowty Aerospace. Fulfilling the hope expressed by Jean-Paul Bechat, Messier-Bugatti's president-chief executive officer, during an interview with AIR & COSMOS last July (see AIR & COSMOS No. 1433, page 11) in connection with the announcement that negotiations between the two companies had begun, steps to evaluate and set up the company were completed before the end of the year. The fact remains that actual establishment of the Messier-Dowty firm still requires approval by stockholders in both firms and by national and Community authorities. That approval is expected in the early months of 1994. By combining the landing gear operations of the two firms, Messier-Dowty should achieve an annual turnover of about 2.5 billion francs with some 2,400 employees divided between Great Britain, France (the Bidos plant in Pyrenees-Atlantiques), and Canada, where Dowty is firmly established. When the agreement was being signed, Gerard Renon, president of Snecma, and Sir Christopher Lewinton, president of the TI Group, said only that Messier-Dowty would be among the world's leading landing gear manufacturers. It is felt, however, that the newly formed firm may take first place--ahead of the Cleveland Pneumatic Corp., which recently joined the B.F. Goodrich Group, and Menasco of the Coltec Industry Group.
