FBIS4-58582 "drnes087_d_94001" FBIS-NES-94-087 Daily Report 4 May 1994 Libya GPC Reacts to Palestinian-Israeli Self-Rule Accord GPC Reacts to Palestinian-Israeli Self-Rule Accord LD0405141694 Tripoli Great Jamahiriyah Radio Network in Arabic 1230 GMT 4 May 94 LD0405141694 Tripoli Great Jamahiriyah Radio Network Arabic BFN [Statement issued by "source" from the General People's Committee for Unity; place and date not given] [Text] What is happening these days concerning what is known as the signing of an agreement between the 'Arafat group and the Israelis on limited self-rule in Gaza and Jericho is a form of falsification. The Arab Palestinian people have not been asked its view on this agreement, and therefore what has been signed is binding only to the signatories who have relinquished the inalienable and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, recognized by all the states of the world through international resolutions adopted at the United Nations, resolutions that affirm the national legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to all its land. This insignificant signing is a unilateral solution that gives the Israelis rights to what does not belong to them. It expresses the submission of some Palestinian leaders to the American-Zionist conspiracy aimed at fragmenting the Arab nation and enabling the Zionist enemy, by force, to control the Arab homeland, so that the Israelis may become the foundation of a Middle East order due to their military might and their weapons of mass destruction that come under no international control. In addition, the crusading west, which bears rancor against the Arab nation and Muslims, continues to supply the Israelis with the most modern means of destruction, the last of which was the deal on American strategic bomber jets, which can cover the distance from Pakistan in the east to Morocco in the west. Moreover, the Israelis continue their occupation of the Arab lands from Egypt's Umm al-Rashrash [Eilat] to the Syrian Golan Heights and southern Lebanon. The position of the Arab nation is firm concerning a just and comprehensive peace, which comes down to the return to their countries of origin of the Jews which emigrated to Palestine while fleeing persecution, the return of the Palestinian people to their own land, and establishing a Palestinian democratic state on all the territory of Palestine. This solution is the one that guarantees peace in the region, and spares the Jews the danger of extermination which the west is seeking to secure against them. The emergence of what is called Israel after World War II, as a result of this war, must be removed, similar to the other arrangements, such as the Berlin Wall and the problem of the people of South Africa.
