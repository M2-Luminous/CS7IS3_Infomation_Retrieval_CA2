In his year-end review of developments in the Namibian economy since independence and prospects for recovery in the immediate future, Mr. Hamutenya pointed out that there are "very positive prospects for an economic upswing in the next two years and beyond," with new investments totalling more than N[Namibian] $700 million to be launched this year. Mr. Hamutenya says that the new investments of more than N$700 million represents 15 percent of 140 projects, ideas, proposals, and profiles presented by potential investors to the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Areas of interest in industrial investment ranges from cement, clothing, the manufacturing of plastics, vehicle assembly plants, mining activities, and fertilizer production. Mr. Hamutenya said in the review that 165 delegations of potential and real investors visited Namibia in 1993, compared to 26 in 1992. He stated that the increasing international interest in the Namibian economy is accompanied, however, by a "disturbing tendency towards protectionism by Namibian businessmen." As examples of this he cited recent controversies surrounding investment plans by Pick & Pay, Olympia Reisen, City Savings and Investment Bank, and the South African Breweries. "It is sad that many potential investors leave the country discouraged by the negative attitudes they encounter in the local business community. Namibia's true interest is served by expansion, not the restriction of economic activities in the country, and it is such expansion of production lines and trade which holds positive prospects for medium-term economic recovery." He points out that insufficient new investment by existing local companies since independence has hurt the country's economic development. Mr. Hamutenya says that while it is fair to say that this lack of investment by local companies does not indicate a lack of trust in the new political order, it is also true that apart from the fishing industry, there has not been any significant local investment since independence. "In other words, except for the exchange of assets, concerning the depreciation of existing capital stocks, very few of the existing companies made any new substantial investments since independence." Mr. Hamutenya added that the next three years will be a period in which the analyses and policy compiled since independence will be implemented in tangible projects. This includes land reforms and the rationalization of the civil service, two of the most important outstanding issues to be addressed by government. "Land reforms are central to the objective of fair economic development." One of his main aims is to find "a reasonable and fair way in which to transfer land from those who have too much of it, to those who do not have it." The government is aware that land is the most fundamental form of ownership and that the issue could have negative socioeconomic and political consequences if it is not addressed. The minister says that for this reason the government looked earnestly at viable options to resolve existing imbalances concerning access to land. Mr. Hamutenya said that the rationalization of the civil service is also essential for the reduction of "what is obviously intolerable" -- namely, the level of continuous government expenditure. "For the medium-term the government is refocusing its budgetary policy to promote the growth of productive economic investment". He also indicated that 1994 will be the year for ensuring that practical economic benefits are reaped from investments.
