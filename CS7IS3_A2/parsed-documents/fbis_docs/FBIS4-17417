Silins reiterated the unambiguous support of the U.S. Administration for the March 15 initialed agreements on Russian troop withdrawal. The signing of the documents would allow international organizations to involve in the control of their implementation, Silins said. Silins reconfirmed the United States' commitment to allot 2 million dollars to dismantle the new building of the Russian- operated radar facility at Skrunda as soon as the withdrawal package is signed. VIA failed to inform BNS about the content of Al Gore's letter but presumably it contains the same idea as Silins said.
