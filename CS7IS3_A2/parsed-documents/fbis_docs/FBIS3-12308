During the session, Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali briefed the Senate on the government contacts on the massacre perpetrated by the Israeli settlers in the Ibrahimi Mosque yesterday. The Senate then issued a statement condemning the ugly crime. [Begin al-Majali recording] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Brother members of the honorable Senate: I would like to stress the feelings of the government, which fully supports all that was said in this honorable Senate this morning. We want to inform the Senate that denunciation--and I think this happens for the first time in the history of this cause--has come from all parties: The European and American parties and even the Israeli leadership regardless of whether this Israeli denunciation is a fact or a cover. But this is the first time such a denunciation occurs in the manner we all have heard. It is natural that upon the directives of his majesty the king, contacts were held on the Arab, Islamic, and international levels and the third world states. The ambassadors were summoned and informed of the importance and seriousness of this incident and its impact on the entire peace process. The crime is unprecedented in history. It was killing in cold blood, not killing in which there was resistance. They were in the mosque praying. Therefore, this takes a world dimension. We should act on the information, press, and diplomatic levels so that this fact reaches all western minds continuously and persistently in order to be greatly influential. We were informed that the Americans are taking this issue very seriously and they denounce it. Hence, they supported an old request made by Jordan to hold the negotiations in one place and to hold them continuously until results are achieved. I think the U.S. President's call on Israel and the president of the Palestinian state to send all delegations to Washington is meant to discuss this matter very seriously. We hope this is so. On this occasion, we insist that the root cause of these terrorist acts and killings is the occupation of land and the construction of settlements. Therefore, we now insist that the settlements, as we insisted in all our negotiations, are the obstacle. In all their statements, the United States and the West also said that. But they might not have felt the seriousness of this issue except after the perpetration of this crime yesterday. Moreover, the UN Security Council met. We supported this meeting, in which discussions and deliberations are still continuing. As for what concerns us here, the government announced an official three-day mourning. It set up a fund for donations. As you see, members of the Senate are offering their contributions. Moreover, the government allocated 100,000 Jordanian dinars, in addition to His Majesty King Husayn's donation of another 100,000 Jordanian dinars. A full campaign will be launched in support of our kinsfolk in the occupied territories. One of the things from which they suffer is the financial aspect. We should not forget this. Unfortunately, for a long time our kinsfolk have not had financial support adequate to enable them to have at least the basic requirements. Therefore, we hope this support by the Senate will enhance this and be able to reach those who need it. The committee [as heard] is comprised of both the private and public sectors. The government will continue all its measures based on our stands in Washington. We told the head of the delegation there to convey our full feelings and to observe the situation in order to adopt a united stand with the Palestinian, Syrian, and Lebanese brothers on the issue of negotiations there. We believe that if the Americans commit us and force Israel to sit continuously and act in a serious manner, perhaps the harmful incident might help in finding a solution or reaching clearly defined measures soon. We will keep the Senate informed of any further developments. As for the security situation, about 5,000 people are currently staging a march at al-Husayni Mosque. However, it is a peaceful march. Community colleges and universities closed down. In al- Baq'ah, about 5,000 people staged a march toward Suwaylih. Some of them returned, while others are still there. There is a march of about 400 people in al-Zarqa'. A march staged at 'Azmi al-Mufti camp is over. People at the Jerash camp are on their way to hold a prayer for the dead. There are small gatherings in various parts of the country. We support all forms of expression. However, we are afraid of marches because various elements get involved. As everyone knows, those with different views unfortunately take advantage of marches to carry out acts of violence that we can do without. Let the marches be peaceful and strong and let the support be in its right place. The government called on the Arab world to close ranks because this will enable us to avoid such an incident and obtain our rights. We call for and fully support holding an Arab summit. We support your request to hold a meeting of Arab parliaments in order to adopt a stand toward this incident. Thank you, sir. [end recording]
