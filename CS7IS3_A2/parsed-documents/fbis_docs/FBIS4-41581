The cable says: Esteemed Mr. President, during the consultations held in Moscow on 22 and 23 June concerning the resolution of the Karabakh conflict, we noted with satisfaction that the cease-fire called for on 12 May through the Russian mediation and CSCE's support is generally being observed. The cease-fire agreement that has been ratified with the signatures of the defense ministers and army commanders is an essential factor for ending the dispute. However, we express our uneasiness at the human loss and material damage recently caused by several clashes on the Armenian-Azerbaijan border. We regard any attempt to violate the cease-fire as dangerous. Within the framework of our joint efforts, we call on all the sides to adhere to the following in order to end the conflict: 1. The sides should demonstrate in words and deeds their loyalty to the obligations they have undertaken in signing the cease-fire agreement. 2. The sides should avoid any hostile activity that may undermine the atmosphere of confidence, which is being created. 3. The sides should take adequate [preceding word in English] measures to peacefully resolve and remove the existing disputes. 4. With a view of signing a political agreement to end the armed conflict and in order to further activate the peace process, the sides should resolutely take advantage of the existing peaceful situation. They should make a strenuous effort to put into effect the clear demand for an end to the bloody conflict between the people and the solution of all the contentious issues at the negotiating table.
