The newspapers report that the Greek Cypriot side has agreed in principle to discuss them. [Kliridhis] We have agreed to discuss the three documents drawn up by the UN secretary general. They relate to the fenced-off area of Maras [Varosha], Nicosia Airport, and the confidence-building measures in general. We have agreed that the issue of the return of the residents of Maras to their property be placed under UN jurisdiction, the UN be responsible for running Maras, and the UN police control the area. We have also agreed that Nicosia Airport be operated by UN officials and used by the two communities. [Uludag] Do you mean to say you have agreed to have two terminal buildings? [Kliridhis] Yes, exactly. We have agreed to the UN secretary general's proposal. But the Turkish Cypriot side has not agreed to place the fenced-off area of Maras under UN jurisdiction. The Turkish Cypriot officials have said they want to retain the area near Demokratia Avenue and that they are not interested in Nicosia Airport. They asked that we recognize Ercan Airport and the ports of Kyrenia and Famagusta. We responded by saying we cannot do that because it would imply the recognition of a Turkish Cypriot state, which we do not recognize. The UN secretary general revealed at the beginning that issues relating to the confidence-building measures should include nothing that would imply the Greek Cypriot side's recognition of the Turkish Cypriot administration or the Turkish Cypriot side's recognition of the Cypriot Government.... Rauf Denktas has informed diplomats that the embargo must be lifted. He has equated that with the Greek Cypriot side's recognition of the ports of Kyrenia and Famagusta and Ercan Airport. I can't predict what he may do after he holds talks with Prime Minister Ciller in Turkey in February. I can't say whether Prime Minister Ciller will change Denktas' mind or whether he will insist on his stance. [Uludag] Elections have been held in north Cyprus and a coalition government has been established. Can you outline your views on that coalition? Do you believe the Turkish Cypriot side may change its policy on Cyprus? [Kliridhis] I have read the coalition protocol very carefully. Considering Denktas' policy on Cyprus, I have seen nothing different in that protocol. Ozker Ozgur and Denktas have approached each other. In practice, Ozgur has made more approaches to Denktas than Denktas to him. Considering Ozgur's views before the coalition's establishment, Denktas' approach is to the fore. [Uludag] Can you comment on Prime Minister Ciller's policy on Cyprus? [Kliridhis] Prime Minister Ciller has informed President Clinton and Prime Minister Major that she is convinced that the time to solve the Cyprus problem has come and that Turkey will try to contribute toward a settlement. But that gives no hint of the nature of the solution to be found. We will wait until next month to see what Prime Minister Ciller has in mind for a solution. [Uludag] Do you mean you have seen no change? [Kliridhis] I have not. Prime Minister Ciller has only said that "Turkey will try to find a solution." We have nothing to indicate the kind of solution to be found. [Uludag] Several Greek Cypriot politicians defend the view that agreeing to the confidence-building measures will be tantamount to recognizing a Turkish Cypriot state. Do you believe the package of confidence-building measures implies recognition? [Kliridhis] I have already mentioned that the UN secretary general said that nothing will be done to imply any recognition when the measures are effected. Indirect recognition will depend on what we agree on. Let me give you an example. The Turkish Cypriot side may agree to UN officials running Nicosia Airport but we will reject a proposal that UN officials should accept Turkish Cypriot passports. Because doing so will mean the recognition of the Turkish Cypriot state. [Uludag] So how will the Turkish Cypriots travel? [Kliridhis] Just as they do now, with Turkish passports. [Uludag] Do you mean you will agree to UN officials processing Turkish passports? [Kliridhis] Turkey is recognized. I will not accept passports issued by Turkish Cypriot officials, because that would mean the recognition of a Turkish Cypriot state. I will be careful and I am convinced that Denktas will be just as careful. [Uludag] You have known Denktas long. Do you believe you can reach an agreement with him? [Kliridhis] I met Denktas when I became a lawyer in 1950. I believe we understand each other very well. Unfortunately, I also believe that if he were to choose between the post of vice president of the Cypriot Republic and president of a Turkish Cypriot state, he would prefer to be president of a Turkish Cypriot state in north Cyprus. He is used to being the top official. But what he wants is not the issue. If Turkey says: "Yes, we will solve the Cyprus problem," Denktas can't obstruct the process alone. He can cause delays.... [Uludag] The general view is that Turkey cannot solve the Cyprus problem without Denktas. [Kliridhis] I do not believe that is true. [Uludag] That is the general viewpoint. He must sign the agreement to be reached.... [Kliridhis] I believe Turkey can convince Denktas to be reasonable, that is, if it wants to do so. [Uludag] I wanted to stress that Turkey cannot completely ignore Denktas and move to sign an agreement. [Kliridhis] I do not believe that is necessary. It would be wrong to leave him out. [Uludag] The Greek Cypriot side has allocated a large amount from its new budget for arms purchases. And you have decided you need to be under Greece's defense umbrella. Many politicians believe you are playing with fire. Is that right? [Kliridhis] No, it is not. [Uludag] Why do you need to be under Greece's defense umbrella and why do you want to strengthen Greece's influence? [Kliridhis] I don't want to strengthen Greece's influence. I want to reduce Turkey's influence to the minimum. Turkey has an army in Cyprus, a very strong army of 36,000 men. [Uludag] Do you believe the Turkish troops will attack the Greek Cypriot side? [Kliridhis] I have not said they will attack me or the Greek Cypriot side. But I believe their presence is aimed at forcing me to agree to a solution that favors Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side. If I don't agree, then the Turkish military forces will remain in Cyprus. I say: If you want to play the game like that, then I can play the same, by increasing Greece's influence. Later, I will say: Right, get out, both of you! I have sent a letter to the UN secretary general informing him that I am prepared to disband the Greek Cypriot National Guard and hand over all its arms to UN officials. The police force can remain as it is and we are prepared to undertake the expenses of a UN peacekeeping force, which will be composed of units from various countries. I am prepared to transfer the cash we will have from all that to a UN account, which will be used to serve the two communities when the Cyprus problem is solved. I am prepared to transfer the Greek Cypriot armored vehicles to UN officials. They can be used by UN troops to control the buffer zone against any kind of aggression. Naturally, everything will be subject to the condition that the opposite side complies in the same way. Let us have no armies on the two sides. Let us have a strong peacekeeping force in the buffer zone and move to hold talks. [Uludag] We have the 1977 and 1979 summit agreements. Are you willing to conclude a nonaggression pact with Denktas? Are you willing to sign an agreement with him to reduce the arms and troops in Cyprus? [Kliridhis] I do not object to the two sides giving separate guarantees to the UN secretary general that they will not attack each other. But if we are not to attack, it will be meaningless to maintain the presence of the military forces. I must strengthen my defenses anytime a Turkish soldier arrives in Cyprus. And more Turkish troops are deployed in Cyprus as I strengthen my defenses. Consequently, we have a vicious circle. I need no army. I can give up my arms. The Turkish Cypriot side needs no army either. We need a peacekeeping force. Let us conclude an agreement with the United Nations and guarantee that neither side will attack or enter the buffer zone. Let us then hold talks like normal people do. [Uludag] How do you assess the Turkish Cypriot community? Do you see it as an equal political partner or as a minority in a federation? [Kliridhis] The wings of a federation have equal rights, whether the federation is made up of two or more parts. Let us consider the federal systems in India or the United States. Many of their states (provinces) have populations of several million people. Many others are smaller. But all have equal constitutional rights. Indeed, there are constitutions that call for equal senate representation, regardless of the population structure ... So, the Greek Cypriot side agreed during the Makarios era and later when Spiros Kiprianou was in power that the two federal states would be represented on a 50-50 basis in the upper house. Had we not agreed to equality, we would have said: As for the population ratio, the Greek Cypriots make up 82 percent and the Turkish Cypriots 18-20 percent. The issue of representation should be based on that ratio. But we have agreed to equal representation. [Uludag] Can you explain the kind of federation you have in mind? [Kliridhis] I believe the Cyprus problem should be solved as follows: The two communities that will establish the federation must have the right to the highest degree of self-government. Only that which is necessary should be transferred to the federal government. The federal government must have jurisdiction over issues relating to unitary sovereignty, unitary international identity, foreign policy, and defense. The federal states and governments will be responsible for all issues relating to internal administration. The issue of having unitary federal citizenship is important. Arrangements against criminal activity are important. So, having arrangements to deal with federal offenses, as is the case in the United States, is important. The taxes of the federal government and those of the two states establishing the federation must be clearly defined. A control mechanism must be established. A supreme federal court must be empowered to ensure that the two sides comply with human rights. That must be a federal procedure. Naturally, state courts will also be established. But the final decision must be made by the federal courts. We must also consider particular issues relating to health. The two sides must have common laws or rules, for example, against importing contaminated foodstuffs. The two sides must agree to issues that guarantee the people's health. All that must be clearly outlined in a constitution. [Uludag] Do you expect a solution in 1994? [Kliridhis] Where is my crystal ball? I can't say I see a speck of light at the end of the tunnel.... True, Turkey has promised to contribute toward a solution and use its influence on the Turkish Cypriot community. But no sign of what it thinks about the solution itself exists. It is premature to decide on that issue. I must be very cautious about saying I have observed particular developments that may lead to a solution. The issue can be better assessed after we see the Turkish Cypriot side's reaction to the confidence-building measures in February and March....
