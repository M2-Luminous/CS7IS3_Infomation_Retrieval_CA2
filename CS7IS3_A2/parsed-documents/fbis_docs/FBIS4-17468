He said the defense ministers had agreed to meet at 1500 [1100 GMT]. However, Grachev had not appeared. "He could at least call us and prevent that he would not come," Radetskyy remarked. [sentence as received] On the question put by INTERFAX-Ukraine, Radetskyy stressed that the Russian proposal to base the Black Sea Fleet in all Crimean ports and the Ukrainian navy in Nikolayev, Ochakov, Odessa or Ismail was unacceptable for Ukraine. Radetskyy suggested that Ukraine could accept basing in different bays of Sevastopol. Radetskyy said the delegations had found understanding and worked fruitfully at the talks. He emphasized that the complex issues had been worked on by experts. Radetskyy was surprised by the statement of Grachev on "seizure" of 126 Black Sea Fleet ships by the Ukrainian Navy. He said the fleet had been divided proceeding from the number of 864 ships registered on August 3, 1992, in accordance with the Yalta agreement. He refuted the statement of Grachev saying that his position differed from that of the Ukrainian president. Radetskyy said in this case he would have presented a report and would have expressed his disagreement. Radetskyy pointed out that if the Black Sea Fleet issue was solved, it would let lessen the tension in Crimea and tackle the economic problems. "However, some people find it beneficial to defer settlement of the problem on the Black Sea Fleet," Radetskyy suggested. "I think this time Russia had no desire to resolve the Black Sea Fleet issue," he added. "It is regrettable that we did not justify the expectations of the presidents. This is to be blamed only on the Russian party," Radetskyy accentuated. Ukrainian Navy Commander Vladimir Bezkorovaynyy stressed at the press conference that the issue on basing dealt with the infrastructure and "we had been deciding on separation of the fleet ships so necessary during the period of transition and giving such opportunities for maneuvering." Ukraine has been financing Sevastopol for quite a long time, Bezkorovaynyy said while commenting on the statement of Grachev concerning financing of the Black Sea Fleet by Russia. "This is four times more expensive for Ukraine than for Russia is to finance the Black Sea Fleet," he added.
