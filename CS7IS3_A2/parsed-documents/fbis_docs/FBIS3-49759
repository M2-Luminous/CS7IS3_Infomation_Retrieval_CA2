One of the reasons for this war is that we will no longer let others determine what our state will be like. It will be as our soldiers dream it should be -- democratic -- and all its citizens will live a dignified life. Whether a person is a Bosniak-Muslim, a Serb, a Croat, a Gypsy... and a person's religious and political affiliation will be a private matter. This will be a free country in which foreigners will also be able to come, make investments and stay. I would like to see the Japanese, Indonesians, Swedes, Dutch, Iranians... and all other people of good will settle here," said Hamdo Hadzihasanovic, defense minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in an interview for OSLOBODJENJE. [OSLOBODJENJE] For a year this country did not have a defense minister. That speaks not only of the force of the aggression from outside but also of internal blockades and treason in order to thwart the defense of Bosnia. [Hadzihasanovic] Let me remind you that, in the stage of preparing for the realization of the long-planned aggression, Bosnia-Herzegovina was effectively deprived of a leader. All those who understood what was going on here were, in various ways, rendered powerless and eliminated from political life. Immediately before the aggression, the entire leadership of Bosnia-Herzegovina was destroyed through the "Agrokomerc" affair, and then also through Neum. For a long time we had many illusions and we still have some today. First of all, every one of us must defend the integrity of his or her own person and preserve his or her sanity. We must not allow our hate to influence our decisionmaking. It is crucial, for strengthening our defense, to rid ourselves of many illusions. First, was it possible to avoid the war? Yes, if we had surrendered. The process of our destruction would be milder and slower, but we would definitely be destroyed. Second, are national parties responsible for the war? I am not a member of any party, but I claim they are not. The aggression was conceived before those parties were created, and they are just one of the means for making war. Third, will there be an intervention and will they lift the arms embargo? There will not be a military intervention. We will have to do everything on our own. The embargo will get weaker as we get stronger. The embargo is like a drug: you become addicted, you must have weapons, but since they are forbidden and not everyone can sell them -- they are very expensive. Fourth, is there a war against the Bosniaks-Muslims and against Islam? Yes, this is also a crusade. But I do not want to emphasize that dimension, for that would only stimulate fascism, even in our own midst. This is an imperialistic war for "greater Serbia." How else can we explain the killing of the Slovenes, Croats, the exile of the Hungarians...? After the aggression, according to the theory of closed systems, disintegration was increased here, to simplify -- disorder and every conflict, from piling up garbage to criminal reprisals between the Croats and the Muslims, and among brothers. Those who need that created evidence that this is a religious and civil war. However, I am sure that there is a Ram ["framework" -- Belgrade plan to arm the Bosnian Serbs] for Milosevic's "ram." I think that the United States has a Ram both for Serbia, Russia, and Europe. Milosevic's chetniks have gone mad and are killing us, but as soon as they come to their senses, they will kill him too. Therefore, we must dispel our illusions, but that will not be painless. The fact that this country was, for so long, without a defense minister, is also a consequence of illusions. However, all the while, the deputy minister and his associates were working. People worked as much as they could in the circumstances. It is not up to me to evaluate their work. I look ahead and do everything to move forward. Stronger by the Day [OSLOBODJENJE] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army was formed and became stronger in dramatic circumstances when they were defending their lives. Would you comment on its organization and strength today, almost two year after the aggression? [Hadzihasanovic] The army, Ministry of the Interior, and other components of Bosnia-Herzegovina armed forces, were formed and became stronger in the most dramatic circumstances known to history. Wise and brave individuals and groups ("Patriotic Alliance," "Green Berets," and others) saw through the aggressor's intentions and offered organized resistance. Wherever there was organized resistance, the aggressor did not realize its intentions. This is a valuable experience and provides the foundation for the development of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. Today it is a great force. Educated, experienced, and with disciplined officers, a command headquarters and units. New officers are being educated as they fight. We have young soldiers coming to us. They use modern, sophisticated computer technology. The world, lead by the United States and West Europe, is afraid of the former Yugoslav National Army, and our army, whose hands are tied by the arms embargo, counters that force on its own and is successful in destroying it. It is high time we told the world that, although they interfere with us, we are helping them to destroy the fascist monster with the flesh and blood of our most outstanding sons.... [OSLOBODJENJE] Of course, demilitarization will soon make no sense? [Hadzihasanovic] One of the illusions imposed on us that I failed to mention in answer to your first question is demilitarization. Is there anything more stupid and lethal than saying to our only real defense force, to the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, in the middle of the war, that we will disband it as soon as we sign an agreement on peace. Fortunately, we have not dispelled that illusion. There will be no demilitarization as long as Serbia and Croatia have weapons. That was just another deceit from the arsenal of special war, which was supposed to shake our faith in our own strength. The public often say that our soldiers are confused, that our goals are not clear, that the Platform of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency has been surpassed.... I do not think that is true. Our soldiers know they are fighting for freedom and justice for their people and for a STRONG BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA. We learned that, just as an illness attacks a body when its immune system is weakened, a war attacks a country when it gets weak, when its leadership is incomplete, and when its people are naive. Prepared for the Worst [OSLOBODJENJE] In the field, there are some individuals and groups that are not under a banner of Bosnia-Herzegovina, under the insignia and command of the army. [Hadzihasanovic] We will energetically finish the process we began. They will either be placed under command of the army or they will be disarmed. Further development of our armed forces is based on a determinant that foresees the simultaneous occurrence of the worst possible factors for us: joint aggressors, withdrawal of the UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] and UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces], the embargo, and the winter. We benefit when any of those factors are missing. All our soldiers know that the war will not end until we provide a minimum area for our survival and development. Until, in addition to access to the Sava, we establish a territorial link with eastern Bosnia, until we retrieve our territory in western Bosnia in which the Bosniak-Muslims form the majority, and until we gain access to the part of our coast at Neum -- there will be no peace. If the aggressors do not sign to verify our intentions, we will have to use force to push them to those borders. Use only our force. [OSLOBODJENJE] How do the government and your ministry intend to solve the problem of finances and logistic support to the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army? [Hadzihasanovic] The government and the Ministry of Defense are realizing many projects that will upgrade the system of financing, equipping, and supplying the armed forces. All sources of financing and goods are gradually being placed in the function of the state and defense. All republic funds have been abolished. The government finances the armed forces through the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Finance. The flow of information, money, and goods for corps and districts are clearly defined. We have recently issued instructions regulating that matter. We have also activated the inspectorate of the Ministry of Defense. Financing the armed forces from local sources must be abolished as soon as possible. That means we must do away with self-proclaimed home guard units and, at the same time, leave less room for autonomism. There are still some hidden stocks of goods. Our primary goal is to introduce stimulative measures to make businessmen sell those goods and start ordering and producing more goods. But we will also combine that with some repressive measures. All firms and other legal persons who will not accept concrete specifications for the scope and deadline of deliveries of goods, or who do not meet contractual obligations, will be shut down. At the same time, we are carrying out a revision of formations in army units. By activating businessmen we will create conditions for reducing the number of logistics personnel, and especially for those who pretend to be that. By increasing production we will also stimulate money transactions, reduce municipality borders (customs duty), cut prices, destroy the black market, and eliminate criminals and the mafia, both domestic and international, often hiding behind humanitarian missions. Those are the prerequisites for breaking the chetnik and ustasha encirclements once and for all. Until we upgrade money transfers, the families of dead Muslim heroes, soldiers and fighters, instead of worthless salaries, will get basic food products, firewood....
