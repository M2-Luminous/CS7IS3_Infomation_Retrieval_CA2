Katalin Horvath reports: [Horvath] The country does not want what the Fidesz wants. Probably we could not explain well enough and could not convince people of the ideas of the Fidesz. This was the cause of our poor performance, said Fidesz Chairman Viktor Orban. As a matter of fact, the Hungarian election result resembles a Polish scenario. It means that the government party could not cope with the economy and people cast their votes for the party which ruled before 1990. The Fidesz has been working for one and a half years to prevent this -- unfortunately, without success. The Fidesz will continue to be in opposition. If necessary, in the second round, Fidesz candidates will step back in favor of the Alliance of Free Democrats. By doing so at least the Hungarian Socialist Party's advantage can be reduced even though it cannot be changed, Viktor Orban said. Speaking about his chairmanship, he merely said that his statement of last night had been misunderstood. He is not even thinking of resigning. The party congress will decide on his chairmanship.
