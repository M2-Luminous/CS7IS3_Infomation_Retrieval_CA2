They added that Interior Minister Brigadier General Yahya al-Mutawakkil was instructed to inform Yahya al-Shami and Fish Resources Minister Fadl Muhsin 'Abdallah, both of whom are members of the YSP's Political Bureau, and Dr. 'Abd-al-Quddus al-Midwahi, who is one of the leaders of the Nasirite Unionist Organization, to leave Sanaa. They are all members of the Political Forces Dialogue Committee. A YSP spokesman said that this "meant that people were being expelled from their own homeland and that the way was being paved for further developments later on." Sources in Sanaa stressed that dismissal of Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas's cabinet and formation of a new cabinet under the chairmanship of another YSP leader was being seriously considered because of the continuing political battle and exchange of accusations between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Engineer al-'Attas.
