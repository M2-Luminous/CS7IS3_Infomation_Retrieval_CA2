FBIS4-11497 "drlat082_r_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-082 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 Peru CCD Approves Citizen' Participation, Control Bill CCD Approves Citizen' Participation, Control Bill PY2704224394 Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish 16 Apr 94 Political Section p A1 PY2704224394 Lima EL PERUANO Spanish BFN [Text] During yesterday morning's session, the plenum of the Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD), by a vote of 50 to one, approved the Citizens' Participation and Control bill recommended by the CCD Constitution Commission. The draft bill, divided into 47 articles, was proposed by legislator Carlos Torres y Torres Lara (NM-C90) [New Majority -- Change 90), who said this bill makes important contributions to Peruvian law as compared with the laws of other countries in Latin America and the world. He pointed out that this is the first authentically democratic step in the country's political decisionmaking, as it combines direct and indirect democracy. Torres y Torres Lara said this bill gives the people the opportunity to participate in the reform of the Constitution and the laws, as well as to revoke the appointment of authorities and to be informed as to how the budget is implemented, among other things. The legislator stated: "No more laws that do not allow the participation of the people. This bill, moreover, will allow the public to be integrated into the process and their opinions taken into account." Legislator Roger Caceres Velasquez said this initiative fills a gap that has existed in Peruvian laws since the Republic was founded. Henry Pease Garcia (MDI) [Democratic Left Movement]) said the bill allows for a referendum without restricting it, as the new Constitution does. Carlos Ferrero Costa (NM-C90) said the public's right to begin an initiative should be broader than legislators' rights. He said he was against the executive branch not being able to subject the draft bill to a referendum. Among the public's rights to initiative included in the Citizens' Participation and Control bill are their participation in the constitutional reform, in the drafting of laws, in referendums, and in the drafting of municipal and regional regulations, among others. Among the public's rights to control are over decisions to revoke the appointment of an authority or to remove an authority, and in demanding information on the implementation of the budget and other control mechanisms in the municipal and regional administrations. As for a referendum, the bill states that one can be requested by no less than 10 percent of the electors, while the support of 25 percent of the electors, with a maximum [as published] of 400,000 signatures, is necessary to revoke the appointment of an authority. To request information on the implementation of the budget, at least 20 percent of the electors, with a maximum [as published] of 50,000 signatures, is necessary. An authority will be removed if the National Elections Board determines that more than 50 percent of the citizens of an electoral district request it. The CCD plenum yesterday also paid homage to the late attorney, ambassador, and journalist Andres Avelino Aramburu Menchaca, who was represented by his widow Lala Irigoyen de Aramburu and relatives, who arrived in Congress at 1308.
