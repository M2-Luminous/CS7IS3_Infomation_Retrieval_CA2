But even though a tough amphetamine control law has been promulgated, this has had little effect on either producers or users. Terrible accidents stemming from amphetamines occur frequently. Mr. Sanchai Singhonglaka, the Region 1 chief judge, expressed concern about this problem, saying that the number of amphetamine cases tried in Region 1 courts has increased. Today, even though the court is handing down stiff sentences to those who violate the 1975 drug act, particularly those convicted in amphetamine cases, the number of amphetamine cases has continued to increase. He said that since the beginning of 1993, a total of 1,241 amphetamine cases have been heard by Region 1 courts. Of these, 1,049 were charged with illegal possession, and 192 were charged with possession with intent to sell. The courts in Region 1 have rendered verdicts in 1,132 of these cases, and are still deliberating the other 109. In those cases that have been completed, the courts found 1,121 of the defendants guilty and six innocent. Four jumped bail, and the case against one was dropped because the defendant died. The courts in Region 1 trying the largest number of amphetamine cases were the Saraburi provincial court, 337 cases, the Thanyaburi [as published] provincial court, 202, and the Ayuthaya provincial court, 125. Mr. Udom Buntham, the director of the Legal Affairs and Crime Detection Division, Office of the Narcotics Control Board [ONCB], talked with reporters about the new law, which calls for stiffer penalties in amphetamine cases. He said that at present, sentences for those convicted of selling or producing amphetamines are rather light. This is because the present law is very outmoded. To ensure that things are in accord with the actual situation, the ONCB will ask the government to make the penalties for producers and traffickers the same as those imposed in heroin cases. This is now being considered by prosecutors before being submitted to the cabinet. Also, rewards leading to seizures will be increased. That is, for pure amphetamine powder, the reward will be increased from 3 baht to 10 baht per gram. For amphetamine tablets, the reward for 1-50 tablets will be 200 baht. For 51-1,000 tablets, the reward can be as high as 5,000 baht. In cases involving the seizure of more than 1,000 tablets, the person will receive an additional one baht per tablet up to a maximum of 100,000 baht.
