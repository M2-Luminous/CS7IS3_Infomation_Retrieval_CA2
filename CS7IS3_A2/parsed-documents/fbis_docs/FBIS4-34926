Pompeyo Marquez, special minister and presidential adviser, said in Maracay, an industrial city 80 km west of Caracas, that the plan will focus in particular on social programs and reactivating production. To that effect, Marquez said the measures will cover three major areas: stockpiles--to prevent hoarding; employment; and training. The measures are intended to raise Venezuelans' standard of living, although most problems will not be totally resolved, Marquez noted. Venezuelans are anxious following the collapse of seven banks and last week's 8.65 percent devaluation of the bolivar to the level of 210 bolivares to the dollar. Local economists have said that Caldera is leaning toward exchange rate controls, a measure the economy minister opposes. Marquez said he supports controls on prices and imports because those measures will stamp out speculation and capital flight.
