FBIS4-33724 "drlat112_c_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-112 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 MEXICO Spanish Minister Interviewed on ETA Operations Spanish Minister Interviewed on ETA Operations PA0906211094 Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 9 Jun 94 PA0906211094 Mexico City XEW Television Network Spanish BFN [From the "24 Hours" newscast] [Text] There is increasing evidence that the ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] could be operating in Mexico. New Spanish Justice Minister Juan Alberto Belloch's priority is to eliminate ETA terrorism. As for the ETA's presence in Mexico, the minister said it does exist and that its members could be active. [Begin recording] [Belloch] We have suspicions. We and the Mexican authorities have nothing more than suspicions. We suspect that some of them could be active ETA militants. [Unidentified reporter] What do you mean when you say active ETA militants? [Belloch] They are people who have connections with the criminal organization and are potentially capable of providing economic support and could even cooperate with other terrorist groups, both in Mexico and Latin America. They could be planning to use Mexico as a springboard. The importance of Mexico in this regard is evident and they could be tempted to use Mexico as they did France. They may want to create an operations base with alliances with other forms of terrorism, adversely affecting both Mexico and other countries of Central America and Latin America. [end recording] He added that he wants to visit Mexico to meet with his Mexican counterpart and exchange viewpoints. [Begin Belloch recording] There is great interest in visiting your country. I would like to have a relationship similar to the one we currently have with France in the analysis of this topic. I believe it is appropriate to take preventive actions instead of waiting for them to consolidate a stable base in Mexico, which Spain and Mexico both are evidently not interested in. [end recording] Belloch said it is not possible for the ETA to carry out attacks in Mexico today, but if the problem is not dealt with now, it could do so in the future. The truth is that since last week, when Spanish Justice Minister Juan Alberto Belloch traveled to Paris to meet with his French counterpart, Charles Pasqua [name as heard], the efforts to fight terrorism have been greatly intensified even though they had reached a high level in the past few years, especially since 1984. In the last few days, heavy blows have been dealt to the ETA with new arrests.
