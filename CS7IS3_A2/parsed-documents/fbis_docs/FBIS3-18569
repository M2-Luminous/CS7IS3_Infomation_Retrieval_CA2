The emergence of social movements and the impressive mobilization of lay school defenders open new prospects for the Left. Nevertheless, if the improvement in the partial legislative elections reinvigorates it, this does not reverse the balance of power. Ten months after its rout, the PS seems unable to present a credible alternative. [passage omitted] The scars of the March 1993 defeat do not explain everything. In politics, one year is an eternity, and the opposition has regenerative qualities. The disaffection affecting the Left has a deeper cause: the lack of credibility of the PS' first secretary. At a time when [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur is paralyzing for the moment the game on the Right because he is considered the winner of the race to the presidency under any circumstances, Michel Rocard is blocking the game on the Left because he has the image of a loser. Polls indicate that he will be beaten by a wide margin regardless of the identity of his adversary from the majority. The most recent CSA-LE PARISIEN poll on the popularity of presidential candidates places him in 10th place with 27 percent of the vote. Even more worrisome for Rocard is the fact that he is far behind [EC Commission president] Jacques Delors, who gathers 44 percent of the vote. Rocard is even overtaken by [former Minister of Culture] Jack Lang (28 percent). Considering his personal qualities, the disaffection burdening the PS boss is no doubt unfair. However, it is explained by his inability to convince his own camp. Placed under high-level surveillance in the PS, Rocard moreover suffers from his being the man most detested by [President] Francois Mitterrand, who remains the most emblematic figure of the Left. Like [Union for French Democracy, UDF leader] Valery Giscard d'Estaing, and to a lesser degree [Rally for the Republic, RPR, leader] Jacques Chirac, Rocard is laboring under the burden of the attrition affecting officials who have been in the limelight for more than 20 years. Rocard is the heaviest handicap of the Left, which has no lack of talented personalities. Laurent Fabius is the most gifted politician of the forty-something generation. Unlike the majority, the Left also has a galaxy of (young) women politicians capable of incarnating the future: Elisabeth Guigou, Segolene Royal, and Martine Aubry. The emergence of the former minister of labor is particularly significant. [passage omitted] The changing of the guards does exist in the PS. However, the Left is playing with marked cards. Partisan logic will probably impose Rocard's candidacy even if the Left has a credible candidate in Delors. He gathered 53 percent of the vote in the last S0FRES poll, compared with 38 percent for Rocard (69 percent among leftist partisans for Delors, 63 percent for Rocard). The former can attract beyond his camp, the latter is contested by his own people. However, just like the Right, the Left is intent on justifying the thesis that "the best one loses." In this game, the socialists seem to be ahead of the majority.
