The results of the debates at that meeting will be supplied to the candidates for president of the republic, and they will be invited to participate in the closing session. "This project of ours dates back to 1992, but we decided to postpone the end of the discussion until the last half of the year because 1994 is an election year, and it will provide an excellent opportunity to reflect on political education and the exercise of citizenship," says Demetrio Valentini, bishop of Jales, Sao Paulo, and head of the CNBB's Pastoral Commission on Social Affairs. The objectives and agenda of the Second Social Week, the topic of which is "Brazil, Alternatives and Protagonists," will be announced on the 24th of this month by Bishop Demetrio and the president of the CNBB, Bishop Luciano Mendes de Almeida. "We will publish the text that will serve as the working document for debate on the basis of the conclusions reached at the "regional weeks" which, over the past two years, have resulted in viable alternatives for building the Brazil that people want," Demetrio announced. Depending on the results of the debates in Brasilia, the CNBB will publish or recommend that the bishops of Brazil's 245 dioceses publish booklets providing guidance for the elections. The head of the Pastoral Commission on Social Affairs points out that the church's concern is not limited to the electoral aspect; it will take advantage of this opportunity to discuss the future of Brazil. "Even if we publish booklets, study notes, or any other kind of document, we are not going to endorse parties or candidates. We will draw attention to values and principles that will provide the voters with norms so they can make the best choices," Demetrio said. The church intends to influence the process, he admits, but without engaging in partisan politics. "We want to lay the foundation so that no matter who wins the election, there will be a consensus capable of ensuring the country's governability." The CNBB is also concerned about the tone of the campaign: "The campaign must not be reduced to personal attacks, because the people are expecting the candidates to present their ideas and proposals," the bishop warns. Regardless of their ideological leanings, all the politicians vying for the most important offices -- especially the posts of state governor and president of the Republic -- will be invited to debate their programs. Booklets for Sao Paulo Faithful Two episcopal regions in the Archdiocese of Sao Paulo -- Brasilandia and Santana, both in the capital's Northern Zone -- are already preparing booklets to provide voters with guidance. Neither of the two will mention the names of candidates or parties, but their documents, written in colloquial style, will draw attention to good qualities and denounce manipulations as a way of helping the faithful make their choices. The work is being done by groups from the Pastoral Commission on Faith and Politics, which are debating alternatives to the national crisis. "We have the support of our bishop, Angelico Bernardino, but he is not intervening directly in the discussion," says social worker Fatima de Araujo Giorlano, one of the coordinators of the Brasilandia group. The bishop is merely supervising the publications to ensure that they conform to the doctrine of the Catholic Church. At the Alceu Amoroso Lima Center in the Santana episcopal region, the Pastoral Commission on Faith and Politics vows that in this year's elections, it will repeat the success it had with a booklet published in connection with the election of the mayor and municipal councilors in 1992. "Norma and Maximo, the two people who illustrated the texts on the municipal elections, will be back to do their best to convince people that it is important to vote," said bank employee Sonia Maria Gimenez, the center's secretary. The head of the Episcopal Vicariate for Builders of Society, Canon Dario Bevillacqua, has announced that the Archdiocese of Sao Paulo will not publish a general booklet because it prefers to leave that job to the pastoral groups.
