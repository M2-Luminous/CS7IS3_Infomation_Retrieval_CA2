FR940919-1-00003 FR940919-1-00001 (3) Radiological Consequences (d) Severe Accident Considerations (e) Implementation Specific Considerations Comments, advice and recommendations on a proposed rule reflecting the aforementioned features and any other pertinent points are invited from all interested persons. Particularly, comments and supporting reasons are requested on the following questions: 1. What are appropriate performance based criteria that should be included in the steam generator proposed rule to address steam generator inspection scope and frequency, nondestructive examination (NDE) equipment capabilities, NDE data analyst capabilities, performance demonstration and qualification of NDE systems, steam generator water chemistry requirements, flaw acceptance criteria, and steam generator tube repair methods? 2. What are the appropriate performance based criteria that should be incorporated into the proposed rule to define adequate tube integrity (vis-a-vis 10 CFR 50 Appendix A GDC 14)? 3. What information should be part of the steam generator proposed rule, and what information should be addressed in a Regulatory Guide? 4. How should the proposed rule be structured to assure that licensees make use of available operational experience and data applicable to steam generator integrity, and that licensees can establish and readily update steam generator programs? 5. How should the proposed rule address new or replacement steam generators versus degraded steam generators? 6. Should the Regulatory Guide be prescriptive in terms of the methods to be used to ensure that the proposed rule's performance criteria are achieved? 7. Should the proposed rule require licensees to submit their programs to NRC for review and approval before implementation? 8. What requirements should be instituted to provide improved or additional monitoring of primary-to-secondary leakage as a means to enhance defense-in-depth relative to steam generator tube degradation? 9. What changes should be made in the NUREG&hyph;0800 radiological calculation guidance used to address the safety significance of steam generator tube leakage and rupture? 10. What beyond design basis considerations related to steam generator tube integrity should be addressed during the rulemaking process (e.g., the potential for containment bypass)? 11. How should tube failure prevention and mitigation measures be balanced in the proposed rule? 12. What interim measures are appropriate to allow continued operation of a unit in which new degradation modes are discovered? 13. Is the proposed rulemaking action considered a necessary or preferred course of action for addressing steam generator maintenance and surveillance issues, or are there other alternative regulatory mechanisms that are equally effective for addressing these issues? If alternatives to rulemaking are preferred, describe the preferred alternatives, including the pros and cons of pursuing the alternative course of action. 14. How should the steam generator rule or associated Regulatory Guide address the following technical issues: (1) Calculation of tube leakage following postulated events such as the main steam line break and the potential for this leakage to exceed the make-up capacity of the refueling water storage tank (supply source for the emergency core cooling system), (2) application of eddy current parameters such as voltage that are indirect measures of tube structural or leakage integrity (as compared to more direct measures such as crack depth or crack length), and (3) calculation of radiologically significant isotope concentrations in released materials (I&hyph;131 equivalent) following postulated events such as the main steam line break with steam generator tube leakage where there is a paucity of data on fission product iodine release rates. The preliminary views expressed in this notice may change in light of comments received. In any case, there will be an opportunity later for additional public comment in connection with any proposed rule that may be developed by the NRC.
