At the same time, as early as 1 July 1994 a "largely budget-neutral" follow-up regulation is to be introduced, which will also include west German and foreign companies. According to this new regulation, all small and medium-sized companies in the producing industry and crafts get a "higher allowance" of 10 percent for investment in the new laender. However, they must not employ more than 250 people. The subsidized investment volume is being raised to a maximum of 10 million German marks [DM] per company and business year. For the 20-percent allowance the subsidized investment volume is only DM1 million.
