The Committee's Spokesman Yuriy Rogozhin told Interfax, his office received a letter from the Navy Commander, Admiral Felix Gromov, proposing interdepartmental inspection over nuclear safety in the navy. He said the committee is currently empowered to license army units for running their nuclear or radioactive facilities and inspect them. These powers were backed up by a decree issued by the president on November 12, 1992. The committee believes interdepartmental inspection instead of state control could lead to incidents at naval nuclear sites.
