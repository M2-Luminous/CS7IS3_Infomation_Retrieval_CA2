Taking part in the parade in the east Berlin district of Koepenick were 1,500 soldiers of the 6th Motorized Rifle Brigade, which has been stationed in Berlin for 49 years. About 20,000 of the capital's inhabitants and their guests lined the street to witness this historic event. A large number of honored guests, among them the Russian ambassador to Germany and representatives of the former Western allies and the Bundeswehr, viewed the parade of the Berlin Brigade, as it is known, from the VIP rostrum. In his speech, Mayor Eberhard Diepgen said the Berliners and the Russian forces leaving the city were parting in friendship. The mayor said he hoped many of the soldiers now returning to their homeland would come back to Berlin. "We want to remain good neighbors and friends," he said. Diepgen recalled that the Russians had first come to Germany, with many losses and sacrifices, 50 years previously as victors and liberators from National Socialism with the Western allies. That will remain their historic achievement. Since then there have been "good and bad days," and there had often been "difficult times," Diepgen went on. He paid tribute to the "special services" which the Western Group of Russian forces had rendered in the days of the peaceful revolution in eastern Germany. Colonel General Matvey Burlakov, supreme commander of the Western Group of Russian forces in Germany, said the Berlin Brigade is the last unit of Russian troops to leave German territory. He had a "feeling of mission accomplished." Burlakov said that the departure of Russian troops is proceeding exactly according to schedule. Approximately 98 percent of the 500,000 men, the 123,000 weapons and pieces of equipment, and around 2.6 million tonnes of material has already been withdrawn over the past three-and-a-half years. This process will be completed by the end of August. The joy at returning to the homeland is, however, mixed with sadness at saying farewell to the befriended German people, Burlakov said. The program was staged by the company forming the honor guard and the Western Group of Forces military orchestra. The Berlin Brigade sang "Farewell Germany" in German and Russian. This was followed by a performance by the Western Group's song and dance company.
