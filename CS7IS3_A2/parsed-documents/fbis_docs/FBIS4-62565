The general participates in the talks between the defence ministers of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh in Moscow. The draft document on dispatching of Russian peace keepers to Abkhazia was submitted to President Boris Yeltsin for approval. The deputy defence minister noted that the peace-keeping force will be stationed in the security zone along the Inguri river as well as in the Galskiy district and the Kodorskoye Gorge to control the ceasefire and assist the return of refugees and displaced persons. Kondratyev claimed that differences in the Georgian parliament will not interfere with the implementation of the agreement signed in Moscow. "Wisdom should subdue ambitions. The present situation in Georgia is less advantageous than that in Abkhazia. Therefore, its leadership should make some concessions," the general said. According to the Moscow agreement, apart from disengagement of the sides along the Inguri river, the Georgian side is to withdraw its troops to places of their deployment outside Abkhazia from the Kodorskoye Gorge under the control of a peace-keeping force from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and U.N. observers. At the same time, all voluntary detachments which arrived from outside Abkhazia, should be disbanded and withdrawn. The sides requested the Council of the heads of CIS member states to take a decision on the use of collective peace keepers in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. ITAR-TASS learnt at the press service of the Georgian Embassy in Moscow that it is highly probable that peace keepers will enter the conflict zone on June 1. The process of disengagement is to be completed no longer than within ten days from the time of its beginning.
