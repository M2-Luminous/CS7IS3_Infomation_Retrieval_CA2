FR940822-1-00034 FR940822-1-00006 Rationale for the Proposed Rule Conceptual Basis The overall conceptual basis for decommissioning, as proposed in this rulemaking, consists of an objective to reduce the residual radioactivity at the site so that it is indistinguishable from the background, a limit on the dose considered acceptable for release of a site with a stipulation that dose be as far below this limit as reasonably achievable (i.e., ALARA), provisions in regulatory guidance for administrative relief from performing sophisticated ALARA analyses for licensees who have little or no site contamination, provisions for restricted termination of a license when physical remediation activities cannot achieve the limit, and enhanced provisions for public participation. The limit for release of a site is 15 mrem/y (0.15 mSv/y) TEDE for residual radioactivity distinguishable from background. If doses from residual radioactivity are less than 15 mrem/y TEDE, the Commission will terminate the license and authorize release of the site for unrestricted use following the licensee's demonstration that the residual radioactivity at the site is ALARA. The Commission expects the licensee to make every reasonable effort to reduce residual radioactivity to levels that will allow unrestricted release of the site. However, the Commission will consider terminating a license in cases where restrictions must be imposed on the use of the site to ensure that public doses are maintained below the 15 mrem/y (0.15 mSv/y) TEDE limit, provided the licensee: (1) Can demonstrate that further reductions in residual radioactivity necessary to comply with the 15 ␣mrem/y TEDE limit for unrestricted use are not technically achievable, would be prohibitively expensive, or would result in net public or environmental harm; (2) Has made adequate provisions for institutional controls to reduce annual TEDE from residual radioactivity distinguishable from background to the average member of the appropriate critical group to 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) TEDE; (3) Has provided sufficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party to assume and carry out responsibilities for any necessary control and maintenance of the site; and (4) Has reduced the residual radioactivity at the site so that the TEDE from residual radioactivity would not exceed 100 mrem (1 mSv) per year even if the restrictions applied in the termination were no longer effective in limiting the possible scenarios or pathways of exposure. The Commission estimates that there may be several existing licensed sites (no more than a few tens) containing large quantities of materials contaminated with low level radioactivity where health and environment may best be protected by onsite stabilization and disposal. The contamination was generated over the last several decades using practices that generally would not be found satisfactory today without adequate plans and financial assurance for decommissioning. In some cases, a responsible public or private entity may no longer exist or be viable for discharging its responsibility for ensuring protection of the public and the environment. In other cases, the contamination may have been generated through research or development contracts with the Federal government or given special consideration in Federal law. Due to the unique characteristics of these sites when compared with the much larger population of licensed nuclear facilities, the Commission contemplates that the owners and operators of these facilities may seek exemptions from the decommissioning criteria under the general provisions in 10 CFR 20.2301. Such sites, and the considerations associated with them, are not unlike disposal sites for uranium mill tailings, and may need to be provided with equivalent types of controls to ensure sufficient protection. At a minimum, the Commission would require that the public health and environmental protection requirements developed for these unique cases be consistent with other appropriate regulatory requirements for disposal of radioactive waste, including those in 10 CFR Part 61 ``Licensing Requirements for Land Disposal of Radioactive Waste'' or 10 CFR Part 40, Appendix A ``Criteria Relating to the Operation of Uranium Mills and the Disposition of Tailings or Wastes Produced by the Extraction or Concentration of Source Material from Ores Processed Primarily for their Source Material Content.'' Any Commission decision on such exemption requests and the disposition of these sites would be made on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the risks and benefits of all viable alternatives including remediation of the site to meet the criteria in this rule. Proper disposition of these sites may require some type of durable institutional control, such as placing the site under the custody of a State or Federal agency, to ensure long-term protection of the public and environment. For example, for a former licensed site in West Virginia, the final disposition included action by Congress that provided for transfer of the site to Federal custody and ongoing DOE oversight. Such an analysis would have to consider all significant risks to humans and the environment resulting from the decommissioning process (including transportation and disposal of radioactive wastes generated in the process) and from residual radioactivity remaining at the site following termination of the license. The Commission specifically solicits comments on this approach to the handling of these unique cases, including proposals for alternative strategies which could be used to assure adequate protection of public health and the environment. The Commission envisions that the scope of the exemption request would be limited to the radiological criteria for unrestricted or restricted release. Due to the unique nature of these sites and the comprehensive evaluation necessary to support such an exemption request, the Commission would require that a meaningful and substantial process be used by the licensee or the NRC itself for informing and involving the public in the decision. Consequently, the Commission would not favorably entertain exemption requests unless they were developed through a process consistent with the public involvement processes required in this rule. For any process conducted by the NRC, the Commission would solicit participation from: the Environmental Protection Agency; local and State governments; persons residing in the vicinity of the site; citizen, environmental, environmental justice, and other public interest groups; Indian Nation or other indigenous people that have treaty or statutory rights that could be affected; and other affected parties. For example, in reviewing proposed decommissioning actions at two licensed sites in Ohio and New Jersey, the Commission has initiated development of Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) for both sites and recently held public meetings on the scope of the EISs with the intent to fully explore the alternatives and potential impacts associated with the disposal of the contaminated material. As a part of this process, NRC is working closely with EPA, State, local representatives, and members of the public to develop acceptable alternatives. The site-specific process applied at these sites by the NRC is attempting to include participation by all affected parties to assure continued protection of public health and safety through a viable and effective decommissioning approach. Although the Commission recognizes there may be existing sites where public health and the environment may best be protected by onsite stabilization and disposal, the Commission does not believe that future activities should result in additional sites that would not be able to meet the criteria in this rule. Therefore, the Commission is proposing to add a new §20.1408 to its regulations which would require that applicants for licenses, other than renewals, describe in the application how facility design and procedures for operation will minimize contamination of the facility and the environment, facilitate eventual decommissioning, and minimize the generation of radioactive waste. Definitions The following definitions already present in the regulations would be revised: The definition of Background Radiation (10 CFR 20.1003) would be revised so that fallout from past nuclear accidents like Chernobyl which contribute to background radiation and are not under the control of the licensee are included in the definition. The Commission does not believe it is reasonable for licensees to be required to remediate material over which they have no control and which is present at comparable levels in the environment both on and off of the site. The definition of Decommission would be revised to also provide for termination of a license and release of property under restricted conditions. This revision was requested by a large number of commenters at the workshops on decommissioning. Those commenters felt that the NRC should recognize that it may not be feasible to decontaminate some sites to a level appropriate for unrestricted use and that restrictions on the subsequent use of such sites could be used to provide an additional measure of public protection.
