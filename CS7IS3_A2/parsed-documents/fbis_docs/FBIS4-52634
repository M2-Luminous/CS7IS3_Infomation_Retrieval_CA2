The concept for the construction of an Islamic Center, which was originally developed in the holy city of Mekkah, has been positively received by a number of cabinet ministers, deputy cabinet ministers, and community leaders, who have expressed their willingness to make this idea a reality. This was stated by retired Gen M. Jusuf. At the program for opening the Muslim month of fasting in Jakarta on 3 March the deputy chairman of BAPEKA [Financial Inspection Board] said that the Islamic Center is intended to help the government to train Indonesians to be healthy and well educated and to believe in God. The Islamic Center will stand on a nine hectare piece of ground which formerly was part of the campus of Hasanuddin University. General Jusuf said that a mosque will be built at the Islamic Center to accommodate 10,000 of the faithful as well as a meeting hall with a capacity of 5,000 people. As quoted by ANTARA news agency, Jusuf added that in addition a building for Islamic educational programs will be constructed, ranging from kindergarten through SLTA [senior technical high school]. It will be equipped with a library, a laboratory, and a polyclinic. For students who come from outside the city of Ujungpandang dormitories will be built for both boys and girls. A foundation to manage the Islamic Center has already been established. A number of cabinet ministers and deputy ministers, in their private capacities, have expressed their willingness to sit on the executive council of the foundation. They are: Azwar Anas (coordinating minister for the people's welfare), Ginandjar Kartasasmita (minister of state for national development planning and also chairman of BAPPENAS--the National 373 Development Planning Board), R. M. Yogi Suardi Memet (minister of home affairs), Edi Sudrajat (minister of defense and security), Tunky Ariwibowo (minister of industry), Mar'ie Muhammad (minister of finance), Dr Tarmizi Taher (minister of religious affairs), Doctor Sujudi (minister of health), Radinal Moochtar (minister of public works), and Abdul Latief (minister of manpower). Other figures who have expressed their willingness to take part in this activity are Gen Feisal Tanjung (commander of the Indonesian armed forces), Gen Wismoyo Arismunandar (Army chief of staff), and Dr Nurcholis Madjid. Meanwhile, Dr Munawir Sadzali (deputy minister of home affairs) has stated that he is willing to take part in this project. Jusuf declared that the Islamic Center which is to be constructed will belong to the religious community and especially to the Islamic community. Therefore, he invited the Islamic community to complete its construction successfully. Aburizal Bakrie, general chairman of KADIN [Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry], led a group of businessmen who attended the meeting, including H. Sudwikatmono, H. Ibrahim Risjad, H. Yusuf Kalla, Fadel Muhammad, Tantri Abeng, Prayogo Pangestu, and Henri Pribadi. They also expressed their willingness to help in making this plan a reality. Mar'ie Muhammad (minister of finance), who spoke in his private capacity, said that the objective of constructing the Islamic Center is not only to build a mosque and school. This project reaches far into the future, involving national development and the national character. Meanwhile, Nurcholis Madjid, a young Islamic leader who also spoke at the meeting, said that the construction of the Islamic Center is an appropriate objective. This activity is a forward step in anticipating the needs of the Islamic community during the coming decades.
