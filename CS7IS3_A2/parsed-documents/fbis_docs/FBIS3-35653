This paradoxical aspiration has a logic of its own: the faster the conflict will be settled the fewer people will die. Besides, the Republic will be able to reform the economy and solve the basic social problems. The Republic authorities policy is based on these factors.? President Aliyev has emphasized the main direction of it at his recent meeting with one of the units of the National Army. According to him, peace could be achieved on condition that Armenian troops withdraw immediately from occupied Azeri territory. This will create a basis for thorough negotiations on resolution of the conflict. The president is sure that cessation of hostilities as well as restoration of relationships between Azerbaijan and Armenia are to be discussed at the talks in order to prevent possibility of a new conflict between the two neighbors in the future. Meanwhile, Azeri analysts take guesses at reasons for postponement of Moscow negotiations between Azerbaijani and Armenian high officials, which was expected to be held with participation of the Russian president. According to them, a coordinated Russian and Armenian plan on resolution of the problem will be proposed to Azerbaijan. The plan in particular specifies that the Armenian party will withdraw its troops from territory seized beyond Nagorno-Karabakh provided Azerbaijan allows Russian peace-keeping ?roops to be stationed in the war zone. The Minsk Conference of t?e CSCE is charged to determine exactly the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. Though authorities of Azerbaijan have not yet expressed their attitude to this matter, Azerbaijan can hardly accept this plan if Armenians and Russians should propose it. Azerbaijan has repeatedly stated that Armenian Armed Forces must be withdrawn without any preliminary terms in accordance with the UN Security Council's resolutions. In this context, the Azerbaijani party considers recent military success of the National Army a guarantee of a beginning of Armenian troops withdrawal. As for the status of the conflict region, the Azerbaijani party is ready to discuss this matter within frames of an international organization but considers that the last word must belong to Azerbaijan. According to another version, spread by some local newspapers with reference to word of Ramiz Rizayev, the plenipotentiary of Azerbaijan in Russia, the Moscow meeting is postponed because a document on complete and unconditional withdrawal of all the Armenian Armed Forces from territory of Azerbaijan has not yet been prepared. The Azeri party will come to the negotiating table as soon as this agreement is signed, the plenipotentiary said. According to his intensive consultations in order to work out this agreement are going on. It is expected that, Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov will soon visit the Russian capital by this reason. Meanwhile, many analysts stress that the Azerbaijani leadership will ask Russia to mediate between the two sides. An appeal to ask for mediating effort of only one state may result in serious problem in future, says the opposition, mainly the Popular [People's] Front, meaning that Russia could strengthen its control over the Transcaucasian region. According to them, the political resolution of the conflict must be carried out with assistance of international organization.
