FR940812-2-00180 FR940812-2-00065 Our NOI questioned whether the 1992 Cable Act's direction to the FCC to update §76.51 sought to bring a change in the copyright laws or the cable compulsory license. See 58 FR at 34594 n. 1 (June 28, 1993) (``It cannot be definitively said that Congress sought to bring about a change in the copyright laws or the administration of the cable compulsory license through this provision.''). Some of the commentators to this proceeding have produced evidence in the legislative history that is strongly suggestive of a congressional effort to clarify the local/distant status of broadcast signals. This history includes correspondence between the licensee of WWAT (TV) Chillocothe, Ohio, one of the communities subject to the 1993 FCC redesignation; and Rep. McEwen requesting an amendment to the 1992 Cable Act to redesignate the Columbus, Ohio market to include Chillocothe, R & R Media Corp. comments, at appendix; and a statement of Rep. John Dingell, Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, endorsing the adoption of the McEwen amendment into the 1992 Cable Act requiring the FCC to update §76.51 of its rules, 138 Cong. Rec. H6529 (daily ed. July 23, 1992). Moreover, the Senate version, which ultimately became the law, omitted the language in the 1992 House cable bill, stating that nothing in the bill should be construed to affect the Copyright Act. We conclude that it is sound copyright policy to accept the FCC's redesignations 4 of markets in the §76.51 list for cable compulsory license purposes beginning with the Commission's March 29, 1993, Report & Order redesignating the Ohio, Connecticut, and Georgia markets. Acceptance of redesignations promotes greater uniformity between the operation of the copyright and communications laws, and is a better assessment of the reality of modern television marketplaces. Broadcast stations that for all intents and purposes compete and operate in a major television market can, through FCC redesignation, establish their location within that market. Their localition within that market should be recognized with respect to the cable compulsory license. All of the commentators agree that it is permissible for the Copyright Office to recognize FCC market redesignations of §76.51 for purposes of 17 U.S.C. 111. We therefore reaffirm our 1987 Policy Decision by ``formally adopt[ing] the view that signals entitled to mandatory carriage status under the FCC's former must-carry rules as a result of an FCC market redesignation order are to be treated as local signals for purposes of the cable compulsory license.'' 52 FR 28366 (July 29, 1987). 4 By ``redesignation,'' we mean the addition or deletion of communities to the top 100 television markets already appearing on the §76.51 list. While we will accept market redesignations now and in the future, we are aware of the possibility that, over time, a large number of market redesignations could dramatically affect the royalty structure of the cable compulsory license. There were approximately 400 petitions for redesignation pending at the FCC when the Copyright Office began its inquiry into §76.51 in 1985, see 52 FR at 28366, and while there is nowhere near that number before the FCC at this time, it is difficult to predict how many redesignation petitions the Commission will receive in the future. Extensive addition of new communities to existing markets could significantly raise the number of local signals carried by cable systems, thereby resulting in considerable decreases in royalties paid for distant signals. While we have said that we will accept future FCC redesignations as a matter of course, we are mindful that Congress expressly chose to freeze the 1976 must-carry rules for copyright purposes so as not to ``materially affect the royalty fee payments provided in the legislation.'' H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 99 (1976). Should there come a day when the number of redesignations ``materially affect[s] the royalty fee payments'' under the cable compulsory license, the Copyright Office may find it necessary to make its concerns public, to call the issue to the attention of Congress, and petition for a legislative solution. In addition to market redesignations, we have also considered the issue of possible future reranking of markets on the §76.51 list. Reranking would be the reordering of markets as they appear in §76.51, including the addition or deletion of markets. Because the FCC has currently declined to consider the reranking of major television markets, see Report & Order, 8 FCC Rcd 2965, 2978 (1994), and there is no petition before the Commission seeking a reranking of §76.51, we agree with the majority of commentators that the results of reranking on Copyright Office policy are not ripe for decision at this time. We are, however, troubled by the implications of reranking. In its comments the Federal Communications Commission, in discussing its 1993 Report & Order updating §76.51, noted that the commentators to that proceeding ``generally suggested that the FCC not rerank markets.'' FCC, comments at 3. In a footnote, the FCC added: Those opposing a reranking of the markets generally contend that such action was unnecessary, impractical or would result in confusion and instability. However, in recognition of the dual communications and copyright implications of Section 76.51, virtually all commentators agreed that any changes with respect to market rankings be done in conjunction with the Copyright Office. Id . n. 11. We heartily agree that, should the FCC consider a reranking of §76.51 in the future, it is both necessary and proper for the Commission and the Copyright Office to consult with one another, and we welcome the opportunity to work with the Commission on such an important issue, should the need arise. In spite of our considerable doubts on the matter, we do not take a position as to what effect, if any, an FCC reranking of the §76.51 major television market list would have on the section 111 cable compulsory license because a decision on this issue would be premature at this time.
