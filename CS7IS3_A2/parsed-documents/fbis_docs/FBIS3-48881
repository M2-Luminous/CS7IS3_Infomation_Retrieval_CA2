The chairman made his decision so the party can avoid being isolated in the coalition alliance. It will be difficult for pro-reformist SDPJ members, not to mention those advocating taking cautious stance on reforming the electoral system, to accept easing the ban on corporate donations. However, Murayama judged: "The party could not gain the support of voters if it were to oppose the revisions at this time," since the bills were rejected at the upper house plenary session due to a considerable number of party dissidents who voted against them. But even if the party executives made such a decision, it is likely "there will be more than 10 dissidents opposed to the single-seat constituency system" (as stated by a senior party official). Thus, it seems inevitable the SDPJ will further lose its influence among the coalition parties, and Murayama and other party executives may inevitably have to resign. At the news conference, Murayama said: "Since Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono have reached an agreement following lower house Speaker Takako Doi's proposal, the party will support this." "Regarding corporate donations, it is disappointing we inevitably had to accept the designation of one fund-raising body to receive such donations, but that cannot be helped from a general standpoint," he added, as he tried to hide his regret. Regarding his future course of action, Murayama said: "I plan to make a progress report at the party's general meeting of members of both houses of the Diet on 29 January and also at the Central Executive Committee meeting which will eventually be held." He thus hinted he may resign after taking care of necessary matters in the aftermath. The SDPJ seems to be holding itself together through a delicate balance between those advocating taking a cautious stance on reforming the electoral system and the pro-reformists. On such an understanding, Murayama sought for a way to avoid having to accept drastic concessions on the political reform bills that could cause the party to fall apart. At a meeting of senior party officials held inside the Diet building in the early hours of 28 January, Murayama indicated he wished to prevent Prime Minister Hosokawa and LDP President Kono from holding their top-level meeting which would likely lead to the coalition having to make considerable concessions to the LDP. As a "third alternative," Murayama hoped to settle the deadlocked situation by having the house speaker act as a mediator. In this way, he resorted to "asking help from Ms. Doi in times of trouble," although to no avail. The top-level meeting was held, and the coalition made considerable concessions, just as Murayama feared. Only the "left half" of the SDPJ tried to prevent the coalition from having to make considerable concessions on the political reform bills. Party members in favor of reforming the electoral system were already prepared to accept the expected concessions, saying: "It is possible that discussion on revisions which could supersede the coalition proposal presented at the meeting of the joint committee of both houses of the Diet may be held at the top-level meeting" (as stated by SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo). Pro-reformists, led by a policy group called the "Democrats," have campaigned to collect signatures for a proposal to oust from the party those "dissident Diet members" who voted against the political reform bills at the recent upper house plenary session. They have thus put a check on Murayama, who has been supported by those advocating taking a cautious stance on the political reform bills. As of 28 January, the pro-reformists have obtained signatures from 35 lower house members and 32 upper house members from the SDPJ, excluding cabinet ministers and Central Executive Committee members. Senior party officials belonging to the pro-reformist groups are confident of rallying together a majority, saying: "The proposal to oust dissident members and efforts to promote political reform are just the opposite sides of the same coin. Since our party is responsible for the bills being rejected at the upper house, it has no right to complain about revisions to key points of the bills. There also are many members who have not signed the proposal but support it. There may be only 20 opponents in the lower house at the most." Under such circumstances, Murayama decided to accept the revisions. However, it is inevitable that the party's status among the coalition parties will now grow weaker.
