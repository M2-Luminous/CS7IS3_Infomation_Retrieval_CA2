Speaking at the national employment meeting here, Zhang said that the expected system will help create a solid labor market for the development of China's market economy. He said that China will this year choose 100 enterprises and ten cities nationwide to try out the system and will trace the development of their overall unemployment rate, long-term unemployment rate, under-employment rate and other economic figures. Meanwhile, China will refer to internationally adopted practices in analyzing and supervising labor markets, the official said. China will also promulgate a set of macro unemployment insurance regulations that suit the country's real conditions so as to standardize management of the labor market. Official statistics show that, in addition to 130 million surplus rural laborers, China has 4.1 million jobless urban workers, or 2.6 percent of the total urban workforce. China's employment situation is extremely difficult, and the country now is faced with unprecedented challenges in deploying all the jobless, said Li Boyong, Chinese minister of labor. To keep the government well informed on the true picture of the country's unemployment and labor supply and demand, China will strive to register the unemployed and give out unemployment relief and employment services according to their particular circumstances. Zhang said that economic progress is the way to provide for expanded employment, adding that the collective economy and the service sector are expected to be the chief absorbers of the unemployed. He said that China will do its utmost to keep the unemployment rate in the vicinity of three percent.
