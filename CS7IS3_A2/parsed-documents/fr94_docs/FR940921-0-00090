FR940921-0-00090 FR940921-0-00016 (C) Oxides of nitrogen. ( 1 ) 5.0 grams per brake horsepower-hour (1.9 grams per megajoule), as measured under transient operating conditions. ( 2 ) A manufacturer may elect to include any or all of its natural gas-fueled Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine families in any or all or the NO X averaging, trading or banking programs for heavy-duty engines, within the restrictions described in §86.094&hyph;15. If the manufacturer elects to include engine families in any of these programs, the NO X FELs may not exceed 5.0 grams per brake horsepower-hour (1.9 grams per megajoule). This ceiling value applies whether credits for the family are derived from averaging, trading or banking programs. * * * * * (3)(i) A manufacturer may certify one or more Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine configurations intended for use in all vehicles to the emission standards set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii), (a)(1)(iv) or (a)(1)(vi) of this paragraph: Provided, that the total model year sales of such configuration(s), segregated by fuel type, being certified to the emission standards in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section represent no more than five percent of total model year sales of each fuel type Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine intended for use in vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of up to 14,000 pounds by the manufacturer. (ii) The configurations certified to the emission standards of paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (vi) of this section under the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section shall still be required to meet the evaporative emission standards set forth in paragraphs §86.096&hyph;10(b)(1)(i), (b)(2)(i) and (b)(3)(i). * * * * * 35.
