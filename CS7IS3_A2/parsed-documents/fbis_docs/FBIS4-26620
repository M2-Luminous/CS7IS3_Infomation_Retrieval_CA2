These agreements were within the 22 documents on cooperation in energy, space, environment, nuclear safety and other areas between the two countries signed by U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Russian visiting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The signing came at the end of a two-day meeting of a number of U.S.-Russian committees established 14 months ago when presidents of both countries met in Vancouver, Canada. Before the ceremony, Chernomyrdin met briefly with U.S. President Bill Clinton. According to the accord, the U.S. will invest 10 billion dollars in Russia's oil and natural gas production in Sakhalin Island as well as widened environmental protection cooperation. The accord on plutonium stipulates that both U.S. and Russia stop operation of plutonium production reactors by the year 2000. Russia has three such reactors in operation, two still producing weapons grade plutonium. The joint committees meet twice a year alternatively in Washington and Moscow. Gore will head a U.S. delegation to Russia in the winter for the fourth meeting.
