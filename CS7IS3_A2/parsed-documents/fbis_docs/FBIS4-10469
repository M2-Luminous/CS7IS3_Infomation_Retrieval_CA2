Regardless of the solutions that may be found, it is necessary to guarantee full observance of the law and compliance with legal norms as fundamental principles in preserving the state of law. I have therefore decided that the Government Ministry will have the support of the Defense Ministry in an effort to provide honest citizens with the security they have previously lacked so they can achieve their personal aspirations. I reaffirm the government's commitment to consolidate democracy and the state of law. I have ordered an immediate budget allocation for the civilian security forces that will allow them to readily acquire the necessary resources to fulfill their duty of safeguarding the lives, property, and interests of the Guatemalan people. My government believes the security issue is critical. It is necessary for the Guatemalan people to support all initiatives to attain peace and security, especially by filing charges in a due and timely manner with the state's security organizations according to the procedure set forth by the Republic's laws. It has never been so important for the people to regain their hopes of achieving real paths toward security. We must end the unfortunate tradition of police forces being incapable of resolving the problems that generate uncertainty and helplessness among citizens. The current government is promoting these changes and it will not rest until they have been made. The authorities, however, cannot be left alone to achieve this national objective. All sectors must play their proper role. In this sense I want to ask for the media's cooperation to help us face this problem objectively by not listening to the sectors that are trying to destroy Guatemala's international image. It is also important to note, without trying to justify our current conditions, that another one of our unfortunate inheritances from previous administrations is the abandonment of the civilian security forces. Previous governments stripped them of vital resources and passively allowed their moral deterioration by condoning corruption. I must also note a paradox. Now that we have a government that truly respects human rights, our opportunities to purchase equipment for the security forces have been limited abroad under the argument that the current government does not respect these human rights. That is obviously not true because we are frequently accused of being extremely tolerant and of not taking the severe actions that some would like. To return to the central part of my message, which is the decision to have the national defense minister support the government minister in providing public security, I must inform the national and international public that such a decision will be carried out according to the objectives of the Guatemalan Army as established in Article 244 of our political Constitution, which are to preserve national peace and security. Continuous evaluation and analysis of the results will provide the necessary criterion on which to base the decision, in an extreme case, to establish a state of emergency and enforce public order controls. Army participation in the security plan does not imply that the country will be placed under military control, as certain persons or groups might think. It simply means that the efforts of all the state's institutions are being brought together to provide maximum security for the people and their property. The Army and the various police bodies will work with full force, but within the law, against those groups that have perpetrated acts of violence and created an atmosphere of insecurity and uncertainty among the population. The government has maintained full respect for the law and will continue its policy of absolute legality, but it will not hesitate to take drastic action against criminals. In conclusion, I wish to express my horror at the recent attacks against U.S. citizens. Such acts are instigated by groups harboring individual interests and are part of an organized strategy to harm the good relations that fortunately exist between our two countries. As part of the new security plans, we will act with full force against the groups that are instigating this violence against U.S. citizens. As a part of its new public security plan, the Government of the Republic hereby reiterates its determination to implement whatever actions are necessary to safeguard the lives, safety, and property not only of Guatemalans but of the foreigners living among us or visiting us for business or pleasure. I have said that I received a nation at war and that I hope to hand it over in peace. To do so, however, I need everyone's help. I ask you all to report any act against defenseless citizens, Guatemalans or otherwise, to the security authorities. In most cases there has not been such assistance. We are all responsible for security. We will enforce order with the law in our hands. No more anarchy. Thank you for your attention and good night.
