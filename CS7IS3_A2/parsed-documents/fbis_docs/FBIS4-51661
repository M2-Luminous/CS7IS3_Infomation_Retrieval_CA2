In actuality, it appears to have become a unification of purpose to suppress discontent by various nations against other nations and to temporarily calm unstable movements in the markets which were a threat to the recovery of the world economy. As a result, an ironic outcome has been the postponement of action on almost all of the difficult issues such as unemployment and economic problems confronting Japan and the United States which are the major destabilizing factors of markets, making the real effects of the agreement an unknown quality. Before the opening of the G-7 meetings, a high-ranking Ministry of Finance (MOF) official said, "The principal role player in the upcoming G-7 is neither Japan nor the United States, but the market itself." The recent G-7 meetings were held just as the economies of the advanced nations were being violently shaken by fluctuations in the foreign exchange and debenture markets. The chairman's declaration read by U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen warned against excessive reactions of foreign exchange and debenture markets and had the strong effect of serving as a message to market sources. G-7 meetings in the past debated individual issues such as Japan's trade surpluses and the U.S. fiscal deficits and had the strong purpose of questioning the macroeconomic policies of the respective nations. However, insofar as the recent chairman's declaration is concerned, it stated, "The slow growth in certain nations has delayed the correction of international payments imbalances," thus suggesting domestic expansion of economic activity in Japan, but no signs of centering criticism on individual nations relative to separate issues. Foreign exchange rates which are leaning towards a high yen and low dollar have had an adverse effect on Japanese export firms and run the risk of delaying Japan's economic recovery. Even for the United States, a cheap dollar will cause a rise in long-term interest rates and will expose the economy to an unfavorable trend. A rise in long-term U.S. interest rates will not only frustrate an economic recovery, but will have an adverse effect on efforts to cut the fiscal deficit. And the impact will not be limited to those two phenomena. Sources at the International Financial Survey Department of the Industrial Bank of Japan state, "As concerns financial markets, especially relative to long-term interest rates, international linkage has been reinforced rather than providing for decoupling (separation of markets)." There's also the risk that higher interest rates in the United States will destroy the effects of financial easing measures in Germany. It was once considered a priority issue for the G-7 to take some kind of action against financial market turbulence of this nature. As an example, if friction between Japan and the United States on trade issues were to once again surface at the G-7 meetings, there is the possibility that the yen would climb even further. In the recent G-7 meetings, it appears it was a common perception among the G-7 nations that they wished to avoid to the degree possible any situation which could result in the exchange of criticism on individual issues. Needless to say, even though an agreement had been reached on stablizing foreign exchange and debenture markets, there is no guarantee that financial markets would react as anticipated by the governments of the respective nations. In fact, the Tokyo foreign exchange markets on the 25th had already taken into account the G-7 agreement on stabilizing foreign exchange markets and assumed no agreement had been reached on policies for renewed cooperative intervention and shifted to a higher yen and cheaper dollar. MOF sources in Japan which had found some solace in the inclusion of foreign exchange stabilization provisions in the chairman's declaration found their hopes for stability crushed at an early stage. We cannot say that there are no concrete effects because it was an agreement of a superficial nature. If the dollar falls to 100 yen in foreign currency markets, there is the possibility of intervention not only by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) but by European and U.S. authorities as well. Even BOJ officials insist that "we should take an objective stand relative to the chairman's declaration on foreign exchange markets," and suggest that the respective nations will react to any sharp rise in the yen. Any effort to put the advanced nations' economies back on the track of stable growth will require that importance be placed on the early execution of the the G-7 "growth strategy" calling for the United States to reduce its fiscal deficit, for European nations to continue their policy of monetary easing and for Japan to expand domestic demand and reduce its trade surplus. However, there are many pending issues, such as medical insurance reform in the United States as it affects U.S. fiscal policy and an expansion in the money supply in the area of German financial policy. In Japan, political turmoil has had an effect in delaying the implementation of economic measures and the tax reduction extension past the next fiscal year as revealed to the United States by Minister of Finance Fujii awaits coordination within the coalition government relative to how long it will remain in force before implmentation of provisions for offsetting tax increases as well as the scope of the tax reductions. Among G-7 nations, there lay a pile of issues, such as between Japan and the United States as to when talks will be resumed on the comprehensive economic measures. Even in connection with the issue of unemployment in advanced nations which was mentioned at the recent meetings, no concrete proposals were discussed and the issue was carried over for discussion at the upcoming Naples summit of leaders of advanced nations in July. The policy coordination position reflected in the recent G-7 chairman's declaration represented a unified position hurriedly established in the face of financial market threats, and any mistake by advanced nations in handling their roles could lead to a violent reaction from financial markets.
