At the meeting, the officials mentioned the reversion of Yomitan auxiliary airfield and said: "We will study the possibility of its return." It is the first positive comment U.S. officials have shown regarding return of Yomitan auxiliary airfield. The remarks came from Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord and Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Ross [name as received] following a request from Director General Yoneyama for a response on three pending matters -- return of Naha Naval Port, return of Yomitan airfield, and the suspension of live-shell firing exercises over prefectural highway 104. Yoneyama said: "It is the wish of the prefectural people to settle these issues." According to the DFA, until now the United States has only mentioned the possibility of moving the parachute training which is currently carried out at Yomitan auxiliary airfield. It has never before hinted at the return of the airfield, instead arguing that "it also acts as a radio wave impact area for both Torii and Sobe communications stations which are located near the auxiliary airfield." The United States has said that parachuting training could be held at other sites, but has maintained that "the return of the auxiliary airfield itself is difficult." At the 28 February meeting, however, the U.S. officials said: "We would like to study the possibility of returning the airfield once we have moved parachute training to another area." They reportedly showed their understanding of the feelings of the prefectural people toward U.S. military bases on Okinawa. It is also said they promised to exert efforts to cooperate with the Japanese Government to settle other issues as well. The DFA is taking a positive view of the remarks by the U.S. officials, saying: "It is a major advance that U.S. officials took positive line on the return of Yomitan auxiliary airfield." The agency hopes Director General Yoneyama will continue his meetings with high-level U.S. officials. He is due to arrive in Las Vegas on 1 March and visit San Diego on 2 March to make inspection tours of military bases. The bases include Nellis Air Force Base, which supervises night landing practices held in Japan; North Island Naval Base; and Miramar Naval Base. He is scheduled to meet base commanders and other officials.
