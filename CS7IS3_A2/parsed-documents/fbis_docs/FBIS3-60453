With this, the Government hopes to bring all of its yet-to-be-covered 66 endemic districts under multi-drug therapy and focus on the need for the rehabilitation of cured patients. Giving this information at the annual meeting of the voluntary organisations and state leprosy officers, the Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Mr B. Shankarananda, said an increase of 35 per cent in the grant-in-aid would be given to the voluntary organisations involved in the programme. As many as 285 voluntary organisations and NGOs are enlisted for this programme. Of the 201 districts in the country which have been identified as endemic for leprosy having more than five cases per 1000 population, 135 districts have been brought under the multi-drug therapy. Besides, there are 77 districts which are moderately endemic having two to five cases per 1000 population. While opening the two-day conference here, the Minister admitted to "having miles to go" before achieving the target of eradication of leprosy by 2000, even though there are about one million leprosy cases in the country which is one-fourth of 1981-82. Though the discharge of cured patients is more than twice the number of new cases, each year another three to four lakh new cases are being added. Rehabilitation problem: On rehabilitation, he called upon voluntary agencies to play a more active role. "As more and more patients are being treated, the problem of their proper rehabilitation in society is becoming more visible and acute. It is therefore essential to work out and initiate an appropriate rehabilitation programme. For the leprosy afflicted patients of the poor sections of society, social rehabilitation has little meaning unless accompanied by economic resettlement." The Health Secretary, Mr. R.L. Misra, said several good projects in rehabilitation were not accepted in the past because of the confusion on whether rehabilitation was the responsibility of Ministry of Welfare or Health. Since Mr Shankarananda's taking over in July 1993, it has been decided to entrust rehabilitation to the Health Ministry. Dr A.K. Mukherjee, Director-General of Health Services, said it was possible to reduce the incidence of leprosy by 41 per cent in the last decade due to the multi-drug treatment which had shortened the duration of treatment. India has been playing an important role in developing and testing immuno-therapeutic and immuno-prophylactic agents for leprosy eradication. Leprosy vaccine is a distinct research goal and an area of high research priority.
