After a four-month interruption, the 64th Ariane is scheduled for launch this Saturday at 0402 (0902 Paris time [0702 GMT]) from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou. It will carry three satellites: Intelsat- 702, the second of the Intelsat-VII series of the international communications satellite organization Intelsat, and two scientific microsatellites of the British Defense Ministry, the STRV-1A and STRV-1B. As a result of the 24 January Ariane failure, which was caused by a problem in the turbopump which has now been solved, two telecommunications satellites were lost: Turksat-1A and Eutelsat-II-F5.
