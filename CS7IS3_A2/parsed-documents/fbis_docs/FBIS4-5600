FBIS4-5600 "dreas070_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 North Korea Deployment of U.S. Apache Helicopters Reported Deployment of U.S. Apache Helicopters Reported SK1204104994 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1043 GMT 12 Apr 94 SK1204104994 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Calculated Dangerous Military Moves" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- The Japanese ASAHI SHIMBUN reported that some latest attack helicopters Apache of the United States were deployed in a South Korean base on April 10 for a "reinforcement of the combat power" of the U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea. And the first batch of Patriot missile batteries which has left Texas will arrive in South Korea, timing to coincide with the Seoul trip of U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry in a few days, said the newspaper. These are premeditated dangerous military moves to further destabilize the military situation on the Korean peninsula and, furthermore, to unleash another war. As is known, the South Korean puppet clique have massively shipped in sophisticated weapons from the United States and "decided" to extend for an indefinite period the order to strengthen "the military posture of readiness" issued to the entire units of the puppet Army, which would cover the period from November last year to March this year. All the units of the three services of the puppet Army now are intensifying their "watch" to attack the North. Such provocative moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean trigger-happy elements for Northward invasion are based on their scrupulously worked out operational plans. Already in September last year the Kim Yong-sam group completed a "New Operation Plan No. 5027" for northward invasion with the U.S. military officials and have staged war exercises against the North with the U.S. imperialists almost every day. Facts vividly show that the ever more undisguised new war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique these days are an extension of their premeditated and intentional war moves stepped up from long ago. Yet, the South Korean puppet clique are making quite a noise as if others were to blame for the tense situation on the Korean peninsula, raising a hue and cry over the fictitious "provocations" by the North. This is nothing but a despicable humbug for justifying their new war provocation moves. The South Korean puppets are seeking to overpower the DPRK by "strength" in league with the U.S. imperialists and, furthermore, to gratify their wild ambition for "unification through Northward invasion" by force of arms, but it is a foolish daydream. It is the unshakable will and policy of the DPRK to answer strength with strength, and dialogue with dialogue. The U.S. imperialists and the "civilian" warmaniacs must ponder over things and stop acting rashly, looking squarely at the resolute will and determination of the Korean people who are fully prepared to cope with any event.
