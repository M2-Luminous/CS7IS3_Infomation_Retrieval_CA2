SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreements and Marketing Order No. 922 [7 CFR part 922] regulating the handling of apricots grown in designated counties in Washington; Marketing Order No. 923 [7 CFR part 923] regulating the handling of sweet cherries grown in designated counties in Washington; and Marketing Order No. 924 [7 CFR part 924] regulating the handling of fresh prunes grown in designated counties in Washington and in Umatilla County, Oregon. The marketing agreements and orders are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions now in effect, apricots and sweet cherries grown in designated counties in Washington, and fresh prunes grown in designated counties in Washington and in Umatilla County, Oregon are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rates specified herein will be applicable to all assessable apricots, sweet cherries, and fresh prunes handled during the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year, which began April 1, 1994, through March 31, 1995. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.
