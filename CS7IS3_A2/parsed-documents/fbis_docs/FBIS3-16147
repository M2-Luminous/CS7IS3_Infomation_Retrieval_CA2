Yegorov assured that the Baltic Fleet is fully able to protect Russia's interests in the Baltic Sea. The admiral noted that the fleet comprises 100 warships, including submarine destroyers and landing ships, rocket launches, and some submarines, as well as two flight regiments equipped with SU-24 attack aircraft, two squadrons of antisubmarine helicopters and coast guard forces. Yegorov said that, in the course of fleet reform over the last two years, submarines carrying strategic nuclear weapons and long-distance aircraft were eliminated. The number of warships in the Baltic has decreased more than twice since 1984, principally due to scrapping of old vessels. The number of men has also been reduced twice. Shumeyko, Yegorov and Deputy Defense Minister General Konstantin Kobets visited a naval base in Baltiisk and observed tactical maneuvers at sea.
