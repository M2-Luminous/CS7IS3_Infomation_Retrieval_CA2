Under discussion were results of socioeconomic development of the republic in 1993 and plans for this year's economic policy. Opening the session, Prime Minister Sergey Tershchenko said that the country needs to introduce qualitatively new economic transformations. He went on to note that the government will pursue the policy of supressing inflation, stabilizing the economy, and creating an institution of private ownership. Everything will be dictated by these main tasks. The minister of economy and the first deputy prime minister, Kazhegeldin, presented reports. It was stressed that in 1993, stabilization of the economy was not achieved. The situation in the economy was characterized by a further fall of production and a decline in the living standards of the population as well as the general instability of economic activity. [passage omitted] In 1993, agricultural production fell by 9.8 percent, while construction and assembly work fell by 25 percent. The sky-rocketing prices for consumer goods led to a decline in people's living standards. Their annual index made up 2,265 percent. At the same time prices for food increased by 23 percent, consumer goods by 18 percent, and services provided to the population by 41 percent. The production of the main types of food decreased as follows: Meat by 12.6 percent, sugar by 36.1 percent, margarine by 48 percent and vegetable oil by 25.4 percent. The participants at the meeting spoke after hearing the reports. President Nursultan Nazarbayev summarized the results of the discussion. He named the specific reasons for decline in production. It depends not only on disrupted ties with neighboring partners but also on the bad performance of economic and management bodies. According to the president the situation in the economy of the republic is improving. The most noticeable change in this improvement took place last December. We have to analyze the reasons for this. At the same time we need to have a clear picture of the enteprises which are lagging behind. This year will definetely be a difficult and tough year. But we have every reason to believe that we can organize our work so as to stop falling into economic abyss. Such a clear-cut and precise line of government policy should be mandatorial this year. It should concentrate its efforts on this. The Cabinet of Ministers adopted a relevant agreement on the issues discussed.
