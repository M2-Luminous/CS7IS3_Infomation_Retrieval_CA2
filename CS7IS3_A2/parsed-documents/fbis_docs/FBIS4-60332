The Indian move will greatly enhance the threat to peace and security in South Asia and as a spokesman of Pakistan's Foreign Office observed the other day, it will raise the specter of a nuclear arms race in the region. In view of the ongoing internal uprising in held Kashmir and the unresolved dispute between India and Pakistan over the future status of Jammu and Kashmir, and also the historical fact that there have been three major armed conflicts between the two countries since their independence, Pakistan will be the most likely target of India's newly acquired military muscle. In long term, of course, there will be other countries who would also have to face up to the reality of life when India decides to flex its muscle in pursuance of its hegemonic designs in the region and its ambition of becoming a regional superpower. Pakistan has, therefore, conveyed its concern over the matter to the Missile Technology Control Regime, MTCR, countries that include, among others, the United States. Hopefully, the MTCR nations would respond positively to Pakistan's message and exercise their collective and individual influence over India to give up dabbling in nuclear missilery and other weaponry of mass destruction. Given India's intransigence over the issue, or for that matter over any bilateral or multilateral issues throughout 47 years of its existence as an independent nation, the pursuance of Pakistani request by the MTCR countries is going to be a formidable task. The Indian prime minister has given a fair proof of it. Addressing the Indian Parliament on the eve of his departure for the United States on an official visit, Mr. Narasimha Rao chose to rule out the possibility that he might agree to roll back India's nuclear or missile program during his U.S. trip. In fact, his decision for any such suggestion was forceful and vehement and he remarked that a leader would be worthless if he changed the policies of his government during visits to foreign countries. He reiterated that his government would firmly adhere to its nuclear and missile development policies. (?While) on one hand, India is pressing ahead with its militaristic designs and augmentation of its military might at a hectic pace, on the other hand, it is [word indistinct] upon its own brand of disinformation and spread of false propaganda against Pakistan. To blame the revolt of Kashmiri people against the Indian occupation on Pakistan is easy enough. It now holds Pakistan responsible for trouble even inside its northeastern states that are over a thousand mile distance from Pakistan. It is also engaged in repeating the wild stories of Pakistan's complicity in last year's bomb blasts in Bombay. Along with its diplomatic and publicity offensive, India is also busy in acts of sabotage and mischief in liberated areas of Kashmir. It is also indulging in violations of the airspace of Azad Kashmir. Several Indian military helicopters flew along the Line of Control on 5 May and on two occasions, they crossed over into Azad Kashmir, besides two Indian terrorists were apprehended recently in Kotli sector of Azad Kashmir. They were carrying 52 kg of explosives and had confessed that they were on a sabotage mission at the behest of the Indian authorities. All these have ominous forebodings for peace and tranquillity in South Asia, particularly the deployment of Agni and Prithvi missiles must be seen as an important landmark in India's nuclear capability and a clear adoption of a threatening posture against small neighbors, Pakistan being on the top of the list.
