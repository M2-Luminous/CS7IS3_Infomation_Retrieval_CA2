This is part of Japan's policy to provide aid to Russia in improving safety in reactors of the former Soviet Union (RBMK reactors). The abnormality detection system involves installing a high temperature-resistant, radiation-resistant microphone in the reactor containment vessel. It works by detecting abnormal sounds produced by leaks, etc., inside the reactor and warning the operators with an alarm. The system has a signal processing device to distinguish abnormal sounds from the sounds caused by vibration, etc., that accompany normal reactor operation, and it uses an acoustic filter to detect only the abnormal sounds. This is implementation of cooperative research based on the Japan/Russia Nuclear Cooperation Agreement. The detection system with the microphone will be installed in the Sosunoviboru [phonetic] NPP II (formerly Leningrad NPP II) by the end of 1996. The costs for the first year are expected to be about Â¥960,000,000.
