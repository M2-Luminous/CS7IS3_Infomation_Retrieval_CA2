Leading a high-ranking political and economic delegation, he met and conferred with his Turkish counterpart and also other officials of that country. [passage omitted] Since 1985 this was the third visit of the Egyptian president to Turkey. The Tuesday visit of the head of the Egyptian regime to Ankara, besides confirming contacts and ties between Cairo and Ankara, was aimed at further expanding political, economic, cultural, and military cooperation and also at boosting ties. This cooperation can assume special significance in view of the position of Turkey and Egypt in the region on the top of their ties with Israel. Last week, Ezer Weizman, head of the Zionist regime, had paid a four-day visit to Turkey. Weizman, in connection with his Ankara visit, had commented that the destiny of the Middle East would be framed with the collaboration of Israel, Turkey, and Egypt. Some political experts assess these contacts in line with the efforts to conclude a regional treaty through which the leaders of Egypt, Turkey, and the Zionist regime could counter the threats posed to them by uniting and also forging necessary coordination. Thus, they can execute their desired policy, which undoubtedly enjoyed the U.S. backing. In this connection, Islamism and escalation of Islamic groups' operations are among the most important problems which are faced by Turkey, Israel, and Egypt. Also the ties of Turkey and Egypt with the Zionist regime can be examined from the angle that they can pave the way for normalization of Tel Aviv's relations with Arab states and also lead to the lifting of economic sanctions against Israel. Hence, political experts analyze the strengthening of ties among Egypt, Turkey, and Israel within the framework of restricting independent and non-aligned policy and also jeopardizing the Islamic tendency in the region.
