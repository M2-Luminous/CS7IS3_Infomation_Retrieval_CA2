Strategic balances being published by the most respectable and serious international research institutes unequivocally state Israel can successfully confront any military threat, which means that its political bargaining power is also better than ever. Experts assess this situation will continue at least until Iran or Iraq purchase or develop nuclear bombs. The military-technical assessment, however, does not reflect the real situation, because it fails to take into consideration the dangerous erosion since the Six-Day War in the Israeli public's stamina during security crises and emergencies. A public's or nation's endurance in emergency situations is reflected in its ability to maintain normal life, in a greater-than-usual willingness to join the national effort in overcoming the crisis, and in high morale. What we witnessed in Israel is the exact opposite. The hysterical reaction to every terror attack indicates that a large proportion of the population -- actively encouraged by the opposition -- refuses to recognize the fact that the peace process is still not peace itself; that making peace is a difficult and lengthy process; that the political and military war of attrition being waged against us by the Palestinians and Syria during the negotiations process itself, is an inseparable part of making peace. The historians who will research this phenomenon will probably reach the conclusion that the role of occupier and oppressor, forced on us after the Six-Day War, was one of the main factors causing us to have no faith in our national cause and harming our motivation to fight and suffer for this cause. Even those who reject this interpretation will find it hard to ignore or deny the symptoms: Instead of the public volunteering en masse to the Civil Guard, thus helping foil terrorism, we find that school trips are being canceled (even to places where there is no danger at all); instead of wide- scale demonstrations of national unity and determination, every terror attack results in whining, hysterics, and boundless abuse hurled at the government. It does not take a military expert to realize that Palestinian and Lebanese terrorism is currently receiving a lot of positive feedback, a thing which only increases its activity. It also does not take a political expert to recognize the damage done to Israel's bargaining power in the negotiations. The Likud and the right-wing parties, which encourage these demonstrations of national weakness and try to score political points from them, are evincing extraordinary shortsightedness. The erosion in public endurance will boomerang against them if and when they come to power. The same holds true for the settlers. Meanwhile, however, it is the government which is under pressure -- and those who come under pressure make mistakes. The eroding public support and the nearing elections are pushing Rabin and Peres into a corner from which they make decisions and issue statements which do not always serve Israel's vital interests. Rabin's statement on his agreement in principle to disband settlements on the Golan Heights is an excellent example of a premature concession made under pressure. In war as in peace, he wins who has the higher motivation and endurance, even if the military balance of power is against him. Britain, for example, won World War II thanks to the British public's endurance during the German blitz on London; The Afghan Mujaheddin organization managed to beat a vastly superior Soviet- Afghan army; and let us admit: the Palestinians brought us to the negotiating table because they evinced great endurance and stamina during the intifadah. The ongoing erosion in the Israeli public's endurance harms our ability to achieve reasonable peace and security in the negotiations. This situation, however, is not irreversible. With the help of an intensive information campaign, the government can change the national mood and cause the public to show more understanding toward its moves and a situation wherein political negotiations are being conducted alongside a war of attrition.
