Ramos has approved the adoption of new measures to speed up the actualization of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Free Trade Area or AFTA following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade or GATT. With the signing of the Uruguay Round final act this month, the ASEAN-member countries want to ensure that preferential treatment under the AFTA is not diminished. The ASEAN groups the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Brunei Darussalam. President Ramos approved three basic approaches as proposed by the Philippine Council for ASEAN Cooperation's Technical Board. These are: -- Broadening the coverage of the Common Effective Preferential Tariff or CEPT by including products selected from the temporary exclusion list; -- Broadening the same inclusion list by including unprocessed agricultural products from the permanent exclusion list; and, -- Improving the existing AFTA CEPT inclusion list. Under the first approach, some 52 items were first delisted from temporary exclusion list. These items are those classified as natural processed and those under Memorandum Order No. 95 implementing the Magna Carta for Small Farmers and the government rationalization program. A line-by-line evaluation of the remaining 662 items in the temporary exclusion list will be done to determine which should be included in the AFTA CEPT scheme based on a set of criteria. Under the second approach, some unprocessed agricultural products will be lifted from the permanent exclusion list to conform with increasing criteria adopted by other member countries. The third approach includes measures shortening from 15 years to 10 years the period for bringing the tariff levels of 1,086 [word indistinct] to 5 percent or less, as well as deepening the tariff cuts.
