Moslem Radio Sarajevo reports that three civilians have been killed and 14 wounded when the forces of Bosnian Croats and of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia Sunday afternoon fired over 80 artillery shells on the Moslem part of Mostar, town in the southern part of the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to Moslem media, the Croat anti-aricraft and artillery units Sunday night fired on demarcation lines in Mostar, and Monday morning renewed their attacks on Moslem positions in Konjic, Jablanica and Prozor areas in central Bosnia. Bosnian Serb military sources report that Moslem forces have been attacking practically all Serb communities and defense lines in the Sarajevo area, trying unsuccessfully to provoke large-scale clashes in order to renew the anti-Serb media campaign. According to the same sources, Moslem forces have also attacked Serb communities and positions in northern Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the areas of Doboj, Gradacac and Maglaj, as well as Olovo in central Bosnia. Moslem formations have carried out a fierce artillery and infantry attack on Serb positions in the Maglaj area, but have had to withdraw, with losses, to their starting point, Bosnian Serb military sources report.
