This drop is attributed to the decline in crude oil prices that occurred in the second half of 1993. The UAE's crude oil revenues in 1993 constituted 39 percent of its gross product, which totaled about UD131.6 billion. The Planning Ministry, in preliminary estimates published yesterday on economic developments in the UAE in 1993, stressed that the decline in oil revenues was accompanied by an increase in the non-oil sectors' share of gross product, which totaled UD80.310 billion ($21.88 billion), compared to UD77.047 billion ($20.99 billion) in 1992. Most of the oil revenues in the UAE go to the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. According to 1992 estimates, the oil sector in each of the emirates contributed the following to the UAE's domestic product: Abu Dhabi, UD43.541 billion; Dubai, UD8.394 billion; al-Shariqah, UD10.061 billion; Ra's al-Khaymah, UD120 million. Of all of the emirates, Abu Dhabi's oil output contributes the most to the GDP. The Planning Ministry states that Abu Dhabi's gross product rose to UD81.692 billion in 1993, compared to UD80.979 billion in 1992 and UD79.9 billion in 1991, despite the drop in oil prices.
