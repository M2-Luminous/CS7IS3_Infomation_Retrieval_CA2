The Department of Home Affairs is presently processing application from more than 2,000 refugees seeking political asylum in the country. The flood of refugees is causing serious problems for the South African authorities, who are still grappling with the issue of displaced people from violence-ravaged areas such as Natal and the East Rand. There has been a steady increase in the number of people seeking refuge from wars and famine in Africa in the past few months. Some have found their way to centres for the homeless such as the Welcome Home Centre in Doornfontein, Johannesburg. The centre, which is home to about 300 homeless people, also houses about 70 refugees from countries such as Somalia, Ethiopia, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Tanzania. The refugees included five Ethiopian dissident boxers who fled from a Mauritius-bound aircraft at Jan Smuts Airport on May 15 while en route to a boxing tournament in Mauritius. Most of the asylum seekers had letters from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the Department of Home Affairs, identifying them as people applying for refugee status. The director of the centre, Mrs Imelda Damane, said the UNHCR [UN High Commission for Refugees] sent refugees to the centre without providing them with money for food and shelter. "How do they expect us to cope with this flood of people when we can't provide for local people who have fled their homes because of violence"? Damane said. A spokesman for the UNHCR denied that the organisation referred people to the centre. He said the name of the centre was one of several appearing on a list supplied to refugees to help them find food and shelter. According to an agreement with the Government, asylum seekers are allowed to look for employment while their applications are being processed. He said the UNHCR did not have any direct assistance programme for refugees. The Department of Home Affairs said a total of 2,146 persons from various countries had applied at its Johannesburg office for asylum on the grounds that they were refugees. Such applicants were issued with temporary permits pending the outcome of their applications. If successful, the refugees were granted temporary residence. The department said it was impossible to give exact figures of refugees because many entered the country clandestinely.
