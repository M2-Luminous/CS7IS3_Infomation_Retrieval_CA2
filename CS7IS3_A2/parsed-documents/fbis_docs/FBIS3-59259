In a situation in which both development opportunities and serious challenges co-exist, whether China's finance and banking has the strength to withstand the onslaught has become a matter of general concern. It was in this connection that the writer visited Professor Liu Guoguang, a member of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee and deputy chairman of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Trend of the Times Reporter: Foreign banks began to enter China more than a decade ago, but it has been only during the past two years during China's efforts to re-enter GATT that the issue of the introduction of foreign banks has aroused extreme concern. Please tell us about this situation. Liu Guoguang: It is my understanding that opening the country to foreign banks was an important decision in China's reform and opening to the outside world that was made more than a decade ago. In 1979, the Beijing Office of Japan's Long-Term Credit Bank hung out a shingle, becoming the first foreign banking institution to set up shop in China since founding of the New China. Later on, some well known Japanese, U.S., British, French, German, Canadian, and Swiss banks also came pouring in to set up offices in China. At first, these offices were permitted to perform only tasks that produced indirect profits. Not long afterward, however, they obtained permission to take part directly in business activities in the special economic zones [SEZ]. Thus, these foreign owned banks began to do more than 10 different kinds of business including foreign currency savings accounts and foreign trade settlements. A large number of foreign owned bank branch offices opened for business in the SEZs. During the 1990's, the opening up of Pudong in Shanghai provided new opportunities for the entry into China of foreign owned banks. In June 1992, the Chinese Government further opened seven coastal cities including Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Ningbo, Nanjing, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Dalian to the entry of foreign banks. According to the most recent statistics, 250 offices of foreign banking institutions, foreign bank branches, Sino-foreign joint venture banks, and wholly owned foreign banks from 30 different countries and territories have been set up in China's 14 cities that are open to the outside world. The speed of arrival and the large number of foreign banks coming to China have astounded the world. The degree to which even the four small Asian dragons made inroads when China first opened to the outside world is incomparable. Not long ago, the Chinese Government tendered to the GATT secretariat a revised tenatively agreed to bill of particulars on the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), which made the following tenative promises about finance and banking services: Foreign banks may use the following four kinds of financial institutions to conduct investment and provide services: foreign owned banks, foreign bank branches, Sino-foreign joint venture banks, and Sino-foreign cooperative joint-venture banks. This shows that the opening of China to foreign banks is an irreversible major trend. Not only is this an important measure for the opening of China's finance and banking sector to the outside world and a requirement for China's GATT restoration, but it is also a major way for China to establish and develop a socialist market economy and to dovetail China's economy with the world economy. Is the Wolf Coming? Reporter: Many people still find it difficult to accept the large scale introduction of foreign owned banks, or they are even filled with anxiety about the prospect. They feel that this will hurt domestic finance and banking and harm development of the indigenous economy and the finance and banking sector. This is termed "crying wolf." What are your views about this? Liu Guoguang: Whether the wolf is coming is impossible to say categorically, and if the wolf is indeed coming, that is not necessarily a bad thing. At least it brings some external pressures to bear. I would like to explain several levels of thinking about this question as follows: On the one hand, bringing in foreign banks will face all of China's big domestic banks with strong competitors. They will face more severe challenges. In many ways, they will be adversely affected and buffeted about. This goes without saying. We know that foreign banks have not only abundant experience and skill in dealing with international banking and financial competition, but they also have self-sustaining, flexible, sophisticated, and highly effective business methods, management mechanisms, and technical equipment. Therefore, foreign banks hold a marked advantage in both their operation and the attraction of capable people. Practice in China during recent years shows that in areas and business fields that foreign banks have entered, such as the international clearing business and the foreign exchange credit business, China's domestic banks have been stricken in varying degrees. This has showed up in a fall off in business volume, a loss of customers, and the flight of skilled personnel. If foreign banks are permitted to do business in the renminbi, the predicament of the domestic banks will be even worse. These are inescapable facts. From this point of view, I feel that some people's worries about the wolf coming make sense. They should not be regarded as groundless fears. On the other hand, we must realize that what follows from the influx of foreign banks is not all negative. There are many positives. For example, the presence of foreign banks will make it easier for domestic banks to learn sophisticated foreign bank management methods and the newest business techniques. This will enhance the domestic banks' ability to provide services, and to upgrade domestic finance and banking in terms of management, service, and skills. it will help increase the competitiveness of domestic finance and banking institutions, enliven financial markets, and accelerate the modernization of domestic finance and banking. It will also help develop new financing methods and bring in foreign capital. It will increase Sino-foreign economic and technical cooperation, and it will promote the integration of Chinese finance and banking with world finance and banking, etc. The benefits are numerous. At the same time, we must also realize that as the lifeblood in operation of the national economy, finance and banking truly power the national economy. It is also for this reason that even nations that have opened their financial markets to the outside world have instituted strict and effective control over foreign banks. Cases in point are Japan and South Korea, which have strict regulations regarding the sphere of business of foreign banks. Australia and Malaysia likewise have strict restrictions on foreign banks establishing branches in their countries. The current situation in China suggests implementation of a limited and gradual deregulation of the sphere of business and the operating area of foreign owned banks. The "Shanghai Foreign Owned Finance and Banking Institution and Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Finance and Banking Control Methods," which was promulgated in 1990, provides detailed regulations on this matter. The tenatively agreed to GATS bill of particulars that China recently made public further provides as follows: When providing services, foreign finance and banking institutions must abide by "People's Republic of China Special Economic Zone Control Regulations Regarding Foreign Banks and Sino-Foreign Joint Venture and Contractual Joint Venture Banks," as well as by "Shanghai Foreign owned Finance and Banking Institutions and Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Institutions Control Methods." Foreign investors shall be finance or banking institutions that have had offices permanently located in China for three years. Foreign banks shall have no less that $10 billion total assets and enjoy a good reputation in their home country before applying to invest in China. Foreign banks may deal only in foreign currencies. Therefore, looked at from this angle, I believe that there is nothing to worry about to be afraid of from bringing in foreign banks. To summarize the foregoing several levels of thinking, my conclusion is that in an overall sense and in long-range terms, the advantages of bringing in foreign banks outweigh the disadvantages. They will ultimately play a positive role in the reform and development of China's finance and banking. Shortcomings of Chinese Finance and Banking Reporter: As far as GATT requirements are concerned, particularly the provisions pertaining to trade in financial services in the GATS, it should be said that there is little disparity between China's finance and banking and customary international practices. Please comment on problems in this regard. Liu Guoguang: It is true that many problems remain in China's finance and banking, which is in the midst of reform and development. These problems are found in both the system of organization and the management mechanism as well as in service methods and techniques, and the caliber of personnel. A look at the finance and banking system as a whole shows the macroeconomic regulation and control ability of the central bank to be weak, and a commercial banking system that stands on its own two feet as a business and is responsible for its own profits and losses has yet to be built. The entire finance and banking business remains highly monopolized by the national banks, effective and normalized competition in financial markets a long way from taking shape. In the system for the management of capital, we continue to control the total amount of funds available, setting the total amount of credit on the basis of national plan expenditures. All the specialized banks must strictly control the amount of funds they make available, largely ignoring the safety, the fluidity, and the appreciation of credit funds. In the interest rate control system, interest rates are still set mostly by plan or administrative fiat, no market interest rate mechanism having been truly formed or playing a role. The specialized banks' assets are undiversified; techniques for controlling assets and liabilities are antiquated; an effective mechanism for stimulating profits and an understanding of modern competition are lacking; and both the efficiency and quality of financial services are very low. In addition, finance and banking legislation lags, and first rate finance and banking talent is hard to find. This situation is at variance with, and even falls far short of, the major trend toward deregulation of China's finance and banking, as well as requirements for restitution of China's GATT status. Given such a finance and banking background, China's domestic banks come under strong competitive pressure from foreign banks. They are in a disadvantageous position that is difficult to avoid. Increasing Strength To Meet Challenges Reporter: What do you feel the priority task is for China's finance and banking sector given the need to develop a socialist market economy and the moderate introduction of foreign owned banks? Liu Guoguang: The introduction of foreign owned banks is already a major trend that cannot be reversed. This being the case, our focus should not be on increasing limitations on foreign banks' entry into China's finance and banking markets. In fact, this is unwise and even impossible. Our emphasis should be on the needs of the market economy and opening to the outside world. We should accelerate reform of China's finance and banking system, and we should do all possible to move ahead with international normalization with the goal of improving in every way the adaptability and competitiveness of China's banking system. This requires close study of the experiences and lessons of developed nations, developing nations, and of China itself in opening its banking system to the outside world, and relating them to our own formulation of measures related to the applicable provisions of GATT. Much work must be done in these regards. I feel that work on the following matters is crucial: enhancement of the central bank's functions to hasten the formation of a unified and effective macroeconomic regulation and control mechanism in order to ensure currency stability; and reform of the central bank's methods of controlling the funds of the specialized banks. Adoption of the 8 percent international practice (i.e., capital plus savings must amount to 8 percent of risk assets), going all out to promote strict control of the ratio between assets and liabilities and to control risks in the specialized banks, increasing the specialized banks' self-restraint capabilities, and establishing a mechanism to supervise and control risks; quickening the transformation of the nation specialized banks' operating mechanisms so that they can gradually become economic entities responsible for their own operating decisions and responsible for their own profits and losses; reforming the interest rate control system, interest rates eventually being set by the market; appropriate development of finance and banking institutions of many various kinds to promote competition; use of both international and domestic means to hasten the training of highly qualified financial service personnel to bring about the quickest possible upgrading of the caliber of personnel through the banking business; widespread use of computer technology and modern communications equipment to hasten the modernization and computerization of finance and banking tools to improve service efficiency; and earliest possible finance and banking legislation. Finally, I want to emphasize the need for discretion on the issue of the scale and speed with which foreign banks are brought into China. Their entry must be in keeping with the level of domestic finance and banking, and the legal climate. There can be no rushing headlong into precipitate action. Prudence is also needed in permitting foreign banks to deal in renminbi. In addition, control and foreign owned bank business transactions and auditing, supervision, and inspections must be enhanced.
