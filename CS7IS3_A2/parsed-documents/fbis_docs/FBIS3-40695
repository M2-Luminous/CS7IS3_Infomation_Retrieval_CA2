It has only subsided for the present. According to the Constitution, Parliament cannot prevent the government from signing treaties. However, ratification may be greatly delayed or may not materialise at all for years, like in the case of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This does not mean the almost weeklong uproar over GATT was an exercise in futility. Rather, it brought home to the government serious misgivings on the economic arrangement to which India has been committed. This has been a desperate gamble by a government commanding only minority support in the Lok Sabha. It is the precise reason behind the government's studied ambiguity on every item that may affect the country under the new world trade regime. The statement by Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the Union commerce minister, has tried to hide rather than reveal the actual implications of the trade regime, to be ushered in next year. Associated Press filed a report from Geneva on December 17 that said, "Indian farmers and drug companies are likely to be hit by patent fees on seeds and pharmaceuticals." Mr Mukherjee has tried to cover up even this. That the prices of medicines will shoot up cannot be denied. Mr Eduardo Faleiro, the minister of state for chemicals, has assured the country the government can control prices of medicines through the drug price control order. He is well aware that no international commitment by the government can be negated by any control at home. This is particularly true when the present government is fervently offering oblations to the god of the market. The government has never taken Parliament into serious confidence about the problems and pitfalls in the Uruguay round. At the Funta del Este meeting of GATT in 1986, India took a firm stand which some bureaucrats sought to surreptitiously modify. But this was scotched at Montreal. However, the surrender lobby was never disarmed. Its intrigues continued until it came on top in 1991 with the present government. The line of surrender was clearly palpable when the Dunkel draft was first published two years ago. Not accidentally, this was precisely the point when the government was practically hijacked by the International Monetary Fund-World Bank mafia--Mr Manmohan Singh and his team. The capitulation line in GATT fitted beautifully with submission to the IMF's structural adjustment prescription two years ago. In fact, the Dunkel draft represented an essential component of Manmohanomics. Thinking the Dunkel injunctions could be defied without upsetting the well-entrenched structural adjustment edifice of the finance ministry is absurd. A similar argument is it would be disastrous if India refused to sign GATT. This is similar to the argument about the problems in case India failed to meet commitments on debt servicing in 1991. As with the new economic policy, the government has avoided telling Parliament the full implications of each item of the elaborate structure of the new GATT. An extensive and exposing public campaign was launched immediately after the Dunkel draft was released, particularly on the question of patents. No recent campaign has mobilised such a wide response from intellectuals cutting across party lines. The government was in a quandary. On the one hand it had already surrendered on the economic front to the Fund-Bank dictates due to the machinations of Mr Manmohan Singh and his team. On the other it had to contend with serious objections to the Dunkel draft by all political parties, including a considerable section of Congressmen. Not surprisingly, the government took the subterfuge of so-called consultations to cover up its capitulation at the GATT talks. A cabinet sub-committee was set up under Mr Arjun Singh to elicit public opinion on the Dunkel draft. It met a number of spokesmen with different points of view. No one has been told of the outcome of the exercise. Despite representations by different bodies, public meetings and discussions, the government maintained a studied silence at home. Meanwhile, it was virtually inactive at the negotiating table in Uruguay. Indian initiative in rallying the developing nations to force changes in the world trade pattern is not possible. The negotiators themselves were hamstrung by the government's continuous commitments to the Fund-Bank. The government's mendacious position is clear from the timetable it fixed for the final round of parliamentary discussion on the Dunkel draft. The deadline for the new GATT accord being December 15, the government conceded a debate in Parliament to begin on December 6. Obviouisly, the government was not serious about the debate influencing its stand at Geneva. Even Mr Mukherjee's statement could be extracted by Parliament after the cabinet had already instructed the government's representative at GATT to sign the new accord. As in the case of economic policy, the government moved without consulting Parliament, though it does not command a clear majority in Lok Sabha. Though a public campaign by an informed body of concerned citizens is on, this was not reflected in the Opposition's performance in the past two years. There have been angry protests in both houses of Parliament in the past week but only after the horse had fled from the stable. The standing committee of Parliament attached to the commerce ministry examined the Dunkel draft for six long months. It submitted its report only on December 13--two days before the GATT deadline. So, its critical evaluation of the draft is only of academic interest. Had this job been given top priority and done three months earlier, there could have been some chance to force the government on this issue. As in other urgent issues nowadays, Parliament is defaulting in its role as the mirror of public perception and concern. It is clear from the world situation that GATT is hardly going to establish a global regime of peaceful trade. Frictions are inevitable between countries, regional groups and certainly the developed giants of the Group of Seven. It is widely perceived the new era following the end of the Cold War will witness fierce rivalry among industrial giants for capturing the world market. In other words, an unprecedented trade war is in the offing. In such a situation, a watchful government in the developing world representing the bulk of the world's manpower, resources and market can effectively intervene to defend third world interests. Whether India will aspire to play this role and if the present establishment, with the halter of Manmohanomics round its neck, can play it is for the nation to judge.
