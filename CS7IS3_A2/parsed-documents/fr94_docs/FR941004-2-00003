FR941004-2-00003 FR941004-2-00002 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE International Trade Administration [A&hyph;821&hyph;807] Postponement of Preliminary Antidumping Duty Determination: Ferrovanadium and Nitrided Vanadium From the Russian Federation AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David J. Goldberger (202&hyph;482&hyph;4136) or Karla Whalen (202&hyph;482&hyph;6309), Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20230. Postponement of Preliminary Determination The Department of Commerce (``the Department'') is postponing its preliminary determination in the antidumping duty investigation of ferrovanadium and nitrided vanadium from the Russian Federation (``Russia''). The deadline for issuing this preliminary determination is now no later than December 27, 1994. On June 20, 1994, the Department initiated an antidumping duty investigation of ferrovanadium and nitrided vanadium from Russia (59 FR 3952, June 27, 1994). The preliminary determination was scheduled for November 7, 1994. On July 15, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission determined that there was a likelihood that a U.S. domestic industry was materially injured, or threatened with material injury, by reason of imports of ferrovanadium and nitrided vanadium from Russia. This investigation involves unusually complex foreign trading channels and, therefore, we have determined that this investigation is extraordinarily complicated within the meaning of section 733(c)(1)(B)(i) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act''), and 19 CFR 353.15(b)(2). Furthermore, we have determined that the parties concerned are cooperating, as required by section 733(c)(1)(B) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(b)(1), and that additional time is necessary to make this preliminary determination in accordance with section 733(c)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(b)(3). For these reasons, the deadline, for issuing this determination is now no later than December 27, 1994. This notice is published pursuant to section 733(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(d). Dated: September 26, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24534 Filed 10&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M
