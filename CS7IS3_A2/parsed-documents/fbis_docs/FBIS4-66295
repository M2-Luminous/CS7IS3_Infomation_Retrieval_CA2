People think: So what if there is a spat? The outlook for the coming year is generally good for the four main components of Hong Kong's economy: trade, the stock market, real estate, and economic relations and trade between China and Hong Kong, as well as for employment. Hong Kong is a large corporation that is about to change hands. The old boss is about to leave, and the new boss is waiting to take over. However, the old and the new bosses are on the outs with each other. They quarrel from morning until night. What is interesting is that even though the bosses squabble, the sky has not fallen. The work of the corporation has not only not been impaired but has become more intense, and prospects are that tomorrow will be better. The following is the general situation in Hong Kong today: Because of the wrangling between China and Hong Kong over the political system, the political atmosphere has been greatly damaged. Economically, however, even though political factors unavoidably affect the economy, the people's general reaction is: So what if China and the UK are having a spat? This also makes sense. Before the two parties had a falling out, everyone had a feeling of uncertainly because the political haze had still not cleared. Now that they have turned on each other, each taking up diametrically opposed positions, the feeling of political uncertainty has vanished. Psychologically, everyone is "relieved." Actually, despite the bad political atmosphere, both the Chinese and the British know that the "economic card" is a bad one to play. What can the Chinese Communists do to the Hong Kong economy? At most, they may be able to continue to drag their feet on the financial arrangements for the new airport. Other matters pertaining to special operating rights may be side issues, but mostly certain British-owned businesses would be hurt. Aside from this, the Chinese Communists cannot bear down too hard without damaging Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. What is more, Chinese capital is at risk in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong has such great economic value to the China mainland. Inasmuch as the political atmosphere has gone from uncertainty to relative certainty, political factors may be set aside for the time being when discussing Hong Kong's economic situation and prospects. Because the sky has not fallen, and the basic elements in Hong Kong's economy are relatively good, it is generally estimated that Hong Kong's economic growth during 1994 will be on a par with 1993. Actual growth will be more than 5 percent. Below, an evaluation of Hong Kong's future economic situation is made on the basis of four things: 1) trade, 2) the stock market, 3) real estate, 4) and Sino-Hong Kong economic relations and trade, which taken together can convey an overall picture of Hong Kong's economy. Trade: Growth of Two Large Markets Abroad, inventories are low while mainland growth is high. The trend of the two large markets can be perceived, and trade prospects can be half predicted. Hong Kong's economy has always depended on trade. One source of data for evaluating Hong Kong's trade situation in the coming year is the semi-official report that the Hong Kong Trade Development Bureau published at the beginning of December 1993 titled, "Hong Kong Trade Prospects in 1994." This research report may be summarized in the following two points: 1. Overseas markets are reviving slowly, but inventories are low. In principal markets such as the United States, recovery remains slow, but prospects are better than last year. Such areas have imported little for some time, and they have pretty well sold their inventories. If their economy takes an upturn and the consumer market picks up, orders will increase. 2. The China mainland shows high growth, but inflation is a worry. The China mainland economy has grown rapidly in recent years. Its annual growth rate is 13 percent. During the last half of 1993, regulation and control was instituted with a tightening of credit, but recently the money supply has been relaxed again. Economic growth during 1994 should be vigorous, but the rise in inflationary pressures and a possible new government retrenchment during the second half of the year are worrisome. This report rests on two basic assumptions, namely that the United States will continue to extend the China mainland's most favored nation trade status. On the basis of this assumption, the report predicts that Hong Kong's exports will improve in 1994, total export value increasing 18 percent, for an actual 17 percent increase. (The 1993 estimate was 14 percent.) Entrepot trade is also expected to increase by an actual 23 percent. (The 1993 estimate was 20 percent.) The United States and China are Hong Kong's largest markets (together accounting for half or more of Hong Kong's exports, and more than half of its total entrepot trade). The situation in 1994 will be one in which the United States market will grow fairly steadily and the China mainland market may slow during the second half of the year. By understanding the trend of these two large markets, it is possible to know in advance most of Hong Kong's trade prospects. Of the issues between China and the United States, the one that affects Hong Kong most is whether China's most favored nation status will be extended. The importance for Hong Kong of most favored nation treatment lies in the current reality that China's and Hong Kong's economies are closely linked. The mainland is the factory, and Hong Kong is the store. Many mainland products transit Hong Kong for sale abroad. In recent years, both the Hong Kong government and businessmen have sent leading figures to the United States each year to lobby in an effort to get the United States to extend China's most favored nation treatment. Their most important line has been that unless most favored nation treatment is extended, Hong Kong will lose 70,000 jobs and 3 percentage points of its GNP. Although whether the United States will extend China's most favored nation treatment in 1994 is still an unknown quantity, everyone assumes it will be maintained. The first condition for extension that the United States has expressed is improvement of the China mainland's human rights situation. In this regard, it is estimated that Beijing will do all possible to take some actions and improve its posture to maintain most favored nation treatment. In the final analysis, Beijing also realizes that it cannot be swayed by personal feelings. As for the United States, recently there have also been some indications that it feels Beijing has responded to improve human rights. In December, GATT finally reached an overall agreement in the Americas and Europe, bringing to an end the seven-year Uruguay round of negotiations. Basically, this assures the continued liberalization of trade. The conclusion of the GATT talks is naturally advantageous for Hong Kong. This is by no means the final talks that will directly benefit Hong Kong, but Hong Kong has always stood for free trade, and it benefits from the liberalization of trade. Strong protectionist sentiment has always existed in international trade. Failure to maintain liberalization will mean a slide toward protectionism, and protectionism is the thing that Hong Kong least wants to see. The Stock Market: Foreign Capital Dominates; Great Bullishness Foreign Capital Speculation in the Stock Market Not Likely To Abate in a Short Time. New Products and New Facilities Increase; Market Will Likely Become Hotter. The stock market has always been regarded as a political thermometer. However, despite the worsening of the political dispute between China and the UK, the Hong Kong stock market runs counter to this precept. The more speculation, the more it booms. In early 1993, the Heng Seng Index was more than 5000, the daily trading volume reaching more than HK$1 billion. Before the end of the year, however, the Heng Seng Index broke the 10,000 points mark, daily trading volume exceeding HK$10 billion. The main reason for this recent bullishness is the entry into the market of foreign funds, which caused a "three grade jump" in the more than 7,000 points Heng Seng Index at the end of September. Foreign capitalists do not regard the Sino-British political squabble as a matter of any importance. They proclaim the good prospects of the China mainland market, and that Hong Kong is the best entry way to the China market. The "instigator" was the U.S. investment form of Morgan-Stanley, followed by a surge of Japanese and European funds. "Intercontinental ballistic missiles" struck, and the temperature of the Hong Kong market increased greatly. Many people feel that it is unbelievable that speculation has gone on this way for two or three months, and even old hands have been caught flat-footed. The trend during the coming year is hard to predict, but the consensus of insiders is that the "gold fish bowl" (i.e., the stock market) is a "big crocodile" world, meaning the big foreign investors in particular. What happens in the market will depend mostly on what foreign investors do. One insider said that the logic for the flow between fund operators recently is as follows: The market price profit rate on the H shares that mainland state-owned business list on the Hong Kong market should not be lower that the profit rate on A shares (for sale inside China) and the B shares (for sale outside China). Furthermore, the market profit rate for the blue chip shares of large Hong Kong firms should also not be lower than for the H shares. In addition, the market profit rate on the Hong Kong stock market (less than 19 times) is lower than in very many other places, yet Hong Kong corporations are doing well and their profits are high. Thus, the conclusion is that Hong Kong share prices should be higher than the current level. These insiders figure that during the first quarter of 1994, the Heng Seng Index should reach 12,000, meaning 16,000 for the whole year. Will the foreign investors withdraw? It seems that they will not withdraw for a fairly long time. The first reason is that the Chinese mainland economy still seems to be growing at high speed. Negative factors during the coming year are few: regulation and control have been relaxed recently, and most favored nation treatment will likely be extended. One possible negative factor is the death of the great helmsman, Deng Xiaoping. The second reason is that there is no place for foreign investment funds to go. A lot of hot money is available; interest rates are low, and the European, American, and Japanese economies are in a bad slump. Of course, there is apprehension lest foreign capital cause Hong Kong shares to go up, thereby bringing Hong Kong investors into the market only to depart once they have taken their fill. Actually, money could be withdrawn very rapidly, because in addition to stock shares, there are other instruments available such as indexed futures and futures options that can be used, so selling off and recovering funds is extremely easy. Nevertheless, very many small speculators have already left the market. Furthermore, not everyone feels that political factors can be ignored. In addition, present prices are too high. Therefore many people are still very wary. With the advent of a new year, expectations are that the Hong Kong stock market may become even hotter. This is because of the continuing increase in new products and new facilities in the stock market. First, the automatic settlement system went into operation, every kind of share certificate being fed into the system continuously. Following adoption of this system, shares were bought and sold using an electronic board listing method, inputting into the buying and selling board being done with the push of a button for immediate execution of a trade. Trading was faster and efficiency increased. Second was approval of short sales of shares. Formerly, short selling (selling of shares one does not have) was illegal in the Hong Kong stock market, but foreign stock markets have long approved it. Once the automatic settlement system went into operation, selling short was allowed in Hong Kong as of January 1994. In 1994, options trading will be promoted. Trading of indexed options already exists. The next step will be buying and selling of options for individual shares (mostly blue chip stocks). In addition, more and more China mainland enterprises are listing on the Hong Kong exchange. State-owned firms issue H shares (currently there are seven or eight of them), and other firms come to Hong Kong to shop for empty shells (to buy empty shell companies). Inasmuch as more new products and new facilities have been introduced, the amount of trading and investment should increase. In addition, since the price of blue chip shares is presently high, quite a few individual investors deal in H shares and second and third line shares. Since the index may rise or fall two or three percentage points in a single day, some individual investors speculate on the market each day; thus, the volume of trading in futures index contracts has increased greatly (to more than 10,000 each day). Real Estate: No Reversal of Rising Trend Prices of buildings are at an all-time high. The rising trend will continue unless an upheaval occurs. Luxury apartment prices may rise by one-quarter, and medium and small apartment prices may rise 15 percent. During the last land sale of 1993, competitive bidding on a parcel of land to be used for dwellings in North Kowloon resulted in a sale at an all-time high price (more than HK$3.9 billion, or more than HK$5,400 per square foot of floor space). It is estimated that once built, the cost of the premises will be 8,000 yuan per square foot). The earliest that buildings can be put up on that land will be 1997. Apparently real estate dealers view prospects favorably. Is it really true that the real estate market need not take political factors into consideration? Chung-yuan Properties Agency director, Shih Yung-ch'ing, feels that one cannot say that political factors have no effect. When Sino-British talks break off for a day or two, the number of inquiries about properties decrease, the atmosphere improving only after the stock market rises. Of course, big buyers and sellers are not much worried about spats between China and the UK in the run up to 1997, particularly those who invest in real estate. This is because real estate is immovable property. The payback rate will extend beyond 1997. During the 1980s, Hong Kong real estate gradually went from the hands of those who had no confidence to those who had confidence. Most of those who hold real estate today are those who feel confident about 1997. Spats between China and the UK will not make them unload real property. Therefore, it is not political factors that are the main factors today, but rather that economic factors favor the real estate market. An analysis of the high rise buildings market shows, according to Shih Yung-ch'ing, that because the Hong Kong economy has grown rapidly, quite a few people on the mainland have made money. (This income is not reflected in any economic growth statistics.) Their increased wealth has increased the demand for luxury dwellings. In addition, some people in Mainland China who have become rich first, and some "princelings" and entrepreneurs who have come to Hong Kong to make money, also want to buy luxury accommodations in Hong Kong. The overseas employees of foreign-owned companies also have such a need. The supply of luxury accommodations increases by no more than 1,000 or so units each year, yet the demand is for 2,000. Supply cannot meet demand, so high rise prices rise by at least 20 percent and as much as 40 percent each year. Today, the price rises between HK$5,000 and HK$6,000 per square foot each year. The market price of a medium or small apartment is between somewhat more than HK$3,000 and somewhat more than HK$4,000 per square foot, depending on location. Because of the effect of things such as banks 70 percent collateral requirement, the rate of increase during the past year was not great. It averaged about 10 percent, which is still higher than the inflation rate. High rise building prices today are at an all-time high. Shih Yung-ch'ing believes that during the coming year favorable factors will outweigh unfavorable factors in the high rise building market, including unfavorable political factors. Barring a turn to the left on the mainland away from the movement toward capitalism that produces a large upheaval, the rising trend will not reverse. It is anticipated that prices of luxury high rise apartments will rise 25 percent in the coming year, and that prices of medium and small apartments will rise approximately 15 percent. Also, because land sale prices set an all time high at the end of 1993, this will be reflected in the future market. Each year more than 30,000 new residential units are completed in Hong Kong, but because of the high prices of apartments, most people can only look at them and sigh. Recently, large numbers of Chinese mainland-owned apartments have been sold in Hong Kong, the number reaching 100,000 units in slightly more than a year. Shih Yung-ch'ing says that many Hong Kong people have purchased apartments on the mainland mostly because they cannot afford a Hong Kong apartment, and mainland apartment listings account for approximately one-third the total for sale in Hong Kong. The effect of mainland apartment listings on the Hong Kong apartment market has mostly been to soak up savings. Much money has been withdrawn from banks, thereby hurting the banks lending ability. This is also one of the reasons why Hong Kong banks have tightened their collateral requirements. Sino-Hong Kong Economic Relations and Foreign Trade: Development Is the Last Word Future Years To Be Decided by How Mainland Pursues Reform and Opening to the Outside World. Continuation of Regulation and Control Will Also Not Employ the Methods of 1993 As regards economic relations and trade between China and Hong Kong, so long as the China mainland continues decontrol, it will be possible to apply Deng Xiaoping's descriptive phrase, "Development is the last word." The event that had greatest impact during the past year was the China mainland's institution of macroeconomic regulation and control measures in mid-1993 only to relax them once again at the end of the year. The outlook for the next stage of Sino-Hong Kong economic relations and trade is that factors for optimism will predominate and political factors will not have much effect. This is the assessment of Chen Honglin, general manager of China's Tianan Investment Corporation. Chen Honglin feels that the mainland's macroeconomic regulation and control measures also play a positive role. First of all, regulation and control straightens out some ways of doing things; it reduces the formerly chaotic situation. Some new policies may be tried that can improve the system. Thus, operation of the economy may become more normal giving impetus to future development. Second, regulation and control is not a turning back, nor does it sacrifice speed. The present is a period when development is moving ahead. With the recent relaxation of regulation and control, various indicators appeared. Chen Honglin noted that with a little more relaxation, more capital will flow out of the mainland. right now, capital in south China is trying to break loose, but is being held back. Once relaxation occurs, it will come to Hong Kong to buy company names and put them on the stock market, or to buy real estate or negotiable securities. Even though the amount of money coming to Hong Kong may be limited, it helps attract more foreign capital to Hong Kong. Another psychological role it plays is that the regulation and control measures of the previous stage appeared without warning. No one knew how long the retrenchment would last. Not that they have been relaxed, even though not greatly, everyone feels there will be no further retrenchment. What real changes has relaxation brought? Chen Honglin said that trade was rather difficult during the previous stage because of the effects of regulation and control. The banks tightened the money supply. Deals that had been made could not be consummated for lack of money. However, by the end of the year, buying and selling increased. This may have been because of the relaxation of the money supply, but it may also have been because of the desire to use retained foreign exchange, or a combination of the two, a final spurt appearing at the end of the year. Nevertheless, despite the relaxation, there will be no verging on loss of control like previously. The relaxation will be focused on the development of bottleneck industries such as energy and transportation. Economic relations and trade between China and Hong Kong during the coming year will be determined by how the mainland pursues reform and opening to the outside world. Chen Honglin predicts that the situation in 1994 will be better than in 1993. This is because regulation and control has produced initial results. Even if regulation and control continues, the methods of the lat half of 1993 will not be used. The mainland's continuation of reform and opening to the outside world provides development room for Hong Kong businessmen. In the trade field, the basic stability of the renminbi, in particular, is a favorable factor. As for America's extension of most favored nation treatment, this is a matter at a different level. In the real estate field, too much was attempted during the previous period. Projects lacking viability will be eliminated, but a development potential exists in large cities such as Guangzhou and Shanghai. In the finance and banking field, the mainland will introduce a number of international practices, which it is hoped will help economic development. Chen Honglin expects that pilot projects will be decontrolled to permit the branches of foreign owned banks to handle renminbi business. Activities inside China and abroad to raise capital (including the issuance of stocks and bonds) will also increase under regulation and control. Chen Honglin predicts that prospects will be bright for finance and banking activity. On the political factors issue, Chen Honglin said the effect of political disputes between China and Hong Kong have weakened. The political changes that will have the greatest effect are still in the China mainland itself, and naturally the event that will have the greatest impact is Deng Xiaoping's death. However, Chen Honglin believes that the psychological effect of Deng Xiaoping's death may be greater than the real effect. This is because no turn around of the policy of economic reform and opening to the outside world is apparent. The conservatives are no longer able to reverse this direction of development. Some people speculate that the CPC leadership will have a power struggle after Deng dies, and that regional separatism may occur. These matters are difficult to estimate, and what effect they might have on the economy will depend on whether the political situation is stable. In short, unless there is some major change in the Chinese mainland political situation, future economic prospects should be good, and this should stimulate Hong Kong's economy.
