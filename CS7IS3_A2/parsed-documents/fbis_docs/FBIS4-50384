Although smiling and waving, King Sihanouk was clearly weak and had to be helped down the steps from the airplane after his flight landed at Beijing's international airport. Citing "serious health problems" Sihanouk said last week that he needed to return to Beijing from Cambodia two weeks ahead of schedule. The king spoke for several minutes with Chinese officials among the welcoming committee before being whisked away by limousine. Sihanouk, 71, began chemotherapy and radiation treatment at a Beijing hospital in October folowing the discovery of a tumour near his prostate gland. He has maintained homes in Beijing and the North Korean capital Pyongyang for several years.
