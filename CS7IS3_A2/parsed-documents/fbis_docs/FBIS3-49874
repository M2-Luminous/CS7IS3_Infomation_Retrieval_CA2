That is why a meeting was organized yesterday with Tony Land, chief of the UNHCR office in Sarajevo. Mayor Muhamed Kresevljakovic asked Mr. Land whether the obvious reduction in the humanitarian aid represented yet another form of pressure on the Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities, and whether the UNHCR had merged with the European underworld, which normally resorted to such tactics. Tony Land vehemently rejected this, justifying the increasingly poor deliveries to the Saralians by the wintry conditions, which limit the number of flights, by the frequent firing at UNHCR aircraft, and the lack of land corridors. The representatives of the city authorities proposed to Land that on one day no flour should be brought into the city, but instead all the flights should be used to bring proteins and sugar into Sarajevo. Land said that he had no say in the kind of goods that were delivered by air. All in all, the meeting with the chief of the Sarajevo UNHCR office was assessed as unsatisfactory. That is why the members of the Sarajevo City Council have sent another letter from today's session to UNHCR's Sadako Ogata, in which they inform her about the very difficult humanitarian situation in Sarajevo, asking her to do something improve it.
