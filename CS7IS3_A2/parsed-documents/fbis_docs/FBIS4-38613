The unsettled nature of credit relations is the main problem in bilateral contacts. This greatly limits the sphere of cooperation at the interstate level, the minister noted. Under the pretext of unsettled Russian debts, South Korea continues to enforce several secret limitations on trade and economic relations with Russia, including abstention from state crediting and insurance of foreign trade deals and investment projects. This creates some difficulties, especially for small and medium South Korean firms, Davydov stressed. Nevertheless, the year 1993 registered growth in Russian-South Korean trade turnover which was worth 1.5 billion U.S. dollars, the minister said. Russian export nearly doubled as compared with 1992, totalling 960 million dollars. Import from South Korea rose by 45 per cent, amounting to 530 million dollars. "I state with regret," Davydov noted, "that Russian export to South Korea consisted mostly of raw materials (98.4 per cent)." On the other hand, a trend for purchasing ready-made consumer goods rather than industrial equipment became more prominent in imports. It is expected that Davydov will hold talks on current issues of Russian-South Korean trade and economic cooperation with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam who will arrive in Moscow on an official visit on Wednesday.
