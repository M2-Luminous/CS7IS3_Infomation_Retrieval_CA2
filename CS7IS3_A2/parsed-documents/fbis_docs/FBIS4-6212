FBIS4-6212 "dreas075_j_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 Indonesia Further Reports on Labor Strikes, Ethnic Unrest Further Reports on Labor Strikes, Ethnic Unrest Troops in Medan on Alert BK1804144194 Jakarta ANTARA in English 1417 GMT 18 Apr 94 BK1804144194 Jakarta ANTARA English BFN [Text] Jakarta, Apr 18 (ANTARA) -- Chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Aburizal Bakrie affirmed that employers in Medan are willing to increase the wages of their employees but only if their demands are reasonable. The workers' demand for a pay increase to 7,000 rupiah (around US$3.33) per day is unreasonable compared to the regional minimum wage of only 3,100 rupiah per day (around US$1.5), Bakrie told a press conference after a meeting with President Suharto at Merdeka Palace [Presidential Palace] Monday. The conflict began in Medan on Thursday when more than 10,000 workers went on strike to demand higher wages and holiday bonus payments. The demonstration ended in a riot following the death of one worker. More than a hundred shops were ransacked and dozens of cars were set ablaze. Indonesian police and troops in armoured cars remain on alert, guarding Medan's industrial areas, particularly on the city's outskirts where most of the rioting took place.
