FR940412-0-00012 FR940412-0-00004 B. Texas Texas received final authorization to implement its hazardous waste management program on December 12, 1984, effective December 26, 1984 (see 49 FR 48300). This authorization was clarified in a notice published in the FR on March 26, 1985 (see 50 FR 11858). Texas received final authorization for revisions to its program in notices published in the FR on January 31, 1986, effective October 4, 1985 (see 51 FR 3952), on December 18, 1986, effective February 17, 1987 (see 51 FR 45320), on March 1, 1990, effective March 15, 1990 (see 55 FR 7318), on May 24, 1990, effective July 23, 1990 (see 55 FR 21383), on August 22, 1991, effective October 21, 1991 (see 56 FR 41626), and on October 5, 1992, effective December 4, 1992 (see 57 FR 45719). On December 8, 1992, the Texas Water Commission (TWC) submitted a final complete program revision application for additional program approvals. (In 1991, Texas Senate Bill 2 created the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (TNRCC) which combined the functions of the former Texas Water Commission and the former Texas Air Control Board. The transfer of functions to the TNRCC from the two agencies became effective on September 1, 1993. Under Chapter 361 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, the TNRCC has sole responsibility for the administration of laws and regulations concerning hazardous waste). Today, Texas is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). EPA reviewed Texas' application, and made an immediate final decision that Texas' hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to Texas. The public may submit written comments on EPA's final decision until May 27, 1994. Copies of Texas' application for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the ADDRESSES section of this notice. Approval of Texas' program revision shall become effective 75 days from the date this notice is published, unless an adverse written comment pertaining to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse written comment is received, EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a notice containing a response to the comment that either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision. Texas' program revision application includes State regulatory changes that are equivalent to the rules promulgated in the Federal RCRA implementing regulations in 40 CFR Parts 124, 260&hyph;262, 264, 265, and 270 that were published in the FR through June 30, 1991. This proposed approval includes the provisions that are listed in the chart below. This chart also lists the State analogs that are being recognized as equivalent to the appropriate Federal requirements. (As a result of the Texas reorganization presented above, TNRCC rules, once codified at Title 31 Texas Administrative Code, are now codified at Title 30 Texas Administrative Code).
