Police said the Chinook helicopter came down in thick fog while on route from RAF Aldergrove in Belfast to a security conference at an Army base at Fort George, Inverness. There were no survivors in the crash which happened at around 6 pm, approximately 700 yards from a lighthouse on The Mull of Kintyre. The RAF said the dead included four crewmen and 25 VIP passengers. Strathclyde chief constable Leslie Sharp told a midnight news conference in Glasgow that the dead passengers included 10 top RUC men, nine Army officers and six senior officials from the Northern Ireland Office. At least six of the dead were men in charge of the secret war against the IRA in Northern Ireland. They are believed to include RUC officers up to and above the rank of chief superintendent. Mr Sharp said all 29 bodies had been found and were removed from the crash site, about to a temporary mortuary at Machrihanish just up the coast. "At this time there are no reasons whatsoever to suspect that we are dealing with anything other than a terribly tragic accident," he added. Some of the dead men would have had access to the most sensitive intelligence in the fight against the IRA and would have been regularly travellers to Britain to update forces on the mainland. One was said to be particularly wellknown in London and was due to retire soon. Both the lighthouse keeper and a woman out walking heard the impact of the 51ft twin-rotar aircraft on the windswept hillside and reported seeing a fireball. Five Navy and RAF Sea King helicopters, local fire crews and lifeboatmen, coastguards, medical crews from Glasgow and specialist RAF mountain rescue teams all converged on the scene, 10 miles from Campbeltown, but there were no lives left to be saved. Wreckage on the ground was reported soon after impact but the search for survivors was hampered by the same thick fog which experts suspect may have caused the crash. At some points visibility was cut to 10ft. Colleagues of the RUC men tonight said they were stunned. "The force is devastated," said one. "It seems the upper echelon of the Special Branch is missing. We can't believe this has happened." No names of the 29 dead were being released until relatives had been informed. One RUC officer said: "These people were right at the heart of intelligence. These were the men who made the Special Branch tick. It's a devastating blow. It's impossible to explain such a loss. Everybody is reeling." One of the dead RUC men was in charge of the Special Branch's source handling unit -- the team which monitored the flow of vital information supplied by the IRA's informers all over Northern Ireland. The officer added: "This is a grievous blow which can't be underestimated. The place is in a state of shock and bewilderment. All these guys had their finger on the pulse. They knew everything." Whitehall sources were giving no details of the precise nature of the Fort George conference, but it seems to have been intended to deal with military and police strategy in the war against terrorism in Northern Ireland. Fort George is a base for the Royal Scots. The conference was being staged there simply because it is a large base with plenty of rooms and facilities -- and in an out-of-the-way and secure location, military sources said. Both John Major and his Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind were being kept informed on developments tonight. An MoD [Ministry of Defense] spokesman said armed forces minister Jeremy Hanley would fly from London to Machrihanish in the morning to visit the crash site and talk to members of the emergency services. The wreckage was strewn over one square mile of remote hilltop, 30 minutes' drive from Campbeltown, the nearest settlement and an air exclusion zone was put in place tonight. Earlier, neither police nor the RAF would give casualty breakdowns but one rescue source said: "The guys are working in the wreckage to get bodies -- it's as grim as that. The debris has been strewn over a huge area and everyone is there -- police, military personnel, everyone. The weather is still appalling -- fog, rain and high wind." Captain Donald Black, of the Campbeltown Lifeboat Services, said the scene suggested the helicopter had hit the ground and then skidded, or cartwheeled for a distance. Aviation fuel had also spilled and caught fire in the heather. Tonight in Glasgow, Mr Sharp said first impressions indicated that bad weather had caused the Chinook to hit the hill and said locals remembered many similar crashes during the Second World War. But he stressed that the cause of the crash had still to be determined "and this will obviously take some time." [passage omitted]
