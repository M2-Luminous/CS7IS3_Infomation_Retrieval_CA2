FR941212-1-00064 FR941212-1-00016 In addition to clearing woodlands, the diversion and channelization of natural watercourses, and pumping groundwater, are also likely to have reduced G. b. cactorum habitat. Diversion and pumping result in diminished surface flows, and consequent reductions in riparian vegetation are likely (Brown et. al. 1977, Strombery et al. 1992, Stromberg 1993). Channelization often alters stream banks and fluvial dynamics necessary to maintain native riparian vegetation. The series of dams along most major southwestern rivers (e.g., the Colorado, Gila, Salt, Verde) have altered riparian habitat downstream of dams through hydrological and vegetational changes, and have inundated habitat upstream. Overuse by livestock has been a major factor in the degradation and modification of riparian habitat in the western U.S. These effects include changes in plant community structure and species composition and relative abundance of species and plant density. These changes are often linked to more widespread changes in watershed hydrology (Brown et al. 1977, Rea 1983, GAP 1988). These changes are likely to affect the habitat characteristics critical to G. b. cactorum . Livestock grazing in riparian habitats is one of the most common causes of riparian degradation (e.g., Ames 1977, Carothers 1977, Behnke and Raleigh 1978, General Accounting Office 1988, Forest Service 1979). Potential future threats to pygmy-owl habitat also exist. Expanding human populations in the border region are expected to continue to increase impacts and threats discussed above. Further, extensive industrial, municipal, and agricultural developments facilitated by the Northern American Free Trade Agreement are anticipated along the U.S.-Mexico border. These developments may result in accelerated habitat loss and demands on groundwater. 2. Western Mexico The pygmy-owl occurs in the more arid lower elevations (below 1,200 m (4,000 ft) elevation) in western Mexico, in riparian woodlands and communities of thornscrub and large cacti. The pygmy-owl is absent or rare in the highlands of Mexico's central plateau (Friedmann et al. 1950), where the least ( G. minustissima ) and northern ( G. qnoma ) pygmy-owls occur. In the mid-20th century, the pygmy-owl was generally described as having been common in western Mexico (van Rossem 1945, Friedmann et al. 1950, Blake 1953). Schaldach (1963) considered the pygmy-owl abundant in Colima, at the southern extreme of its range, 30 years ago. Fifth years ago, the pygmy-owl was considered ``fairly common'' in the lower elevations of western Sonora (van Rossem 1945). Current information on the status of the pygmy-owl and its habitat in western Mexico is incomplete, but suggests that trends vary within different geographic areas. The pygmy-owl can still be located fairly easily in southern Sonora (Babbitt 1985, T. Corman, AGFD, pers. comm.), but its distribution is somewhat erratic. Christmas Bird Count data from 1972 through 1991 from Alamos, Sonora, and San Blas, Nayarit, indicate that the pygmy-owl was not uncommon, but detections varied widely from year to year (National Audubon Society 1972&hyph;1992). In recent years it has been found in abundance in some areas but is absent in others, in apparently similar habitat. Abundance also varies between habitat types, being more abundant in thorn forest than cactus forest (Taylor 1986). The pygmy-owl is now rare or absent in northern Sonora, within 150 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border (Hunter 1988, Monson and Russell in prep. , AGFD in litt. ). Extensive conversion of desertscrub and thornscrub to the exotic bufflegrass ( Cenchrus ciliarus ) for livestock forage is known to be taking place, but quantification is not currently available. It is possible that the factors causing declines in Arizona are also having effects in western Mexico (Deloya 1985, Hunter 1988). However, further information is needed before determining whether it should be listed in western Mexico. Eastern Populations
