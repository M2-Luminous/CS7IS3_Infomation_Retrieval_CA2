FR940627-0-00130 FR940627-0-00019 A summary table of the F/FA grouping system is included in the regulations (see Table F94&hyph;7 in ยง79.56). In this table, the fuel families serve as column headings and the categories define the rows. The resulting combination of fuel families and categories (i.e., the boxes in the table) contain the F/FA groups. Within each category, one or more groups are defined according to the presence of differing constituents in the raw fuel or additive/base fuel mixture. The number of groups in a particular F/FA category depends on the variability among the products in that category. For example, the atypical category for each fuel family potentially consists of many groups that are defined according to the atypical element(s) or constituent(s) specified for the particular family. Within each group, one formulation is chosen to represent all of the member products in compliance with the registration requirements. Related costs may be shared by participating F/FA manufacturers within each group. Groups within the Baseline Categories. The baseline category for each defined fuel family contains a single F/FA group, with the exception of the baseline methanol category. As discussed above, the baseline methanol category includes two groups: the M100 group and the M85 group. The representative to be used in required emission characterization and health effects tests for each baseline group is the designated base fuel for the respective fuel family (see Section V). For example, all gasoline formulations meeting the gasoline baseline criteria are sorted into one group, to be represented in testing by the designated gasoline base fuel. The same holds true for diesel, ethanol, methane, and propane fuel families. In the case of methanol, baseline formulations are divided into two groups and testing is performed on two representatives, one for each of the designated baseline groups, i.e., M100 base fuel and M85 base fuel. Groups within the Non-Baseline Categories. Non-baseline categories are defined for each fuel family. F/FAs in non-baseline groups include products that comply with the baseline elemental composition restrictions for the respective fuel family, but do not meet quantitative limits on certain baseline components (e.g., oxygen content). Non-baseline groups are defined according to the constituent(s) that differentiate the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture from the baseline products in the respective fuel family. The representative for each non-baseline group is the member of the group with the highest concentration of the non-baseline constituent. (a) Gasoline. Gasoline formulations which comply with the baseline elemental composition criteria, except that they have a total oxygen content of 1.5 weight percent or more, are designated as non-baseline. These products are grouped according to the specific oxygenate compound (e.g., any specific alcohol, ether, or methanol/co-solvent combination) used to increase the oxygen content of the gasoline formulation. Thus, separate non-baseline groups are defined for ethanol, methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME), diisopropyl ether (DIPE), di-methyl ether (DME), tertiary amyl ethyl ether (TAEE), etc. In the NPRM, EPA had proposed to define additional non-baseline groups for fuels containing combinations of oxygenate compounds (or for which the registration contained multiple oxygenate additives), with separate groups defined for each combination recorded in a registration. However, EPA decided not to require the testing of oxygenate combinations in this final rule during the routine Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing program. EPA believes that the testing of fuels with individual oxygenates will satisfy the main objectives of the program by providing basic information about the potential health effects of particular oxygenated compounds in gasolines. Requiring routine testing of every recorded combination was judged unreasonable, as it resulted in a number of groups that did not reflect actual formulations in use. If there is concern about the toxicity of specific mixtures of oxygenated compounds, EPA may require additional testing under Tier 3 on a case-by-case basis. An exception to this treatment of oxygenate combinations occurs in the case of non-baseline formulations containing methanol. Existing ``substantially similar'' criteria currently limit the use of methanol as an oxygenate in gasoline to 0.3 percent by volume (i.e., 0.1 percent by weight), unless the formulation contains appropriate alcohol co-solvents. Thus, methanol-containing gasoline formulations with 1.5 weight percent oxygen or more must also contain a co-solvent. Accordingly, in the grouping system, each methanol and co-solvent combination used in gasoline formulations defines a different non-baseline group [e.g, methanol and isopropyl alcohol (IPA), methanol and tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA), methanol and butanol, etc.]. Those oxygenate compounds used as co-solvents for methanol need to be identified as such in a fuel's registration. If an oxygenate is not identified as a methanol co-solvent, even if it appears in a fuel registration that also includes methanol, then EPA will assume that it defines a gasoline/oxygenate group separate from the methanol/gasoline mixture. Within each non-baseline gasoline group, a formulation consisting of the base gasoline fuel blended with the highest weight percent of the oxygenate or methanol/co-solvent combination registered for any member F/FA product will serve as the group representative that will be tested to comply with the program's requirements. The selection of the group representative is to be based on the highest actual concentration-in-use or the highest recommended concentration-in-use, whichever is the greater, for the particular oxygenate or oxygenate/co-solvent blend.
