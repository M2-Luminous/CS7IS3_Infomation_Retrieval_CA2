I would like to ask you one very personal question. You studied in South Africa. You were at Fort Hare University, and you have been avoiding coming to this country for very a long time. With the demise of apartheid how do you feel being back in the Cape? [Mugabe] It's a great feeling to be back to South Africa. I was back actually at the time of the inauguration, to attend the inauguration of President Mandela, and that was a great feeling, a great feeling indeed because I had last been here in 1952, only when I came back for graduation. I stayed in South Africa, I think for two years up to 19...[pauses] end of '51, in the Eastern Cape. A lot of things have happened since then, when I was at Fort Hare, and apartheid was just beginning to be implemented, and I remember the students who belonged to the African National Congress Youth League planning real action by way of demonstrations, sit-ins, and passive resistance, but after that the struggle took other dimensions, and there was armed struggle. It was during that period -- we were in exile together with the ANC and the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], and together we planned the strategies to defeat colonialism in whatever form, whether it was in the form of apartheid or in form of UDI [Unilateral Declaration of Independence], as in southern Rhodesia then. And we got our independence in 1980, 14 years before South Africa got its freedom and democracy. Of course, when we got our own freedom, we never regarded that as complete freedom of Africa, and we had always worked on a program, yes, for us to get our own freedom in what was Rhodesia, but also for others -- Namibia to get its own independence; South Africa to get its own freedom and democracy, and that was a long, long wait, a very long wait indeed. We all longed for a day when apartheid would go, when we could interact with South Africa, and we could visit South Africa and the South Africans could visit us. The day has now come, so it's a tremendous joy. [Mashokwe] Were you at all surprised by the turn of events come February 1990, when President De Klerk then announced these changes? [Mugabe] Yes, a mixture of both surprise and disbelief. Surprise, because we never expected that the leader of an Afrikaner Party, the National Party, which in fact had been the initiator of apartheid, could one day reverse it in that dramatic way. It was indeed dramatic, too dramatic for us to believe, but there it was. When it was first announced, we thought it was just palliative, the statement was just palliative in that apartheid would not really go, but when one measure after another was taken to undo it and completely eradicate it from the statute book, then we started to believe. [Mashokwe] Mr. President, do you ever regret the stance that you took? You were known to be very vocal against apartheid. You didn't mince your words on this. When you look back, your country suffered a lot of economic ills. You were destabilized in the process. When you look back, do you have any regrets? [Mugabe] We don't regret having taken the steps that we took. In fact, a country like Zimbabwe, who did not go the full length in opposing apartheid -- we wished we could have done more, but it was not possible because of the linkage between our economies -- the South African economy and Zimbabwe, a linkage that was consolidated by Ian Smith during UDI, and when Rhodesia was made to depend on South Africa. But politically, diplomatically we took quite a rigid stand, and we were not to have anything to do with those who were in charge of apartheid here and in government, therefore, because we held them responsible. We don't regret having taken that rigid stand at all, but we regret the loss of life that ensued, the sabotage that was carried out in Zimbabwe, destruction of ANC property and the loss of life that followed that destruction of property. That we regret. We still have those wounds. We still have the scars, the damaged buildings. They still are there, and in fact we still have prisoners we have arrested--people we have arrested for committing those acts of sabotage. But all that was really the amount of sacrifice we were called upon to make in order for us to have the day that now we have. In order for us to return to South Africa, we had to do all that. [Mashokwe] The prisoners -- are they going to be released at any stage? What are the possibilities? [Mugabe] Well, we are reviewing their cases. There are only five in our prison, and one of whom is a South African, (?called) (Zwayo), and the other four were South Africa's agents from white Rhodesia -- Rhodesians who worked with South Africa, but President De Klerk and now President Mandela have all appealed to me for possibly their release, but their death sentences had been commuted to life imprisonment, and therefore they are not going to die, but we are reviewing their cases. I consulted with the Minister of Justice the other day, and we thought we should review their cases in the same way as we review the cases of our own, but now that here people have been pardoned, people who were guilty of what one might call political crimes, and had been pardoned, except a few, we might very well review their cases in a favorable way. [Mashokwe] In South Africa we talk of this truth commission where South Africans are saying: Let's know what happened in the past. Let's pardon people, including right-wingers probably. [Mugabe] Pardons, sure, must be granted. The past must go. Bygones must be bygones, and this is what I said in March 1980, when I appealed to both the black and white community to work together. They had to forget the past. They had now to recognize that whether yesterday they had fought as enemies or as allies, they could no longer actually do without each other, whichever way things go. We shall live side by side with each other, and therefore, there had to be a recognition of that common belonging, a common denominator that came about as a result of our independence. The same with South Africa. There is that common denominator and your situation here is even much more complex than our own. We are only 10.5 million. You are 40-plus million, and therefore it's a big population you have, but apart from that a population that also subdivides itself into various races, various tribes, people living in various regions and a number of religious affiliations, and so it's a much more complex situation, and I admire the stance that President Mandela and of course the ANC have taken in demonstrating that this is now a new South Africa, which requires a new ideology, a new political outlook that binds everyone together and makes the people of South Africa have a common destiny, which means there is that greater sense of belonging to South Africa, greater sense of nationality than there ever was before. At least that's what is being cultivated and we admire that. [Mashokwe] We talk now of the conference that you attended, on the threshold of the new era. Many critics say that this threshold never really reaches the ordinary people of southern Africa, of Africa. What is your comment on this? [Mugabe] No, it does reach to the ordinary people of African grassroots, and we are always talking about the grassroots. True, when policies are first enunciated they don't immediately....[pauses] They don't go down to the masses until they have been explained, but this is the work that our subordinates must be doing in the regions and at various levels, to tell the people that we are now one, but of course it will take time for some of our people to forget and to forgive and forget, but the leadership, if it does continue to preach national reconciliation and national unity, national harmony, the message will get through. I assure you. [Mashokwe] Unemployment in Zimbabwe is said to be about a fifth of your people there. We have the same kind of problems. Is there no danger, not just in Zimbabwe -- South Africa has the same problem -- is there no danger of unemployed people overturning political gains? [Mugabe] No, I think the numbers are exaggerated. We have quite a lot of youngsters, yes, who are unemployed but our situation is quite different from yours. We are less urbanized than South Africa, less industrialized than South Africa. In industries -- we have in Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru, Mutare, yes -- but over 70 percent of the people, between 70 and 80 percent, are over [sentence as heard]. And the youngsters who are unemployed by and large are people with roots back in the rural areas. They come into urban areas to seek employment, but when they can't get that employment they go back to the rural areas. There is hardly a Zimbabwean who says Harare is his home. None. We all have our roots where people can do agriculture, and this is a solution that really, that we find amongst us -- that is, if the going is not that good in town, people can always go back to the rural areas and eat, provided of course we have not been struck by droughts, and so there is that aspect. People can do agriculture, and our youth, we are now trying to mobilize so some of them, I hope a substantial number, can pursue agriculture you see, as a way of life. But this is not to say we don't have a sizable number of people unemployed. Yes, the reason they are unemployed is not because there had been any mismanagement of the economy, but rather that colonial -- the colonial legacy that we have has been that of underdevelopment in what was regarded as the African sector in the rural areas and also the development of skills was delayed or denied in some cases. Therefore, even though the jobs are there but they are jobs for skilled men, and these cannot be found in every case. With jobs in industry, even in the public service, you see, we have jobs, but they require skilled people. In some cases the white employers go out of Zimbabwe to get skilled personnel, people with high skills whom they want to be managers or to be highly trained technicians operating in the -- I mean, to undertake operations in their industries. So that is one reason, but of course we are now engaged in trying to transform the system and opening it up to investment, encouraging existing investment to expand and, thereby, create more jobs. It will take us time, but we are doing that. [Mashokwe] What role, Mr. President, do you see for South Africa in the Southern African Development Community? [Mugabe] Oh, a tremendous role. South Africa will now come with its heavy muscle and join us. Heavy muscle, because it is a highly developed country. It has its own problems, of course, of underdevelopment in certain sectors, but you have highly developed industries and that gives South Africa quite a muscle with which it can interact with us as we relate to it, both multilaterally within the region, and also bilaterally. We trade with South Africa. Zimbabwe is the largest trading partner South Africa has in Africa, and 20 percent of our imports come from this country, and so we are quite a market. Botswana gets about 80 percent of its imports from this country and so also is a good market, and now what we want to see is an economic order that binds us together in a cooperative way, and of course the benefits must be reciprocal. We must open up our borders, remove tariffs, or lower them for a start, and trade with each other as freely as we can. [Mashokwe] Is there no fear of this big brother image which could probably bring about concern or suspicion? [Mugabe] Oh, no, no, no. We are very happy. In fact we are encouraging countries whom whenever we speak and this subject arises, we always encourage countries to help South Africa at this stage. South Africa will need a lot more of aid by way of investment, even grants for a start. We had that kind of, you know, boost at the beginning of our independence, and at least to get us...[pauses] to get our economy to be reconstructed and rehabilitated, and South Africa needs that kind of assistance from the whole of the international community. Yes, when one looks at Cape Town and Johannesburg, Durban, and the other big cities one is impressed by what happens there. But one must look also, even within those cities, at the depressed areas, you see, the townships, that has been neglected. One must look at the systems, social systems that operate and see whether these systems are equitable or inequitable. Look at the educational system. A lot needs to be done really to rehabilitate, to reconstruct and restructure it in such a way that it is the education that formally on the blacks [as heard]. Education systems can be boosted, can be qualitatively transformed and brought to the level of the education that was obtained on the European side, and this is what we had to do in our own country -- remove the inequities of the past, all the inequalities. That will require some funding, a lot, lot more funding and investment is required in order for the economy to continue to grow, and if South Africa prospers that way they will get the benefits as well, by way of the new technology which has come to South Africa. There would be companies that will come to Zimbabwe, to Botswana. We already have lots of South African companies in our country and the technology that their parent companies acquire here will be technology that the subsidiaries elsewhere will require, but of course, within the system of our interaction, cooperation, the benefits by way of technology will be our benefits. The benefits by way of capital goods will also be our benefit. We will use machinery for our mines from South Africa. South Africa will sell them much more cheaply that Britain or Germany, for obvious reasons, are likely to sell those same goods to us. So, there is that benefit to be derived and we don't think that money that comes to South Africa is money that would have come to us, necessarily, no. [Mashokwe] Fourteen years of Zimbabwe's independence. What lessons are there for South Africa -- for this new emerging democracy? [Mugabe] Quite a number of lessons, and I don't think they are lessons necessarily for the government or for Mandela. They are lessons for the community. One, independence does not usher in an era of manna falling from heaven. Never will there be gifts the Almighty will shower down on the people of South Africa. The people of South Africa have got to sweat, to work hard. Now the environment is there. We must ask for the opportunity, you see, for them to work. The opportunity for them to have the necessary skills, the opportunity to be appointed, given they have those skills, to jobs that they were denied yesterday, and this is what the outlook must be on the part of the people -- patience. They will require a great amount of patience because delivery of benefits is a process, a function really, of the development of industries. Then there is the second aspect which has to do with racial harmony. That has got to continue. If that fails then the country is ushered into an era of conflict and a country as large as South Africa, if it develops conflict you know what the consequences will be and there will then be a spill over into neighboring countries. One we would hope that doesn't happen. We are glad that the policy that has been adopted by President Mandela is one of racial harmony and one, of course, that seeks now to get rid of the conflict between Inkatha and the ANC, the conflict between the whites and the blacks, and if only the people will heed that lesson, then we will have a very peaceful and stable South Africa, but it will take time. It has taken a long time for our own whites to adjust to the new situation. Yesterday they were the leaders, they were, well, the policy makers, and now that we are the policy makers some of them find it extremely difficult to adjust. Economically, they are still bosses in our country, the whites, and they have not, you know, as it were, reoriented their thinking. They have not fully adjusted. Some have adjusted but they are only a small number. Ian Smith is still talking the same UD language ... UDI [Unilateral Declaration of Independence] language as in 1965. He hasn't adjusted, but we didn't have to adjust. We adopted the policies that we espoused, even during the liberation struggle. We said to ourselves we are not fighting the white man because he is white. We are fighting his policies. Once those policies have gone the white man becomes acceptable, but he will have to accept the new order, but you have people like Ian Smith. You have your own Ian Smiths here who will continue to fight for the old order, even though it's a futile struggle, but it will continue until [laughs] death takes them, and so really, we have got to be patient, and I would hope that my brother President Mandela will be patient with them and not get annoyed. We have been patient with Ian Smith. He still runs his farm. We have not confiscated it in any way. We ... sometimes you feel... [pauses] you feel the man is completely unrepentant. Why continue to treat him justly, but then sense and I think, magnanimity bids that, well, that the man is harmless anyway. Let him have his outpourings and they won't do anyone any harm. [Mashokwe] Mr. President, I'm running out of time. [Mugabe] Yes? [Mashokwe] The issue of the Frontline States, will it still be there as the OAU has been accused of not being able to address its own socioeconomic and political problems. Let's look at Rwanda for instance? [Mugabe] Yes, the Frontline States no longer have a front line, and we do not regret that the front line has gone. I was joking with former President de Klerk yesterday, when he asked me whether South Africa was a member of the Frontline. I said yes, and he said where is the front line? I said if the FL still exists it's now the fishing line along the coast. And so that's why we wanted the Frontline to (?leave) and that's where we now are. So we can go fishing now, but we are looking at how we can transform the Frontline into an organ that will be a watchdog one, and come to the assistance of countries or a country that will have lost control because of some instability that has been triggered by lawless people. And we have the example of Lesotho, what's happening in Lesotho, and really Lesotho requires friends now. Friends who believe in democracy. Not long ago they had elections there in order to transform the military experience there, which the people of Lesotho were forced to embrace for so long a time, into a new democratic order, and the elections were won by the BCP [Basotholand Congress Party]. But some people are opposed to that experience. And we feel that Lesotho is really to be allowed now some period of rest from military rule, and anyway, a period it deserves, because everybody in our region is going democratic. They will possibly be assisted. And so the Frontline States, as a spearhead of the OAU, and also of course as an organization of our own region, can be transformed so it embraces not just the countries that fought for Zimbabwe, Namibia, and South Africa, but others also in our region. Possibly the role of SADC [Southern African Development Community], and has this political agenda, but not an agenda to interfere in the domestic affairs of a country, an agenda really to salvage a country, to save it from being torn apart by forces that are inimical to progress and democracy. And that's the role we hope those of our experts we asked to look at how the Frontline States can be transformed, and the new look Frontline States might be able to do. But you made mention of the OAU and Rwanda. Well, the OAU is a much larger organization than the Frontline States, and of course the larger an organization is then the more complex and the more problems, and in some cases the more contradictions it embraces. And it's true that in Rwanda we have a situation that should have been controlled long ago, but this is not to say nothing was being done, President Mwinyi was working with our encouragement on a program to get the leaders to agree to proceed to elections, and in fact there is already an Arusha Agreement. Unfortunately, the incident of an air crash reversed the process that was underway, but we hope we can once again, if we send troops, as some of us have committed ourselves to do, and bring the situation under control, and President Mwinyi can start the exercise from there. He left it off where the air crash and the events that followed disrupted it. So it's not that nothing was being done in Rwanda, it is only that when the event or the tragedy of the air craft that crashed happened, and the subsequent developments, the Hutu rising against the Tutsi, and we were not poised immediately to go into Rwanda and help solve the situation, that was unfortunate. [Mashokwe] In conclusion Mr. Mugabe, what do you want to do when you stop being a politician? [Mugabe] What do I want to do? I want to teach again. I want to go teaching. When I retire from politics, obviously, I want to do a little more reading, more writing especially, and bring you into another focus of our people, and some of my experiences in getting them to read and evaluate my experiences. [Mashokwe] Mr. Mugabe, thanks for your time and for honoring us with this interview. [Mugabe] Thank you.
