Obviously as a result of pressure exerted by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], the body, chaired by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, decided on Tuesday [26 April] to establish a working group consisting of defense experts of the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the FDP. These experts are to intensively discuss Ruehe's plans -- including the reduction of the armed forces to 340,000 men -- before any decisions are made. According to reports from coalition circles, a detailed commitment to the future structure and strength of the Bundeswehr has been avoided. This is to be made before the Bundestag elections, if possible even before the summer recess, participants in the meeting said. Kinkel had reportedly come out against the reduction of the armed forces to 340,000 men, which Ruehe is striving for, and has insisted on the current upper limit of 370,000 men. Primarily, it must be asked how big the Bundeswehr must be in view of Germany's security policy, Kinkel said. This determines the financial demand and not the other way round, namely that the financial demand determines the size of the Bundeswehr. In the CDU/CSU, too, the number of soldiers is disputed. After the meetings of the coalition representatives and the Cabinet, Ruehe stressed that, apart from the question of personnel, the basic issues of his concept met with agreement. This applies to the financial demand of 47.5 billion German marks per year, the division of the Bundeswehr in crisis reaction forces and main defense forces, as well as a correspondingly differentiated military service of 12 and 10 months respectively. General compulsory military service is to be maintained in any case, Ruehe told journalists. This year no further decisions will be made about the future of individual barracks. Ruehe repeated his view that with the current financial volume it is not possible to maintain a strength of 370,000 men, modernize the Bundeswehr, and raise the investment share from the current 20 percent to the planned 30 percent all at the same time. The savings outside personnel reduction, which Kinkel is demanding, are envisaged in his concept anyway, Ruehe said. He is confident regarding the further discussion; he feels "very much supported" by his party. CDU/CSU circles said that the decision by the coalition representatives was surprising after the FDP had signalled basic agreement after talks with Ruehe over the past few days. The German Bundeswehr Association has meanwhile called the minister's ideas "well founded." In the future, too, the army will be large enough to fulfill its tasks, Association Manager Bernhard Gertz said on Deutschlandradio Berlin. In the response to a parliamentary inquiry by the Party of Democratic Socialism, the Federal Government stated on Monday that about 169,000 recruits were drafted for basic military service last year.
