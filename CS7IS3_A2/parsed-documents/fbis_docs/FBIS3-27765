The two are Sfc. Kim Chol-chin, age 23, and Pvt. Kim Kyong-chol, 19, of a North Korean People's Constabulary Unit. The duo were spotted and rescued unconscious on Jan. 27 south of the West Sea extension of the Military Demarcation Line near Paengnyong-do Island while they were adrift in a tiny boat. They were taken to the capital military hospital, where they expressed the hope to return to North Korea, a Ministry official said. He said the two will be returned to North Korea through the Military Armistice Commission at Panmunjom inasmuch as they are military members and were rescued in an area under control of the United Nations Command in Korea. The pair said they left their duty area at Ochasin-ri, Yongyon-kun, South Hwanghae Province, by small boat around 6 p.m. Jan. 25 to collect fishnets set 50 meters off the coastline near their post. But, they were swept away by a sudden gale and went adrift before being rescued by a South Korean Naval vessel one mile south of the sea boundary around 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27.
