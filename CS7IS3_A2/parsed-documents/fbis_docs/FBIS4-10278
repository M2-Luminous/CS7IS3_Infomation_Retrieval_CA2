Defense Minister General Angel Montero Revette said after a meeting with President Rafael Caldera that Tucano airplanes and ultramodern F-16 fighter bombers destroyed the landing strips with war bombs "to prevent the garimpeiros from violating national sovereignty." Although Montero did not disclose how many airplanes were used or landing strips destroyed, he said that reconnaissance efforts had been conducted previously by land in Sierra de Parima and Delgado Chalbaud hill, over 1,100 km south of Caracas and virtually on the Brazilian border. The minister stressed that these actions were coordinated with the Brazilian Armed Forces. Government sources have disclosed that the Army and militarized National Guard also participated in the operation. A week ago National Guard troops clashed with a group of garimpeiros. One of the gold seekers was killed, two were captured, and four managed to escape.
