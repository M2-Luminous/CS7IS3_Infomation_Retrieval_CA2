Rehn's success mainly redounded to the disadvantage of Raimo Ilaskivi (Conservative Party), and Rehn was moreover the candidate who garnered most votes across party lines. The results were analyzed by a Statistics Center report that was published immediately after the first stage of the presidential election on Monday [17 January]. The Statistics Center compared the votes received by the candidates' political parties in the last municipal elections and constructed special profiles for each candidate. The support for first-round winner Martti Ahtisaari (Social Democratic Party [SDP]) derived mainly from areas where the SDP is strong, completely different from the pattern in Rehn's support. Looking at where the SDP ran strong in the municipal elections, Ahtisaari won in Helsinki and Oulu, and in the Kuopio and Lapland electoral districts, and did worst in Northern Karelia and Kymi electoral districts. In his hometown Oulu and in the Kuopio electoral district Ahtisaari won the leftist vote. Ahtisaari also seems to have run strongly among high income earners. He was the victor in 67 of Finland's richest 113 municipalities, and Rehn in 27. Ahtisaari was the winner in most large cities. Some exceptions included Espoo, Kokkola, and Vantaa, where Rehn was victor. The Unemployed Favored Paavo Vayrynen Center Party candidate Paavo Vayrynen appears to have been the favorite in areas of heavy unemployment. He won in 7O of the 12O municipalities in which unemployment has grown most rapidly. Second most favored in areas of heavy unemployment was Ahtisaari and third was Keijo Korhonen (Center Party). Having campaigned as a strong leader, Vayrynen received strong support also from those municipalities in which incomes fall below the national average. Vayrynen came out somewhat poorly in regions where his Center Party is strong, but did well in areas where Center Party strength is weak. Vayrynen's support was greatest in sparsely populated agricultural districts. Ilaskivi Lost in Cities According to the Statistics Center, Ilaskivi did poorly in areas in which the personal income level is high and that have been the basis of Conservative Party electoral strength. Ilaskivi's losses were larger in cities than in less densely populated municipalities. Comparing figures for Rehn and Ilaskivi, it appears that part of the Conservative vote went to Rehn. Korhonen was especially favored in cities, from which he got over half his votes. His support was as expected strongest in Kainuu, where he took votes from Vayrynen. The Left Alliance lost most votes as a party, compared with the 1992 municipal elections. Support for Claes Andersson dropped from the figure for the latter elections especially in the Lapland, Oulu, and Kuopio electoral districts. The Left Alliance voters also deserted Andersson in the northern electoral districts of Turku and Pori counties. Support for Pertti Virtanen was slightly larger in cities than in rural areas. Eeva Kuuskoski garnered two-thirds of her votes from cities. Finns residing abroad most strongly supported Rehn, who got 3O.9 percent. Following her were Ahtisaari (29.5), Ilaskivi (14), and Vayrynen (12.4). Kuuskoski, Andersson, Korhonen, and Virtanen got small percentages of the foreign Finns' vote, and the bottom candidates some tenths of a percent. Those casting their ballots in Sweden favored most Ahtisaari (33.2 percent), followed by Rehn (32.8). Then came Vayrynen (14.4) and Ilaskivi (7.3).
