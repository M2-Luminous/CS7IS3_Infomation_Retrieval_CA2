In order to attract Hong Kong and foreign investors, the Hunan Provincial Government recently formulated new regulations and offered more favorable conditions to them. Hong Kong and foreign businessmen are encouraged to make investments in the following projects: 1) The construction of basic agricultural facilities; 2) The planting and raising of high-yield and good-quality crops and animal breeds; 3) The development of forestry; 4) The development of aquiculture; 5) Tests and application of modern agricultural techniques and technologies; 6) Processing of farm, forest, animal, and fishing products; and 7) other export-oriented agricultural development projects. External businessmen may make investments or may carry out cooperation in the form of providing funds, materials, industrial property rights, patented technologies, or other property rights. The Chinese side may make investments or may carry out cooperation by means of providing funds, land assets or land use rights, plants, equipment, technologies, crops, forests, water resources, and other property rights. If external businessmen want to make independent investments to run crop, forest, animal, and fishing farms, they may do this by going through the formalities for the transfer of the land use rights. After acquiring the land use rights, the external investors will be able to carry out their development projects, and they also may transfer the land use rights to other people after they fulfill the requirements of the first transfer contracts. If external businessmen independently develop collective agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery, they may go through the formalities according to the contracts on the use of collective land, but the collective land cannot be resold. When external investors use state-owned land to launch their development projects, the longest term of land use may reach 50 years. The land use contracts may be extended if the same land is still in use. If external investors use state-owned land to launch development projects in the fields of agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishery, they may be exempted from paying land use fees for 10 to 15 years as of the date of approving the land use. If the land is used to develop forestry, the term of exemption may be 20 to 30 years. In their investment in agricultural development projects, external businessmen also may enjoy the following favorable taxation arrangements: First, when foreign investors launch developing agricultural projects or introduce improved varieties and animal breeds recognized by the provincial government to separated test zones, their income from the test cultivation in the process of scientific research will be exempted from local taxes for a certain period of time. Second, the improved seeds, seedlings, stud stock, feed, medicine for protecting plants and animals, and the tools and equipment for processing farm products imported by the enterprises with external investment for the purpose of exporting farm products will be free from customs tariff. Third, a reasonable quality of materials and appliances used by the external staff of the enterprises with external investment in their daily lives are free from customs tariff. Fourth, with the approval of the customs authorities, the agricultural development zones may set up comprehensive bonded warehouses and bonded factories. The goods imported to such bonded facilities are completely free from customs tariff. The farm products for further processing shipped by the chain enterprises and for indirect export are free from customs tariff. If the products are related to export licenses and export quotas, the external investors may apply for such licenses and quotas from the authorities in charge of foreign trade, which first will meet the needs of foreign-funded enterprises involved in developing agricultural projects in the issuance of export licenses and quotas. The provincial government also requires in the regulations that local governments at all levels, as well as relevant departments, offer effective assistance to external investors involved in agricultural development projects, and help them solve problems in their production and daily lives, and guarantee their legitimate rights and interests.
