In this one year, of the nine highway contruction projects in the National and Autonomous Region's 7th and 8th Five-Year Plans, eight were finished and put into use, with six of them being assessed as fine projects. This was a result of the attention and concern of the Ministry of Transportation and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional People's Government, the support of the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang, and the hard work of tens of thousands of highway construction workers and officers and men of the People's Armed Police Transportation Unit. Xinjiang is a vast territory where transportation used to be quite backward. But as reform and opening up has developed in depth, and China's western economic construction has taken off, the importance of highway construction in Xinjiang has become increasingly evident. The great northwest is a key region in China's productive forces layout in the transition to the new century, and a priority in China's "four border" strategic development, as Xinjiang sits on both borders and roadways, being located at the center of the new Eurasian land bridge, with over 60 countries and regions having developed "highway"-centered economic and trade exchanges, with Xinjiang as the relay station and the Central Asian inland business and trade center for joint development with the CIS and Eastern Europe of the Eurasian inland market. Xinjiang highway construction is a heavy responsibility with bright prospects, meaning that we will have to work even harder. We are now actively planning the construction of a superior highway from Turpan to Urumqi to Dahuangshan. This will be Xinjiang's largest single highway construction project since liberation, with an estimated overall investment of 2.3 billion yuan, including a World Bank loan of $150 million, with the highway being 285.5 km long, divided into two sections, east and north. The east section will start at the mouth of Grape Ravine in Turpan on National Highway No. 312, ending at Ulabo Lake in Urumqi, being about 178.8 km long; the north section will start at the intersection of Xingfu Road at Dahuangshan in Fukang on National Highway No. 216, ending at the north mouth of Hetan Road in Urumqi, being about 107.7 km long, to be a key part of China's northwest highway system. The highway will pass through famous Xinjiang tourist sites such as Turpan and Tianchi, running along Xinjiang production bases for commodities such as coal, oil, industrial chemicals, iron and steel, and motor vehicles. It will play an enormous driving role in speeding up the industrial and agricultural production of these areas and in spurring economic development throughout Xinjiang. We have made conscientious early-stage preparations according to World Bank loan international project procedures, with the feasibility study report having successfully won State Planning Commission approval through examination and appraisal, the initial project design documents having been examined by the Ministry of Transportation, and an evaluation of the whole project by the World Bank Evaluation Delegation having been received. To ensure project progress and quality, we have adopted international bidding, with over 30 construction units having bought advance eligibility evaluation documents, the roadside work of land acquisition and demolition and removal already underway, and efforts being made to begin construction in the summer or fall of 1994. Meanwhile, we are emphasizing three highway construction projects, such as from Tianchi to Turpan Port, guaranteeing their total completion in 1994. While focusing our human and financial resources on superior highway construction project priorities, we will continue in 1994 to build highways such as National Highway No. 312's sections from Sailimu Lake to Qingshui River and from Hami to Barkol, in an effort to build more and better roads for Xinjiang's economic development. As a review of the past year shows amazing achievements, we are looking to the future with full confidence. We will welcome the arrival of the new year with even more outstanding accomplishments.
