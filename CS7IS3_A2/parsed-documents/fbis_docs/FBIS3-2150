From the fact that the conference insisted on a need to ensure social stability while pursuing reform and economic development, this is considered a measure to prevent media reports from causing social unrest. However, the decision to ban the use of the slogan comes as a surprise to large sectors because it was a slogan announced by the supreme leader, Deng Xiaoping, during his visit to south China in February, 1992. This visit is known to have become the starting point of the current high economic growth. Besides the ban on use of the slogan, the source said the conference released the policy on banning media reports which 1) can incite public apprehensions about inflation; 2) play up increasing debts of state-owned enterprises; and 3) point out problems with economic development of coastal areas or criticize growing gaps in regional economy and personal income. Since late last year, media have reported much about the possibility of large-scale economic reform being launched this year, thus causing public apprehensions about inflation, panicking people into hoarding foodstuffs and thus causing price hikes. The source said these measures are a product from this experience. Premier Li Peng spoke on the current economic situation at the conference, and said: "While paying attention to both favorable and unfavorable conditions existing in our economy, we should promote economic reform at an appropriate pace but in an positive way." Furthermore, he indicated that the economic growth for this year will be set at around 9 percent as was decided at the State Council's Economic Work Conference held at the end of 1993. Since the nation achieved an economic growth of 13 percent in the past two consecutive years, however, there are strong complaints among local CPC cadre members about this as in seen in a remark by a Beijing cadre member who charged setting the goal at 9 percent "is extremely conservative." Even Deng Xiaoping is said to be unhappy about it.
