To accomplish this strenuous task, it is very important for us to rely on scientific and technical progress. For this reason, a number of key laboratories should be established throughout the province, in addition to technical research and development centers that are closely linked with production enterprises. We also should develop technical popularization networks in various localities and trades. We should actively develop the technology market, and should encourage scientific and technical research units and personnel to run enterprises, or to become shareholders of enterprises in a form of scientific and technical investment to promote the integration of the market, scientific research, and production.
