In a meeting with South Korean correspondents here, Spokesman Chen Guosang said Monday that "the Chinese leader will definitely visit South Korea." "A foreign visit by the top Chinese leader is customarily decided upon in relatively short time before the actual visit takes place," Chen said. "President Jiang's visit to South Korea is just a matter of time." The spokesman thus did not rule out the possibility that Jiang's Seoul visit could be realized earlier than generally expected. President Kim Yong-sam extended an invitation to Jiang to visit South Korea during their march summit meeting in Beijing, which the Chinese president accepted.
