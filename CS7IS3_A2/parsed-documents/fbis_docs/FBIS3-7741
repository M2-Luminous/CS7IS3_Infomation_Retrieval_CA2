Together with the group that, as a part of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, supported the Alternative of Political Realism, he intends to form a strong bloc oriented at the center of the political spectrum. This group counts on Cernak's [National Democratic] wing of the Slovak National Party and on the Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic. But talks with other parties are also in progress. Asked how he sees frequent changes in the post of Slovak foreign minister, inasmuch as in other countries foreign ministers retain their posts regardless of changes in the composition of elected coalitions, Jozef Moravcik said: A mechanism allowing this practice to be implemented should be created in Slovakia. Slovak foreign policy does not benefit from frequent changes.
