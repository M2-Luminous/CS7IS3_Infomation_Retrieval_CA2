The company will recommend that the governments of both Japan and the U.S. tighten their methods of technical review and set minimum acceptable price ceilings for procured items. So far, Cray has bid successfully on only one of eight contracts that the Japanese Government has awarded under the first supplementary budget of 1993, and is unhappy about this situation. Meanwhile, the Japanese Government and manufacturers are unhappy about the way the U.S. Government conducts its procurement. As such, it is likely that there will be a reaction to Cray's position. Before biddings on a total of 11 computers to be procured under the supplementary budget began, John Carlson, Cray's chairman, had said that his "goal is to land contracts on four or five of them." So far, it has procured a contract on only one computer. While there are three more contracts for which to bid, it is likely that the company will win only one of them. Cray believes that its poor performance is due to the method of technical review, which prevents its products' technical advantages to stand out in view of the low- price bids of Japanese manufacturers. The company's officer concerned said his company "will not file a complaint on the biddings this time," but the company plans to request that in biddings henceforth, evaluations of product performance be conducted by a third party, and that lower-limit price ceilings be instituted in addition to the upper-limit ceilings currently required. But among Japanese manufacturers there are voices saying: "It is absurd to set lower-limit ceilings on bid prices. Price competition contributes to lowering government expenditures." Some also note that in the biddings made under the supplementary budget, three out of eight successful bidders are to provide U.S.-made products, which, they say, means that progress is being made in market liberalization.
