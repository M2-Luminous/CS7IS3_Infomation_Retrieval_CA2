An official of the Banking Administration Bureau under the People's Bank of China said that overseas co-operators now number 40, with a total investment amount of three billion U.S. dollars. More than 20 Chinese investment funds have their stocks listed on the securities markets of New York, London and other European countries as well as Hong Kong. Starting in 1987, the Chinese investment funds burgeoned particularly in 1992. Banking specialists here agree that the expansion of the Chinese investment funds overseas indicates foreign investors' appreciation of the prospects for China's economic development. It also paves the way for China to absorb overseas capital and stimulates the growth of domestic investment funds.
