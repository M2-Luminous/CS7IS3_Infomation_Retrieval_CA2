Asked what he hopes to see from the government that new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was to form later in the evening, Saito told a regular news conference he would first put priority on the long- delayed budget. The government of Morihiro Hosokawa was unable to start Diet deliberations on the budget for the fiscal year that started this month, as parliamentary business snagged on the personal financial dealings that toppled Hosokawa. "It would be nice to see the budget enacted as soon as possible," Saito said. He also noted that a meeting of finance leaders from seven major industrial nations Sunday reconfirmed a Group of Seven (G-7) commitment to exchange rates that reflect economic fundamentals and to avoiding "excessive" fluctuations. In the future, Saito said, he hopes the G-7 will "cooperate to stabilize the foreign exchange market."
