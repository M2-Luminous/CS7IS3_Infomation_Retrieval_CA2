Officials from the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) of the mainland and the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) of Taiwan agreed to hold further talks as soon as possible to negotiate the repatriation of hijackers so as to reach a formal agreement. A senior official from ARATS told XINHUA today that the negotiations between the two sides from December 18 to 22 in Taipei had made major progress as the two sides have achieved important common ground and formed a basic framework for the agreement on repatriation of hijackers. Airliner hijacking has become a serious problem since early this year. The two sides agreed in principle that hijackers must be repatriated and punished severely, as hijacking civil airliners is a serious criminal activity. The framework of the repatriation agreement involves the scope of repatriation, principle of repatriation, coercive measures and the way of repatriation and hand-over, according to the official. The planned agreement applies to persons from both sides of the Taiwan Straits who hijack civil aircraft to the other side. The official said that although exact wording of the agreement is to be further discussed, Mazu and Mawei ports will be the places for handover and Jinmen and Xiamen may also be possible venues for it.
