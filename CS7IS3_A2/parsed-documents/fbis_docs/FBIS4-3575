It will reduce the part the central government plays in their business and leave them to be managed by bar associations, said Justice Vice-Minister Zhang Geng. And the move will give lawyers more freedom to open up businesses and offer the public better services, Zhang told a council meeting of the All China Lawyers' Association (ACLA). Bar associations will handle lawyers' registration, training and exchanges and protect their legal rights. This will divorce them from the decades-old system under which they served as government employees and were assigned work by judicial administrations. The new system will make judicial organs responsible for approving law offices and mapping out official policies, Zhang said. Work to introduce bar associations began several years ago, leading to the establishment of the ACLA, and 29 provincial associations. The change was necessary as China switched to the socialist market economy, said Zhang. For lawyers and law offices would have to serve as counsel for the government, enterprises and individuals. And more and more lawyers and law firms would be needed as the economy continued to develop. Last year, 20,000 lawyers began practising and 900 law offices were setup -- rises 46.3 percent and 22.8 percent respectively from 1992. At the end of last year there were 66,700 lawyers in 51,000 offices. Zhang called on Chinese attorneys to learn laws and regulations thoroughly, and master the theory of the market economy to serve their clients better.
