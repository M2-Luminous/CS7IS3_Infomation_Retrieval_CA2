IZVESTIYA was first to obtain a copy of this bulky report prepared by the Academy of Sciences' economics department and the international foundation, Reform. Ten of the most well-known economists gathered around the same table to work on this document in the final stage. We have highlighted three of them solely because Stanislav Shatalin was director of this work, while Leonid Abalkin and Nikolay Petrakov were recently named chief advisers to a government which is renewing its course. There was even talk of instructing first deputy chairman Oleg Soskovets to draw up a program of essential changes. Nevertheless, Stanislav Shatalin told your IZVESTIYA correspondent that the notion of a special "Abalkin-Petrakov" program is a myth. All that they have to offer the government is this report and it is this joint document which is now lying before the president, the chairman of the government, and the deputies in the Federal Assembly. Well, we are reading this undoubtedly interesting work slightly earlier than the president and all the rest. We shall omit the detailed criticism of Gaydar's reform. It was voiced fairly often when the reform was being implemented and its opponents became even more active after the retirement of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov. The Shatalin team's main conclusion is this: The scale of the present crisis, which has increased as a result of shock therapy, and its internal structure are having an extremely dire effect on the solution of social tasks and threaten the irreversible destruction of the country's economic, scientific, and technical potential. After expressing the ritualistic criticism of the monetarists, and moreover expressed in sometimes well argued criticism, the academicians move onto the basic principles of the development of their strategy. There are six. To summarize briefly, first there is the "definition of the social indicators of the reform" -- a guaranteed subsistence minimum, an employment threshhold, the proportion of expenditure on education, health care, and so forth -- limits which may not be exceeded under any circumstances or for any reason. Second, they are demanding the abandonment of the "naive belief in the automatic improvement of the economy by impersonal monetarism" and demand the restoration of state regulation. Material production must be supported, the competitiveness of Russian goods must be increased, and reliable economic legislation must be adopted. The third principle is financial stabilization. How? The measures include the mobilization of domestic sources of accumulation using the population's money savings. While proclaiming a rigid financial and credit policy, the academicians nevertheless believe that the priority spheres and production units must be supported. They propose the regulation of prices and incomes. And so forth. The fourth principle is the guideline toward the single Russian market. But here they utter the traditional phrase about switching the focus of the reform "from the center to the regions." Fifth. Reliance on one's own efforts. A reappraisal of the role of foreign aid. We will cope by ourselves. Sixth and last. The transformation of the relations of ownership. This is the main area. Every form of ownership, and that includes state ownership, must have an owner. The economy is multi-tiered. Attracting investments is the main criterion in the decision on privatization. Switching the focus from the privatization of property to the privatization of management (eternal glory to the directors!). And a sweeping blow: the "consistent curtailment of voucher-based privatization as a populist measure, which is incapable of resolving the problem of social injustice but can intensify the rise in inflation and the collapse of the production potential." The old guys know how to swear eruditely. There are three stages to the "new" reform. In the first 2-3 years we will achieve stabilization. We will stop the slump in production and reduce the rate of inflation. We will highlight the "crucial areas" (housing, food, and medicines) and place the emphasis on them. In stage two -- 10 years -- we will embark on the structural reorganization of the economy. We will achieve the pre-crisis volume of gross product and ease the stratification of property so that in the third stage we can join the ranks of the world's economic leaders. But that is in the future. In the first half of this year it is planned to settle all the wage debts. To establish in legislation a subsistence minimum and within a year raise the minimum wage to that level. "But that means the money supply," I said to Shatalin, "it means increasing the money supply again. " "Yes, it means the money supply," the academician agreed, "which in its pure form leads to a rise in inflation. But if the extra money leads to a growth in production and extra goods, this will reduce inflation. You have to do your calculations. That is what I told Boris Fedorov -- you have to do your calculations." The authors of the report argued among themselves most about prices and customs policy and the attitude toward hard currencies. This is how it turned out in the end. The liberalization of prices, first and foremost prices for energy resources, can only restrict the market and lead to a new spiral of inflation, a further slump in production, and the collapse of whole sectors if the commodity producers retain their monopoly, the authors believe. This means that it is necessary to use the traditional stabilization measures. In other words, to regulate prices. The sequence goes like this -- first prices for certain raw materials and transport charges are fixed. The state pays the debt to the sectors. Then within the framework of this set of measures the ratio between prices and pay levels are normalized by agreement. Prices will be indexed by means of special funds created from tax receipts from above-norm profits. This tax will be paid by those who sell output at deregulated prices. The aim is that a certain rational correlation of prices will be fixed initially using administrative measures and then within a few months an entire system of economic regulators will be built to "underpin" these correlations. The academicians' dream is that inflation will then be around 3-5 percent. As a consumer of their economic plans I can foresee empty shelves in the stores. Just like before. Empty shelves will be the result of the proposed principle of the protectionism of this country's producers primarily through a customs import tariff. The course aimed at the convertibility of the ruble is acknowledged to be long-term and is effectively postponed indefinitely. But the task right now is to regulate the system of the internal convertibility of the ruble. The auction rate ceases to be official. The Central Bank fixes the price of the dollar. After that it is like it used to be in the old days. The course of the reintegration of the former republics of the USSR, although, admittedly, on the basis of national currencies. The restoration of the manageability of the economy. That is, the direct management of state enterprises. State control of the process of privatization. The appointment of leaders. The participation of local organs in the direction of joint-stock and holding companies. "It can no longer be tolerated that ministries and departments are removed from the processes of the reform of enterprises.. from influencing the consumer market".... Shatalin himself admitted honestly: He knows how things must not be done but he only half knows how things ought to be done. Nevertheless, instead of surgical intervention, the ailing economy is being offered the old, tried and tested medicines whose effectiveness is only half guaranteed. The point, it seems to us, is not whether the prescriptions are old. The point is that even if you wrap them in a new package, they passed their use-by date long ago.
