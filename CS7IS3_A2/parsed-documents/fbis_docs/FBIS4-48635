ANC Secretary-General Mr Ramaphosa, 41, who was elected unopposed by a joint sitting of the 400-member National Assembly and the 90 member Senate, will oversee the two-year process which is to draw up the country's final constitution. Former minister of manpower, National Party MP Mr Leon Wessels, was elected his deputy. Neither nomination was opposed. Speaking to the 490-member Assembly immediately after his unopposed election, Mr Ramaphosa said he was eager to get down to the task. When Senate President Mr Kobie Coetsee, who oversaw the election, announced that Mr Ramaphosa had been duly elected, all the members of the Assembly, except for a handful of Freedom Front MPs, rose to their feet and applauded. After being escorted to the presiding officer's seat, Mr Ramaphosa shook Mr Coetsee's hand and took the chair. He told the Assembly that its inaugural meeting was the culmination of many bitter struggles waged by "the mass of our people" to install democratic rule in South Africa. It was also the embodiment of a vision now shared by many South Africans that the final constitution should be drafted by an elected body of men and women to realise the long-cherished dream that the people should govern. The Constitutional Assembly gave the country prestige and raised hopes that the task of broadening and deepening democracy in South Africa would indeed be accomplished. The Assembly had a historic and important task, Mr Ramaphosa said. The constitution would have to reinforce the aspirations of all South Africans on the matters of reconstruction and development, would have to enhance national unity and reconciliation, and help achieve lasting peace. "It is a document that must spell out the fundamental principles by which we as South Africans want to be governed," he said. He regarded it as a great honour as well as a formidable challenge to be elected to chair the Assembly charged with such an important task, and undertook to perform his duties in a spirit of fairness and openness so that South Africans as a whole could see that their parliamentarians were involved in a truly transparent process. He trusted the Assembly's deliberations would be marked by a spirit of co-operation and good humour. Drafting the document would entail tough political bargaining, but the quality of the final product would depend on the intellectual and emotional balance, the farsightedness and wisdom each of the Assembly's members were able to bring to the task. "I trust we will not be found wanting," he said. Those who elected the MPs had reposed a great deal of trust in them. "We must not and cannot fail," he said. Immediately after Mr Ramaphosa's speech, ANC Chief Whip Mr Arnold Stofile moved without opposition that Mr Ramaphosa be empowered to appoint a rules committee for the Assembly, and that he chair the committee. Mr Ramaphosa dissolved the Assembly "until further notice". He was the ANC's chief constitutional negotiator, a former security detainee, and headed the National Union of Mineworkers before becoming prominently involved with ANC-aligned politics in the late 1980s.
