This is in addition to demands that North Korea comply fully with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections and engage in dialogue with South Korea, they said. Seoul and Washington share two common goals, Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar told a press conference winding up a four-day visit to Seoul. The goals are to preserve peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, avoid proliferation of nuclear weapons and prevent North Korea from becoming a nuclear state, they said. "This challenge we face together, I believe, has to be met with firmness, determination and calmness," said Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. North Korea must satisfy the IAEA on inspections of all declared and undeclared sites, Nunn listed as one of the terms to bettering ties with North Korea. It must also accept all legitimate demands "made by the IAEA for the purpose of assuring the world that North Korea is in compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and its obligation," Nunn said. North Korea would also have to sit down to discuss with South Korea denuclearizing their peninsula. "Beyond that, there would have to be some understanding and discussions regarding North Korea's past behavior in terms of terrorism, and also including the case for missile technology," he told reporters. Nunn described North Korea's unexpectedly frequent return of the purported remains of missing American soldiers from the Korean war over the past few months as "one encouraging sign" and said solution of the nuclear problem would be a "very important first step." The senators' visit has been described as a field trip to tap all possible countermeasures to North Korea's nuclear problem. They came to Seoul after making stops in Moscow and Tokyo. Asked about the viability of economic sanctions and military strikes should diplomatic efforts fail, Lugar advised the involved parties to be "thoughtful and careful." He repeated President Bill Clinton's words that an attack on South Korea is an attack on the United States. "We ought to say we are prepared for all contingencies," Lugar said. "But my own view is we ought to be thoughtful, patient and persistent and that time is on our side." It's important to apply pressure "without being provocative, dramatic," the senator said. Tying what he saw in Russia with North Korea, Nunn warned of economic collapse if Pyongyang continues on its present path. "There is a powerful lesson in here (Russia) for North Korea," he said. "It's apparent that a nation cannot continue to really have an economy that sustains its people if it invests the kind of percentage of GNP in defense that Russia did in the past and North Korea continues to do today," he said.
