Leader of the Liberal-Democratic Union of December 12 Boris Fedorov categorically opposes this idea. He told INTERFAX that it was illegal and that he would resign on the day stated in the Constitution -- December 12, 1995 -- whether or not a decision on the issue was taken. Leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party Vladimir Zhirinovskiy believes that the deputies' powers may be extended, if his party is given a chance to form a government. Otherwise, early presidential and parliamentary elections must be held, he said. Vice-Chairman of the Communists of Russia faction Viktor Zorkaltsev said that the proposal on postponing parliamentary elections was unethical. As the State Duma was elected for two years, he said, it had no moral right to vote for the extension of its powers. "Electors will not understand us," he said. Representative of the Russia's Choice faction Aleksandr Osovtsev views this proposal as an attempt to "buy" deputies. "One can't change the rules either during the game or after it, when a certain result has been achieved. This is not a gentlemanly practice," he said. In his opinion, the alignment of forces in the bodies of state authority following the elections on December 12, is "accidental rather than logical" and that new elections must be held. Member of the Yabloko faction Viktor Sheynis said that the idea of suspending parliamentary elections was immoral, and expressed hope that even the deputies who wanted to have their powers extended would not dare to ruin their reputation by supporting this idea. In his opinion, the State Duma is not likely to provide two thirds of the votes necessary for changing the Constitution. Deputy Gennadiy Burbulis, who withdrew from Russia's Choice faction recently, said that extending parliament was possible. He believes, however, that the most important thing is to ensure the stability of the current course, not to extend the deputies' powers. Burbulis also said that the question of extending the president's term in office might be raised on the condition that Boris Yeltsin pledged not to run for the presidency in 1998.
