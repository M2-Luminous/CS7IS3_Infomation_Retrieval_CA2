It has already been decided to give rewards ranging from 3,000 yuan to 30,000 yuan under these regulations to some 13 informers for the information on such evil-doers which they gave to the procuratorates, said Zhao Dengju, an SPP deputy procurator. "Exposure by means of letters, telephone or interviews by the masses has played a key role in China's drive against the corrupt practices," Zhao told a news conference here today. Some 80 percent of all the corruption cases on the procuratorial file for investigation and prosecution were traced on the basis of clues reported by the masses, he said. Since the beginning of the current anti-corruption drive, the procuratorates nationwide have accepted and heard 230,000 such cases, of which 170,000 were corruption cases, he said, adding that they accepted and heard 1.69 million reported cases since 1988, of which 1.22 million were related to corruption. The provisional regulation stipulates that an informer will be rewarded based on the role his information plays in cracking the case, or his contribution in helping the judicial bodies, and the illicit money or goods recovered. To protect the informer from revenge, the regulation states that information about the informer will not be disclosed without his or her own permission. The SPP official said the 13 rewarded informers had helped to uncover 11 major and important corruption cases, and recover 18 million yuan worth of illicit money and goods. Their rewards will total 119,000 yuan, he said. The provisional regulation going into effect today is expected to help further the country's anti-corruption drive, Zhao said.
