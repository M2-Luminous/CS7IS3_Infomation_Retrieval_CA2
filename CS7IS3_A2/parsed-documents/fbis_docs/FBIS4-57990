Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo told NOTIMEX the government of Jose Maria Figueres, who was sworn in on 8 May, will review its relations with Cuba. "The Cuban people have been greatly harmed by a blockade that has lasted many decades, and we believe the Cuban problem should be discussed within the OAS," Naranjo said. He stated: "In a matter of months, Costa Rica will approach the OAS concerning what we believe should be a revision of the Cuban situation," the Costa Rican minister added. We do not rule out the possibility of analyzing Cuba's situation at the next OAS general assembly, which is scheduled to be held in Belen do Para, Brazil, from 6 to 10 June, the Honduran Foreign Ministry reported. Haiti's problem is another case that must be analyzed within the OAS, Naranjo said. The strengthening of the democratic system, the human rights issue, and the integration process are part of the topics in the agenda for the next OAS general assembly in Brazil. Moreover, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal told NOTIMEX that, "in Cuba's specific case, the world has changed, and we believe Cuba must return to the OAS." Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar said "Cuba is a brother country that belongs to the American hemisphere and it must be reinstated in the OAS." Panamanian Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero Gonzalez said he "disagrees" with the blockade enforced by the United States against Cuba for more than 30 years. "The case of the Cuban embargo must be discussed at the OAS because this is apparently the last remnant of the Cold War redoubt," Cordero said. Guatemalan Foreign Minister Marithza Ruiz de Vielman emphasized that the president of her country, Ramiro de Leon Carpio, has yet to define what position he will adopt concerning the Cuban case. Salvadoran Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria revealed a position similar to the one adopted by Guatemala when he said President Alfredo Cristiani's administration has yet to discuss the Cuban issue.
