Reality has proven that, in the past four years, a number of elements have been accumulated which have not only permitted access to stronger measures for the transformation of the economy, first of all, into a market economy, but which also require the application of these measures. In this context, the program proposed by the PDSR is notable for its obviously pragmatic character. Its point of departure is the fact that, legislatively, Romania has succeeded in eliminating the backwardness in reforms compared to the neighboring countries. There is another fact which can be deduced from the structure of the entire program drawn up by this party -- namely, the fact that the reform which it would like to have accelerated on all levels is not an act of virtuosity but one which is absolutely necessary for the achievement, in time, of an economy which is in harmony with the Western countries and in accordance with the human and material resources available to us. In this context, in 1994, all attention should be concentrated on ensuring stability and economic recovery, for a greater coherence of socioeconomic reform, with emphasis on two basic elements -- privatization and restructuring. Also, it will be absolutely necessary to take a number of austerity measures. Without going into detail in regard to such a far-reaching and ambitious program which offers, upto the end of this year, possibilities for our economic recovery and, to a no lesser extent, for our social recovery, we will, however, try to present a few of the illustrative elements. Thus, ensuring the development of industrial production (a process for which some opportunities were offered in 1993) will mean technological modernization and restructuring of production in all branches. Labor productivity and product competitiveness will increase. The structure of services will be developed and diversified. The investment process will be reinvigorated and the inflation rate will be controlled. At the end of the year, the rate of inflation will be about 75 percent higher than in December 1993. In the field of privatization, first of all, in addition to supporting competent institutions capable of applying the development strategy of the private sector (the National Agency for Privatization and the Romanian Development Agency), we will aim to privatize 2,300-2,400 commercial companies. An action worthy of attention will be the utilization of ownership certificates, which, at present, is only a hope. At the same time, efforts will be intensified to clarify the system of ownership in agriculture, aiming at the issuance of at least 1.5 million property titles so that this process can be concluded in 1995. Restructuring, an extremely important process, must be expanded. However, this does not mean -- and the PDSR program points this out -- the dismemberment of national industry or ultimately, the deindustrialization of the country. Also, it must not be interpreted as a cause of unemployment or as an occasion for importing products which will no longer be supplied by Romanian industry. However, the national economy must be "purged" of nonviable economic agents. Competitive fields, as well as economic agents with the same defining characteristics, must be stimulated. We will not dwell upon the implications of this measure for individual branches of industry, but we will mention only a few basic principles with the aid of which the planned dimensions will be given to this work. Thus, among other things, we will allocate financial resources to obtain the necessary financing for the restructuring program by giving governmental guarantees and assuming state debts upto the limit of 0.5 percent of the gross domestic product, obtaining foreign sources of financing, in the form of reimbursable and nonreimbursable credits, soliciting, on a priority basis, the technical assistance of international bodies in drafting and implementing the priority restructuring program and the medium-term and long-term strategies for the restructuring process, including assistance in the juridical and legislative domains. Also, public corporations will be discussed and restructured. Of course, only a careful examination of this program could demonstrate the solid and coherent policy planned for this sector which is so responsive to restructuring. The policy also calls for a resumption of investment activity by giving priority to projects already begun, by clarifying the situations of suspended projects whose continuation is opportune, by establishing measures with a view to finalizing the public investment program for energy, transportation and telecommunications, land improvement, water resources, forests, and environmental protection, the communal-administrative infrastructure of localities, as well as urbanism and territorial management. The wage and price policy will be a very important element. In this area, first of all, efforts will be made to create the legislative and institutional framework for the protection of competition and to pursue the strict observance of regulations in this field, in accordance with the free action of economic agents and the general interest of economic and social stability. In regard to prices, the intervention of the state will be limited only to fields which contain the attributes of natural monopolies. For this purpose, competition-type infrastructures for purchasing, processing, and distribution will be gradually created. And, finally, the legislative framework will be set up for institutional structures to protect competition. The wage policy will be geared toward stopping inflationist pressure and promoting competition in the national economy. The budgetary and fiscal domains and the fields of monetary and hard currency policy have not been neglected. Also, actions and measures for achieving objectives and priorities for foreign economic relations, for scientific research and technological development, education, human resources, health care and medical treatment, culture, local public administration, national defense, and reform in the field of justice are being thought about. We will mention, from the fiscal domain, the presentation to Parliament of laws on the profit tax, the general income tax, the tax on agricultural income and local fees and taxes. In regard to the restructuring of budgetary expenditures, among other things, wage limits will be introduced and the number of public functionaries will be reduced, among other ways, by the effects of the law on the organization of the activity of the government and the ministries. Subsidies for 1994 will amount to only 3.5 percent of the gross domestic product. We will aim for a significant increase in the financial autonomy of the public administration and special importance will be given to the organization of institutions for stock market transactions. The Party of Social Democracy is asking the government to place measures of social protection at the center of attention. In this field, the program has several priorities: the protection of the incomes of the population by slowing down and stopping the deterioration of their purchasing power, the stimulation of the demand for workers and the social protection of the unemployed; the acceleration of the process of reforming social security and public assistance systems, the improvement of working conditions and the support of the construction of housing for the people. As for the employment of the labor force and the social protection of the unemployed, in 1994, a draft law on the professional formation, advanced training, retraining, and recycling of workers will be promoted. For a better administration of the unemployment fund, a tripartite system will be instituted for the fund's administration and monitoring. In regard to the protection of the income of the people, there are plans to improve the system of indexing incomes, perfecting the mechanism of moderating the total cost increases with wages, correlating the base wages of personnel in public institutions with those negotiated in other sectors of activity, as well as protecting the wages of persons with low incomes by ensuring the payment of the minimum wage and its periodic review. The reform of the social security system will also aim at the establishment of autonomous risk insurance banks and will ensure that budgetary expenses for social security are limited to 8-8.5 percent of the gross domestic product. In its turn, social security will undergo profound transformations. This will include a law for the protection of minors in special situations, as well as a law on special protection for people with handicaps. There are plans to improve the legislative and institutional framework for labor safety and working conditions. Finally, the construction of housing will be encouraged and supported. In this area, the construction of 17,000 apartments, currently in different stages of execution, will be completed. The legislative framework and the necessary institutions for financing housing construction will be created. The construction of public housing for families with modest incomes will begin, about 3,000 lower quality apartments will be rehabilitated, and the program of consolidating buildings destroyed by earthquakes will be continued. This economic strategy program of the PDSR also makes references to the foreign policy of the country, stressing, in this area, the elements which define our actions in the context of a definitive rapprochement of Western European structures to North Atlantic structures. In essence, the few elements which we mentioned are proof that the PDSR is tenaciously working for the consolidation of the state of law, the acceleration of economic reform, and restructuring and privatization, along with the assurance of real social protection, in accordance with the laws and interests of Romania.
