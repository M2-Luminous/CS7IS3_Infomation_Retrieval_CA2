The court rejected Vil Mirzayanov's suit against the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] on the grounds that the FCS -- after the Security Ministry was abolished and primary investigation functions were transferred to the Prosecutor's Office -- is no successor to the Security Ministry. "This is the first case in which the court has defended the interests of a citizen who suffered from the state's high-handedness," said Aleksandr Asnis, the scientist's lawyer.
