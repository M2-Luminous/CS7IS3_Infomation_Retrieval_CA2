Ada's promoters now envision a planetary future for it. In step with its upgrades (Ada 83 in 1983, Ada 9X next September), the Ada language, invented by the French around the end of the 1970s for the DOD (the U.S. Department of Defense), has been jogging along in its quiet way. But watch out! This time, urged by its large-scale industrial users worldwide, its additional features have to do with object-oriented programming and enhancement of the language's real-time characteristics. Ada thus becomes a serious challenger to C++, in the object-oriented language sphere as well as in that of real time. After the hopes to which the start of the preceding decade had given rise, the Ada market never really took off. Different estimating methods put it today in the vicinity of $220 million annually (see box). "The fault lies with serious marketing problems," says Marie-France Mignon, communications director at Alsys. "Ada can be installed only by specialists; and efforts aimed at students have been insufficient. We are seeking to remedy this situation, since it is they who open the doors for us to new accounts where force of habit, indeed lack of information, tend to result in the use of C++." C++! Voila their nemesis. Still reluctant to acknowledge it though, the extraordinary success Bjorn Soustrup's language enjoyed during the 1980s is sufficiently solidly based to rouse the passions of Ada's supporters. All precautions were taken from the very outset with respect to standardization and responses to the needs of users. C++'s gains are all the more infuriating in that "historic" Ada clients, specifically the defense industries, are gradually surrendering to the fad. The Ada 9X norm project, once accepted (for the moment, it is being examined by the ISO [International Standards Organization]), is expected to respond, at least from the technical viewpoint initially, to the advances C++ has achieved. "This new edition is in keeping with a contractual requirement for a review of Ada every 10 years by the ISO," says Pascal Plisson, who heads the defining of Ada products at Alsys. Specifically, Ada 9X will enhance the language in two principal directions. Object-oriented programming occupies a preponderant place, since Ada will now have more robust inheritance capabilities and polymorphisms of execution, two essential characteristics for valid support of the object archetype. Prototyping tests, which in particular enabled the DOD to launch the Ada Gnu product, revealed compaction gains by a factor of 5 with respect to the code of certain Booch software components (named after the American creator of the method). This should greatly improve its reusability and readability characteristics. Real-time applications can also be expected to benefit from recent work that takes into account asynchronous models through the addition of a type of protected codes. Alsys reports gains in execution by a factor of 3 during recent prototypings, with respect to the so-called "rendezvous" mechanism used in Ada 83. In addition, Ada 9X will now support the 8-bit international ASCII character set, which is expected to open the doors of the Japanese market a little wider to it. The language is also to be further opened to the outside world, possibly giving rise to programs written in Fortran and C, for example. And recent disclosures indicate that, upon submitting application for certification, each supplier will be asked to choose an applicative option. The choices offered will be: parallel processing, scientific computing, or distributed systems. "Approximately 90 percent of the kernel of a compiler will be common to all; the remaining 10 percent will depend on the option chosen by the supplier," says Pascal Plisson. 9X Products Beginning in 1994 Alsys plans to launch a first product under the new norm around the beginning of 1994. Verdix prefers to more cautiously await a justification of this shift, based on demand by clients loyal to Ada (generally speaking, Americans, who are very sensitive to the recommendations of the DOD). "We do not want to run the risk of disappointing them with products that may lack sufficient robustness," says its director for Europe, Olivier Roubine. The strategy that Verdix (Vadspro line) and its new partner Rational (Apex, under UNIX) intend to follow will be to provide real-time extensions to their compilers, beginning in the second quarter of 1994, and object-language extensions in the third quarter. The 9X movement, and Ada's intent to offer C++ serious competition within two years from now, can nevertheless be deemed to be already under way. A study by French consultant Jean-Francois Guenon forecasts that by 1995 these two languages will clearly dominate the world of real time, to the detriment of C. It remains to be seen whether the promoters of Ada will be able to impose their language on the computer community as a whole. Nothing is less certain. The DOD, of course, has committed several million dollars to promote Ada. But there is a possibility that this effort may not reach beyond a clientele consisting of big industrial and defense accounts that are already users of the language. Alsys, which makes no secret of its militancy in favor of the Ada cause, has decided to market Proada compilers under Windows at less than 5,000 French francs [Fr], around mid-1994. But essentially, the suppliers' rationale revolves around the problems of development. "Ada has always sought to incorporate the leading software engineering ideas of its time," says Pascal Plisson, adding by way of further clarification, "Ada is not the largest of the existing compilers. It is the smallest software development environment." Rational, with its Rose environment, and Alsys, having taken over the activities of IGL Technology, a Thomson subsidiary specializing in software engineering, have made no secret of their intent to rapidly attain critical mass, no longer in the Ada market (where the two groups represent close to 50 percent of the market), but rather in the software engineering market. And with a telling argument: "Particularly in the real-time domain, our products offer already integrated development facilities, while the vendors of C and C++ computers position themselves in this market mainly as sellers of accessory tools for refurbishing a workshop," says Marc Richard-Foy, who heads pre-sale activities at Alsys. It remains to be seen whether this integrative and, on the whole, globalizing rationale will not penalize Ada 9X as compared with the supposed flexibility of use of a C++ compiler. The trend does not yet favor Ada 9X, which, in particular, has not managed to penetrate the small and medium-sized enterprises sector. The suppliers are hoping not to regret, some few years hence, not having dared to name Ada's new upgrade Ada++. [Box]: Still a Confidential Market Worth only $220 million annually, the Ada world market is dominated by the two recently formed groups: on the one hand, Rational and Verdix; and on the other, Alsys and Telesoft. The first of these groups today accounts for around $65 million of the market, and the second for around $50 million. These two entities have incontestably far outdistanced their immediate pursuers: Tartan, DCC, and especially DEC, which mainly sell compilers. But in addition to their size, they are also characterized by their interesting positioning in the world software engineering market, where they easily rank among the top 10, and where they are pitted against the more generalist development environments of Cadre (Teamwork) and IDE (Software Through Pictures).
