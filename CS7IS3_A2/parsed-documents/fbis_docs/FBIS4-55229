The prosecutor's office have informed the Budapest court about this in a letter. The court is to decide on the movement's application for registration in an extrajudicial procedure. The prosecutor's office drew the court's attention to the fact that the real aims of the Hungarist Movement are demonstrated by its leaders' statements, from which it emerges that they regard Ferenc Szalasi, the leader of the former Arrow Cross movement, as their ideal, and even the name of their organization is identical to the former fascist movement. In the peace treaty concluded at the end of World War II, Hungary undertook an obligation that it would not allow fascist organizations to function.
