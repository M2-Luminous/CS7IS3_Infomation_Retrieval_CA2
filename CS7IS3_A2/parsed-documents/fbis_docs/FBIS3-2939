Focusing on the task of making package improvements and breakthroughs in key areas in the reform of the economic structure for 1994, the deputies discussed in depth the relevant issues. They pointed out that it is necessary to concentrate more on reform; to pay attention to careful organization and overall coordination; to unite as one; and to work creatively so as to ensure essential progress for our reform this year. Some leading comrades from the CPC Central Committee, the NPC Standing Committee, and the State Council participated in the discussion meetings of some of the delegations today. They joined the deputies in deliberating the work report and listened to their opinions and proposals. Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun; Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau; and State Councillor Song Jian focused on agricultural production when they expressed their opinions while participating in the discussion meetings of the Jilin, Gansu, and Jiangsu delegations respectively. Tian Jiyun stressed: There will be overall stability only when there is stability in agricultural production and stability in the countryside; only when there is overall stability can reform in various areas be smoothly implemented and can development be promoted. People throughout the country, both at the top and at lower levels, must take agricultural development as a task of prime importance. Wen Jiabao stated: We must conscientiously implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and those of the central conference on rural work; must stabilize and improve the party's basic policies for rural areas; must deepen rural reform; must ensure the implementation of various policies; and must further enhance the enthusiasm of the peasants by promoting rural economic development, by increasing peasants' income, and by promoting rural stability. Song Jian stressed: We should regard agricultural production as our basic strategy and pay particular attention to developing agriculture by relying on science and technology. After hearing remarks by deputies from the Inner Mongolian delegation, Vice Premier Li Lanqing pointed out: This year's reform covers a broad spectrum and is very intensive. Time is pressing. This requires governments at all levels to effectively handle relations between reform, development, and stability while practically and realistically resolving problems appearing in the process of reform. Taking part in the Gansu delegation's discussion and deliberation, State Councillor Li Tieying said: Although there is quite a gap in the level of economic development between China's eastern and western regions, their understanding of reform and their efforts to accelerate reform should not differ. Accelerating reform and exploring new ideas suitable to the western region's development constitutes the fundamental approach to revitalizing the region's economy and narrowing the gap between east and west. Speaking at a meeting of the Liaoning delegation, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua paid special attention to the technological transformation of large and medium-sized enterprises. He suggested we must have a sense of urgency on this issue, undertake work every year, and make constant efforts to achieve technological progress and meet market demands. Ren Jianxin, member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, said at a meeting of the Shanxi delegation that effective measures must be taken to safeguard and ensure public order and social stability. Taking part in the Taiwan delegation's discussion and deliberation, Vice Premier Qian Qichen said: Peaceful reunification of the motherland is the common aspiration of all Chinese people. Any attempt or act to divide the motherland, no matter in what form, runs counter to the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation and is doomed to failure. He added: As long as people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait join hands to develop relations, the great cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland will surely be realized at an early date. The reform programs to be launched by the state this year are greater in number and magnitude, broader and deeper in scale, and more difficult than those carried out previously. Therefore, deputies from various provinces emphasized: We must dare to make reforms and must seek ways for advance, coordinating efforts to effectively implement and publicize reform programs to ensure the achievement of concrete results. Shandong delegate Jiang Chunyun stressed the need to devote more energies to studying, promoting, and carrying out reforms to ensure the smooth implementation of the central authorities' various reform programs. To this end, he said, we should pay particular attention to work in the following three aspects: First, we should further emancipate our minds and seek truth from facts, seeing to it that the thinking and concepts of cadres at all levels conform with the requirements for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. Second, we should enhance our awareness of the overall interests and correctly handle the relationships between individual and collective, local and national, and current and long-range interests. Third, we should fully mobilize and harness the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of people in reform. Guangxi delegate Zhao Fulin stated: We must fight an all-out battle because many of the reform programs already launched this year involve changes in ideology and concepts, innovations of system, and readjustment of interests. Hence, he called for courage and determination to overcome difficulties in reform, adding that people at higher and lower levels must work with one mind, consider the overall situation, and observe discipline. Henan delegate Li Changchun said: In brainstorming this year's reform programs, we must promote package reforms in the five areas of the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, while simultaneously achieving breakthroughs in the two key areas of microeconomic market foundation and macroeconomic market system. Therefore, leaders at all levels should pay keen attention to promoting reforms, correctly handling the relationship between local and national interests, and earnestly implementing various macroeconomic regulatory and control measures. Jiangsu delegate Shen Daren said: In the course of introducing various reform measures, leaders at all levels should pay keen attention to investigations and studies, constantly keep abreast with new circumstances, promptly solve new problems, and earnestly summarize and popularize good experiences so as to promote reforms in a prudent and down-to-earth manner. Many delegates stated views on specific reform programs. Sichuan delegate Guo Daiyi said the only way for invigorating large and medium state-owned enterprises lies in deepening reform, pointing out: First, we must straighten out the relationship between the enterprises and the state with regard to ownership; second, we must clearly define the relationship between the government and enterprises; third, we must reduce the financial burden the enterprises have to bear in supporting social undertakings; and fourth, we must establish mechanisms for the enterprises to exercise scientific management and raise economic efficiency. Stressing the need to accelerate reform of the financial system, Henan delegate Zhao Bingshen said: First of all, financial system reform must be synchronized with the transformation of the operating mechanisms of enterprises; second, it is necessary to standardize management systems while continuing to rectify financial order; third, it is necessary to go all out to pool funds lying idle in society to meet the demand of funds for economic growth; fourth, it is necessary to adhere to the policy of stressing efficiency and repayment capability in issuing loans; and fifth, it is necessary to increase efforts to transform specialized banks into commercial banks.
