The investigation revealed that many police officials, including several who served as police chiefs, have been involved in reactionary activities, have organized secret meetings, and have adopted code names in the organization. The investigation was secretly carried out by the inspectors of the General Director of Police. The report written by the inspectors has been submitted to the Ankara State Security Court Prosecutor General's Office. The investigation began when the General Directorate of Police received a letter from a student at the Ankara Police Academy, who was in his final year. State of Emergency Governor Unal Erkan was the general director of police at the time. The officials were shocked by the letter, which was submitted to the Police Inspection Council. Placed Under Surveillance The police moved to tap the telephones of several officials and place their activities under surveillance. It was ascertained that several students in the Police Academy and other police training institutions took part in reactionary activities. It was also ascertained that several police officials held secret meetings in their homes, adopted code names, and used coded expressions in their telephone conversations. The police inspectors concluded their investigation after many years. They submitted their report and several documents to the Ankara State Security Court Prosecutor General's Office. Meanwhile, several of the high-ranking officials, whose names appeared in their report, were removed from active duty. [passage omitted] Pressure A police official said some time ago that the activities of reactionary groups in the police organization has created uneasiness. He stressed: "It is common knowledge that a significant amount of reactionary activity exists in the police organization. In fact, the reactionary officials have held influential posts at various times. An urgent solution must be found to resolve that problem. Meanwhile, a serious struggle exists between the reactionary groups. The officials have to be very careful on that matter. The inspectors, who are investigating the problem, are under significant pressure at the present time." It has been claimed that the inspectors have asked for protection on grounds that their safety has been threatened. However, the claim has not been confirmed by the officials.
