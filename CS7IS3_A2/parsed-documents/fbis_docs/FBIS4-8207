"We are very much concerned that maybe we are on a slippery slope in terms of international involvement in this fighting area, and our main effort now will be directed at making sure that this tragic experience of Gorazde is not going to be repeated," Churkin told reporters here after holding a two-hour meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. He said Milosevic had asked him to try "to help find a way out of this situation" which has been rendered more difficult by the Bosnian Serb decision to break all contact with the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Churkin said he believed Russia could play an important role in relaunching the peace process which would be aimed at finding a "firm and lasting cessation of hostilities." He said Russia was not pleased at the "level of communication in this very tense moment," apparently referring to the UN decision to launch the air strikes without consulting with Russia first. "I believe that if Russia was involved in a much closer way in this conflict area, maybe some of the developments may have been prevented," he said. Churkin was to travel to the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale later Monday to meet with military leader Radovan Karadzic. The latter earlier cancelled a meeting with U.S. special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Charles Redman.
