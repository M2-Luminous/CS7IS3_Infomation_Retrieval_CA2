Among the reasons of discontent are the delay in the debate and passing of the railway transportation bill, the persisting economic blockage, and the compensation by the government of railway tariffs. Should their claims be disregarded, Elcatel promised concerted strikes on 15 February, to be then extended to a general strike on 17 February.
