He described as grave the situation which has taken shape there, "although a degree of stabilization is taking place out of the laws of evolution, with no special interference, and maybe even despite interference by federal and local organs of power. People are tired and are themselves seeking peace." Abdulatipov pointed out that in the past, in fulfillment of the president's edict of 13 December 1993, which clearly designated ways out of the crisis, the Russian Government adopted a corresponding decree. Of its 37 points, to date just...one has been fulfilled. Although the deadline was set for March-April of this year. The matter is being held up either at the Ministry of Economics or at the Ministry of Finance. Whether they want it or not, Abdulatipov declared, their sluggishness could lead to new clashes. For example, the planned capital investments in Ingushetia amount to 91 billion rubles [R]. To date, however, Ingushetia has received only R800 million -- just 0.8 percent of the set amount. In Ingushetia 0.8 percent has been spent on housing construction, and 6 percent on other sectors. The construction workers who have rebuilt houses for refugees in North Ossetia have not even received their wages. The most interesting thing, Abdulatipov pointed out, is that money is being allocated in accordance with all the documents. But very insignificant amounts reach the addressees. What question can there be of resettling refugees if houses are not being rebuilt? At the same time dozens of construction companies are looking for work in the North Caucasus. There are approximately 110,000 unemployed people in the region. There is a construction infrastructure. There is no money. Unless decisive measures are taken, the state of emergency zone in the region of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict will become a paradise for political adventurers and criminals.
