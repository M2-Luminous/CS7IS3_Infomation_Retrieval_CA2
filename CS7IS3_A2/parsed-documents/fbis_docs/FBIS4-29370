I would like to inform you of the following news: Following thorough and exhaustive examinations, my very competent Chinese doctors were of the opinion that for me to be completely cured, I must undergo three or four additional sessions of anticancer chemotherary at the end of June, which will require me to stay in the PRC for another three or four months. Although I have to live far away from you, venerable monks and beloved compatriots, all my heart and my thoughts will remain forever close to our revered motherland. Every morning, I make my prayer and pay my deference to the august image of our great guru, begging that full peace will return to all of Cambodia so that my beloved compatriots can once again live in happiness and enjoy prosperity as in the times of Sangkum Reas Niyum before the 18 March 1970 coup d'etat. I wish the two supreme patriarches, all Buddhist monks, and all compatriots the five Buddhist blessings, that is, long life, social prestige, happiness, good health, and enlightment. [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk
