In an announcement by the puppets, the provocative war exercise -- which is being held through a three-dimensional military operation on the ground, air, and sea with an exercise to prepare for action, a biological and radiological warfare exercise, the transfer of military forces and equipment, and the exercise of taking off and landing on an emergency airstrip in the northern area of Kyonggi Province near the Military Demarcation Line, in South Kyongsang Province, and on the West Sea of South Korea -- will continue until 14 May. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is babbling about someone's nonexistent surprise attack and has once again started to play with fire. This once again reveals their bellicose nature of clinging only to the road of confrontation and war. Someone's surprise attack which the puppets are babbling about, is a [word indistinct] of threat to invade the South which has not been carried out before. This is nothing but a sophistry to justify the criminal character of the war exercise which they are carrying out. A very grave situation is being created at this time on the Korean peninsula because of the reckless war commotion by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets. As everyone knows, under the groundless excuse of the so-called development of nuclear weapons, the U.S. imperialists ruptured the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. They indiscriminately made bellicose absurd remarks by saying that they will not decline to carry out a war, and are concentrating aggressive forces into South Korea and its neighboring area on a large scale . The offensive helicopter, the Apache, and the new-type missile, the Patriot, were dragged in by the U.S. imperialists. They are trying to newly deploy military equipment including tanks, howitzers, and a vehicle that can fire successive rockets, into South Korea. Recently, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry flew into South Korea and held secret talks on war, examined preparations for a war, and babbled about resuming the Team Spirit nuclear war exercise. Along with this, the puppet clique made an order to all of the puppet forces to be on 24 hour alert, and are all the more kicking up a war frenzy. As shown by facts, there are only threats of northward invasion on the Korean peninsula. Despite this, the Kim Yong-sam clique is now conducting a joint tactical exercise of the puppet army, navy, and air force. This war exercise is aimed at making every preparation for assuming an adventurous offensive position to invade the North and at aggravating tensions. The Kim Yong-sam group also pursues the hidden purpose to overcome the serious power crisis [simgakhan tongchi wigi] by carrying out this war exercise. As everyone knows, there are loud voices in South Korea protesting the Kim Yong-sam traitorous group that is running toward the road of fascism, nation-selling, confrontation, and war. In particular, with great indignation with the opening of the rice and weapon markets to the U.S. masters, South Korean people, youth, and students hold demonstrations and meetings every day under the slogan "Down With Kim Yong-sam." Youth and students are also intensifying the antiwar and antigovernment struggle with the violent death of student Chang Tok-su who was forced to join a war exercise as a momentum, and the puppets have been driven into a corner. Thus, the Kim Yong-sam group tries to turn people's attention, to overcome the worsened power crisis, and to justify its confrontation and war policy by conducting the large-scale war exercise. This is well proved by the fact that many homeland reserve troops have been mobilized in this war exercise. The war commotion, however, is nothing more than a desperate struggle [majimak parak] by those who have no future. The Kim Yong-sam puppet regime that has been abandoned by the people as it turned its back on the nation cannot last long. The Kim Yong-sam group is trying to seek a breakthrough by stirring up a worthless war commotion. However, the war commotion will rather face greater protest and opposition from the South Korean people and will only result in hastening its ruin.
