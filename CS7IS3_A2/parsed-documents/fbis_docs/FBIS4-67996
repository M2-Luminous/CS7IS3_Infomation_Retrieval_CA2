Hamas is awaiting Israel's decision to release Palestinian prisoners, including Hamas prisoners. Hamas functionaries talk about accepting the Israel-PLO agreement, while its military arm insists on continuing the struggle against the occupation. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports: On the eve of the signature of the agreement with the PLO, and after the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has already withdrawn approximately 90 percent of its forces from the Gaza Strip and redeployed in the Qatif Bloc, the question remains, what will Hamas do? Over the last few months Israel has tried -- via IDF officers -- to open a sort of dialogue with Hamas. Major General Matan Vilna'i, commander of the Southern Command, and Brigadier General Doron Almog, commander of the IDF forces in the Gaza Strip, have held several meetings with some Hamas leaders in the area. The two tried to come to an understanding of Hamas, attempted to soften it, occasionally resorting to threats -- but without much success. Yesterday Hamas disgustedly rejected Foreign Minister Peres' proposal to release Hamas leader Ahmad Yasin in exchange for a call on his people to halt the acts of terrorism against Israel. Sources in the Gaza Strip say that apparently Israel does not realize that Yasin can no longer issue such an order to 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' military arm. They claim that there is a growing rift within Hamas between some of the spiritual leaders and functionaries, and the fighters in the field, after agreement between the PLO and Hamas was signed. This agreement, which calls for cooperation in many areas, was signed by Rashid Abu-Shabak, leader of the Fatah Hawks, and Mahmud al-Zahhar, who is considered to be the leader of 'Izz-al- Din al-Qassam. Sources in Gaza say that since this agreement was signed, differences of opinion have surfaced between the fighters in the field and the organization's spiritual leadership, with the former complaining that Fatah is removing them from work places, such as the busy works which Israel is financing in the territories. Despite all the denials coming from the direction of Fatah, and the calming statements issued by Musa Abu-Marzuq, a Hamas functionary residing in Jordan, it transpires that the limited agreement between the PLO and Hamas will not prevent attacks in Israel and in the territories, excluding the areas of Gaza and Jericho which will be under the PLO's control.
