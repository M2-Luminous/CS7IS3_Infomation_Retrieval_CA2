Mr. Dan Crompton, Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire said yesterday the PLO had asked the Foreign Office to help set up a British-style community police force. The agreement envisages the withdrawal of Israeli forces, leaving a Palestinian police force in its place. Mr. Crompton, with three or four other officers, will train senior officers within that force. He will visit the occupied territories next month with another officer from his force, Acting Chief Supt [superintendent] John Tunney, to meet potential candidates and assess training needs. It is also possible he will visit PLO headquarters in Tunis for further consultations before setting up a course in March. "The Palestinians have asked us for advice on structuring and training," Mr. Crompton said. "They don't want a paramilitary style force. What they want is a move to the community style policing you see in the UK. "They are anxious to show a quantum leap if you like between the sort of occupying force we have seen there up to now and a British-style force. But it is likely to be a rocky road. "There is no common law in existence in the occupied territories." A Foreign Office spokesman said Britain would also be providing equipment for the Palestinian police force as well as helping to train nurses, build schools and give advice in the management of water resources. The Palestinians had also asked for help in setting up a radio station, particularly in the training of journalists, a role expected to be undertaken by the BBC and the Thompson Foundation.
