During the talks, concerning China's moves to strengthen its military power through such measures as the resumption of nuclear testing, Japanese officers said: "There are arguments in Asia that China's moves might threaten the security of other Asian nations. We hope China will boost the transparency in defense matters." However, Chinese counterparts reiterated China's conventional stand, saying: "Nuclear weapons are solely for self-defense. Inflation is the major reason for an increase in defense expenditures." At the end of last year, security talks were held between officials of the foreign ministries of the two nations. This time, uniformed officers held the security dialogue for the first time. They included Toshimasa Fujiwara (major general), chief of the Joint Staff Council's 5th staff officer section, from Japan and Zhan Maohai (major general), deputy director at the NDM's Foreign Affairs Bureau, from China. They exchanged opinions for about five hours.
