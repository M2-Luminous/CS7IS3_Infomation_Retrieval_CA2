Otherwise they might never agree. The statement was made in a Wednesday interview with Interfax by a special envoy of the Russian president, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin. He added that during the contacts of the last six months the differences between the sides deepened rather than shrank. "If this continues, there will be no settlement at all. Therefore purposeful and energetic influence on the conflicting sides is necessary," the diplomat said. He stressed that Moscow expects the Geneva meeting of foreign ministers of Russia, the USA, Britain (permanent members of the UN Security Council), as well as Greece, Germany and Belgium (representing the EU) to work out a common strategy for a Bosnian settlement. According to Churkin, Russia and its Western partners have not yet agreed on their approaches to a settlement. It is the purpose of the ministerial meeting to agree to the maximum on the approaches and a concrete program of action. So far there are only different ideas concerning the way the sides should be influenced, Churkin said. On the possibility of using armed force to pressure the conflicting Bosnian sides Churkin said there has never been such an argument. Any use of force, and this has happened already, is prompted by extraordinary circumstances which in their turn stem from humanitarian reasons, the existence of safe havens and the protection of the UN force in ex-Yugoslavia. Security Council resolutions for ex-Yugoslavia did not provide for the transition to a diplomacy of force. It is out of the question to try to use force to make one of the sides do something for a political settlement. Churkin said that by pressure on the conflicting sides he means the use of solely political means. In his opinion the Geneva meeting can reach agreement and work out a coordinated plan. "Common grounds will be found. The question is how far-reaching these common positions are going to be. Only the ministerial meeting can show that," Churkin said. The diplomat said that Russia's starting point is quite resolute, but he could not promise that the Russian side would manage to persuade all participants to share its views. He foresaw certain difficulties, but hoped that the common approach would be as close as possible to the initial Russian stand. In Churkin's opinion one cannot say that the current situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina favors a political settlement. The situation is quite the opposite. It is not favorable for a political settlement because both the Bosnian Serbs and the Muslims are drawn too much by centrifugal forces aimed in the opposite direction, in the direction of further military confrontation, in particular in the area of Brchko. They believe that a political settlement is impossible in principle. This does not promote the peace process, of course. The diplomat did not rule out the possibility that the Geneva meeting might drag out and end on Saturday morning, not on Friday as it is planned now.
