ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule adopts as final, the Corps regulations contained in 33 CFR 334.905 Pacific Ocean, offshore of Camp Pendleton, California, Fallbrook restricted area, which were published in the Federal Register as an interim final rule on October 15, 1993. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 15, 1993. ADDRESSES: HQUSACE, CECW&hyph;OR, Washington, DC 20314&hyph;1000. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Elizabeth White at (619) 455&hyph;9422 or Mr. Ralph Eppard at (202) 272&hyph;1783. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commanding Officer of the Naval Weapons Station requested the Corps to establish a restricted anchorage area (identified as Fallbrook), offshore of Camp Pendleton, San Diego County, California. In accordance with Naval Sea Systems Command, OPS Volume 1 Manual, Ammunition and Explosives Ashore Safety Regulations for Handling, Storing, Production, Renovation, and Shipping, a safety distance of 9,000 feet to inhabited structures is required for the anticipated net explosive weight of 5,500,000 pounds. During loading/unloading, vessel traffic and anchorage would be restricted to a distance not closer than 5,400 feet from the vessel. The Fallbrook anchorage site has been intermittently utilized in the past and its use needs to be continued in support of replenishment operations associated with the transfer of ordnance from the Fallbrook Annex to and from naval combatants and ammunition ships. The Navy's utilization of this anchorage is expected to grow to a maximum of 10 days per month. This planned long-term utilization for replenishment operations necessitates establishment of the restricted anchorage. The Corps Los Angeles District Engineer issued a public notice on June 2, 1993, which solicited comments on this proposed restricted area to all known interested parties. The District did not receive any objections to the establishment of the restricted anchorage area. There also were no comments received in response to the interim final rule and accordingly, the rule is adopted without change. Economic Assessment and Certification This final rule is issued with respect to a military function of the Defense Department and the provisions of E.O. 12866 do not apply. These rules have been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354), which requires the preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any regulation that will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses (i.e., small businesses and small government) jurisdictions. There is no anticipated navigational hazard or interference with existing waterway traffic. There are no recreational or commercial fishery operations presently in or using the waters within this area because of ongoing military operations. Therefore, no loss of resources or use of resources would be borne by the public. Therefore, it has been determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and that preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis is not warranted. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 334 Danger zones, Navigation (water), Transportation. In consideration of the above, the Corps is amending part 334 of title 33 to read as follows: PART 334_DANGER ZONE AND RESTRICTED AREA REGULATIONS 1.
