According to him, Bosnian Serbs reacted to Muslim acts of provocation in the area of Gorazde "inadequately." "The Serbs made a four-kilometer incursion from the disengagement line, and invaded several villages, whose Muslim population took shelter in the city of Gorazde which is controlled by Muslim units," the diplomat said. As he said, the situation is aggravated by the circumstance that in Gorazde the Muslims are holding about 50 Serb prisoners of war, whom the field commanders of Bosnian Serbs are seeking to free at any cost. On Friday, the official from Russia's Foreign Ministry said, high-ranking representatives of Bosnian Serbs and Muslims are to meet in Sarajevo's airport to discuss the possible ways to reach a settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole, and in Gorazde in particular. According to Interfax's interviewee, the formula that helped to ease tensions in and around another Bosnian city, Srebrenica, could be used in the area of Gorazde. "Stipulated in an agreement reached between Bonian Serbs, Muslims and the command of the U.N. protection forces, the formula provides for withdrawing the armed units of both sides from the line of confrontation, demilitarizing the "buffer" zone and deploying U.N. peace-keeping forces there," he said. This week-end or early next week the special envoy of the Russian president, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, may make a trip to the Balkans, the diplomat said. "We are working in two directions -- Bosnia and Krajina. It's not surprising therefore that the program of his trip includes Zagreb and Belgrade," he added. According to Interfax's interviewee, in Moscow on Wednesday Churkin conferred with one of the leaders of Bosnian Serbs, Momcilo Krajisnik, and discussed with him the situation that had emerged in the wake of the Washington agreements signed to form a Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina,and subsequently establish a confederation between it and Croatia. "The two men discussed the role Bosnian Serbs could play under these agreements. Russia wants the lawful rights of the third nation making up the state of Bosnia- Herzegovina -- Bosnian Serbs -- to be observed," he stressed. Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the Russian president, will fly to Belgrade Sunday, April 10 to meet with Serbia's leaders, Grigoriy Karasin, a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said at a briefing in Moscow Thursday. Karasin added that Churkin would meet with Croatian leaders in Zagreb Monday and the next day would attend talks on the economic issues of the settlement that would be held in the Russian embassy to Croatia. Karasin did not rule out the possibility that Churkin would also visit Sarajevo.
