FR940111-0-00084 FR940111-0-00019 Many funeral providers, however, erroneously believe that the GPL must be given immediately upon initiation of preliminary arrangements discussions that do not involve price or specific goods or services. That misinterpretation leads them to offer the GPL at arguably inappropriate times, such as during preliminary discussions of death certificates or veterans benefits, or, in the case of an out-of-town death, the location of the deceased. 145 145 See R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR) at 151&hyph;153. To remedy their concerns, provider groups proposed repeal of the GPL timing and distribution requirements, or, in the alternative, amendments that would require providers to: (1) ``Make available'' to consumers a GPL; (2) Offer the GPL to consumers who inquire only about prices; (3) Offer the GPL to consumers before ``specific'' funeral goods or funeral services are ``selected'' or prices discussed; and (4) Give a GPL for retention only to those consumers who request to keep it. 146 146 R&hyph;G&hyph;3 (NSM) at 43; R&hyph;G&hyph;6 (NFDA) at 66; R&hyph;M&hyph;9 (NFDA/NSM) at 277. The Commission has determined, however, that the preponderance of the evidence does not warrant the sweeping amendments to, or repeal of, ยง453.2(b)(4)(i) as proposed by funeral provider groups. The Commission draws that conclusion particularly in light of the empirical evidence on the level of providers' compliance with the current GPL requirements (23% give the GPL at the outset of arrangements discussions), and the evidence that consumers want price and options information about funeral goods and services and value price information that they receive early in the funeral transaction. The Commission is persuaded by that compliance evidence, however, that some fine-tuning is necessary to clarify the Rule and promote increased compliance, thereby enhancing the Rule's opportunity to provide benefits to consumers. The amendment discussed below thus is intended to remove any ambiguities and unnecessary rigidity in ยง453.2(b)(4)(i) that appear to cause funeral directors to misinterpret their obligations under that provision. Provider group proposals would have unacceptably narrowed the circumstances in which providers would be required to provide a GPL to consumers. First, the suggestion that providers ``make available'' a GPL might have been tantamount to effective repeal of the entire GPL requirement if such language means something other than physically giving the GPL to consumers. 147 Consumers might receive no GPL disclosures about funeral service prices or options, or concerning their rights in the funeral transaction under the Rule or other laws, unless they asked to see the GPL and providers voluntarily complied with their request. Such a change is not warranted, given record evidence on relatively low, overall levels of Rule compliance. Other evidence_that consumers are reluctant to raise price issues after the death of a loved one, that consumers, nonetheless, desire price and service options information, and that consumers benefit from price information they receive early in the funeral transaction_also supports this conclusion. 147 The proponents of this change did not specifically explain or define the term ``make available,'' or how this and other suggested amendments would change the current requirements of ยง453.2(b)(4)(i). Second, the NFDA suggestion that providers need only give a GPL to persons who inquire in person about the ``price'' of funeral goods or services would eliminate the obligation to give a GPL to those who ask about prices or ``funeral arrangements.'' In light of the evidence just mentioned, this proposed narrowing of the GPL distribution requirement is not supported by the record. Although one of the Rule's goals is to increase price competition, and, in turn, reduce overall consumer expenditures, the Commission also intended the provision of itemized price information to alert consumers to their various options and to permit them to select only those items they desire, whether or not expenses would be reduced as a result. 148 Lacking record evidence to support a change, consumers who inquire about providers' offerings, and not their prices, should thus be entitled to receive a GPL. 148 R&hyph;B&hyph;5 at 42297. Virtually every funeral director who advocated a change in the GPL timing requirements expressed concern about when in the arrangements discussions might be the sensitively correct time to discuss ``price'' with consumers. None spoke of the correct time to provide or discuss information about funeral service ``options'' and their relative cost. The record evidence, however, suggested that because price issues may not specifically arise early in the transaction, due to mutual provider and consumer reluctance, consumers may choose particular types of arrangements, or specific items, without the benefit of information about the available alternatives unless they receive a timely GPL. Third, the NFDA proposal that providers make the GPL available at the funeral arrangements conference before ``specific'' funeral goods and services are selected or prices discussed would remove the requirement that providers give the list at the beginning of arrangements discussions, wherever they take place. Record evidence shows that consumers benefit from price and service options information, including the GPL, that they receive early in selecting funeral goods and services, and that at least some funeral arrangements, short of a formal ``arrangements conference,'' often can and do occur away from the funeral home premises. 149 Other evidence discussed earlier demonstrated that consumers' knowledge generally about the funeral transaction, although somewhat improved, is still relatively low. As a result of adopting the NFDA suggestion, consumers' opinions about the overall type of funeral service or individual items could thus be formed, or actual selections made, without the benefit of the GPL disclosures concerning prices, options and consumer rights under the Rule. In that event, the preponderance of the record evidence supports the conclusion that the GPL's purpose to provide ready price and service options information for consultation while consumers are considering what goods to purchase, before they make selections, would be unnecessarily defeated. 149 See, e.g., Hennessy, funeral director, Tr. Vol. II, 1026&hyph;1027 (timing of visitation and service often likely to be among first topics of concern to a family during removal); Hunter, Tx. Funeral Service Comm'n, Tr. Vol. III, 602&hyph;603 (discussing funeral arrangements away from the funeral home is a very common practice); Johnson, NSM, Tr. Vol. I, 744 (conversations away from the funeral home border on making funeral arrangements); Simms, NFDA, Tr. Vol. II, 452, 470&hyph;471, 473 (various arrangements discussions during removal have occurred); Hocker, NFDA, Tr. Vol. III, 1402, 1479 (problem during removal when the family says something like ``can we have the funeral on Wednesday'' that triggers presentation of the GPL); Dr. Nelson, AARP, Tr. Vol. I, 91 (preliminary arrangements can occur in consumers' homes where their concept of the funeral may be discussed and formed); and Klein, NYSFDAB, Tr. Vol. II, 1067 (not all arrangements are made in the funeral home). Empirical evidence from the Replication Study on that issue indicated that 14% of consumers said that in-person arrangements discussions took place at a hospital or nursing home, or at the home of the respondent, the deceased, or a relative. See R&hyph;B&hyph;2 at Table III&hyph;24, p. III&hyph;33. The extent to which some of those respondents may also have participated in discussions at the funeral home is not clear from the data.
