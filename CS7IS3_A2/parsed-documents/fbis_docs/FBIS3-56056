Of course, I am sorry that this visit is brief, however, I hope that the U.S. President will visit Ukraine on a full-scale basis, appropriately, and we shall be able to show him Ukraine as it is. I invite you, Mr. President, to visit Ukraine whenever this is most convenient for you. This was a short visit which had lasted only several hours but, in my opinion, it was worth several-day long negotiations because those problems which we discussed and what has just been mentioned by Mr. President are really worth the world's interest in what we agreed on and in the documents which we are to sign in Moscow. I believe that the most important issue for Ukraine, for Europe, and for the entire world is the nuclear issue. We have approached its solution in concrete terms. I am convinced that this day and the coming days open the way before the world for disarmament and nuclear armaments elimination. Ukraine will fulfill its obligations, Ukraine will not be in the way of nuclear disarmament. Naturally, the major part of our consultations was devoted to discussing various aspects of Ukrainian-American relations. I am pleased to note that the American side, the U.S. President, support our state's sovereignty and independence in the difficult time of our formation as a nation. I believe that such assistance is a specific form of partnership for the sake of developing democracy in Ukraine, for the sake of democratic processes on the territory of the former Soviet Union. I am convinced that the charter of partnership, friendship, and cooperation whose text is being worked up by our experts and is near completion, will become a very important stage in the development of our mutual relations. Very important for us is the understanding on the part of U.S. President of the problems facing the economy and the problems of the economic reform and support of the economic reform in Ukraine. I am satisfied with the fact that the U.S. President will support our state at the international financial structures, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. We are aware of the fact that resoluteness and responsibility for the implementation of the economic reform are required, and we are ready for this. We are also satisfied with the fact that trade relations between our countries are developing today and that new prospects for their development will open up. We support the U.S. initiative concerning its formula called Partnership for Peace. We believe that this is a universal formula involving all states and providing them with an opportunity to participate. We understand that this program cannot solve all the security problems, but it provides an opportunity for all the states to take an active part in the program. I would like to welcome, once again, the President of the United States of America to Ukraine and express satisfaction with the fact that we reached relevant understanding and common points of view on all the issues which we discussed. Although brief, today's meeting was very important and productive. It opened up a qualitatively new page in Ukrainian-American relations which from now on, I am sure, will have a stable and reliable future. I thank everybody for their attention.
