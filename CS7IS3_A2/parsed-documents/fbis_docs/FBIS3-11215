This time he supplied evidence to the government that Colombian guerrillas and a bishop attended a secret summit in Cuba in January, which EL TIEMPO newspaper has been reporting. The prosecutor general today reported that part of the Guerrilla Coordinating Board leadership met in Havana, Cuba, with a Colombian bishop. Although he did not give any names to avoid violating legal proceedings, it was learned that over the past few hours the prosecutor visited President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo and Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin. He delivered a document and informed them about the status of the investigations into a trip to Cuba by guerrilla leaders Alfonso Cano [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC, general staff], Ivan Marquez [FARC], Alberto Gutierrez Bermudez, and Lionel Pardo. [Begin recording] [De Greiff] We have evidence that shows that guerrilla leaders or subversives, whatever you want to call them, went to Cuba. [Ayala] Was Monsignor Nel Beltran also there? [De Greiff] A bishop was there; I cannot say who. [end recording] The Colombian Episcopal Conference insists that Bishop Nel Beltran was not the one in Cuba. However, intelligence organizations report that the priest traveled to San Jose, Costa Rica, to attend a religious summit, rested 15 days in the United States afterwards, and on his way back returned via Cancun, Mexico, from where he traveled to Havana to attend the meeting which EL TIEMPO newspaper has reported.
