FR940323-2-00064 FR940323-2-00048 [FRL&hyph;4853&hyph;9] The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; Adequacy Determination of State Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of Tentative Determination on Application of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for Full Program Adequacy Determination, Public Hearing and Public Comment Period. SUMMARY: Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA Section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribe Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribe permit programs provide for interaction between State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed Puerto Rico's MSWLF application and certain revisions thereto, and made a tentative determination that all portions of Puerto Rico's MSWLF permit program are adequate to assure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. Puerto Rico's application for program adequacy determination and its revisions are available for public review and comment. Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a hearing on any determination to approve a State/Tribe's MSWLF program, the Region has scheduled four public hearings on this tentative determination. Details appear below in the DATES section. DATES: All comments on Puerto Rico's application for a determination of adequacy must be received by the close of business on May 12, 1994. Two public hearings will be held at the Solid Waste Management Authority in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico on May 11, 1994. The first hearing will begin at 1 p.m. and the second hearing will begin at 7 p.m. Two additional hearings will be held at the Mayagüez City Hall in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico on May 12, 1994. The first hearing in Mayagüez will begin at 1 p.m. and the second hearing will begin at 7 p.m. Puerto Rico will participate in the public hearings held by EPA on this subject. ADDRESSES: Copies of Puerto Rico's application for adequacy are available between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. at the following two addresses for inspection and copying: U.S. EPA Region II Library, 26 Federal Plaza, room 402, New York, New York, 10278, telephone (212) 264&hyph;2881, and U.S. EPA Caribbean Field Office, 1413 Fernandez Juncos Avenue, Office 2A, Santurce, Puerto Rico, 00909, telephone (809) 729&hyph;6922 extension 222.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine that State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs are adequate to comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate.
