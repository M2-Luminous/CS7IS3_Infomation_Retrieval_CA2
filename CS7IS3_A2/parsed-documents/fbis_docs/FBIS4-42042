Mr. Zuhurov, representatives of the opposition groups have stated that simultaneously with a ceasefire a nationwide amnesty ought to be declared. However, the representatives of the state of Tajikistan were against this proposal. What was the reason for this opposition? [Zuhurov, heard briefly speaking in Tajik, fading into Persian translation] The reason for this is as follows: We fully agree with this condition. However, we said that we need time so that we can return to our country and approach the related bodies to look into the cases of those against whom criminal proceedings have been issued and to release them from prison over a period of time. A document must be formulated and a law must be adopted for this. This will require five to 10 days, or two to three weeks.
