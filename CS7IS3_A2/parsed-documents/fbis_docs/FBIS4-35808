The relief column was carrying 1,500 tonnes of food, destined for distribution in areas affected by the war. Dr. al-Aghbash condemned this attack, which constitutes a violation of agreements pertaining to the transportation of relief supplies, which guarantees safety for relief convoys, as signed by the government and the rebels under the auspices of the United Nations and the Intergovernmental Agency on Drought and Development [IGADD] states. The United Nations, which supervises Operation Lifeline's activities in providing relief to the south, has presented a formal protest to the rebel movement in Nairobi regarding this attack, considering it to be a violation of the agreements on relief. It may be recalled that the last agreement in this regard was signed on 17 May under the auspices of the IGADD committee, under which the number of relief areas was increased from 21 to 84.
