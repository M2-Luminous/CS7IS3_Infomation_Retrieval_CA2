Ye. Trofimov; UDC 517] [Abstract] Integrals of function f(x[.sub]1[/],...x[.sub]n[/] along straight lines are called beam data. If n=2, the beam date correspond with the Radon transform ; this case is characteristic for classical computer X- ray tomography. Methods of 3-D (n=3) or even 4-D (n=4), the fourth coordinate can be time or wavelength with the tomography in the optical range. Reconstruction of function f(x) from its beam data is the 3-D reconstruction problem. This problem is meaningful for any type of tomography. Equations are provided for computing the Fourier transformation of uniform, generalized functions in a three-dimensional space. These formulae allow to construct effective numerical algorithms of tomographic 3-D reconstruction from the beam data. References 10 Russian.
