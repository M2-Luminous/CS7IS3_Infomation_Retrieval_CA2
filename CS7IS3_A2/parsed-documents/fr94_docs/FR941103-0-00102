FR941103-0-00102 FR941103-0-00016 The requirement contained in current paragraph (c) only specifies extreme dynamic loadings. A cargo tank designer must determine which loadings, if any, should be considered as acting simultaneously. TTMA stated it is unlikely that extreme dynamic loadings will occur and highly unlikely that such loadings will occur at the same time. TTMA reported that if the extreme dynamic loadings are considered by the cargo tank designer as acting simultaneously, the resulting weight of a DOT 406 cargo tank would increase significantly. TTMA went on to state that such an increase in tank weight would have an adverse effect on public safety because it would cause a decrease in the number of gallons delivered each trip, increasing the number of trips and miles driven, thus increasing the probability of more accidents, personal injuries and fatalities. During discussions on structural integrity issues at the February 1994 public meeting, the potential for changes in loading due to liquid movement was addressed. Commenters generally agreed that while significant lading movement can occur during partially loaded conditions and that such movement cannot be disregarded by cargo tank designers and vehicle operators, the variables involved are more than can be comprehensively dealt with at this time. The general agreement was that the highest stress conditions on most cargo tank configurations occur when the cargo tanks are full. Discussions on how to combine the loadings in calculating the structural integrity requirements have been going on for a number of years. RSPA agrees with commenters that the loadings currently in the HMR are based on extreme conditions that would be realized only on a rare occasion, if ever. Thus, based on recent information presented at the public meetings and written comments received in response to the NPRM, RSPA concludes that, for the design and construction of cargo tanks, it is best to consider separately the effects of normal operating loadings, which are known to act in combination, and the effects of extreme dynamic loadings, which are not expected to act in combination with each other. Therefore, in this final rule, RSPA is revising paragraph (c) to provide structural design requirements that will be more reflective of conditions encountered by cargo tank motor vehicles. These revisions will require cargo tank designers to consider normal operating loadings to be acting simultaneously, except that longitudinal acceleration and deceleration cannot occur at the same time. Also, extreme dynamic loadings must be considered in separate calculations; these loadings may be considered to be acting independently. Paragraph (d) prescribes design calculations that should be considered to account for stresses due to impact in an accident. For consistency, the accident damage requirements contained in current paragraph (d) are moved to ยง178.345&hyph;8(e) where other accident damage protection requirements appear. Also, consistent with other changes made to this section, paragraphs (a) (1) and (3) are amended by removing the reference to paragraph (d) of this section. Paragraph (e) is editorially revised, for clarity and consistency, by changing the word ``wall'' to read ``shell and heads'', and paragraphs (e) through (g) are redesignated as paragraphs (d) through (f). Section 178.345&hyph;5 Commenters supported the proposed change in paragraph (b) that all fittings and devices mounted on a manhole cover must withstand the same static internal fluid pressure as that required for the manhole. However, commenters requested a revision to clarify that fitting and device manufacturers are responsible for testing and certifying the structural integrity of their products. RSPA agrees with the commenters that the fitting and device manufacturers should be responsible for ensuring the integrity of their components. Therefore, the proposed provision is revised for clarity and added as new paragraph (f). Another commenter suggested that paragraph (e) be revised to require that each manhole cover must be marked with the date of certification. RSPA will consider this comment in a future rulemaking action. Section 178.345&hyph;6 A minor editorial change is adopted as proposed in the NPRM. Section 178.345&hyph;8 Commenters recommended several changes to the accident damage protection requirements. They requested that all accident damage protection devices be designed so that calculated stress under the conditions prescribed not exceed the ultimate strength of the material of construction. They pointed out certain inconsistencies in the design criteria specified in this section. For example, in paragraph (d), the design stress for accidents involving longitudinal deceleration is based on ``the lesser of the yield strength or 75 percent of the ultimate strength''; the general requirement for accident damage protection in paragraph (a)(3), is based on ``75 percent of the ultimate strength''; while bottom damage and rollover damage protection, in paragraphs (b) and (c), both are based on the ``ultimate strength.'' RSPA agrees there is merit in using the same criteria whenever possible. Therefore, in this final rule, the design of all accident damage protection devices is based on the ultimate strength of the material of construction.
