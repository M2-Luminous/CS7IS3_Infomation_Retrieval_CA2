Several local and international organizations have expressed willingness to mediate in the issue. Even the two parties involved in the conflict have expressed their inclination for peace. Nevertheless, what are the factors that hinder these peace efforts from making any headway? Today, it is clear that the primary reason for this is lack of a clear-cut policy with the government in adopting suitable measures to resolve the ethnic conflict. The ideas expressed by the president in general meetings on the ethnic conflict are totally contrary to those of the prime minister. Apart from this, the views expressed by the ministers also differ.in Three points stated by President D.B. Wijetunge recently on the minorities issue have drawn our attention. He says: There is nothing like ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka, but it is only the menace of terrorism that exists in the country. Only the majority community people should rule the country forever and the minority should depend on them. There is no traditional territory for Tamils in Sri Lanka. The president's views on the ethnic conflict have been reflected in these statements. At the same time, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe has adopted a different approach to the ethnic conflict. He projects himself as a person who believes in negotiations to find a solution to the conflict. It is ludicrous to note that his invitations to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam [LTTE] for talks carry different conditions on different occasions. Thus, besides differing from the views of the president, he contradicts his own statements. Third, ministers have been expressing their own views, either in favor of or against those of the president and the prime minister. The official position of the government should be a combination of all these views, but one can come across only contradictions here. In other words, their views indicate that the government does not have any specific or authenticated stand on the ethnic issue. While taking steps to resolve the ethnic conflict, it is imperative to form a specific and coordinated view, at least at the ministerial level. When the government does not have a specific and unified stand on the ethnic conflict, the Sinhalese politicians are offering various kinds of false propaganda on the minorities issue. This further aggravates the situation in resolving the issue. As the Sinhalese are given a wrong impression about the Tamils and their demands, it amplifies the feeling of animosity and creates a situation which makes it difficult to find a solution. Given this situation, the government resorts to military action to suppress the legitimate aspirations of the minorities. All the military actions taken by the government in the past one and a half decades have ended in farce, only leading to the destruction of the property of the government and the people. However, these military actions could not destroy the legitimate aspirations of the people. Today's events indicate that these aspirations cannot be wiped out by mere military operations. The Tamil community in the north has adapted itself to live amid any kind of threat. Normal activities are being carried out there despite heavy bombardment and shelling. People are used to living amid major economic embargo and transport barriers. In Kilaly, boat service is continuing despite air and missile attacks. All these things indicate that the Tamils are not going to submit to any kind of military pressure. At the same time, the perpetual military pressure and the conflict have brought major changes to the social fabric of the Northern Tamils. Once Mahatma Gandhi said: The day when a woman is able to walk all alone in the streets at midnight can be regarded as the day of absolute freedom. A volunteer from a service organization who visited Jaffna recently has said that such a situation exists only in Jaffna. He has also pointed out that the crisis situation which existed before 1985 or from 1987-90 has changed, and that a peaceful atmosphere prevails there now. All these things indicate that the struggle of the Tamil people has reached a stage where it is impossible to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the people with inconsistent solutions. At the same time, this issue has gained international recognition. Human rights and refugee welfare organizations have also started showing interest in this issue. The government will have to face an embarrassing situation in dealing with the pressures being exerted by them. Because, the norms like fundamental rights, human rights, and the right to self-determination have gained international acclaim. Acknowledging these norms will be quite unpleasant for the Sri Lankan Government. Therefore, the government would prefer to resolve the issue at home itself rather than taking it to the international level. Today, everyone understands the need for holding talks with the LTTE to resolve the issue. The LTTE theoretician Anton Balasingham has already stated that the organization is ready for unconditional talks with the government. Although the government side speaks of holding talks, this is only lip service. Ranil Wickremasinghe, who outlined various preconditions on different occasions, says that the response should come from Prabhakaran himself and that he should also participate in the talks. Anton Balasingham and Karikalan would not have given their personal views to the journalists and representatives of peace missions who visited Jaffna. They would not have said anything without the permission of Prabhakaran. Therefore, the condition insisting on Prabhakaran's direct participation does not seem to mean anything. Asking a guerrilla organization to lay down its arms first and then come to the negotiating table is unprecedented. Past experiences also will not help create such a situation. For instance, even during the presence of the Indian peacekeeping force, the government started installing Sinhalase settlements in violation of the accord and delayed the establishment of interim government [as published]. Therefore, all Tamils feel that it will be suicidal to lay down arms while trusting the government, which is in the clutches of the Sinhalese racists. Hence, the process of talks cannot be initiated all of a sudden. It can be initiated gradually and stage by stage. To achieve this, good diplomatic skill and political will to solve the problem is imperative. Those who possessed diplomatic skill and political will were only able to resolve major global issues. But, as far as Sri Lanka is concerned, is there anyone with such qualities? First of all, the government should admit that there is ethnic conflict in the country. Second, the government should realize that this conflict needs a solution and that it should take appropriate steps to achieve this. Mere invitations for talks will not be the right initiative to find a solution. In the past, the government succeeded in hoodwinking Tamil leaders by holding several negotiations with them. Perhaps the reason for the government's hesitation to hold negotiations now may be that it cannot dupe the Tamil leadership any more.
