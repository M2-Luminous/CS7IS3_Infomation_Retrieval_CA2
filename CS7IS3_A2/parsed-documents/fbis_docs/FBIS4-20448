The drug distribution dynamics in mice of both praziquantel (PZQ) and praziquantel liposome (PZQ-Lip) were determined using RP-HPLC method. The results indicated that the drug concentration of blood, liver and spleen in the PZQ-Lip group was higher than those in the PZQ group from 1/2 to 16 hours post ip. the t 1/2 of the former was considerably prolonged. The toxicity of PZQ-Lip tested by LD[.sub]50[/] was decreased about one fourth as compared with PZQ (3372 vs. 2454 mg/kg). There was a significant difference in the cyst inhibition rate between PZQ-Lip group (68.7 percent) and PZQ group (14.3 percent) (P < 0.01) as shown by the results of secondary alveococcosis mice treated with either drug at 500 mg/kg-d x 12 d for four consecutive courses. Histological observation of the germinal layer after treatment showed that the damage of PZQ-Lip group was more severe than that of PZQ group. The ultrastructural observation showed that both drugs had marked effects on the organelles of cells. The above experiments indicated that the efficacy of PZQ-Lip was more effective than PZQ for treatment of alveococcosis.
