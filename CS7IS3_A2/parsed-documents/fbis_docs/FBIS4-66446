(Toagosei), Kanegafuchi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Kanegafuchi), and Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, Inc. (Mitsui Toatsu) -- will embark on a joint project for developing a new, energy-saving electrolysis technology that is expected to reduce electric power costs to nearly 40 percent below the existing ion-exchange membrane electrolysis. The group plans to spend six years starting in FY93 and approximately ¥500 million in the context of the efficient energy utilization development technology-implementation subsidy system of MITI. Medium-sized electrolyzers will be installed in Toagosei's Nagoya Plant and Kanegafuchi's Takasago Plant for the project. This technology originated from the basic study by Professor Keiichi Furuya, of Yamanashi University, and was further developed with the assistance of the Japan Soda Industry Association. Essentially, the project appears to be a cooperative project for all soda makers in Japan. Japan produces approximately 3.84 million tons per year (FY92) of sodium hydroxide. About 90 percent of this quantity is produced by the ion exchange membrane method, which had saved considerably more energy than the previous diaphragm process. However, the soda industry is still among the industries notorious for their energy-consumption. The industry has been waiting for a new energy-saving electrolysis technology to be developed. The process originally developed by Professor Furuya lowers voltage to eliminate the cause for the deterioration of energy efficiency by preventing the generation of hydrogen, a by-product of the electrolysis. Hydrogen is formed at the anode, and the prevention was achieved by using a new gas-diffusion electrode. There will still be problems with the process if it is industrialized, including the life of this electrode. Therefore, with a subsidy from MITI, the above-mentioned three companies will embark on the six-year project starting in FY93, with a budget of ¥479 million to solve the problems of the new technology for industrialization. The three companies recently submitted to MITI a formal application for the subsidy and are scheduled to begin research in December 1993. Small electrolyzers will be installed at Toagosei's Nagoya Plant and Kanegafuchi's Takasago Plant to study the electrode's performances, confirm its life, evaluate its structure and materials, evaluate the materials for the construction of the electrolyzer, and modify or improve them as much as possible. Based on the results of the studies, the group will design a 1.2-m-tall, medium-sized electrolyzer and will optimize the production method for the gas-diffusion electrode. Engineering data will be gathered with the medium-sized electrolyzer for the industrialization of the technology. According to MITI, in FY92, Japan's soda industry consumed 9,780 megakilowatt-hours of electric power. When the new electrolysis technology is developed, the power consumption is expected to be reduced by approximately 36 percent. Furthermore, this gas-diffusion electrode is said to be broadly applicable in the electrochemical industry, including for high-performance cells such as fuel cells and for electroplating processes.
