Quadrilateral Talks Loom Ahead"] [Text] A Georgian-Ossetian meeting (including both South Ossetia and North Ossetia) devoted to the problems of refugees and those subjected to forcible resettlement has been held in Vladikavkaz at the initiative of the CSCE mission. The meeting was attended by Aleksandr Tsvetkov, chief of the CSCE mission (Ukraine); Vazha Khachapuridze, plenipotentiary representative of the Georgian head of state; Znaur Gassiyev, first deputy chairman of the South Ossetia Supreme Soviet; and Yuriy Sedakov, chairman of the North Ossetia parliamentary committee for national policy and foreign affairs. The sides concluded that the return of refugees has been complicated by the absence of a political settlement to the Ossetian-Georgian conflict, and agreed on the need immediately to set up expert groups to prepare quadrilateral talks between Georgia, South and North Ossetia, and Russia. One of the most complex matters in the upcoming talks will be the state and legal status of South Ossetia. By the time the negotiations begin, a protocol of intentions will be signed, modeled on the Dagomys agreement on South Ossetia, and a range of matters to be discussed will be determined. North Ossetia took an active part in the preparation of the current meeting because, according to Yuriy Sedakov, the practice where hostilities have ended, but talks have not yet started, may lead to yet another round of tensions. The second contentious matter -- the status of peacekeeping forces -- has also yet to be resolved. It is known that members of the CSCE mission question the legality of the current trilateral status of these forces because they include former combatants. However, Vakhtang Rcheulishvili, deputy speaker of the Georgian parliament, thinks otherwise: he is even ready to admit that the Tskhinvali procedure for deploying peacekeeping forces may be repeated in Abkhazia. He said: "Similar problems -- separatism and status -- require similar solutions. But they cannot be absolutely identical. The same problems will be discussed in both Georgian- Abkhazian and Georgian-Ossetian negotiations, the only difference being our approach -- we oppose the internationalization of the Ossetian problem and raising it to the level of the CSCE or the United Nations. Russia will be the sole mediator in the settlement of this problem."
