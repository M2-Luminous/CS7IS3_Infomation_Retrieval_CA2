Replying to a question during his weekly news conference, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ataman said that the citizens who went to northern Iraq in this way should see that they were tricked. A terrorist organization can promise nothing but blood and tears, he stressed, adding: Consequently, if they decide to return to their country, we will naturally open our arms to these citizens. There is no doubt that our state will do whatever it can to resettle these people and ensure their welfare.
