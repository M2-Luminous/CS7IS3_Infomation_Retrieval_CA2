This is a good start toward fulfilling this year's economic forecast, which set unemployment reduction as its priority. However, it must be noted that even in January the number of unemployed rose in 15 communities, particularly in Gornja Radgona and Murska Sobota, while in Maribor, which has a disproportionately high unemployment rate, only 14 people found jobs. At the end of January 135,323 unemployed were registered at the Republic Employment Office; 1.3 percent, or 1,819, fewer than at the end of 1993. To compare: in December alone the number of unemployed increased by 1,091. However, compared to January 1993, the number of unemployed increased 12.7 percent, or 15,261. [passage omitted]
