Of the 3,618 large families in Komsomolsk-na-Amur, 3,115 are in need of immediate material assistance. More than 130 enterprises in the kray are standing idle and their workers have been forced to take unpaid leave. At the same time wages have been held back since September on the majority of sovkhozes in the Amur region, and bread is distributed on credit in the rural consumers' cooperative stores, according to lists.... These facts, heard at the annual meeting of deputy administration chiefs of cities and rayons of Khabarovsk Kray and leaders of departments and committees for social protection, illustrate better than anything else the condition of despair that now prevails in the remote areas of Russia. Speaking before participants in the conference, the chairman of the kray Committee for Social Protection of the Population, Nikolay Telyatnikov, noted: "We have taken on a heavy burden with empty pockets." Today, in his words, it is easier to name those whose existence can be defined as more or less bearable because added to the traditional categories of underprivileged--pensioners, disabled persons, the chronically ill, workers of the budget sphere--in recent months have been those who are officially registered and actually unemployed, single mothers, especially those living in dormitories and receiving wages that are less than what is needed to pay for housing, and also school graduates who have been left without work. The only reason social upheaval has not occurred so far, thinks the deputy chief of the administration of Bikinskiy Rayon, Raisa Kabanchenko, is that the people of the Far East are too patient. But very soon, in her opinion, the explosion will have to occur both in "the defense sector" and in rural areas as well as other places. It is no accident that the kray's governor, Viktor Ishayev, in order to provide at least some emergency payments to the needy, a couple of days ago issued a directive to stop payment instructions for a total of 7 billion rubles [R] earmarked for the Pension Fund of Russia, which had been filled out by the Khabarovsk division. The first deputy minister of social protection of the Russian Federation, Boris Dudenkov, participating in the meeting and evaluating such actions on the part of the administration as "local hooliganism" which could lead to the "collapse of Russia," admitted, however, that attempts to get into the pension fund are being made not only in the krays and oblasts but also at the very highest level. In particular, the Ministry of the Economy is now actively working out plans to use this money for financing the miners. Those who have survived the social and economic wilderness have no hope yet. According to Dudenkov's information, the Ministry of Finance has not yet transferred to the Republic Fund for Social Support of the Population R28 billion withheld since 1992. True, thinks one of the leaders of the social ministry itself, there must be a different approach to forming these funds: Not through direct taxes but with excise taxes on luxury items and some of the funds received from privatization. And while the ministry staff is building castles in the air and thinking about how to take some money from the rich in order to help the most deprived, the Khabarovsk Kray authorities are hoping for financial support from the capital. As the deputy governor, Irina Strelkova, put it, "It would be wrong to ask for a lot but we have indicated the main sore spots in the package of documents prepared for the government." This has to do with the so-called targeted allotment of funds for a sum of about R10 billion. Above all for conducting child summer health protection measures and completing the reconstruction of a specialized boarding house for people suffering from chronic psychological illnesses.
