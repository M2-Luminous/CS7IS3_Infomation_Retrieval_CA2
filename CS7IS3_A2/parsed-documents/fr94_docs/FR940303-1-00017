FR940303-1-00017 FR940303-1-00003 This paragraph provides that the proposed regulations are not intended and will not create any substantive rights for any person other than an attorney for the government. In particular, a violation of the rule will not provide a basis for the dismissal of civil or criminal charges or for the suppression of evidence that is otherwise admissible. This provision accords with existing law. Traditionally, matters relating to communications with represented persons have been treated as matters of attorney discipline without granting substantive rights to defendants or any other persons. See, e.g., ABA Code of Professional Responsibility, Preliminary Statement; ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Scope. Of course, when the communication with a represented person or represented party violates the Constitution, the federal courts retain the power to fashion appropriate remedies. Section 77.12: Relationship to State and Local Regulation Both DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 provide that communications that are ``authorized by law'' are not prohibited by the rule. Virtually all the states have adopted some version of DR 7&hyph;104 or Model Rule 4.2 that includes an ``authorized by law'' exception. These proposed rules, as substantive regulations duly promulgated by the Attorney General pursuant to statutory authority, have the force and effect of law. See e.g. Batterton v. Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 425 n.9 (1977). Accordingly, communications with represented persons that are undertaken pursuant to these rules should be considered ``authorized by law'' within the meaning of rules adopted by the various states. Such communications will therefore be consistent with state rules wherever state bar authorities have adopted a rule containing the ``authorized by law'' exception. Furthermore, no conflict will arise between state and federal law in those jurisdictions with regard to communications with represented persons. In those states that do not currently include an ``authorized by law'' exception or repeal current provisions, the proposed rule may conflict with their provisions governing communications with represented parties. The second sentence of this section provides that in those cases the proposed regulations will preempt the application of conflicting state and local rules as they relate to contacts by Department of Justice attorneys. The longstanding position of the Department is that the Supremacy Clause bars ``any attempt by a state bar association to impose sanctions on a government attorney who is acting lawfully and in pursuance of his federal law enforcement responsibilities.'' See Ethical Restraints of the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility on Federal Criminal Investigations, 4B Op. O.L.C. 576, 601&hyph;02 (1980). It is clear that a Department regulation published after notice and comment constitutes ``federal law.'' See, e.g., Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 295 (1979) (``It has been established in a variety of contexts that properly promulgated, substantive agency regulations have the 'force and effect of law'''). It is also clear that a properly promulgated Department rule is binding upon state authorities and supersedes contrary provisions of state law. The Supreme Court has recognized that ``[f]ederal regulations have no less pre-emptive effect than federal statutes.'' Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. De La Cuesta, 458 U.S. 141, 153 (1982). Accord, e.g., City of New York v. FCC, 486 U.S. 57, 63 (1988) (``[t]he phrase `Laws of the United States' [in the Supremacy Clause] encompasses both federal statutes themselves and federal regulations that are properly adopted in accordance with statutory authorization''); Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U.S. 691, 698&hyph;700 (1984). Accordingly, to the extent the proposed regulations conflict with state law, the regulations preempt the conflicting state law. This section does, however, provide an important exception. If the Attorney General finds that a Department attorney has willfully violated these regulations, preemption will not apply. As a result, a government attorney who willfully engages in communications that violate these rules will be subject to disciplinary proceedings both by the Department and by the appropriate state disciplinary authorities. IV. United States Attorneys' Manual In addition to the promulgation of the proposed regulations discussed above, the Department proposes to add several new provisions to the United States Attorneys' Manual to provide additional guidance to Department attorneys when dealing with individuals or entities represented by counsel during criminal or civil law enforcement investigations and proceedings. Those provisions are set forth in full below as part of this commentary. The decision to include some restrictions in the Manual while other restrictions are contained in the rule was an important one. In the process of determining what the appropriate Departmental policy should be, it became clear that any regulation would have to apply to a variety of circumstances, including: White collar and organized crime investigations, complex conspiracy investigations, individuals whose counsel are paid by a third party, and individuals fearful of their counsel for various reasons. Accordingly, the Department determined that the regulations should be broad in scope and should provide unambiguous guidance that would not adversely affect federal law enforcement efforts. Thus, the regulations distinguish between the investigative period before indictment, arrest, or the filing of a complaint and the period after arrest or the commencement of formal proceedings. They also distinguish between communications that are part of a factual investigation and negotiations of plea agreements, settlements and similar legal arrangements. At the same time, the Manual revisions require that government attorneys consider the principles underlying the basic prohibitions in a much wider variety of circumstances. The Department expects all Department attorneys involved in criminal or civil law enforcement proceedings to adhere to these provisions. Failure to do so will result in appropriate departmental discipline.
