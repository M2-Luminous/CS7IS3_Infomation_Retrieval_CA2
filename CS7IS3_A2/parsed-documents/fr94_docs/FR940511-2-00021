SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: As authorized by Section 16 of the Act of March 3, 1901, as amended (15 U.S.C. 278f), the NIST Building and Fire Research Laboratory conducts directly and through grants and cooperative agreement, a basic and applied fire research program. Academic institutions, non-Federal agencies, independent and industrial laboratories are considered eligible for this program. This program has been in existence for several years at approximately $1.5 million per fiscal year. No increase in funds has taken place. The Fire Research Program is limited to innovative ideas which are generated by the proposal writer on what research to carry out and how to carry it out. Grants awarded under the Fire Research program will generally provide financial assistance to the recipient without substantial NIST involvement in the projects. Cooperative agreements awarded for Fire Research projects will generally involve a close working relationship between a group of NIST experts and the recipient. No matching funds are required. Proposals will be considered for research projects from one to three years. All grant proposals submitted must be in accordance with the programs and objectives listed below. Program Objectives a. Fire Protection Applications: Researcges, develops and demonstrates the application to building fire problems of fire protection analytical (computerized) tools and methods of assessing the ignition and burning rate of contents of buildings. This includes: developing a performance based fire code and methods of assessing fire risk; developing methods of evaluating and predicting the performance of and interactions between building fire safety design features; developing an understanding of the burning rate of furniture and other building contents; developing a data base that provides the necessary input to users of the analytical tools; and operating the Fire Research Information Services which supports the entire laboratory staff and the fire community and has an on-line bibliographic data base.
