In a news conference held at Jordan Hotel this morning, Ghanim said he will convey a message to His Majesty King Husayn from His Excellency 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council chairman in the Republic of Yemen. He added that the message deals with the latest developments in Yemen and the full implementation of the Security Council resolution which preserves the territorial integrity of Yemen. The message also deals with Yemen's insistence on unity and democracy. He said his short visit to Jordan is part of a tour of a number of Arab countries and is aimed to acquaint the Arab leaders with what is going on in Yemen. Ghanim said a Yemeni delegation is currently visiting the Arab Maghreb states, and a Yemeni parliamentary delegation is visiting the U.S. Congress within the framework of political efforts by the Yemeni leadership to explain the facts to brothers and friends and refute the allegations that attempt to deceive Arab and international public opinions through portraying the conflict in Yemen as one between the north and the south, or as an attempt to impose unity by force, while the fact is that it is a conflict between the Yemeni people and the rebels and secessionists who carried weapons against the legitimate regime in order to secede. Ghanim emphasized that unity was established four years ago and was not set up by force but through peaceful means. A referendum on the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen was conducted mid-1991 on the basis of which elections were held in 1993, so how can it be said after all this that we are imposing unity by force? Ghanim said the Yemeni Government unequivocally rejects the presence of foreign forces in Yemen, and considers the rebellious side's demand of entrenching secession through the presence of international forces a blatant aggression against the sovereignty and independence of unified Yemen. Ghanim said: We will abort any secessionist effort, and will work for unity under legitimacy. Our duty is to confront secession and rebellion on the basis of our constitutional responsibilities. He emphasized that Yemen is committed to Security Council Resolution 924, which calls for an immediate cease-fire if the other party is committed to it. The minister added: We know that certain parties are supporting the mutineers' position. We are surprised by this support, and we urge these parties to stop because it will lead to more bloodshed. He pointed out that while the legitimate government forces are demanding the right to affiliation, the other side is demanding mutiny and secession. He stressed his categorical rejection of this interference in Yemen's domestic affairs, and said that Yemen would find itself compelled to reply in an appropriate way if that interference in its national sovereignty continued. During his news conference, he touched on threats from certain sides, and said that they constitute plots against Yemen and its legitimacy. The Yemeni official appealed to the Arab League, the UN Security Council, and all the fraternal and friendly countries to confront those who wish to peddle these plots. He said: We are against any measure or interference that would prolong the war and lead to secession, stressing that Yemen's legitimacy is seeking dialogue within the framework of Yemen's unity. No party alone, he said, has the right to represent that legitimacy and no one has the right to disrupt unity or even argue outside the framework of Yemeni legitimacy. He added: We will reject the division or fragmentation of Yemen by any party, pointing out that international legitimacy has not so far dealt with us in accordance with the UN principles or Charter but in accordance with temporary and political interests. He also said: I attended the deliberations the Security Council's members held before Resolution No. 924 was issued, and I sensed the extent of encroachment exercised against world nations in violation of the principles advocated by the United Nations. Resolutions, he said, are being taken in light of bargains and flattery and apart from peoples' rights and states' right to noninterference in their domestic affairs. The council, he added, also uses double standards. Ghanim then praised the role of the Jordanian king, government, and people in maintaining Yemen's unity and territorial integrity. He also praised Jordan's media, which have stressed their objective support for right and media which the Yemeni citizen views as friendly.
