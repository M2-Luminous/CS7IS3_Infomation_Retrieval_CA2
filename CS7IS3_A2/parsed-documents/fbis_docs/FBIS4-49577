This aspiration was expressed in Beijing yesterday by Ren Jianxin president of the Supreme People's Court, in his speech to 400 participants of the Licensing Executives Society (LES) International Conference. LES International, established in 1974 in San Francisco, is a global non-governmental body specialized in the study and promotion of technology trade that covers the transfer of copyrights, trademarks, patents, know-how and trade secrets. United Nations estimates predict the world's technology trade will hit $230 billion in 1995, compared with $50 billion 10 years ago. "The world's economic trend has provided many Asian countries, including China, with an excellent opportunity to develop their own national economies," Ren said. "Technology transfer and licensing, closely linked with economic development, shall have broad prospects in a region with great vitality." Between 1979 and 1993, China struck over 7,000 technology trade contracts with foreign countries valued at almost $48 billion, according to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation. Last year alone saw 493 technology import deals worth $6.11 billion and 141 technology export deals worth $2.15 billion. The imports included large equipment, licensing, technical services and consultancy for product design, technique and manufacturing know-how. Ren also noted that China has developed a sound legal system for protecting intellectual property rights. China's rewritten Patent Law and Trademark Law has offered extended protection. Copyright protection has also been brought into line with international norms, and the security of trade secrets has been stipulated in the Anti-Unethical Competition Law enforced in December 1993.
