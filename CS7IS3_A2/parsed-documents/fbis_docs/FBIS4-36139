The first is our sense of great disappointment that Arab coordination has not really ever materialised or bore fruit. Right from the start of the Madrid talks in October 1991 it was clear, following the Gulf war and the damage that the war inflicted on the Arab body politic, that the minimum level of Arab consensus had been lost. All those so-called Arab coordination sessions since then have been more of a public relations stunt than real team work. What has exacerbated the problem is Israel's explicit determination to strike separate deals on each of the peace tracks. Israel's first breakthrough was with the Palestinians, which drove a big wedge between the Palestine Liberation Organisation, PLO, on the one hand, and the other parties--Jordan, Syria, Lebanon--on the other. The second important consideration is, now that the negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track are only awaiting a final push, inevitably carrying with them the Lebanese, Jordan cannot afford to be left behind without any real bargaining chips in its hands. That situation, so many sensible Jordanians have argued, is not in the best interests of the country. Hence the necessity of the latest step to resume the talks in Washington today and perhaps to move them later to the region for practical purposes. Needless to say, there is nothing that should stop Jordan and Israel from settling the issue of their common border in accordance to International law as embodied in the 1992 League of Nations terms of the British mandate over Palestine and Jordan. A settlement of this issue can then be turned into a crucial precedent, for Syria and Lebanon, and also the Palestinians, to follow. Nothing is more important here than for Israel to confine itself to internationally acknowledged boundaries, leaving in the process the occupied Arab territories to their rightful owners. The war issue is of course more complex. Israel has so far insisted that since water was scarce the two countries should embark on joint projects to generate new sources of water. That Jordan welcomes but only after it gets its rightful share of the joint resources. What we hope will result from the Washington talks is concrete movement towards lasting and comprehensive peace in the region. If Jordan can get the Israelis to concede on Jordanian rights on borders and water, if it can get the Israelis to accept the principle of withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, then those talks that are to be held in Washington tomorrow will be a major step towards achieving that peace.
