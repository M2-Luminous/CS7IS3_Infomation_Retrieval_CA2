EMI President Lamfalussy knows one thing for sure: "This is not going to be an easy task." Speaking before the central bank of Hamburg, Mecklenburg, and Schleswig-Holstein, Lamfalussy said that the course of fiscal policy can considerably narrow down monetary policy's stabilizing possibilities in both phases of the economic cycle. The only thing that the currency authorities can do is continue to conduct a medium-term stability policy, hoping that this will limit the damage caused by a false fiscal policy. Lamfalussy: "I can see a major problem coming our way here. We will have to define what we mean by a stable monetary policy." This is the biggest challenge that monetary politicians will face over the next few years. Lamfalussy considers the use of a money supply target to be the crucial point. The biggest advantage of a money supply target is that it clearly determines the course of monetary policy. If the targeted money supply growth rate remains unchanged, this indicates a stable monetary policy course. Determining money supply targets takes the pressure off central banks that is exerted on them by governments or parliaments, Lamfalussy said. A central bank has less difficulty resisting an adjustment of monetary policy for subjective reasons. Also -- and this might be the most important point -- a money supply target that is well understood by the general public clearly signals to the players in the market what range of prices and wages is permitted. Whether determining money supply targets is appropriate depends on two things. First, there must be a stable medium-term link between money supply and prices, the final target; and, second, the central bank must be in a position to control the targeted money supply. Several countries, such as the United States and Great Britain, no longer meet one or both of these preconditions. John Crow, former governor of the Canadian Central Bank used to say: "We have not given up M2 -- M2 has given us up." In Germany, such a statement is not justified, in spite of occasional diversions from the M3 target and in spite of M3's recent behavior. Lamfalussy: "But this behavior does not go back nearly long enough to draw any conclusions on medium-term stability of the money demand function, which is the whole point of the matter." Yet, there are ongoing discussions on what basis the European Central Bank's common monetary policy shall be conducted.
