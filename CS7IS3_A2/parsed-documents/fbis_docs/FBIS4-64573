That was what Walter Kittel, Federal Government representative for advisory services in East Europe, said at an event organized by the East and Central Europe Association in Hamburg. Over the past year, the Federal Government has made German advisory services more efficient and improved the coordination of the provision of such services among participating ministries. Kittel went on to say that the goal of advisory assistance was to improve framework conditions for private economic activity and the capacity to absorb international financial assistance. The situation in the CIS countries above all has been shaped by the fact that former command mechanisms for managing the economy have collapsed along with the socialist structures. At the same time, an appropriate free market economic system that conforms to world markets has yet to be developed. A large part of the funds available from the IMF, the World Bank, and the East Europe Bank is blocked for that reason, Kittel said. According to information provided by Kittel, the federal budget for 1994 contains about 300 million German marks for advisory assistance in East Europe. The allocation of the funds will be coordinated by the Economics and Foreign Ministries, distributed among eight fields of activity and 11 countries (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, the Baltic states, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus) and further coordinated with other donors, especially the European Union and international financial institutions. In addition, the distribution of about a third of the funds will require Kittel's approval. In cooperation with each of the partner states, medium- and long-term framework programs have been drawn up for individual countries. At the beginning of 1994, the programs contained more than 800 individual activities. The amounts that the recipient countries will obtain are based on objective criteria, including Germany's economic and foreign policy interests. The projects are based on countries' needs, not on the advisers' ideas, and focus on particular fields and regions, Kittel said. The Reconstruction Bank [KfW] is drawing up a program for conducting assessments and suggesting improvements. The Federal Government program is already oriented toward mobilizing at the lowest possible cost the knowledge available and personnel resources of the relevant organizations, such as the KfW, the German Equalization Bank, the Society for Technical Cooperation, the Trust Agency, as well as party and business foundations. German business can profit from these advisory services in that German investment will be sought in the partner countries as a result of the export of German laws, the adoption of German technical standards, and the identification and launching of private cooperation projects. Viewed against this background, Kittel said it was desirable to develop a symmetrical relationship between German financial assistance and advisory services. Whereas the Germans have borne about two-thirds of the costs of financial assistance provided by the G-7 countries, Germany's share of G-7 advisory services has only been 25 percent.
