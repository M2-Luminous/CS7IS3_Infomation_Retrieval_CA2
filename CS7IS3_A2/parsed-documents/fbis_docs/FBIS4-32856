After meeting with Supreme Court members in Sucre, the country's administrative capital, Sanchez de Lozada announced that he will promote the establishment of a Constitutional Court during the extraordinary congressional sessions that started last week, and during which the constitution will be amended. After meeting with Sanchez de Lozada, acting Chief Justice Gualberto Davalos expressed the Supreme Court's opposition to the establishment of a Constitutional Court. Davalos explained that the Bolivian Supreme Court has and will always oppose the establishment of a Constitutional Court, because it believes it would undermine the Supreme Court's powers and the autonomy of the judiciary. Sanchez de Lozada expressed his determination to propose the establishment of a Constitutional Court in the constitutional amendments, and cited several European and Latin American countries that have one. The Bolivian Supreme Court has been virtually paralyzed since last year in view of impeachment proceedings undertaken against its president, Edgar Oblitas, who has been charged with extortion.
