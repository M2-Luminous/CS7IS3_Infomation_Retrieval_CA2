Talks dealt with the Arab situation and relations between the two fraternal countries. The meeting was attended by Algerian Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri and Syrian Ambassador in Algiers Dr. 'Abd-al-Jabbar al-Dahhak. It was also attended by Dr. Mikha'il Wahbah, director of the special bureaus department. At the end of the meeting, al-Shar' spoke to reporters. He said: I conveyed a letter from President Hafiz al-Asad to His Excellency President Zeroual dealing with bilateral relations, the overall regional situation, and internal developments in fraternal Algeria. I listened to his excellency's assessment of the situation in Algeria and the national dialogue. President Zeroual stressed his concern for Syrian-Algerian relations to me, and I emphasized to his excellency our concern for bilateral relations. Al-Shar' added: We expressed our conviction that Algeria, through what it enjoys in terms of militant history and important regional and international status, must restore its position and effective role, particularly in the Arab World. This is because Arab and Islamic nations are facing great challenges, and Algeria has an important role to play in confronting these challenges. Collective Arab action will remove many dangers facing us, and will help us all serve our nation's objectives. Asked about Syria's position on the Security Council's delay in passing a resolution regarding the Hebron massacre, the foreign minister said: Delaying a resolution by the Security Council is not important. What is really important is the substance of such a resolution. Accordingly, we say that such a resolution should not only condemn the hideous crime committed in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque; it should also address the real reasons behind committing such a crime. In other words, a clear position should be taken on the settlements and the armed settlers. These settlers should be disarmed, and the settlements should be dismantled as part of a comprehensive solution that will completely end the Israeli occupation of Arab territories. Otherwise, such terrible massacres can occur again.
