For a year, beginning 1 July, Germany and then France will shoulder the presidency of the European Union [EU] in succession. Statutory alternation dictates this. The two countries whose cooperation will have most strongly influenced the move toward Europe, despite temporary disagreements and fleeting quarrels, will be at the helm in turn. And this comes at a difficult time. It is clear that this welcome political continuity will either provide Europe with a decisive impetus capable of giving it a real economic, diplomatic, and even military identity, or the last opportunity will be wasted. The ground is fairly clear. The big upheavals are behind us. Neither GATT, daunting because of the risks of division it involved, especially between Paris and Bonn; nor last summer's crisis which almost destroyed the European Monetary System; nor the rather stormy ratification of the Maastricht Treaty sufficed to block the EU's progress. Once the danger is over, there is always a tendency to underestimate it. It nonetheless existed, and it must be admitted that, without Franco-German cooperation, it would probably have ended in disaster. It is this cooperation which Francois Mitterrand, Edouard Balladur, and Chancellor Kohl are discussing in Mulhouse. But this [Franco-German] summit will be more one of assessment than decisionmaking. Indeed, the aim is to prepare for the European Council meeting in Corfu at the end of June, at which Jacques Delors' successor as head of the EU Commission will be appointed, and the G-7 meeting in Naples at the beginning of July. The first is an internal affair focused largely on the running of the EU institutions. The other is an external matter within the club of the most highly industrialized countries and involves the establishment of better conditions for economic development through the inclusion of a "social clause" [in trade agreements]. This is a full enough program to justify the Mulhouse consultations. In view of the preelection debate on the renewal of the European Parliament, such a summit may seem to be a routine matter. This would be to forget that European building has only been able to progress thanks to compromise and that there is no other means of progressing. Nothing better illustrates this obvious fact than Franco-German cooperation. Without it, Europe would already be a dead idea.
