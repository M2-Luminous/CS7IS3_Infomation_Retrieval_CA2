The National Police arrested this week Herrera Agurcia, a retired Army officer, when he was hiding in the home of Subcommander Tobias Gadea, a retired Government Ministry official and an Esteli City resident. The leader of Cobra 93, which operates with the support of cooperatives in the Miraflor area, said at the time he was arrested he was making contacts related to his guerrilla activities. Although Herrera did say: "I have been staying in his house for a long time," he denied Tobias Gadea's involvement in this new recompas movement. Herrera said many retired officers support Cobras 93, but when there are criminal activities involved, sympathizers begin to suspect the rearmed members. Herrera Agurcia, a Quilali native, led the Battalions for Unconventional Warfare during the past decade, and after joining the retirement plan for a large number of officers he left for San Bartolo to farm his father's lands. According to Herrera Agurcia, the 3-80 Northern Front [FN 3-80] recontras killed his brother and other relatives and raped and beat his wife, leading her to have an abortion. This is how he arrived in Esteli, where he organized the self-styled Cobra 93 so as to "make the recontras pay for the death of our relatives." Herrera Agurcia explained the movement's objectives were betrayed by Ramon Alejandro Bermudez, a retired officer and Cobra 93 second in command, because his men began to rape peasant women and to become involved in kidnappings and attacks against communities along the Pan-American Highway from Esteli to Condega. During a news conference at the National Police Command Operations Center in Esteli that took place on 25 February, Herrera Agurcia said before the main police commands of the department Bermudez had told him before his arrest six policemen and EPS members on duty were supporting the movement, and they were even donating war weapons. Subcommander Douglas Zeledon, second department police chief, confirmed Policeman Leonel Valenzuela was arrested as a presumed "Cobra 93" collaborator. He added investigations are still going on to detect the possibility of individuals being involved in planning the recompas actions. So far the recompas have perpetrated nine robberies and other crimes. Zeledon said the operations will continue until approximately 16 criminals are arrested, although Herrera Agurcia said his forces include up to 80 men, and if the government does not give them an enclave, they will begin actions against the FN 3-80 in El Zungano. The military operations have resulted in the arrest of 12 people, including two injured, most of whom are retired EPS members and members of cooperatives in Miraflor, 27 km northeast of Esteli. The authorities have also seized 10 AK and M-16 rifles, one 23-25 carbine, TNT explosives, a large amount of ammunition, backpacks, uniforms, medicine, and other military material. Subcommander Zeledon explained three criminal bands operate in Esteli Department, including the remnants of Cobra 93, robbers who operate in Pueblo Nuevo and affiliate with the FROC [Peasant-Worker Revolutionary Front], and another group that operates between Yali and Condega.
