Busek accused Haider of fanning fears among the population "against his better judgment." The FPOe chairman is making claims that are "highly irresponsible" and, in the end, are "no longer justifiable" if one assumes a minimum standard of politics. The OeVP chairman was referring to answers that the FPOe chairman gave to the KURIER readers' service. Among other things, Haider confirmed "incorrect" rumors that Austrian drinking water will be passed on to Brussels. He claimed that Chancellor Vranitzky is following orders "from outside Austria" issued by the Free Masons or, for instance, that in northern Germany several people have already died as a result of "mad-cow disease," the main source of which is England and which also threatens Austria, "because then there will not be any import restrictions anymore." Busek said that in saying this Haider not only "confirmed that he is still a an adolescent in terms of democracy" but he had also made an "essential contribution" to "reducing credibility in politics as a whole." The OeVP chairman was optimistic that the EU referendum will result in a positive vote. A result over 53 percent would be "a good result." The point is "a decision for the young generation." During the discussion over the past weeks, too much "pea counting" had been done. He would like the citizens to feel "a bit of the breath of history," Busek said. On Monday the conference of provincial governors unanimously adopted an EU declaration, in which the citizens are called upon to vote "yes" on EU membership. It cites the following four main arguments: peace and security, the development of Austria as a business location, the development of a varied but integrated Europe, an Austrian voice in Europe. EU State Secretary Brigitte Ederer said in an APA interview that she does not believe that the mood has changed toward rejection. However, the referendum is "certainly not yet over. The result will be narrow, but it will be narrowly positive," Ederer said. She appealed to those in favor of EU membership to "go to" the referendum. If the result should be "no," we will suffer from a "hangover" relatively quickly. Among other things, one has to expect investment to decline.
