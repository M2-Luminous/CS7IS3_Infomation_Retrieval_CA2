Heads of the seven parties, except Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, reached the agreement at a meeting at the head office of Rengo, Japan's largest labor organization, which played a key role in helping the parties form the coalition last April. Leaders of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), Komeito, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), Sakigake (Harbinger), and the United Social Democratic Party (USDP) attended the meeting. The chief of the Democratic Reform Party, a minor parliamentary group in the House of Councillors, also joined. Hosokawa, who heads the Japan New Party (JNP), was absent. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who met Hosokawa at his official residence, told reporters that Hosokawa hopes for a solution to the tax dispute as early as Sunday, and by Monday at the latest. Takemura said, "the prime minister will give a decision if representatives of the coalition parties cannot reach a solution." At Sunday's meeting, the coalition leaders agreed to first implement the 6 trillion tax reductions and to establish an interparty consultative body to discuss a new 7 percent indirect tax, which Hosokawa proposed as a revenue source for the cuts. Rengo President Akira Yamagishi told a news conference that he will ask the coalition to reach a conclusion in one year's time on the matter of revenue sources. "I hope the coalition will decide in one year. There will be no progress as long as the SDP continues to insist on two years' time," Yamagishi said. The SDP, the largest among the seven ruling parties, has called for a large tax cut and for discussion in two years on how to finance the tax reduction. Other coalition parties have agreed to formulate a conclusion in one year's time. Attendees at the Sunday gathering were SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata, Komeito Chairman Koshiro Ishida, DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi, Sakigake leader Takemura, USDP head Satsuki Eda, and Yasumatsu Hoshikawa, head of the Democratic Reform Party. In the coalition, Hata serves as deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Ishida as director general of the Management and Coordination Agency, Ouchi as health and welfare minister, and Eda as director general of the Science and Technology Agency. The seven met before attending Rengo's Central Executive Committee session. Meanwhile, Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, a main strategist for the coalition government, suggested his readiness Sunday to make all-out concessions to the SDP. Ozawa, appearing on Fuji TV's "News Report 2001" talk show, said he accepts the idea of imposing the new indirect tax as a special-purpose levy for welfare affairs only. Last week, Hosokawa announced a 6 trillion yen tax cut retroactive to January 1 and also proposed imposing a 7 percent "National Welfare Tax" effective from April 1997 to offset resultant revenue shortfalls. But the tax cut and increase program hit a snag in the wake of strong opposition from the SDP, which threatened to quit the coalition unless the new tax plan was dropped. On Friday, the coalition scrapped Hosokawa's program and agreed to spend more time discussing it, averting a major political crisis that could lead to a breakup of the six-month-old Hosokawa cabinet. Hosokawa has repeatedly expressed hope for an early solution to the tax dispute in time for his departure to the United States on Thursday for a summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton. The Clinton administration has been urging Japan to take drastic economic stimulus measures to pull its slumbering economy out of a recession, revive consumer spending and thereby pare down Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States totaling 50 billion dollars annually. Government sources said the Hosokawa cabinet was compiling the 15 trillion yen stimulus package featuring the 6 trillion yen tax cut as well as increased public works spending in the face of a veiled U.S. threat to invoke its Super 301 retaliatory trade provision. The SDP has blasted Hosokawa's tax plan as a ploy to force the nation to accept a de facto more than double the current 3 percent consumption tax rate, and merely renaming it a "National Welfare Tax." The SDP has argued that the coalition should insert into the legislation wording that would ensure all fresh revenue from the new tax be used solely for welfare purposes. But the Finance Ministry has resisted the demand, saying that such a provision would tie the hands of the government in funneling the revenue to fund various policy measures. The SDP has insisted on the abolition of the consumption tax imposed five years ago. It boosted its parliamentary strength in a 1989 House of Councillors election shortly after the then cabinet of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita imposed the levy.
