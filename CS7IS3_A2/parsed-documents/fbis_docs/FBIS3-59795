At the general meeting of the IAEA in Vienna, Austria, on 27 September, STA Director General Eda reported on the status of Japan's study of a system for international control of non-military use of plutonium, and called for cooperation in the international community. Japan is promoting the development and use of nuclear energy built around the use of plutonium, and because plutonium use under appropriate control is essential, we will watch future responses with interest. On the other hand, a symposium called ``Why Plutonium Now,'' which was co-hosted by the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum and the nuclear energy data and information office, was held in Osaka City on 25 September. The pro-nuclear and anti-nuclear factions sat down together for the first time. The surfacing of plutonium as the focal point of the development and use of nuclear energy is a recent thing, and it is encouraging that the two sides finally have come together in a debate on the pros and cons and other problems of nuclear energy, where emotions have tended to take precedence in the past. The overall nuclear picture in the international community consists of the United States, which touts nuclear non-proliferation but wears the armor of global strategy which is visible under its robe, China and several ``suspected nuclear countries,'' which are defying the United States, and Russia, which has been trying to dispose of nuclear warheads since the disassembling of the former Soviet Union. The focus of this is on plutonium. The sole reason for such concern about plutonium is that it can easily be converted to use in nuclear weapons. Unlike uranium that requires enrichment, plutonium produced in a nuclear reactor can be separated, extracted and used almost as is for nuclear weapons, and this can be done with only basic chemical knowledge. Enriched uranium can be mixed with natural uranium to lower its concentration and make it difficult to convert to nuclear weapon use, but in contrast, there is no effective means to prevent the conversion of plutonium. Furthermore, use of plutonium in nuclear power plants, certainly in fast breeder reactors but even in light water reactors and other types of nuclear reactors, is disadvantageous in terms of economical operation; and it is difficult to say that the safety of the technology has been verified fully. The current environment is such that insisting on plutonium use at this time would tend to create suspicion that there is an intention to develop nuclear weapons. It probably is true that this sort of suspicion is hidden behind some of the domestic and foreign criticism. There are a number of reasons and one big one is that the government has not provided sufficient appropriate explanation to gain the people's understanding. There is plenty to reflect upon, such as whether the petitions and views of civic groups opposed to plutonium use have been heeded with humility, or whether it was thought that it would be sufficient to provide technical explanations that were over the heads of residents with little expert knowledge. Ensuring transparency in the use of plutonium is the most important goal of international control. The statement Director General Eda made at the IAEA general meeting probably resulted from an STA study. International transparency is supported by domestic transparency. It needs to be stressed that efforts to gain domestic understanding will lead to understanding in the international community.
