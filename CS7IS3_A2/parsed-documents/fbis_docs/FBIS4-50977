While helping balance the richer east and poorer west (because GATT calls for trade policies to be applied uniformly across the country) among other merits, the access could well cause trade deficits for China for a long time, said Wang Xinkui, deputy director and professor of the Shanghai Foreign Trade Institute. The trade balance could deteriorate (on the basis of the level observed before the access) in the immediate future, he added. "For, in general, it will be easier for foreign businesses to enter into the Chinese market than for Chinese companies to enter into foreign ones, as soon as China assumes a freer trade policy upon access to Gatt," he explained. Soaring imports could emerge as China switches from a planned economy to a market-based one. During the transitional period, imports are expected to run out of control to a certain extent when trade is deregulated. This situation is set to be aggravated if domestic enterprises go for imports in a blind way as the national economy continues to expand in the fast lane. "Moreover, a huge demand for foreign consumer goods by ordinary people will be a potential stimulus to new rounds of imports," Wang said. But he admitted that re-entering Gatt will provide China with an opportunity to readjust its foreign trade pattern which developed in the 1980s. The pattern is characterised by a favourable tilt towards the country's coastal regions, labour-intensive industries and a narrow export market concentrated on the United States, Japan and Hong Kong. The pattern has produced three major problems for China's foreign trade, Wang said. First comes the worrisome export growth momentum, which is maintained by the supply of more export goods whose prices have been drifting downward most the time. China's overall export price level in 1990 dropped by 12.4 per cent over that in 1981, although the annual trade volume grew by 12.3 per cent from 1981-90. "The bottom reason for the worsened export efficiency is that China failed to establish new money-spinning industries (such as machinery processing) when the costs of labour and raw materials soared up to hamper the competitiveness of the labour-intensive industries, like textiles," Wang said. Second comes the imbalanced development between the east and the west. The third is that China's exports are unduly focused on a few markets. Statistics show that exports to the US, Japan, Hong Kong and Macao accounted for 68.3 percent of China's total in l991, up from 53.1 per cent in 1980. To break the undesired pattern Wang said China must lose no time in bolstering a cluster of new technology-intensive industries, which will be the mainstay of the national economy in the next century. Priorities should include the heavy chemical, machinery, electronics and telecommunications sectors. These sectors have been a weak link in the Chinese economy, which in the 1980s favoured labour-intensive sectors, such as textiles industry. "China should take advantage of its treatment as a low-income nation after rejoining Gatt to protect these new industries by resorting to tariff and non-tariff measures on a selective basis." Wang said. These industries should establish systems that promote large-scale production via corporate alliances and annexations, he added. China should also take advantage of easier access to more overseas markets, which will apply lower tariffs to China after its re-entry into Gatt, to cultivate more export markets other than just the few mentioned above. The biggest headache for China's exports is that there are no powerful transnational companies that can compete effectively in the world market. He urged the government to further wean itself from meddling in the business operation of large and medium-sized State enterprises, so that they will be more competitive.
