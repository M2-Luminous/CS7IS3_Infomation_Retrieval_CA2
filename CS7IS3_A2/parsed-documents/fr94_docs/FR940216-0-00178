FR940216-0-00178 FR940216-0-00010 (ii) Any refiner or importer that elects to achieve compliance with the anti-dumping requirements using the: (A) Simple model shall meet the requirements of this Subpart D using the simple model standards; or (B) Complex model or optional complex model shall meet the requirements of this Subpart D using the complex model standards. (2) During the period January 1, 1998 through December 31, 1999, any refiner or importer shall be subject to the Phase I complex model standards specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. (3) Beginning on January 1, 2000, any refiner or importer shall be subject to the Phase II complex model standards specified in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. (j) Complex model early use. Before January 1, 1998, the VOC, toxics, and NO X emissions performance standards for any refinery or importer subject to the Phase I complex model standards shall be determined by evaluating all of the following parameter levels in the Phase I complex model (specified in §80.45) at one time: (1) The simple model values for benzene, RVP, and oxygen specified in §80.41 (a) or (b), as applicable; (2) The aromatics value which, together with the values for benzene, RVP, and oxygen determined under paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section, meets the simple model toxics requirement specified in §80.41 (a) or (b), as applicable; (3) The refinery's or importer's individual baseline values for sulfur, E&hyph;300, and olefins, as established under §80.91; and (4) The appropriate seasonal value of E&hyph;200 specified in §80.45(b)(2). (k) Effect of VOC survey failure. (1) On each occasion during 1995 or 1996 that a covered area fails a simple model VOC emissions reduction survey conducted pursuant to §80.68, the RVP requirements for that covered area beginning in the year following the failure shall be adjusted to be more stringent as follows: (i) The required average RVP level shall be decreased by an additional 0.1 psi; and (ii) The maximum RVP level for each gallon of averaged gasoline shall be decreased by an additional 0.1 psi. (2) On each occasion that a covered area fails a complex model VOC emissions reduction survey conducted pursuant to §80.68, or fails a simple model VOC emissions reduction survey conducted pursuant to §80.68 during 1997, the VOC emissions performance standard for that covered area beginning in the year following the failure shall be adjusted to be more stringent as follows: (i) The required average VOC emissions reduction shall be increased by an additional 1.0%; and (ii) The minimum VOC emissions reduction, for each gallon of averaged gasoline, shall be increased by an additional 1.0%. (3) In the event that a covered area for which required VOC emissions reductions have been made more stringent passes all VOC emissions reduction surveys in two consecutive years, the averaging standards VOC emissions reduction for that covered area beginning in the year following the second year of passed survey series shall be made less stringent as follows: (i) The required average VOC emissions reduction shall be decreased by 1.0%; and (ii) The minimum VOC emissions reduction shall be decreased by 1.0%. (4) In the event that a covered area for which the required VOC emissions reductions have been made less stringent fails a subsequent VOC emissions reduction survey: (i) The required average VOC emission reductions for that covered area beginning in the year following this subsequent failure shall be made more stringent by increasing the required average and the minimum VOC emissions reduction by 1.0%; and (ii) The required VOC emission reductions for that covered area thereafter shall not be made less stringent regardless of the results of subsequent VOC emissions reduction surveys. (l) Effect of toxics survey failure. (1) On each occasion during 1995 or 1996 that a covered area fails a simple model toxics emissions reduction survey series, conducted pursuant to §80.68, the simple model toxics emissions reduction requirement for that covered area beginning in the year following the year of the failure is made more stringent by increasing the average toxics emissions reduction by an additional 1.0%. (2) On each occasion that a covered area fails a complex model toxics emissions reduction survey series, conducted pursuant to §80.68, or fails a simple model toxics emissions reduction survey series conducted pursuant to §80.68 during 1997, the complex model toxics emissions reduction requirement for that covered area beginning in the year following the year of the failure is made more stringent by increasing the average toxics emissions reduction by an additional 1.0%. (3) In the event that a covered area for which the toxics emissions standard has been made more stringent passes all toxics emissions survey series in two consecutive years, the averaging standard for toxics emissions reductions for that covered area beginning in the year following the second year of passed survey series shall be made less stringent by decreasing the average toxics emissions reduction by 1.0%. (4) In the event that a covered area for which the toxics emissions reduction standard has been made less stringent fails a subsequent toxics emissions reduction survey series: (i) The standard for toxics emissions reduction for that covered area beginning in the year following this subsequent failure shall be made more stringent by increasing the average toxics emissions reduction by 1.0%; and (ii) The standard for toxics emissions reduction for that covered area thereafter shall not be made less stringent regardless of the results of subsequent toxics emissions reduction surveys. (m) Effect of NO X survey failure. (1) On each occasion that a covered area fails a NO X emissions reduction survey conducted pursuant to §80.68, except in the case Phase II complex model NO X standards for VOC-controlled gasoline, the NO X emissions reduction requirements for that covered area beginning in the year following the failure shall be adjusted to be more stringent as follows: (i) The required average NO X emissions reduction shall be increased by an additional 1.0%; and
