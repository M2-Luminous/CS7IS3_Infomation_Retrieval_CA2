FR941205-0-00074 FR941205-0-00021 It is fundamental under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that Congress lacks the power directly to compel States to enact and enforce a Federal regulatory program. Equally fundamental, however, is Congress' authority to establish a program of cooperative federalism in which States are encouraged to enact a State regulatory program using Federal standards in a federally preemptible area. When Congress created the operating permits program in title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, it could have entirely preempted State regulation by creating a regulatory scheme to be enforced exclusively by EPA. Instead, Congress created a regulatory scheme where States could enact permit programs meeting Federal standards or have EPA promulgate such a program. When Congress chooses to allow the States such a regulatory role in a federally preemptible area, such as it has done in title V, the Supreme Court has found no violation of the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and therefore no unconstitutional invasion of State sovereignty. Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U.S. 264, 290 (1981); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U.S. 742, 764 (1982). The title V operating permits program does not ``commandeer the legislative processes of the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a Federal regulatory program.'' Hodel, supra, at 288; FERC, supra, at 764&hyph;765. Rather, this program is clearly one of cooperative federalism that encourages the States to enact and enforce a State program, incorporating title V's standards, by offering incentives to do so. Congress can encourage States to regulate in a particular manner by attaching conditions on the receipt of Federal funds and/or offering States the choice of regulating an activity in conformance with Federal standards or having the State law preempted by Federal regulation. New York v. United States, 112 S. Ct. 2408 (1992). Congress has provided States with two incentives to encourage them to adopt and implement an operating permits program consistent with Federal regulations. If a State fails to submit an approvable program, it is subject to one or more of the sanctions described under section 179(b) of the Act. Again, it is well established that Congress is empowered to further Federal policy objectives by conditioning the receipt of Federal moneys upon compliance by the recipient State with Federal statutory and administrative directives. See, e.g., South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987); Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448 (1980). In addition, under section 502(d)(3), if a State does not submit a title V operating permits program or if the State program does not meet the requirements of title V, EPA is required to promulgate, administer, and enforce an operating permits program in that State. Thus, if the Commonwealth does not submit a permanent program that complies with the Act and 40 CFR part 70, the full regulatory burden will be borne by EPA. The Commonwealth asserts that EPA's interpretation of section 502(b)(6) is a violation of the Eleventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Virginia's concern is misplaced because section 502(b)(6) provides for judicial review of a State's permitting decisions in State court and therefore does not implicate the Eleventh Amendment. Comment: The Commonwealth of Virginia should receive interim approval of its operating permits program. Several commenters believe that Virginia's program will meet the minimum requirements to be considered for interim approval as described at 40 CFR 70.4(d) once proposed modifications to the permits program regulations are adopted. It has also been stated that the issue of judicial standing is not a relevant criterion for assessing interim approvability.
