"It is a day of sorrow not only for the Palestinian people but maybe also for the peace process," said al-Husayni, who front's Yasir 'Arafat's mainstream PLO group Fatah. "When it reaches this level this means the peace process is dying. "If the Israelis are not going to take real steps to stop the settlers and their activities in the area I believe they are killing the peace process," al-Husayni said. He called for the Israeli government to disarm all settlers and demanded that an inquiry be set up immediately "to investigate not only who did it, but also what was the attitude of the army before and after the event." The Tomb of the Patriarchs where the slaughter took place in Hebron is under military guard. "I call for the government and Rabin to take real steps and not only words. Words will not be enough," al-Husayni said. "If the Israeli government cannot take this responsibility then we have to take it ourselves. "They have to create an atmosphere (in which) we can tell our people there is a peace process and they can wait, or else we cannot ask them to restrain themselves.
