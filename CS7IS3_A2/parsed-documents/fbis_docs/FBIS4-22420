This is viewed as quite attainable by State Minister of Forests Kazimir Shlakota, which will retain its prior designation as Ministry of Forests through 1994, despite the fact that the agency is now subordinate to the Ministry of Agriculture. The mix of exports is also improving. The log sell-off craze has ended. But there is little to grieve over what has passed. If at one time we had not exported unprocessed logs and pulpwood, where would the funds have come from to acquire equipment for cutting timber and for sawing lumber? Now we can cut and sell boards. - Now we are preparing for the next stage. A plywood enterprise is already in production in Riga. That yields $600 per cubic meter. Sawn lumber is about 110-115 dollars per cubic meter. In the ramp up period, while local workers learn how to prepare and select wood for the plant, local wood will comprise only 20% of the production while the balance will be imported from Germany and Finland. By next year Latvian wood will make up 50% of production and the following year this will jump to 75%. Four firms will begin production in Latvia this year that make wood panels for furniture making from wood slats. This will create new opportunities for furniture manufacturing. Already Latvian furniture makers are working and exporting to the West. We must, however, meet local demand for furniture where last year over five million worth of furniture was imported into Latvia from Germany and Finland, even where our own products are superior. A German child's bed costs 320 Ls. One just like it that is produced in Latvia costs 120 Ls (and these are exported to Germany!). It appears that our people are ready to pay 200 Ls for the label Made in Germany. The most important problems -- to clarify available raw resources and production capacity, which is now sufficiently available that we are running out of resources. That is an energy problem, because there is a massive effort to convert furnaces to burn wood and wood chips. But will there be wood to burn? The second problem -- restart the paper industry. At this point only the Ligatne factory is in production. Two paper-making machines need to be started in Sloka. Paper carton production also needs to be started in Ranka. Russian paper has become cheap. Even the expensive Finish paper has become advantageous due to its quality. This is why the Latvian producer has to drop his price (reprocessing newsprint, reducing irrational energy consumption, using production waste for fuel) and improve his quality. Changes in Latvia's forestry -- due to the privatization of wood processing enterprises and to reallocation of governmental functions -- was begun a bit too early by our Ministry, if we take into account the overall status of the country. We hoped that privatization would be implemented quickly -- in reality, in three years virtually nothing has happened in the enterprises. At the same time these enterprises have been robbed to nothingness. We also expected that the divisions between national, local government and private forests would have been rapidly and clearly established. It is finally becoming easier. Most importantly, we have let energetic people operate in the forests. We established very low fees to be paid to the State treasury to permit farmers and small enterprises to start felling logs and making money with little up-front cost. This, however, was done at the expense of forest management -- less money to pay forester wages. Latvians are slow by temperament. This is why for a time it seemed that little was happening in this field. Movement began in earnest, however, last year when over a thousand private sawmills, carpentry shops and furniture factories began production. Each gave work to from five to even a hundred employees. In a year's time these enterprises got on their feet with virtually no financial investment. But the real flowering of the wood-processing industry lies ahead. The export of sawn lumber has grown six-fold. This has been done by the small, rural sawmills. The large mills have little to offer, because they have problems with production quality. These are no longer the times when we can produce crooked flooring where a cat can fall through the cracks! Bit by bit local demand is also picking up in construction. At this time our exports are hitting the limits of our forest resources. There are no more logs in Latvia. We must begin to think about importing wood for processing in Latvia. This is now beginning. This year wood will be imported from Finland (processing is cheaper here) as well as from Lithuania and Russia where wood processing firms have not thrived because there the State attempted to hold on to the wood processing industry. The Estonian wood processing industry was immediately converted to the free market, but we attempted to regulate the conditions when these became critical and forest products workers wages became unacceptable. We then lowered duties and tariffs to assure a stable 30-40% profitability. This is why wood processing is the only industrial sector in Latvia that can develop on the basis of its own resources. Farmers at this time do not have other comparably secure sources of profits, which can also be used for other farming needs. -- But how does this development affect the forest itself? Is there a basis for concerns about the rapid cutting of our forests? -- I believe that our explanations have helped, because now people are less upset. At this time we can process about 6.5 million cubic meters of wood per annum. Last year, we processed only 4.7 million, but 1.8 million cubic meters remained in the field. 400,000 cubic meters were not processed by state enterprises in their prolonged prebankruptcy condition. At the same time, 1.4 million cubic meters were not logged in the former kolkhoz forests, which are being converted to private ownership, because the conversion is far too slow. There are too few specialists who can determine borders and resolve disputes among heirs. These disputes are becoming stronger by the day as it becomes clear that the forest represents real wealth. The pre-war Forestry Department managed 1,270,000 hectares of forest. We can hope that we will regain control of 1,200,000 hectares losing 70,000 to road-building and to private farmers. About 1,300,000 hectares should be transferred to private ownership and about 100,000 to local governments. What will happen with the State's share? We want to straighten the borders, and sell small holdings in turn purchasing forest land adjoining larger forests. In any case, I do not desire to sell-off the nation's forests. First, until 1996 forest property in Latvia will be very cheap. This is because many owners who have reclaimed their land don't have a clear idea what to do with it, and are selling it off. This drives down the price. Secondly, the government can gain greater value from the forest through careful management instead of selling it. Why should you take a hen to market, if you can make good money by selling its eggs? (I hope that private owners understand this and that by 1996 that the forest selling boom comes to an end.) The capabilities of the national forest management system are demonstrated by the stable growth of exports. (We do not do any logging. This is done by private loggers who pay the government a stump fee. It is however, possible, in time that we will be able to lease a parcel including a brigade of loggers.) Third, the national forests must remain as a place where people can pick berries and mushrooms and rest. It will become more difficult to do this in a private forest. Forest preserves and reservations can be formed in the expanse of the national forests. -- How have new private owners of forests responded to the strict government guidelines for forest management and use (which came into force on January 31). It is no secret that many of these people have the attitude, "This forest belongs to me and I can do with it what I want!" -- Private owners can only use their forest resources if they have a project that has been developed with the forest developer and the State forester. The owner who does not have a project must receive written permission from the forester with each use. At this time the reaction of the owners is negative. They feel that they will know best what to do. This is why we try to explain that this policy serves their own interests. Why should you log your birch now if you will barely get 100 Ls? Why not wait a decade when you will get 4,000 Ls from each hectare? If you must log now, then the next time when you will be able to earn 4,000 Ls from your birch will be 50-60 years from now. But it is hard to explain to a beggar, who needs those 1000 Ls today. A person, who wants to be a real proprietor, must know what he can extract from his property. This is why it is important to establish a project, a 15 year plan, how to maximize the yield from the forest resource. Most new forest owners are people with no experience with very poor prior knowledge. It is no accident to see forests where the owners have mowed down the trees completely -- as if they were in the land of their enemy and not their own. And then their is the share that belongs to the heirs reclaiming their land who are bent on selling it immediately at all costs, because they do not have an idea what to do with it. This is why we are pushing the passage of this law to explain to these new owners what wealth a real proprietor can get from his forest. This is why I urge those who are repossessing their forests to read the specialty magazine Forest Life! At the Ogre Forest Technicum, a new organization is being formed called the Association of Forest Users which is already operational in four regions. This organization has begun training, specialists are going to the countryside to give lectures and to provide explanations. Forest owners will have to adjust to the fact that forests will be managed only by those who have the necessary knowledge. If they won't have this knowledge themselves, then they will have to hire specialists who have the knowledge. Anybody can buy a car who has the money, but only those can drive who have a driver's license in their pocket. A forest is a far more complicated affair, than driving a car, believe me!
