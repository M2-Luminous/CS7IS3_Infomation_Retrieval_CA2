General Mya, what would you like to say about this? [Mya] Our view is that we will not be able to achieve internal peace through a cease-fire agreement with the SLORC. The SLORC's cease-fire is a sham. The revolutionary forces in Burma took up arms for political reasons; the SLORC is pursuing a cease-fire, but this does not solve the political problem. Internal peace can only be established when the political and ethnic problems are solved. The SLORC is not doing this. It is pursuing a cease-fire, but it is not talking about politics. When political issues are raised, it insists categorically on the surrender of arms. The KNU [Karen National Union] cannot accept this. Other ethnic groups made cease-fire agreements with the SLORC and held talks, but they were not allowed to raise political questions; they stopped at the cease-fire issue. This does not serve the interests of the ethnic groups' armed revolutionary struggle. Furthermore, the SLORC does not wish to establish internal peace; we have learned that it is pursuing this in order to get foreign loans. [Correspondent] The news on the outside is that the SLORC and Gen. Mya's KNU are attempting to hold cease-fire talks. Considering the points you just mentioned, what reason would you have for holding cease-fire talks? [Mya] We will not discuss a cease-fire with the SLORC. We will participate, however, if talks are held. If we participate we will do so according to DAB [Democratic Alliance of Burma] policy; if we hold talks we will do so as the entire DAB. We informed the SLORC, but it did not accept this. It said it will only hold separate talks. We said we would hold separate talks, but they had to be held abroad in accordance with DAB policy. The SLORC did not accept this; it wanted to hold the talks in Rangoon. We insisted on holding talks abroad because we held talks with the BSPP [Burma Socialist Program Party] on three previous occasions without any success. On these previous occasions, they said the political problem had to be solved politically and insisted on surrender. Now the SLORC is doing the same. We insisted on holding talks abroad because it insisted on surrender without attempt to solve political problems by political means. We want to hold talks abroad because we want to establish genuine internal peace and discuss matters freely as we wish. We want to work in a cordial manner in an attempt to bring about internal peace. It is neither our desire nor wish to obtain a cease-fire; we are striving for lasting peace. The SLORC, however, does not accept this. [Correspondent] I gather from what you just said that you wish to hold talks with the SLORC not only on the limited matter of a cease-fire, but on broad issues including political and military matters and the issue of peace in the country. Is this assessment correct? [Mya] Yes. We want peace for the entire country and not just peace between the Burmese and Karen. We want peace in the whole of Burma. [Correspondent] You said the SLORC rejected your suggestion. According to one report we received, the SLORC verbally rejected your proposal to hold talks in Thailand. Is this correct? [Mya] That is correct. I met the military attache, but they also did not accept this. [Correspondent] There is a report that Khun Sa had proposed an alliance with various ethnic groups, including the KNU. Is this true? [Mya] There was an offer from Khun Sa. Khun Sa had publicly declared the formation of a republic. We sent some youths to observe his declaration of a republic. We wanted to study the extent of the Shan people's support and interest. [Correspondent] The SLORC has alleged that representatives of the KNU, Mon, and Karenni met with Khun Sa to discuss a military union. Would you like to comment on this? [Mya] This is not true. It was not aimed at military union. We wanted to observe whether they would fight after achieving independence. As far as we observed, they will not fight the SLORC, but will retaliate if the SLORC attacks them. That is what we observed. [Correspondent] That is all I would like to ask on the current situation. Would you like to add anything, Gen. Bo Mya? [Mya] The people of Burma are being oppressed and insulted by the SLORC. Other countries should consider this; they should remember the suffering and hardship of the people of Burma and come to our defense. [Correspondent] I said I had no more questions, but I do have another question. Does the DAB remain as united as before? [Mya] Yes. The DAB remains united, and there is much understanding. Some organizations that already held talks with the SLORC have become disappointed because the SLORC does as it pleases, while some organizations are reestablishing contact with us. [Correspondent] The fourth anniversary of the general elections in 27 May. What would you like to say in this regard? [Mya] The people want genuine internal peace and full democratic rights. They absolutely do not want the SLORC. The people's judgment will eventually prevail.
