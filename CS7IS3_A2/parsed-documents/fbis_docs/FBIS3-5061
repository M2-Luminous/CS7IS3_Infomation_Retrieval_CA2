The height of its mindless communication, as manifested in its utterly ridiculous allegations against the integrity of our leaders, threatens to cripple the British industries and relations between the two countries. But nobody, not even the Government there, seems to be able to imbue the British Press with a sense of being responsible. Perhaps it is now up to those who suffer and have to survive the consequences of their fallen fourth estate who must exhaust their resources to do something about it. Since the British Government seemed to shy away from doing anything concrete to rebut the ridiculous and unsubstantiated allegations made, the maligned Malaysian Government seems to have no choice but to end all further dealings with British companies. Indeed, why should the Malaysian Government give contracts to British companies, only to suffer various allegations and ridicule in the British Press? As the Malaysian Government cannot expect justice or reasonableness from the once-respected British Press, it should not be blamed for assuming it could not hope for justice from a British court should it decide to take legal action against the offending newspapers. Perhaps the Malaysian Government, in its wisdom, knows that taking the newspapers to the British courts would be a lengthy process bound to tie up human and financial resources which are better utilised for the development of the country. In any case the British Press has not shown due respect to its own legal system. It openly criticised court judgments. As such, there is nothing that could stop it from further maligning our leaders should the court rule in favour of the Malaysian Government. The British Press always prides itself in being free, independent and liberal. This may seem so. But while it may be free from Government influence, it can never be free from editors who are beholden to the owners. The history of the British Press is full of examples of independent editors of newspapers being put out on the streets by the owners. A landmark example was when Harold Evans had to leave after he disagreed with Rupert Murdoch, who had just then acquired THE TIMES. The British Press and some British Ministers, in trying to justify the ferocity of their attacks against Malaysia and the Malaysian leaders, have often referred to the Malaysian Press as being controlled by the government. What they failed to recognise is that the Malaysian Press has not only been responsible but has been instrumental in helping to create a stable, peaceful and harmonious multiracial Malaysia that is on the threshold of becoming an industrialised country. Malaysia, unlike Britain, is built on the foundation of mutual respect among members of society -- the press included. It is this respect that is fostered, and allowed to grow and spread, that has helped establish a strong and industrious nation. This formula is so successful that even the British companies benefited by way of trade and contracts. Unlike the British Press, the Malaysian Press does not believe in opposing for the sake of proving a point or showing that it is powerful and independent. It is a part of the national tradition and we are proud of our role.
