The credits, he said, must be granted on easy terms rather than at the unbearable discount rate of 210 percent. He complained that the agricultural sector was neglected as far as financing was concerned. The updated draft budget that was supported by the Agrarian Party in the Duma would appropriate over 10.8 trillion rubles, of which over four trillion as support of most important industries, for agricultural needs. As of mid-June, however, as little as 9.26 and 1.94 pct of these amounts, respectively, have been made available, Nazarchuk said. He added that the Finance Ministry had promised to make as much money available to the farming sector as the budget had appropriated. Even if it does, however, the Agrarian Party cannot rule out the possibility of protest actions undertaken by the Russian peasants. The national convention of peasants may have a significant role to play in such actions. The date of the convention will be set by the Agricultural Workers Collective Action Council which will meet on June 24.
