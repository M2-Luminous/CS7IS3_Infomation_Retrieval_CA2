According to reliable information, during the one-hour meeting, the U.S. Pentagon mentioned: a) The situation in the Balkans might remain fragile and this is why the U.S. side is examining the repercussions of possible developments that will affect Skopje and Albania. b) The U.S. Secretary of State made a lengthy reference to the issue of Albania, leaving the impression that the U.S. Government efforts to help that country include military cooperation through the new Partnership for Peace doctrine. Perry did not discuss the Greek minority rights issue, but conveyed the broader view of the U.S. Government. He mentioned that despite minor problems, Greece can and should help Albania during this period. According to the same information, the Greek delegation appeared willing to examine ways of "tripartite" cooperation (Greece, United States, Albania) within the greater framework of Partnership for Peace. In accordance with a Greek proposal, this issue will be discussed extensively during Perry's official visit to Athens on 19 July. It is noted that during this period, Perry will have a clearly "Balkan tour" and will visit Bucharest, Sofia, Skopje, Athens, Tirana, and Sarajevo. c) The U.S. military delegation was particularly insistent on the issue of Skopje. The U.S. officials repeatedly expressed their concerns about the recent border "incidents" between Serbia and Skopje. Some international newspapers had played up these incidents. According to the same sources, a U.S. interlocutor at the Pentagon expressed "his great concern" about "the fate" of the U.S. peacekeeping force in Skopje "if something goes wrong." d) The "traditional" reference to the Cyprus issue was made. The Greek delegation proposed that an extensive discussion on this issue as well as on the defense doctrine be conducted in Athens in July. Larisa The Greek side immediately expressed interest in active participation in the Partnership for Peace, stressing that as a strong Balkan country, Greece can play a particularly constructive role in this effort, thus "upgrading" Greece's bid to be the headquarters of "NATO's multinational swift intervention force," which is being pursued by both Athens and Ankara. Following this, the defense minister preferred not to raise at this meeting the issue of an air subheadquarters, preferring to discuss the issue of a Larisa headquarters during his meeting with Perry in Athens. During a recess in this meeting, the Greek delegation raised the issue of redistributing annuities from U.S. military aid to Greece. The tremendous debt (6 billion dollars, 2 billion of which are from taxes) is pressuring the Greek side. This is why a proposal was made for a favorable way to "write off" the two billion. On CNN In an 8-minute interview on the U.S. network CNN, which was relayed last night, the Greek defense minister supported the Greek positions on the Greek-Turkish differences and the issue of Skopje.
