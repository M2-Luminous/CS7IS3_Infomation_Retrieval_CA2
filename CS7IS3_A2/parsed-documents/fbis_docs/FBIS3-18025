The delegations were chaired by Mr. Olgerts Pavlovskis, state minister for external trade and relations with the EU in the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Mr. Daniel Guggenbuhl, head of unit in the European Commission's directorate-general for external economic relations. This first round of negotiations was held in an open and constructive atmosphere. The parties had a general exchange of views on the various aspects to be covered by the agreement. Both delegations shared the view that the envisaged new trade agreement will be a further important step for the integration of Latvia into the European Union and that the negotiations should be concluded as soon as possible. The Copenhagen Summit had invited the European Commission to submit proposals for developing the existing trade and cooperation agreements between the EU and the Baltic states into free trade agreements. The Commission presented its proposals on 1 December 1993. On this basis the Council adopted the negotiating directives for the three countries on 7 February 1994. The negotiations with Estonia and Lithuania will start tomorrow and on 28 February.
