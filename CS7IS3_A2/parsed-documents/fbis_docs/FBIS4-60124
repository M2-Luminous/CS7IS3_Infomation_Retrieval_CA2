Our movement revolted against the reality of the 1967 defeat and adopted the slogans of the masses to achieve the goals of the masses in returning and establishing an independent Palestinian state, with Holy Jerusalem as its capital. It is normal that global difficulties affected the regional situation, which made our march a difficult and bitter one, marked with huge sacrifices. Our march was able to resist because of the huge sacrifices made by the Mujahid people and its struggling forces, despite the fact that its achievements were vulnerable to all means and attempts to dominate and even destroy them. Therefore, starting from our conviction for a just and comprehensive peace, the movement took part in the peace process approved by the Palestinian National Council, prior to our delegation leaving for Madrid, putting before our eyes the objectives of our Palestinian people and with determination to establish its presence in the midst of these international changes. [sentence as heard] The accord which was recently signed in Cairo is a natural outcome to the struggle of our people and its heavy sacrifices in the shadow of these accelerating international changes. The Fatah Movement is confident that our people, wherever they are, will stand in a single rank in the battle of construction and building, the battle of building their independent state as they have always stood during all stages of the national struggle, one consequence of which is what we have achieved on the ground in the homeland. Therefore, the unity of our people is the genuine guarantee for the success of Palestinian authority and a safe way toward the realization of an independent Palestinian state, with holy Jerusalem as its capital. Therefore, we in the Fatah Movement call upon the Arab brothers and all friends to stand by us at this fateful moment, to back us in the building of our state as it is a Pan-Arab objective, and to firmly establish a just and comprehensive peace in our area, with all the consequences this will have on the entire Arab situation. We call for mutual assistance and solidarity in order to underpin the joint Arab position in the clash of civilizations in the area. We in Fatah have waged our sincere and loyal struggle and our solid realistic practices for many years. Throughout the long dialogue with our brothers in the other factions -- even before their emergence -- it has taken us a long time to convince them of our work and what we are struggling for. We are now facing the political battle and creating a new policy in the area in the shadow of the new international order, the facts and [?settings] of which rule the entire area. We are confident that our dialogue with all brothers is to clarify positions, facts, and variables, and to teach everyone of their national and Pan-Arab responsibilities, as we did during the jihad and the armed struggle after the great achievement at the eternal al-Karamah battle, during which the Fatah Movement offered the best of its youth and cadres. We are facing a new era that is taking shape on the ground and requires every effort and perseverance from everyone. It requires from us -- after realization of the beginning of the return with the arrival of the Palestinian security forces in the homeland -- the rebuilding of the homeland, the infrastructure, and the creation of work opportunities for our struggling masses. One of the main points of strength on which we depend is the strength of the starting point -- the revolution -- its achievements and influence on world opinion, the effectiveness of the blessed Intifadhah, the determination of our Palestinian people inside the occupied homeland and outside to accomplish their national objectives, their adherence to unity and cohesion, and denying the enemies all chances of creating division and conflicts within their ranks, and attempts to create alternatives to their leadership. These points of strength will themselves firmly establish the Palestinian people on the map of the Middle East and the world. However, this by far falls short of their ambitions or rights and below the requirements of justice. However, it is the beginning from which we start to work toward the elimination of the Zionist occupation of our land and to realize our legitimate rights, according to the resolutions of the United Nations. The clash between cultures and the competition between civilizations is a legitimate matter, and it is the real test for our relations with Israel. We can score some points in this area. The world is going through a phase which totally rejects the policy of no peace, no war. We, as a movement, are required to take our people out of the tunnel of the Cold War in order to establish them on the political and geographic map of the region and the world. The phase of moving to a homeland requires a definition of the bases and the concept of this move, and of Fatah's role in the phase which would follow the move to the homeland. It also requires a definition of Fatah's view of the principles and provisions of carrying out national duties in order to build a Palestinian state and a Palestinian society within the history and civilization of the Palestinian people. This course is based on its affiliation spiritually, nationally, and organically to its Arab nation, and on its just rights to a homeland and free choices of its right to return and to self-determination. The Fatah Movement values the great stand taken by the Egyptian president, Government, and people in supporting the peace process and hosting the talks on its territory. Fatah also appreciates the stand of the brotherly Jordanian king, Government, and people, marked by their persistent support for the Palestinian issues, the latest of which was facilitating the crossing of our forces to our dear land. Also, the stand of the brothers in the Gulf, at the forefront of whom are the brothers in Saudi Arabia, led by His Majesty King Fahd, custodian of the two holy places, who are transporting our forces from where they are stationed to the homeland. In addition, there is also the stand of the brothers in Algeria, Libya, Sudan, Iraq, Mauritania, Lebanon, and Syria, who are hosting their Palestinian brothers. We also send salutations to the sincere brotherly stand of fraternal Tunisia and its president Zine El Abidine, Zine El Arab [as heard], its government, and its fraternal people, for providing all requirements of success for the work and activity of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and its institutions, and for its strong support to the Palestinian positions in the peace process. [passage omitted] We besiege God to guide our steps on the road to building our independent state on our national soil. It is a revolution until victory.
