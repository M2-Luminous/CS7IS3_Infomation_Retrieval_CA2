FR940810-2-00059 FR940810-2-00035 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Public Information Collection Approved by Office of Management and Budget The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has received Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for the following public information collection pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96&hyph;511. For further information contact Shoko B. Hair, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 418&hyph;1379. Federal Communications Commission OMB Control No.: 3060&hyph;0599 Title: Implementation of Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act, GN Docket No. 93&hyph;252, Second Report and Order. Expiration Date: 04/30/97 Estimated Annual Burden: 2150 total hours; 1.66 hours per response; 1295 respondents. Description: In the Second Report and Order issued in GN Docket No. 93&hyph;252, the Commission adopted rules to implement Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by Section 6000(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The new rules adopted: (1) interpret the elements that define the terms ``commercial mobile radio service (CMRS)'' and ``private mobile radio service (PMRS);'' (2) based on these definitions, determine the regulatory status of existing mobile services and of personal communications services (PCS); (3) address the degree to which those services that will be classified as CMRS will be subject to regulation under Title II of the Act; and (4) address the other issues, including interconnection rights and preemption of state regulatory authority over mobile service providers. Traditional private carriers now reclassified as commercial mobile radio services providers will be subject to certain Title II provisions. The statute preempts state regulation of entry and rates for both CMRS and PMRS providers. States may petition the Commission for authority to regulate CMRS rates under some circumstances. The information collected as a result of this rulemaking will create regulatory symmetry among similar mobile services. This symmetrical regulatory structure will promote competition in the mobile services marketplace and will serve the interests of consumers while also benefitting the national economy. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19492 Filed 8&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;01&hyph;M
