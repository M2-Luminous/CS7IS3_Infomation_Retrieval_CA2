This conference failed because: 1. No country promised to provide aid to the two-headed government; 2. Only the United States, Japan, and Australia pledged to provide some aid. [sentence as heard] The two-headed government is not very hopeful that a significant amount of money is forthcoming even from these pledges. At the previous Tokyo conference, these countries also made promises. In concrete terms, the money came in trickles. Many countries and international organization at the meeting proposed that peace and security be established first for their aid to be efficient. These countries made this proposal not believing that the two-headed government can carry out what they have proposed. 1. Who can the two-headed government convince about economic rehabilitation and Cambodia's reconstruction if its mouth talks about national reconstruction while its hands are constantly fueling the war of communist Vietnam? 2. How can national reconstruction take place when the government is so corrupt? What country, apart from bad elements in the alliance, is going to throw money into a bottomless pit? These are the major reasons that cause the failure of the Tokyo conference.
