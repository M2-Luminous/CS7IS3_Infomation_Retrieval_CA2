We wanted to publish the summaries according to an alphabetical order, but the answer of the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] arrived yesterday after the press deadline, so we will publish their short program in our next issue. Questions: 1. What are the three major political, economic, social, or welfare tasks facing the governing forces in the next four years, tasks that your party accepts and will give preference to even at the cost of other problems? 2. What are the three larger-than-average economic, political, social, or moral burdens facing the society or some strata of the society in the next four years, burdens connected with or independent of the aforementioned tasks that you do not accept or accept only partially, and which you force into the background compared with other similar problems? Agrarian Alliance 1. Preparing the agricultural sector for the role of governing, the agricultural program is the most developed part of our party's program, and its title also expresses the essence of our conviction: The crisis that emerged in the agricultural sector requires the reorganization of agriculture. Our party places agriculture in first place among the sectors capable of accelerating our national economy. Our main goal is to put an immediate end to the crisis and to create legal and income security for agricultural producers. For this, we want to raise our agricultural concept to the level of a government program that enjoys a broad parliamentary support, and thus create guarantees for the supply of budget resources necessary for the implementation of the national agricultural program. It is clear for the Agrarian Alliance that agriculture should play a lasting stabilizing role in Hungary in an economic policy that asserts this country's interests well, and agriculture should have a greater national economic weight in our Gross Domestic Product [GDP], exports, and employment, compared with the more developed countries. Modernization also contains the requirement that Hungary should develop proportionally and the level of development of various parts of the country and types of settlements should be balanced. If the current trends continues, there will be a danger of increased territorial inequality and social division. This will appear not only in the confrontation between towns and villages and between the capital city and the provinces, but also in the increasing differences in the people's life expectations, quality of life, and social situation. The universal realization of the fact that the development of intellectual resources -- education and scientific research -- is the most profitable investment must be raised to the level of government policy. The level of extent of these resources determines today the level of economic development and the possibilities of participation in the international integration. At the same time, investments aimed at increasing the intellectual capital are directly connected with the bourgeois transformation of society. 2. The situation is obviously sensitive: One has to speak of forcing important issues into the background on the eve of parliamentary elections. Among the various possible issues, we mention first the fact that, no matter how justified it is to increase the professional level in the ministries and government offices, we would not be able to pay for really good professionals in the future either, because, in the state administration, we will continue to be unable to compete with the income possibilities prevailing in the sphere of enterprises and private ventures. The development and modernization of Hungary's defense forces is an even bigger issue, and it requires considerable resources. At the same time, the budget will not enable an adequate increase in defense expenditure in the near future. And now an example from the world of culture. The construction of the new National Theater is a really important national issue that was decided long ago; however, it is highly improbable that the necessary budget can be allocated for this in the coming four years. United Smallholders' Party [EKGP] 1. The EKGP regards the following as partial measures of the three major tasks: -- irrigation development of up to 1 million hectares; -- a maximum interest level of 10 percent; -- industrial export subsidies of 7-8 billion forints annually and agricultural export subsidies of 30-35 billion forints annually; -- an encouraging tax system; -- an annual export volume of $8 billion and $4 billion respectively; -- a maximum annual global consumption quota of $200 million, without private cars; -- a maximum of $100-$150 million agricultural imports annually; -- an annual foreign trade surplus of $1.5-$2 billion; -- a maximum annual budget deficit of 100 billion forints; -- a streamlined army personnel, good technology, and state administration; -- the use of customs charges [vampotlek] (3-5 billion forints annually up to the year 2000); -- acceleration of investments with subsidies of 15 billion forints annually (industry-agriculture and price-interest). 2. "Burdens" connected to important things cannot be left "unsettled!" There can be only slight "burdens" connected to the aforementioned "key tasks" (burdens that can only enjoy less government interference and smaller financial resources); -- sports; -- film production; -- state finance for other arts; -- social support for inactive strata of the society (between 20 and 55 years of age); -- tax exemptions [adokimeles] for luxury and prestige consumption; -- government aid to unsuccessful banking or insurance activity. Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] 1. According to the Fidesz, the three major tasks of the coming four years are the following: the creation of jobs, educational reform, and the development of backward areas. The new government will have to face the fact that the using up of the future [jovofeleles] carried out by the governments in power in the past 10 years can no longer continue; in other words, it is impossible to accumulate the foreign and domestic debt continuously. If the credits are used to temporarily keep the level of social consumption high and not for increasing the economic performance, the Fidesz will not accept further increases in debts. Using up future resources primarily limits the living conditions of the young generation, because they are only left with repaying the interest on the debts accumulated by their predecessors, while they hardly have any share of the temporary higher consumption. Therefore, the most important task is to improve the economy's competitiveness, carry out investments aimed at creating new jobs, and conduct an economic policy that encourages saving. In addition, it is absolutely necessary to reform the system of budget redistribution and to come to a social consensus. The most important element of the latter is an agreement with the trade unions, an agreement that will make it possible to reduce inflation by at least 5 percent in one year. From the increased economic performance resulting from the aforementioned steps, greater resources than hitherto should be allocated to prevent the final degradation of backward areas particularly affected by the crisis. 2. Although almost everyone in Hungary today feels that his living standard is lower than the one he deserves, one can nevertheless not promise an increase in the level of consumption in the short term. We only have a real chance to catch up with the developed countries if we first allocate more resources to investments that lay the foundations for a competitive performance. All this demands that social consumption should not increase according to our wishes. This is particularly true in the situation in which both our domestic budget balance and our international balance of payments show an unparalleled deficit. The new government will receive this situation as a starting inheritance. Only a few social groups will have the possibility to obtain greater resources than permitted by the overall economic performance through social redistribution. According to the Fidesz program, these are the young people and the young unemployed. We would support them with the increased development of education and through employment. In addition, we will pay particular attention to preserving the value of the pensions of people older than 70 and people living below the minimal wage level. Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP] 1. The illustrious figure of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], Mr. Lajos Fur, said the following: "The MDF succeeded in halting Hungary's fall. We stopped at the bottom of the pit." We can believe Mr. Fur. He should know. One can, at the most, argue about how deep this pit is. The above quotation is rather cynical, but essentially we must start from a factual conclusion. Our homeland is in mortal danger! Only firm, clear, and rapid measures can help. Concretely, we should immediately put an end to the squandering of this country's property. We must create the bases of a real constitutional state. The present government kept legislating innumerable laws, laws that often contradict each other and leave legal gaps. And their economic and financial consequences are not elaborated properly. Patchwork does not lead anywhere! When building a house, one should start at the base, not at the roof. In other words, we need a new constitution! We must determine the basic values of our society! Based on this, we must create a really pro-venture legal and economic environment that leads to economic progress. We must immediately reduce public burdens considerably in order to increase the interest of ventures and entrepreneurs. We must see to it that property relations are settled in a way acceptable to all. We must reexamine the handling of our debts, which has become almost unbearable. We must eliminate unemployment. In the previous development phase of market economy, as a result of spontaneous manipulations partially based on certain interests, unemployment was a real economic category. This is something antiquated today, and it is unacceptable for us. Young people should receive housing, jobs, opportunities to study, and prospects, and elderly citizens should receive an honest subsistence. We must carry out these tasks in a rather short time, and not in the distant and foggy future. The Hungarian people should get their confidence back, a confidence that the previous governments that openly served the Russian interests and the recent post-communist government tried to rob in the past decades. We can count in months, or years at the most. The people's patience is limited! This country is in mortal danger! We must act accordingly. The FKGP has detailed programs based on exact evaluations. 2. The people were promised democracy! In reality, a monolithic power based on a hidden pact policy is increasingly emerging with an arrogance exceeding that of the previous dictatorship. Hungary's economy, culture, and society are deteriorating rapidly. From a consistent evaluation of this process, we can draw the conclusion that we are not only talking about an unbelievable dilettantism here, but also about a deliberate destruction of this country. And all this is taking place in a way as if there were democracy here. In other words, they try to blame democracy for the infamy carried out against the Hungarian people. The FKGP wants to stop the ravages of this government. The FKGP accepts the implementation of this task and it takes upon itself to return the confidence of this nation. It is obvious that one cannot disregard certain groups of social tasks in a society that is at the bottom of the pit. It is particularly impossible to disregard the fact that they want to break the faith of the Hungarian people in order to make them helpless and slaves. Naturally, there can be priorities in economic life. Driving sectors are needed, but the basic conditions of development should be created in all areas of society. This is the historic task of the FKGP today. Republic Party 1-2. The program of the Republic Party outlines three major tasks. The consolidation and subsequent stabilization of the economy presupposes the reduction of inflation. For the economic conditions to improve and become attractive for domestic and foreign investors, and for the living conditions and quality of life of the population to improve, there is a need to develop the infrastructure more rapidly than the average development. Along with this, unemployment should be reduced to an acceptable level, unemployment that causes one of the biggest shocks to Hungarian society. Obviously, this needs a different economic policy based on a new type of distribution of the domestic income (one that will not increase after the change in the government either). Consequently, along with a gradual reorganization of the tax system and the reduction of tax burdens, we can no longer delay the reform of the large distribution systems, the budget, and state management either. However, it is also clear that the implementation of the aforementioned major goals and the restoration of our domestic and foreign economic balance is a long-term task and requires certain deliberate compromises. According to well-founded evaluations, a complete elimination of unemployment along with a consistent implementation of an anti-inflationary policy is not a realistic goal. Therefore, we will have to live with an unemployment rate of about 5-5.5 percent in the coming years. If we tried to force unemployment under the aforementioned level, it would become impossible to reduce inflation. At the same time, the planned reduction of the unemployment rate limits the reduction of inflation. Thus, we can expect a lasting period of 10-15 percent inflation in the coming years. However, with such an inflation rate, there are realistic opportunities for settling and accelerating the economy. On the other hand, it is necessary to considerable reduce over- distribution and the budget deficit. One can see today that we can only achieve economic consolidation, a venture-friendly economic environment, a better welfare network, and an improvement in the situation of pensioners (protecting the real value of pensions) if the budget deficit in the coming years is not lower or higher than 5 percent of the GDP. With such a budget deficit, the international evaluation of the Hungarian economy can be lastingly positive, there will be no need to withdraw capital worth 150-190 billion forints from the economy, and this surplus income can contribute to the implementation of our development goals.
