Yeh Chin-feng, vice chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC], said the council agreed to the mainland visit only after the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) Friday [29 April] notified its Taiwan counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) that foundation personnel will be permitted to visit the boat where the murders occurred. Victims' relatives were barred from boarding the pleasure boat when they were in the mainland earlier this month, a move which was seen as an attempt by the mainland to cover up details of the crime. Yeh quoted ARATS as saying that SEF personnel will also be given an oral report on autopsies performed after the crime, apparently a compromise to Taiwan's demand for a written report. The group will include law and crime experts, Yeh said, but she declined to say whether active-duty police officers will be part of the entourage. Mainland authorities have arrested three suspects in the murders but failed to clear up some remaining questions surrounding the case. SEF and ARATS are authorized by their respective governments to handle private exchanges in the absence of official contacts.
