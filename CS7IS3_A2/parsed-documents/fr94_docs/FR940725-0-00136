FR940725-0-00136 FR940725-0-00019 Paragraph (c)(2) of §1910.146 requires general industry employers to post signs or use other effective means of informing employees about the existence and location of and the danger posed by permit spaces; paragraphs (c)(3) and (d)(1) require general industry employers to take measures to prevent unauthorized entry into permit spaces; and paragraph (i)(8) requires attendants to take measures to keep unauthorized persons out of permit spaces. The notice reopening the record requested comments on whether or not shipyard employers should be required to take measures, such as those proposed in §1910.146, to prevent unauthorized entry into work areas covered by Subpart B. The commenters agreed that the systems being employed by the shipyard industry have been effective at preventing unauthorized access under the previous Subpart B (Ex. 11&hyph;3, 11&hyph;6, 11&hyph;7, 11&hyph;10, 11&hyph;11, 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;14, 11&hyph;15, 11&hyph;18, 11&hyph;19, 11&hyph;20, 11&hyph;24, 11&hyph;25, 11&hyph;26, 11&hyph;31, 11&hyph;32, 11&hyph;39, 11&hyph;41, 11&hyph;42, 11&hyph;43, 11&hyph;44, 11&hyph;45, 11&hyph;49, 11&hyph;50). They contended that all spaces are made safe before entry and that the posting and training requirements proposed in Subpart B and outlined in the notice reopening the record would keep employees from entering unsafe areas. The Jonathan Corporation (Ex. 11&hyph;18) presented these arguments as follows: As a result of routine training, our employees are cognizant of the fact that only spaces which have been tested and posted as being SAFE FOR WORKERS are cleared for entry. This system has served our company very well. This proposal does not recognize our daily involvement with confined spaces. Mr. Joseph J. Ocken (Ex. 11&hyph;31) agreed, stating: Any expectation that every confined space (or enclosed space presenting confined space hazards) will somehow be properly barricaded courts disaster. My Coast Guard training emphasizes a straight forward safe work practice: ANY SPACE presenting confined space hazards must be RECENTLY tested by THOROUGHLY trained and equipped individuals and have appropriate ENGINEERING CONTROLS applied BEFORE ENTRY. Any other space, REGARDLESS OF BARRIERS, is treated as UNSAFE. OSHA concurs with these comments. The revised Subpart B protects employees from ``unauthorized'' entry through the use of several protective techniques. First, §1915.12(d) requires employees to be trained to recognize the characteristics of confined spaces and the hazards involved. They are also required to be trained to perform their duties safely (§1915.12(d)) and to understand all warning signs and labels (§1915.16(a)). Second, confined spaces and spaces containing dangerous atmospheres must be tested and found safe before entry under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of §1915.12. Third, under these same paragraphs, spaces found not to be safe for entry are labeled ``Not Safe for Workers''. Under the unique conditions of shipyard employment, these measures are effective at preventing unauthorized employees from entering spaces containing dangerous atmospheres. To illustrate, when a space is marked ``Not Safe for Workers,'' the only authorized entrants are those who are entering for emergencies or for short durations to accomplish ventilation to make the space safe. It is not until the space is retested and certified as ``Safe for Workers'' that employees are allowed to do work in the space. Under the general industry standard, only a confined space containing a hazard that may expose an employee to the risk of death, incapacitation, or impairment of ability to self-rescue is deemed to be a permit space, requiring the adoption of the protective measures set out in §1910.146. The general industry standard addresses hazards that are exacerbated by the lack of adequate means of access and egress and by the enclosing nature of the space. By contrast, Subpart B treats all confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres that could present an atmospheric hazard as having this potential, and requires protective measures before entry takes place. In the shipyard context, this approach provides an effective means of protecting employees who must enter confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres. Section 1910.146 also requires employers to consider non-atmospheric hazards, such as engulfment and internal configuration of the space, in determining whether or not a confined space is a permit space. The proposed revision of Subpart B did not address non-atmospheric issues. Because OSHA was considering the expansion of Subpart B to land-side confined spaces in lieu of applying §1910.146, the notice reopening the record requested comments on whether or not Subpart B, as expanded, would adequately address non-atmospheric hazards that may be encountered in confined space work (Specific Issue B&hyph;1, Question J). The vast majority of commenters agreed that Subpart B, in combination with other requirements in part 1915, adequately protected employees (Ex. 11&hyph;2, 11&hyph;3, 11&hyph;6, 11&hyph;9, 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;14, 11&hyph;15, 11&hyph;18, 11&hyph;19, 11&hyph;20, 11&hyph;24, 11&hyph;25, 11&hyph;26, 11&hyph;28, 11&hyph;29, 11&hyph;30, 11&hyph;31, 11&hyph;35, 11&hyph;37, 11&hyph;39, 11&hyph;40, 11&hyph;41, 11&hyph;45, 11&hyph;47, 11&hyph;49, 11&hyph;50). These commenters contended that non-atmospheric hazards are readily identified, are covered by other part 1915 standards, and are the responsibility of line supervisors and employees. The statement of Ingalls Shipbuilding (Ex. 11&hyph;30) was typical of these comments: Ingalls believes that such non-atmospheric hazards are adequately addressed by their current respective standards. Ingalls further believes the foreman or supervisor of the workers is responsible for the above listed non-atmospheric hazards. Subsequent to an ’inspection by the competent person, non-atmospheric hazards may develop as a result of ongoing work (for example, a welder installing his welding leads which create a tripping hazard). The foreman or supervisor is responsible for the health and safety of his employees and for the actions of his employees on a continual basis throughout the workday. Non-atmospheric hazards are obvious without the need for special instrumentation, whereas, the tests performed by the competent person are used to detect unseen atmospheric hazards using specialized instrumentation. The Department of the Navy (Ex. 11&hyph;30) noted that while Subpart B does not address non-atmospheric hazards, it should not be amended to address such hazards:
