FR940325-1-00005 FR940325-1-00003 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Part 101 [Docket No. 90N&hyph;0134] RIN 0905&hyph;AD08 Food Labeling: Reference Daily Intakes; Reopening of Comment Period and Correction AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Proposed rule; reopening of comment period and correction. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reopening until April 25, 1994, the comment period on a proposed rule to establish Reference Daily Intakes (RDI's) for vitamin K, selenium, chloride, manganese, fluoride, chromium, and molybdenum for use in declaring the nutrient content of a food on its label or labeling; to change the units of measure for biotin, folate, calcium, and phosphorus; and to make consideration of selenium, molybdenum, fluoride, and chromium optional when determining nutritional inferiority, which appeared in the Federal Register of January 4, 1994 (59 FR 427). FDA is taking this action because of an inadvertent error in the document on the date on which comments were due. In addition, the document was published with some editorial errors. This document corrects those errors. DATES: The comment period is reopened until April 25, 1994. The agency is proposing that any final rule that may issue based on this proposal become effective 30 days after date of publication of that final rule. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Camille E. Brewer, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS&hyph;165), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202&hyph;205&hyph;5483. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of January 4, 1994 (59 FR 427), FDA issued a proposed rule to amend the food labeling regulations to establish Reference Daily Intakes (RDI's) for vitamin K, selenium, chloride, manganese, fluoride, chromium, and molybdenum for use in declaring the nutrient content of a food on its label or labeling; to change the units of measure for biotin, folate, calcium, and phosphorus; and to make consideration of selenium, molybdenum, fluoride, and chromium optional when determining nutritional inferiority. Because of an inadvertent error, the proposed rule specified two dates for the close of the comment period. On page 427, in the ``DATES'' section of the document, FDA listed March 7, 1994, as the close of the comment period. On page 431, in the ``COMMENTS'' section, however, the document incorrectly stated that July 7, 1994, would be the close of the comment period. The agency's intent was to give the normal 60 days for comment; that is, to close the comment period on March 7, 1994. However, because of this error, the agency's intent was obviously obscured. As a result, there may be interested persons who have not yet sent in their comments even though March 7, 1994 has passed. Therefore, to ensure that all interested parties have an opportunity to comment, FDA is reopening the comment period for an additional 30 days. Comments must be received no later than April 25, 1994. In addition, the agency discovered some editorial errors in the document. This document corrects these errors. In FR Doc. 93&hyph;31816, appearing on page 427 in the Federal Register of Tuesday, January 4, 1994, the following corrections are made: 1. On page 430, in the second column, in the 4th full paragraph, in the last line, the words ``being an'' are corrected to read ``being labeled''; and in the third column, in the third line from the bottom, ``section IV.C.1.'' is corrected to read ``section IV.B.''. 2. On page 431, in the first column, in the first full paragraph, in the second line, the date ``July 7, 1994'' is corrected to read ``March 7, 1994''. This date is, of course, being extended until April 25, 1994 by this correction document. Dated: March 17, 1994. Michael R. Taylor, Deputy Commissioner for Policy.
