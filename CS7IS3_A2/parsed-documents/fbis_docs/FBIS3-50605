Some of the figures released by the UADE register almost triple the 53 percent inflation measured by the government since the convertibility plan was introduced in April 1991. Rents have gone up by a staggering 157.2 percent while doctors and dentists have increased their fees by up to 137 percent. Hairdressers were not far behind as their rates have bounded skyward, bringing them up to 103 percent higher. According to the UADE report domestic help has kept pace with this upward surge and is now an average 99.9 percent more expensive. Most people, with their wages seemingly stuck to a very low floor, have been amazed to see the cost of entertainment bubble up and up. A ticket to a football match now costs 92 percent more than nearly three years ago, as do cinemas and theaters. Also hitting the wage earner's pocket has been the cost of the midday meal, which has gone up by a belt-tightening 77 percent since convertibility began. Transport would appear to be the only service whose prices have gone up less than official amount for accumulated inflation. Short distance bus fares have increased 40 percent while the cost of a ticket on a commuter train has gone up by only 23 percent. The UADE points out that the price rises in the last 12 months have caused a drop in the industrial worker's purchasing power in most areas. Widespread clothing imports have made refurbishing ones wardrobe one of the few good deals around. Purchasing power in terms of clothing has improved by 10 percent.
