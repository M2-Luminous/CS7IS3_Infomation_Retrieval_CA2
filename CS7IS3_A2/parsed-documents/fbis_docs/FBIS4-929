Elias] [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- There will be no mass action by the Witwatersrand branch of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] Youth Brigade in central Johannesburg until after the election, Branch Publicity Secretary Mandlakayise Magubane said on Tuesday [19 April] night. Speaking after a meeting of the group's leaders in Johannesburg, he said the organisation would now dedicate itself to campaigning for the election "right up to the last minute". "Although we are not happy with the fact that the poll date will not be postponed, we are going to do our best to win the election," he said. He appealed to all former IFP supporters who had joined other political parties "just so they could take part in the voting process" to come back into the IFP fold. Businessmen and workers in central Johannesburg have been concerned since last week that there would be an IFP march though the centre of Johannesburg coupled with stayaways threatened by the Youth Brigade. "We have stopped all rolling mass action to concentrate on the election," Mr Magubane said.
