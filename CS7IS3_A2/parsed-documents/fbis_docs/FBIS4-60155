Reports indicate that Zionist forces kidnapped al-Dirani from his residence in eastern Lebanon early Saturday and took him away to the occupied terrritories. In its editorial, the Persian daily `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' termed the act as the most explicit form of state terrorism displaying the inhuman nature of the Zionist regime once again. However, said the daily, such crimes by the Zionists have always been connived and even supported by the west and international community thus encouraging the criminals to further expand such heinous actions. All evidences indicate that what has happened and is happening in Lebanon is precisely a planned conspiracy, said the editorial adding, "the Lebanese government on the one hand disarms the anti-Israeli forces and renders them defenseless against the aggressions of the occupiers and on the other leaves the Zionists free to intrude the Lebanese territory". The daily considered it possible that the Zionist regime carried out its operation in coordination with Maronite communities and the so-called security forces of Lebanon. Under the circumstances, said the paper, no one is secure even in his own house as long as the occupying Zionists continue their heinous actions with impunity. The final solution is, therefore, the elimination of the Zionist regime, it added. The paper also said that the events of the past few months cast doubt on the sincerity of the Lebanese officials towards the resistance of southern Lebanon notwithstanding their occasional support. The contemporary history of Lebanon has taught the people that they can defeat the brutal Zionists in their land if they keep an eye on the infiltrated mercenaries of Tel Aviv in every corner of the country. The editorial stressed that fighting against the occupiers is not possible without identifying lackeys. Commenting on the same subject, another Persian daily `ABRAR' criticized international bodies for keeping mum towards the abduction saying that they did not even condemn the explicit Zionist encroachment upon the Lebanese sovereignty. It said that the advantages the Zionost regime reaped from this operation and its ensuing propaganda against Iran and other progressive Muslim and nationalist forces in the Middle East deserve contemplation. The paper stressed that the Americans seemingly have no problem in mending fences even with some of the anti-Zionist and Muslim forces in the region. However, this is not the case with Iran, it added. The editorial warned that if Damascus joins the reconciliation trend of the so-called peace talks in the Middle East, the western mass media and certain regional governments will launch a propaganda to label Iran as a country who endangers the security of the region. Washington envisages that Iran would take a passive stance vis-a-vis the developments in the Middle East once Damascus joins the reconciliation trend, wrote the paper. The daily called for the mobilization of all diplomatic potentials to avoid landing in such a situation and called for adopting a strategy based on national security and interests. The English daily `TEHRAN TIMES' referred to the statements made by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin that the kidnapping had been carried out under the direct supervision of his government and asked what powers are behind the terrorist regime whose chief of government shamelessly proclaim he had issued orders for the operation. "The most interesting aspect of the situation, if it is at all possible to find an interesting aspect in this criminal act, is the new definitions the western statesmen offer for some of the political terms, and then use the vast network of the mass media they have at their disposal to publicise those illogical definitions." According to the new political terminology devised by the Americans, said the paper, a nation that is fighting for the freedom of its land is a terrorist nation, whereas a government that openly occupies territories from other nations and kidnaps people is an anti-terrorist government. "The Zionist regime's justifications for engaging in terrorist acts is indicative of its irrational aggressive attitude," stressed the editorial. Turning to the Zionist regime's claims that Arad was captured when his plane was downed in southern lebanon during a bombardment mission, it said that Hizballah should put the airman on trial as a war criminal and punish him indeed if they have him in their captivity. "The trial of this war criminal will be a good lesson for other Israeli pilots who commit the inhuman act of slaughtering women and children in southern Lebanon," concluded the daily.
