Cf. early brief report in JPRS-CST-94-001, 24 Jan 94 p 31] [Abstract] The first domestic development of a utilitarian EDFA module prototype using two domestically made 25-mW, 1480-nm-wavelength LDs as pump sources and Er[.sup]3+[/]/Al[.sup]3+[/] co-doped optical fiber is reported. This module has a net gain at 1550 nm of 27 dB, a saturated output power of 0 dBm, a maximum output power of 7 dBm, an optical bandwidth greater than 20 nm, and a noise figure less than 7 dB--values comparable to early-9Os international standards as published in references 3-4. This module, jointly developed by Qinghua University, the CAS Institute of Semiconductors, the 863 Optoelectronics Fabrication Center, Wuhan Institute of Posts & Telecommunications Science, and MEI's Institute 46, is designed for 4 x 622 Mbps WDM or TDM (time-division multiplexing) fiber optic transmission systems and optical soliton transmission systems. Figures 1-4, not reproduced, show the following: a schematic of the EDFA module, consisting of a fiber coupler, an isolator, the first pump LD, a WDM unit, a control circuit, a power supply, the Er-doped fiber, the second pump LD, another WDM coupler, another isolator, and another fiber coupler; graphs of EDFA module gain characteristics (plots of gain vs signal input for both forward pumping and bidirectional pumping); a graph of EDFA module power characteristics (plot of output power vs input power); and a graph of EDFA module bandwidth characteristics (plot of net gain vs signal wavelength), respectively. There are no tables. References: 1. Peng Jiangde et al., GAO JISHU TONGXUN [HIGH TECHNOLOGY LETTERS], 1992, 2(12):10. 2. Peng Jiangde et al., GAO JISHU TONGXUN, 1991, 1(10):1. 3.
