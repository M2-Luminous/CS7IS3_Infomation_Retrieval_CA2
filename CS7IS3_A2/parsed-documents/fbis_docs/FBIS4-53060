The association will call on ministries and agencies in charge to review the ordering system and bidding procedures so as to facilitate foreign-affiliated makers' participation in public works projects in the telecommunications sector. It will also collect information on public works projects and provide it to its members. The U.S. Government and other organs have made more active moves to seek expansion of the government procurement of supercomputers as well as the importation of foreign-made information equipment, including cellular phones. Under such circumstances, the association aims to become a "lobbying body" to promote business with Japan. The new organization expected to be established will be (tentatively) named the "Association for the Promotion of Telecommunications Equipment Import." The members are expected to include foreign-affiliated computer makers and software development companies, system houses, and trading firms engaged in the importation of information equipment. Among major companies that will be invited to participate are: Electronic Data Systems (EDS), the Rikei Company [name as published], IBM Japan, Microsoft Company, Motorola Company, Nihon Unisys Ltd., Nihon Digital Equipment Company, and Sumitomo Co. The preparatory committee (with Takefumi Kanoya serving as chief of the secretariat) has been proceeding with the selection of executives and the association is expected to be formed as early as May. Several special committees such as the "Council for Reforming Public Works Project Ordering System" will be formed under this association. Through these committees, the association plans to collect information on government-planned projects and make recommendations on how to promote telecommunications by setting up a desirable public system and on how to revise the ordering system.
