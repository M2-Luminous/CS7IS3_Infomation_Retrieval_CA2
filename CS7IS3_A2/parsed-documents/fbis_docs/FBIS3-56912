The program features platforms presented by the Democratic Party of Ukraine [Demokratychna Partiya Ukrayiny] and the People's Movement of Ukraine [Narodnyy Rukh Ukrayiny], also known as Rukh. The announcer says each party has been given a 10-minute slot on this evening's program during which each party can presents its views. The Democratic Party of Ukraine begins its slot with a brief video recording. Party chairman Volodymyr Yavorivskyy then takes the floor in the TV studio, naming some party members, and saying that the Democratic Party was born not out of its leaders' ambitions but out of a reality of building a Ukrainian state. According to sociological polls, Yavorivskyy says, the party occupies first place in Ukraine. He says his party is not looking for enemies, preferring to use the word "opponents." Yavorivskyy says people are fed up with the statutes and programs of different parties. The Democratic Party is not looking for someone to blame, he says, but for a way out of the complex situation that has arisen. He says the main cause of the current difficulties was that nothing was done with reforms after independence. A reform of the authorities, he says, should have been the first step after independence. But the same weak and irresolute authorities remain, he says. Yavorivsky favors the law proposed at today's conference of local representatives. In accordance with the law, elections would be held for local leaders who would then bear responsibility for their actions. He goes on to say that the issue of reducing the army should be resolved wisely, adding that servicemen cannot just be thrown onto the street. He proposes that those leaving the army voluntarily could be given a double privatization package and that construction detachments be formed to speedily build accommodation for them. But the main thing is economic reforms, Yavorivskyy says. He and his party are against shock therapy, because people are already exhausted. It is necessary, however, to advance toward reform. He adds he is convinced people are ready for economic reforms. He says society has been polarized into rich and poor, and that a middle class should be created. The Democratic Party's slot finishes with another brief video recording. The entire Rukh slot is taken up by a video recording featuring Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil. Chornovil starts by saying he believes viewers are fed up with traditional election broadcasts from the studio, finding it hard to tell the difference between the programs of various parties and having little faith in them either. He believes the reason for it all is to show that Ukraine has a multi-party system. But this is not so, he says, because of the anti-party nature of the law. If there were a proportional or mixed electoral system, he says, it would be different -- fewer parties and one clear winner, which would assume full responsibility for what occurs in Ukraine. He goes on to say Rukh stands for fundamental political reforms. He mentions today's conference of local representatives, adding that the main elements of the draft law discussed at the conference have been taken from Rukh's program: elections of leaders at all levels, eliminating the post of presidential representative, the president being head of state and not head of the government, with all branches of power being clearly delimited. He goes on to say that the judicial system needs to be reformed because it is deeply corrupt, turning a blind eye to the deeds of the Communist nomenclature. It is necessary, he says, to bring order to the country's finances and put an end to the bedlam. If this were done, pensioners, disabled people, and mothers with many children could be paid twice as much, he says. Reforms should begin immediately. Chornovil refutes the accusation that democrats conducting reforms have put the country in the situation it is in now, saying democrats have not been in power to do so. Ukraine is traditionally an agricultural state, he says, and therefore it is necessary to start with agrarian reforms. But as the nomenclature has acquired land illegally, it is necessary to return what has been acquired illegally so that conditions are equal before beginning extensive privatization. Rukh pays special attention in its program to social protection. He says the Communists pose as the greatest protectors of the people, but it is they who brought about the situation in the first place. Rukh is for assistance directed to where it is most needed, Chornovil says, but it's not for everyone. If privatization and land reform are conducted, Rukh proposes to carry out monetary reform with the introduction of the hryvna. But if the hryvna were to be introduced now, it would share the same fate as the coupon and be dead within a few months. It is necessary to demonopolize extensively, he says. Then there will be true market prices, considerably lower ones than now. Chornovil concludes by saying Rukh is the greatest political force in Ukraine today. If the viewers support it and it gets at least 25 percent of the seats in parliament, then other reformist forces there could unite around the basis of this foundation and a government of national confidence could be formed. He asks viewers to vote for Rukh candidates, adding "we won't let you down."
