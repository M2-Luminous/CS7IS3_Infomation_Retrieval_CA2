Since 1983, Chinese cities have saved using 13.9 billion cubic meters of water altogether. The ratio of recycled water used has increased from less than 20 percent in 1983 to 60 percent. China economizes to save using 1.39 billion cubic meters of water annually, equal to building seven water-works with a capacity of 500,000 cubic meters. Economizing on water obviously helps to protect China's water resources and city environments, he pointed out. Waste water which had to be disposed of has decreased by 1.1 billion cubic meters every year through the save-water drive. Shanghai, Tianjin, Ningbo and other cities have improved their control of earth subsidence by stronger management of utilization of ground-water resources. China also saves 6.95 billion kwh of electricity every year by cutting water-use, Ye said. China has 2,800 billion cubic meters of water resources, the sixth greatest in the world. But each Chinese citizen only has 2,440 cubic meters, a quarter of the world average, due to China's large population of more than 1.1 billion. Figures from the provinces so far available in Beijing show that by the end of 1993, there was water shortage in about 300 cities out of China's total of 570 cities. To make people conscious of the importance of keeping water-use down, China has set aside the second week in June every year as a period for special publicity on saving water, ye said. He added that the government has set up a special organization in the Ministry of Construction and branches in most of the cities to coordinate water-saving efforts.
