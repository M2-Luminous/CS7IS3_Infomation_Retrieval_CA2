Ciller addressed her party's assembly group meeting today. In her statement, Ciller reported that the organization's balance has been totally upset as a result of the blows dealt to the bandits both inside and outside the country in a planned, systematic, and determined manner. The initiative has been placed in the hands of the state forces at every point, Ciller announced, stressing that the separatists, who suffered a significant loss of personnel, are in a state of moral collapse. Under these circumstances, Ciller explained, there has been a 300 percent increase in the number of terrorists fleeing the organization or surrendering to the security forces of their own free will. She remarked that the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] has totally lost the people's support and is therefore trying to recruit militants by the use of force and violence. Pointing out that the terrorists are trying not to engage in large-scale clashes with the security forces that will result in heavy losses, the prime minister said that it was learned that heavy pressure is being applied and horrible executions are taking place within the organization in a bid to prevent desertions. Ciller revealed that the terrorist organization's logistics support and warehouses of provisions have largely been destroyed. Ciller announced that the developments in northern Iraq, which are very important for Turkey's national security, are also being followed carefully. All necessary steps and measures are being taken to prevent events from taking a turn that may threaten Turkey's interests, Ciller stated. Noting that there is full agreement and cooperation with Iran concerning the antiterror struggle, the prime minister disclosed that there are signs that certain neighboring countries are still supporting terrorism. [Begin Ciller recording] I want to clearly say the following to them: You reap what you sow. I especially recommend that they learn this Turkish proverb. Furthermore, I remind them that such behavior does not comply with the concept of a serious and honorable state. [end recording] In the 270 terrorist incidents that occurred over the past two weeks, Ciller explained, 314 terrorists were killed and 122 terrorists were caught, while only 50 members of the security forces were martyred. She underlined that it is evident that the past 10-month period yielded more effective results than the past 10 years. Ciller explained that the bandits urged innocent Kurdish-origin citizens to immigrate to northern Iraq by the use of force and various lies and they now wish to use this as a means of propaganda against Turkey at the United Nations and in world public opinion. In this way, Ciller noted, the bandits are trying to bring foreign political pressure to stop the operations in the region and to secure safe havens for themselves. The prime minister announced that the PKK, which is beginning to crumble inside the country, has adopted the strategy pursued by ASALA [Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] in the past, of dragging the struggle into the international arena and onto a human rights level. Ciller recalled, however, that all the citizens in Turkey are equal and this is guaranteed by the Constitution and the laws. Pointing out that the citizens, who were forced at gunpoint to immigrate to northern Iraq, are now hungry and destitute, Ciller continued: [Begin Ciller recording] I am calling on these citizens not be instrumental in the plots of the terrorist organization, not to succumb to it, and to immediately return to their motherland and homes. I hope that everyone will note and understand that the terrorists' real goals are not related to the interests of the regional population and that the organization itself is a tool in the hands of known foreign centers. A large group of youths -- mostly mere children -- who have been instigated into undertaking terrorist acts against their state and who have been driven to the mountains by a handful of traitors -- who are leading a safe and luxurious life abroad -- are not actually aware of who and what goal they are serving. I would like to remind them once again that they have only two options and no other ways out. I say to them: Come and surrender to the compassionate hands of the state. We will treat you with the compassion of a state and a mother. You either opt for this alternative, or we will end up with youths who will die in security force operations with the stamp of traitor on their foreheads. I genuinely feel the compassion and sorrow of a mother. I am again calling on all our youths. I am again appealing on all the mothers and fathers: Let us embrace our children. Let us together prevent them from pursuing a dead-end road. [end recording] Ciller emphasized that, as promised, this matter will definitely be concluded before 1995. She also reported that the National Security Council decision recommending the extension of the state of emergency -- currently in force in 10 provinces -- for another four months as of 19 July will be submitted to the Turkish Grand National Assembly after being assessed by the Council of Ministers.
