Over 70 students were rounded up and police said they will all be arrested. Tension escalated from early morning when estimated 700 students gathered at Seoul campuses to join the afternoon anti-UR rally. Students resorted to steel pipes and wood sticks as riot police blocked them from going into campuses where morning ceremonies were planned before the march to the rally site in the southern part of the capital. Demonstrators took 54 policemen hostage inside Hongik University campus [approximately 5 miles from the U.S. Embassy] and demanded an exchange with 20 collegians taken by police. Riot troopers stormed the campus building with tear gas and saved the hostages but hours of confrontations continued before the students tried to force their way out using firebombs. Rally pamphlets caught fire in the volley of firebombs and flame erupted at the student center but was put out in 25 minutes. Police said at least 160 people, including 110 of their men and 50 students were hurt and receiving hospital treatment. Paek Kwang-hae, a 21-year-old student, was reported to have suffered serious eye injury after being hit by a rock. Meanwhile, the anti-UR rally opened as scheduled at 3 PM with over 7,000 ralliers. "Down with Uruguay Round, repel Uruguay Round," protesters chanted. Seoul ended up opening its rice market despite President Kim's campaign pledge to keep it closed. The government is set to ratify the UR accord in August. Downtown traffic was paralyzed for throughout the afternoon as some 1,000 ralliers went ahead with its 5 km march.
