(F.M. Burlatskiy, A.A. Galkin. "The Modern Leviathan." Moscow: MYSL, 1985, p. 317). An accurate assessment of the correlation of forces, the ability to determine a precise position under adverse conditions, the ability to select proper allies and partners--may compensate to a certain degree for diminished economic potential and retarded dynamics of development. This is especially urgent for the Russia of today, which for certain reasons is undergoing one of the most critical periods of its history. In order to avoid failure and subjective defeats under such conditions, the foreign policy of the state must be equal to the situation being endured. This can be done, in our view, only if policy is based on fully realistic and rational foundations which conform first and foremost to the interests of Russia itself, and not on mythical or abstract concepts oriented on theoretical considerations removed from real life. We are talking about bringing the foreign policy of the Russian Federation into conformance with the principles comprising the basis of foreign policy activity of the developed democracies that constitute reference points for Russia. In effecting the transition to a market economy, we must not forget that "capitalism brought along with it the ethics of pragmatism, the ethics of common sense. A lofty idealism resided in its slogans of freedom, equality, and brotherhood, but it was an idealism based on a sensible, utilitarian accounting of realities." (A.N. Yakovlev. "Prelude. Cataclysm. Epilogue." Moscow: NOVOSTI, 1992, p. 276). It is pragmatism and common sense, in our view, that would advisably be put at the foundation of the foreign policy strategy of the Russian state under today's conditions. From this point of view the question of selection of priority partners may be examined--with respect to both the "near" and "far" abroad. Relations with its great neighbor of the Far East--China--will be of primary and vital significance to the Russian Federation. These affect not just the interests of Russia in Asia, but the entirety of Russia's international policy. As it develops in dynamic fashion, China is today playing an ever more prominent role in the Asia-Pacific region. "No single Asian power in the Asia-Pacific region has at its disposal the universal and powerful influence that belongs to the People's Republic of China." (S.V. Solodovnik. "Stability in Asia--Russia's Priority." MEZHDUNARODNAYA ZHIZN, 1992, No. 2, p. 88). Expert analyses predict that in the future, China will be quite capable of assuming a leading position in world politics (a number of analysts even predict that the People's Republic of China will turn into a superpower in the 21st century). An expansion of mutually advantageous cooperation with the PRC will conform to Russia's interests in developing its economic infrastructure in the Maritime Kray region, Siberia, Sakhalin, and Kamchatka. In the long term, should events develop favorably, it is felt that the Chinese "springboard" could facilitate to a certain degree the emergence of Russian capital in the markets of Southeast Asia, where Chinese business "is a permanent element of the socioeconomic structure of countries of the region." (S. Goncharenko. "Partners or Competitors--How Regional Chinese Capital Operates in the Countries of Southeast Asia." VOPROSY EKONOMIKI, 1992, No. 3, p. 113). The experience of the PRC's transition to a market economy is interesting in many respects and may prove quite useful to the Russian Federation (especially since when one takes a sober look at things, it is impossible not to see that during a historically short period of time the PRC has been able to approach the real market far more closely than the Russian Federation, where a greater role has been devoted to talk). In laying the foundation of Russian-Chinese relations today, we are obliged to proceed from the long-term perspective, first and foremost from a clear realization of the immutable fact that China and Russia are fated to be neighbors forever, regardless of whether one is pleased at this or not. Of great significance to the security of Russia's interests in the South and Central Asian regions is the preservation of continuity in the development of relations with India. Settlement of the problem of India's payment to Russia of its long-term state credit debt opens up broad opportunities for the development of mutually beneficial cooperation in the sphere of trade, shipping, space research, modern technology exchange, and exchanges in the military-technical sphere. India's implementation of a large-scale program of economic reforms, during which it "opens up new spheres for the application of capital" (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, 18-24 February 1993) will create favorable conditions for Russian investors, joint-stockholders, and private entrepreneurial structures. Since time immemorial the peoples of India and Russia have come to share deep-rooted traditions of humanitarian and cultural cooperation. In addition, expansion of the Russia-India political partnership contributes towards the consolidation of stability in Hindustan and throughout Central Asia as well. This is of major significance to Russia. Prospects for developing and intensifying ties with Russia's Eurasian "twin"--Turkey--appear to be promising and advantageous for Russia. Quite a number of historic parallels can be seen in the development of the two countries. Over the course of centuries, Turkey, like Russia, has played the part of a unique "bridge" between East and West, not belonging to one or the other. Like its northern neighbor, Turkey has had to endure the agonizing process of surmounting the empire syndrome and effecting transition to a modern (secular) model of state structure. Today Turkey, just like Russia, is resolving complex problems of economic modernization. The history of Russo-Turkish relations records a great many pages of drama and even tragedy. At the same time, the past also contains a positive experience of cooperation between the Russian Federation and Republic of Turkey of the days of Kemal Ataturk. The similarity of historical experience and economic systems of the two countries presupposes their compatibility and complementary nature. This experience is also valuable because today in Russia and other CIS states, "with the conduct of liberalization of the economy, a number of trends are being observed that operated in Turkey during the 1980's. They deal with the fate of state enterprises, pace and forms of privatization, and development of the financial market." (S. Avdashev. "Turkey--A National Model of Liberalization of the Economy." 1992, No. 11, p. 101). Nor would it be in Russia's interests to ignore the strong influence Turkey has in the Caucasus, the Balkans, Central Asia, and the Black Sea region. Capability for a constructive and highly effective relationship is seen in the prospects for partnership between a renewed Russia and Israel, where a tremendous Russian-speaking community has formed that exerts significant influence on the political, economic, and cultural life of the state. "One-fourth are our former people"--as the words of the famous poet express it. This is not only a natural and vital element linking the two countries, but a powerful factor of rapprochement between Russia and Israel as well. Repatriates from Russia have significant capacities at their disposal for rendering intermediary services in trade between the West and Russia, in investing capital in the Russian Federation economy on a long-term basis, and in implementing joint projects in both countries. Prospects appear good for cooperation in the development of tourism, trade in subtropical crops, processing and sale of diamonds, and in the sphere of scientific research. The development of relations between Russia and Israel would provide a weighty contribution to stabilization of the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean, facilitating settlement of one of the most deep-rooted and complex problems of modern times--the problem of the Near East. It is important to emphasize in this regard that the deepening of Russian-Israeli relations cannot and must not be effected at the expense or to the detriment of Russia's traditional ties with the Arab world (in particular, with Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and Kuwait). On the whole, orientation on the Near East should, in our view, constitute one of the priority directions in foreign policy strategy of the Russian Federation in Asia. In the "near" abroad, of exceptionally great long-term relevance to the national security and interests of our state is Kazakhstan, covering the "soft underbelly" of Russia and linking it with the countries of Central Asia at the same time. The geographic position of Kazakhstan, its virgin lands, natural and raw-material resources, developed industrial infrastructure, and the largest Russian-speaking diaspora outside the borders of the Russian Federation make it objectively urgently necessary to effect the very closest coordination and integration (a "strategic alliance," if you will) in all spheres of activity between Russia and Kazakhstan. The traditional gravitation of Armenia towards Russia is to a great extent the result of the particular features of its historical development and geopolitical situation. Occupying a central position in the Transcaucasus and essentially constituting the "key" to all of Asia Minor, Armenia is located at a unique juncture of two worlds--the Christian and Islamic worlds. Such a position has its obvious pluses as well as minuses. Armenia's advantageous geographic position, its solid intellectual potential, and the presence of a large and diversified diaspora in many countries of the world, including in Russia itself, make prospects for the development of stable and all-encompassing cooperation between Russia and Armenia quite promising. Rich mineral and energy resources, developed livestock-breeding, climatological and balneological factors, and the presence of suitable economic "recesses," have created favorable preconditions for cooperation between Russia and Kyrgyzstan. Not of minor significance to the Russian Federation is the presence in Kyrgyzstan of a large Russian-speaking community that plays an important role in the socioeconomic and scientific life of the state. The high-priority nature of relations between Russia and Uzbekistan has been determined by an aggregate of factors in the geostrategic, economic, and cultural spheres, as well as by historical tradition. The heart of the "mid-territory" of the Central Asian region, Uzbekistan "is not only a buffer zone, the boundary between the former USSR and the Islamic countries, but is the place where new ideas and the reality of a new world structure intersect." (M. Timonina. "They Are Aided By the Black Rock, We--By the Golden Crucifix" SOTSIUM, 1992, No. 6, p. 41). The interdependence of the economies of the two states, trade ties that have become a permanent fixture, and civilized and humanitarian traditions going back centuries upon centuries constitute a solid foundation for profitable cooperation on a broad scale. In this manner, with all the dissimilarity, diversity, and nonuniformity with respect to the above-enumerated countries, there exist certain substantive aspects and features that are intrinsic to a greater or lesser degree to practically all of them. It is these most typical features which, in our view, could be laid within the foundation of a system of criteria for selecting priority partners in both the "near" and "far" abroad. Their universal nature makes it possible, in our view, to utilize this system beyond the boundaries of the Asian continent as well. Thus, in selecting priority partners for the Russian Federation abroad, the main focus of attention must be concentrated on the following fundamental parameters: --mutual compatibility of economies, approximate comparability of economic development; --"key" nature of the geopolitical position of partners; --internal stability; --the secular principle in organization of state power. We know that the main foreign policy task of any state is to ensure its internal development. As it applies to Russia's present conditions, this means primarily the preservation of the country's economic potential and the safeguarding of political stability, and not simply physical survival within the existing state borders. Proceeding from this, the economy must be set as the cornerstone, while the foreign policy itself of the Russian Federation is subordinated to economic interests. Such pragmatism in policy does not constitute anything extraordinary--quite a number of countries in the world espouse such an approach to their benefit. Nor does this run contrary to the interests of the world community. Cooperation between the Russian Federation and the above-mentioned partners will enable it to actively participate in collective efforts to resolve regional conflicts in the Near East, the Transcaucasus, and Central Asia, thus contributing significantly to the consolidation of international stability. Rivalry in the international arena remains with us and will continue in the post-confrontational world. Under these conditions, only sober calculations, realism, and pragmatism can guarantee the success of foreign policy efforts. Russian philosopher Nikolay Berdyayev heaped severe criticism upon abstract doctrinaires in politics who proclaimed general principles without regard to relevant vital tasks and the given moment in history. "The oversimplified abnegation of problems and the specifics of the history in which any politics is formed is an indicator of mediocrity or superficiality in this area," he emphasized, "or a lack of interest in this sphere of existence, an absence of calling to it." (A.N. Berdyayev. "The Fate of Russia." Moscow: 1990, p. 215). These words are exceedingly relevant today. It is entirely apparent that even today the adjective "free" as it pertains to Russia "is still very difficult for our top brass to utter..." (Yu. Boldyrev. "The Russian Era." IZVESTIYA, 6 February 1993). It is therefore entirely logical to assume that without freedom of thought, freedom to choose our own path of development, freedom to determine our own Russian interests and priorities, the danger of dogmatism in the foreign policy sphere will continue to exist.
