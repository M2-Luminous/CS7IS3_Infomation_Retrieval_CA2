You have always sought to limit the responsibilities of socialist politicians in cases of corruption to two authorities: criminal responsibility to the authority of the Courts of Justice; and political responsibility to the judgement of the voters, as expressed at the ballot box. So far, this formula has offered you enough comfort to govern and a comfortable calmness in impunity. Legal power finds itself politicized to a degree that suits your politician's calmness, and the voters have continued losing their confidence in you and your "felipismo," but so slowly that one would have thought that this confidence would never disappear. Montesquieu was quite dead and the vote of the electorate was, to a great extent, captive. However, the time came when the functioning of the institutions of the state was seriously weakened. The traditional and apparently indelible credit in two fundamental institutions dropped: the Bank of Spain and the Civil Guard. When the governor of the Bank of Spain, who, with his signature, guaranteed our banknotes, turned out to be defrauding the Finance Ministry and a rogue who abused his position to make himself rich; while the director of the Civil Guard turned out to be a fugitive from justice on a wanted list with a price on his head, then tell me, Mr. prime minister, what can we count on in the hallowed halls of the state. And those are just two examples, perhaps the most striking ones, but they are accompanied by a multitude of large, medium, and small examples, like Manrique's rivers, which all lead to the sea! Here, corruption is already a broad expanse of sea whose shore cannot be seen. It is with sadness and with all due respect that I say this, but I have to say it. You, Mr. prime minister, seem at this time the leading person responsible for the major corruption scandal surrounding the nation and rotting it through and through. It is no longer possible to present your sin as a simple and venial sin of omission. It is not that you sat there, Mr. prime minister, with your arms crossed and your hands dangling before the growing flood that has inundated Spanish politics, turning it into a sewer. No. It would have been possible to blame it on convenience, blindness, clumsiness, or on softness, or perhaps on a brazen lack of concern, a feeling that "it is none of my business." However, it is possible, and necessary, to find more and more serious responsibilities in your position. You not only agreed to corruption, you not only closed your eyes to it and ignored it, you not only "tolerated" it -- in the exact sense of the word -- but you went much, much further, Mr. prime minister. You hid it; you denied it; you covered it up, as a criminologist would say. You made it possible with your protection, and you encouraged it with your complacency. Moreover, before investigating it, discovering it, and condemning it, you turned it into a crime of defamation by those who were denouncing it. You insulted the only Spaniards who were uncovering, discovering, and showing the voters the stew cooking in your kitchen, in your government, in your party, and in your entourage. Mr. prime minister, this transcends political responsibility and comes close to criminal responsibility. Now you want to gain time before accepting these responsibilities, but you are only succeeding in drawing nearer to the home of your friend Carlos Andres Perez and the painful situation of your friend, Bettino Craxi, who has been tried and relieved of his passport. In just a few years, you ruined your political life, the history of the Spanish Socialist Party, and the hopes of a large part of Spain. Leave your sense of shame aside, Mr. prime minister.
