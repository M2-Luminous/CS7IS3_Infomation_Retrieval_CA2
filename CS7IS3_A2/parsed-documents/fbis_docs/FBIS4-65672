In a speech at St. Antony's College of Oxford University on 19 May, Ruehe said according to the draft text that Russia should not be treated like Tajikistan or Albania. "However, it must learn to see itself as Russia, as neighbor among neighbors, and as a partner among basically equals, and act accordingly." He said it was understandable that Russia as a big power wanted to play a part in pan-European security issues. Moscow should become a strategic partner of NATO, but "must not hinder our neighbors' step-by-step integration into Western structures."
