By not contesting the election, "the FA has put itself beyond the disciplinary sanction of the Independent Electoral Commission, a development which will complicate the task of controlling alliance zealots. Within hours of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] decision to boycott the election, gunmen suspected of having IFP links attacked the Zevenfontein squatter camp, north of Johannesburg, killing four people and wounding nine more. The victims were reported to be ANC [African National Congress] supporters." BUSINESS DAY Constraints of Single Ballot -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 15 February in a page-10 editorial believes the National Party (NP) and the ANC "may be inclined to withdraw their offer of a double ballot, with separate votes for national and regional government, now that the Freedom Alliance parties seem likely to boycott the election. But the constraints of a single ballot are plain. Only six of the 19 parties (including the major contestants) are contesting everything. Their supporters's single cross, in any region, will count for that party in Parliament and regional legislatures. People voting for any of the other 13 parties forfeit some choice." "One vote is supposed to count twice; in many cases it may count once, forcing voters to choose between a national say and a local one. Our new freedom has limits." SOWETAN IFP, Freedom Alliance `Spoiling for a Fight' -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 15 February in a page-8 editorial "would grant members of the IFP and the Freedom Alliance their right to boycott the elections -- just as we do Azapo [Azanian People's Organization] -- if they stopped their tactics of deliberately spoiling for a fight. The fact that the other parties taking part in the coming elections are doing everything to get these organisations into the elections exposes their refusal to go to the polls."
