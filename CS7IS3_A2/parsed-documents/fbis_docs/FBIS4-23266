FBIS4-23266 "drafr106_e_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-106 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Nigeria Former Senators Form Opposition Group Former Senators Form Opposition Group AB0106192194 London BBC World Service in English 1705 GMT 1 Jun 94 AB0106192194 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] One of the catalysts of opposition in Nigeria has been the election of the consultative constitutional conference, known locally as the Confab, which is supposed to draw up a new political dispensation. It seems to have sharpened the resolve of those who look back at the annulled elections of 12 June last year and want those results reinstated. Now a new opposition group is emerging of senators elected last year but who lost their jobs when the Senate was disbanded along with all other institutions when General Abacha seized power. A number of senators say that they are going to reform the Senate, among them is Segun Bame Gbetan who was elected senator for Oshun East. On the line Akoi Amusu asked him if it wasn't a bit late to be reviving the Senate. [Begin recording] [Gbetan] Well, we have made this move because since the annulment of the results of 12 June 1993 election, we feel that there is no other way but to try to resolve both the annulment of the results of that election and to get the Senate and in fact the National Assembly back to function. So, that is the general consensus now that the senators have also come together that we should get the democratic structures back in place. [Amusu] But aren't you just causing confusion? I mean, the Abacha government is now in the process of setting up a constitutional conference. It has held elections and everything. So, why are you now suddenly coming out to say that you want the old Senate to meet? [Gbetan] Well, it is accepted that there may have been some confusion about the strategy and the style to adopt but the goal has always been the same: The goal of the political class is the same as the military government of General Abacha. Both want to install lasting democracy and whether it is through Confab or through general resolution, the goal is the same. So, I think now if you have a general resolution, the Confab may not be necessary. [Amusu] But Gen. Abacha doesn't want you old politicians to come out of the woodwork. He wants to start afresh with a clean slate. [Gbetan] No, there is no intention on the part of Gen. Abacha to leave out any particular group. That was why everybody was allowed to contest and quite a number of senators contested and won election into the Confab. [Amusu] So, what you are suggesting is that the Abacha government should just forget about the constitutional conference, what you are calling a Confab, and just let you senators sort it all out. [Gbetan] Yes, I believe that is a very viable alternative to the Confab. [Amusu] But you see, if Gen. Abacha is being asked to accept your election in those elections of last year as being valid, then why shouldn't he accept the election of Moshood Abiola whose election as president has been annulled? [Gbetan] Yes, Gen. Abacha and his government have distanced themselves from the illegal annulment of that election and I believe they are working towards restoring the results of that election. [Amusu] But they've showed no signs of that. They have shown absolutely no signs of their intent to reinstall Chief Abiola as president of Nigeria. In fact, on the contrary, they seem to be doing everything to avoid that. [Gbetan] Well, I believe that what they have not done is to try to do it by military fiat or by executive fiat and that is by trying to go through the Confab and particularly General Diya has said that they will abide by the decision of the Confab and I think the feeling in the country today is that the Confab should go there and resolve that issue and get Chief M.K. Abiola to form his government. [end recording]
