Over the past few days there have been rumors of Berlusconi's involvement in a deal that prompted the Milan District Attorney to consider bringing charges of fraudulent accounting against the club's manager, Adriano Galliani. Yesterday these rumors, originating from political circles, reappeared, and were promptly followed by a denial, first from a deputy prosecuting attorney who is dealing with the case, Francesco Greco, and then officially, from Borrelli himself. Wednesday afternoon [4 May] Galliani, Milan's manager, who is under investigation in connection with the Lentini case, was questioned for an hour and a half by [Judges] Di Pietro, Colombo, Greco, and Davigo. Galliani opted not to answer. The affair in which he is implicated stems from the purchase of the player, Lentini, whom Turin sold to Milan for the astronomical fee of 16.5 billion lire, according to the contract deposited with the Soccer League, though it seems that considerably more than that was paid secretly. Colombo dealt with the matter first; his suspicions were aroused by 6.5 billion lire paid from abroad. Part of the money came via Switzerland to Borsano, a Socialist deputy from Turin. The rumors of Berlusconi's involvement stem from the fact that he has a legal obligation to monitor any possible irregularities.
