This small area of around 26,000 square kilometers, with its population of just over 2 million, has demonstrated an enormous interest in political and party politics. Almost unbelievable: According to official data from the registration services of political parties and movements in the Republic of Macedonia, 58 political parties and seven associations of a political nature had been registered by October 1993. Yet interest in party membership or affiliations is decreasing after years of meetings, rallies, and gatherings, following the initial national and political euphoria. Television coverage of parliamentary sessions are further proof of this -- initially, the programs were more popular than soccer or light entertainment programs, and the debates, the repeats, and the "jokes" were retold at home, in the street, and in cafes. However, today it may be concluded that these programs are no longer popular and that basic political interest is a thing of the past. The Dangerous Years -- Perfect Tranquility Nonetheless, in this relatively short democratic period of four years, parties with influence and a proper image, with their large memberships and affiliations among the citizens, have proliferated. Mainly, these consist of parties that caught the "first train" to registration -- the SDSM [Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia], the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Movement for Macedonian National Unity], the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity], and the LP (formerly Reformist Forces -- now the Liberal Party], and they won most seats in the first pluralist Macedonian Parliament. The MAAK [Movement for All-Macedonian Action] and the League for Democracy, which were the first to hold constituent assemblies (4 February and 11 February 1990), although achieving a proper image (national and all- encompassing) and affiliations, suffered a disaster at the elections and since then their fall has continued in that eternal and merciless void called politics. The Social Democratic Party of Macedonia (the first party in Macedonia to register), the Democratic Union-Peasants Party of Macedonia, the Macedonian National Party, the Party of Yugoslavs in Macedonia, the Labor Party, and some others created and registered in 1990, although on the "first train," remained at the political margins, while, despite their modest election results, the Socialist Party and the National Democratic Party have kept a constant level of support among their constituencies, membership, and affiliates, and they retain a degree of political influence. As for the other parties subsequently created, only the Democratic Party of Serbs in Macedonia, the Democratic Party of Macedonia, and the Democratic Party, created last year, have remained in the ratings. Macedonia has passed through the years of living dangerously, of war and peace, social disturbances, disorder, and chaos in the world of transition, in accordance with its own historical, political, geographic and strategic conditions, in relatively perfect tranquility. The same refers to parliament, maintaining its own standards, without early elections, something that is probably far from praiseworthy but that certainly reflects the situation in a state that was seen as one of the youngest states in the world, but capable of dealing with internal and foreign problems and frustrations. Macedonian politics has displayed in the international arena a temperate and constructive policy whose only problem is the dispute with Greece, in which the angels are, in any case, on our side. This conclusion can be seen by the Christmas recognition of Macedonia on the eve of the Greek presidency of the European Community. As for domestic policy, Macedonia has a number of its own problems and unsolved frustrations that need to be settled in the course of time. It has to do, first of all, with the social sector. Our international state interests are not visibly imperiled by the domestic political scene, because these have to be viewed within the framework of foreign policy. It is not possible to expect radical shifts, regardless of who might come to power after the second parliamentary and presidential elections to be held this year, because part of the Macedonian strategy has been built on the basis of Macedonian Balkan equidistance, the maintenance and reinforcement of Macedonia's independence and neutrality. It can now be seen that the idea of Macedonia as a country of peace and stability internally and regionally has become dominant and that it will be difficult to foster radical or nationalist ideas. Basic Political Issues Going back to the political party scene in Macedonia, and bearing in mind the foreign policy of our state and its international recognition, one must inevitably take into account certain political processes that might affect the state's future political profile. Namely, as the time of national euphoria passes, which has set the Balkans on fire and is still burning in its central parts, the reverse process has begun in our state. It is a process toward abandoning national and nationalist engagement and turning toward everyday life. It is the everyday life of dealing with basic questions requiring precise answers and precise political engagement. The year 1993 is very illustrative in explaining this process. Namely, a number of events took place to indicate this process. A number of parties were burdened with internal poison and divisions. These parties had nationalist programs or engaged in effectively nationalist political activities. The past year saw, as was mostly exposed by the media, a division within the largest party of the Albanians in Macedonia, the PDP. In effect, the PDP used only half of its strength last year on purely party politics and within the government coalition. In practice, all its activities were limited by the political realities in a country in which nationalism did not win through, and in which such a nationalist party, through its exponents (ministers and delegates), could see how far the highest ladders could go -- to the negotiations with mediator Arens, where the real and demanded possibilities remained somewhere in the middle. [sentence as published] The radical wing of the Tetovo branch, headed by Menduh Taci, appeared as a reaction to these activities, threatening to withdraw from the institutions of the political system if the nationalist demands of the Albanians were not met, but declining to offer a concrete political platform. The two opposing factions politically divided the Albanian population, something that could also divide the party and jeopardize the campaign of the Albanian parties in the forthcoming elections. The Democratic Party of Turks of Macedonia [DPTM], another nationalist party, is experiencing serious disunity. Unlike the situation within the PDP, the current president of the DPTM, Erdogan Sarach, has been accused of radicalism by the party's Skopje branch. Calls for the Turks to leave Macedonia, the events in Zupa, and reports that genocide against the Turks is in progress in the eastern parts of the country are the main arguments for the branch's opposition to the party leadership. The party's general assembly is expected to bring the matter to a conclusion -- determining whether the populist or the civic concept will prevail in this party, whose membership is drawn exclusively from the Turkish minority in Macedonia. Disunity Before the Elections The question of whether the political disposition of the Serbs in Macedonia is seriously influenced by the political forces of its northern neighbor will be answered in the course of this year. The beginning of 1992 saw the Democratic Party of Serbs registered. Many divisions, and political and national pluralism interlocked within the party. The party's president, Boro Ristic, successfully led the party until the signing of the agreement with the Macedonian Government, through the mediation of Arens, when there emerged a definite division within the party between those in favor of Serbian national unity and those in favor of "settling down" and accepting a minority status in line with European standards. It is yet to be seen whether the radical current headed by the new president of the DPS, Dragisa Miletic, will unite the Serbs in one party and with one idea, although all the internal circumstances suggest that there will certainly be political disunity within this population, too. The Muslim party, the SDA [Party for Democratic Action] has experienced similar disunity. The faction of the first president of this party, Sadrija Hasanovic, has continued to follow the majority of its genuine principles, while another SDA faction has emerged, led by Rizvan Halilovic, as well as the SDA-Islamic Road, located in Tetovo. The VMRO-DPMNE must also be mentioned as a nationalist party, as its activities were determined by external political processes -- the breakup of Yugoslavia, the emergence of Macedonia as a state, and its road to international recognition. This party is very interesting for political analysts. Despite all the forecasts, it achieved success in the second round of the elections. Nonetheless, it lost its chance (to use its number of deputies) to form a parliamentary majority and then a government. It seemed to be unable to deal with the reality of the political circumstances and the election results because of its nationalist concepts, and its escape from the political realities became an integral part of its political platform. However, this was the point where the differing internal party interests collided, resulting in a bolstering of party factions, whose independent activities reached a point where new parties were formed as some factions deserted the party. First, the vice president of VMRO-DPMNE, Vladimir Golubovski, formed the VMRO-Democratic Party in 1991, and later the VMRO-Goce Delcev (1992) and VMRO-United (1993) appeared, while the latest party to be formed from a VMRO-DPMNE faction has been the VMRO-Patriotic Party, located in Bitola and led by former Vice President Dimitar Crnomarov, to which the deputy Mitko Atanasovski is inclined. A number of VMRO-DPMNE members joined the Ilinden-Free Democrats, which then became the Democratic Party within the Pan-Macedonian Association of political prisoners and those persecuted for the ideas of VMRO-Goce's. In addition, some eminent VMRO-DPMNE members and district officials went over to the Democratic Party led by former SDSM leader Petar Gosev. Party disunity may not be the preserve of the national parties alone, but what is obvious is that party turmoil is characteristic of them alone. The former leader of the SDSM, Petar Gosev, failed to attract a single deputy or member of the party leadership. Nor has the Liberal Party achieved any greater success, either. However, this year's elections will show the views of the citizens of our state, as well as the state of the parties in Macedonia. And the citizens' vote will certainly provide the most accurate answers to all the questions put forward in this article.
