Atun issued a written statement today in connection with the report President Clinton submitted to Congress on the Cyprus question. Atun pointed out that once again Clinton failed to adopt an equal and balanced approach toward the two peoples in Cyprus. The prime minister said: It should have been understood by now that referring to Kliridhis as the Cypriot president will not help the solution of the Cyprus problem; rather, it will encourage Greek Cypriot intransigence. Kliridhis is the leader of the Greek Cypriot Administration, which does not represent the Turkish Cypriot people. He has been elected only by the Greek Cypriot people. The legitimate Cyprus Government, which is sovereign over the whole of Cyprus based on agreements, ceased to exist in 1963. Atun recalled that the Cyprus Government was turned into a Cyprus state through military force and occupation. Even though the United States is aware of these facts, he said, it continues to recognize the Greek Cypriot Administration as the legitimate Cyprus government. This approach cannot help the search for peace, he stressed. Atun said: It is noteworthy that Mr. Clinton never mentions in his report the hostile policies being escalated by the Greek Cypriots at every platform. The prime minister expressed the hope that the U.S. Administration will show the necessary initiative to correct this situation and to end an approach that is totally incompatible with the spirit and content of the confidence-building measures. This would help the negotiation process, he added. Atun pointed out that the most important obstacle, both before a final solution and before the confidence-building measures, is the fact that the Greek Cypriot Administration is recognized as the legitimate government for all of Cyprus, even though it does not have the legal basis for that, and the insistence of third parties in refusing to treat the two peoples equally. He stressed that by changing this erroneous attitude and by treating both sides equally, third parties will create the necessary conditions for the success of the negotiations.
