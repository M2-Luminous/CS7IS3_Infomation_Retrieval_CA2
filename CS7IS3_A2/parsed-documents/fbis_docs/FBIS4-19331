"I have always conceived of the role of Senate speaker as a role `super partes', necessarily having no political strings attached," Spadolini said. He underscored the need of the speaker to defend the principles of democracy and a "correct dialectic among all the political forces within a civil confrontation of ideas" which must never be allowed to degenerate into mere "insults and provocations." The senate speaker must be the guarantor for the rights of both the majority and the minority, he insisted. The current situation of the senate is the most delicate in its history and that balance must be preserved which is so fundamental to the future of the legislature and to the proper functioning of the democratic institutions, Spadolini said. These balances are the fruit of a complex and complicated history which cannot easily be reduced to prefabricated diagrams, he continued. For this reason, Spadolini said he was offering himself as a candidate that he claimed would provide an institutional guarantee of that impartiality and equidistance which he said he has sought over the past seven years as speaker to provide the nation, in keeping with the spirit of the constitution. The 122 senators of the Progressive Pole, at an early-morning meeting, unanimously decided to back Spadolini's candidacy. Just before the Senate assembly began, the 30 senators of the People's Party also decided to back Spadolini.
