FR940906-0-00059 FR940906-0-00019 The definition of ``Bimonthly'' has been revised to coincide with calendar months, rather than weekly reporting periods. This change is necessary to allow greater consistency between ADF&G and NMFS data collected from the industry that is used to calculate processor fee assessments. The definition of ``Catcher vessel'' has been revised to clarify that a catcher vessel is used for catching fish, but does not process fish. The definition of ``Fishing trip'' has been changed to more clearly implement NMFS' intent for observer coverage requirements set out at §677.10(a)(1) for catcher vessels delivering groundfish to shoreside processing facilities. A catcher vessel required to carry a NMFS-certified observer during at least 30 percent of its fishing days in a calendar quarter under §677.10(a)(1) also must carry an observer during at least one fishing trip during the calendar quarter for each of six different groundfish fishery categories defined at §677.10(a)(1)(ii) in which it participates. In the proposed rule, these fishery definitions were based on a vessel's retained catch composition of groundfish during a weekly reporting period. However, retained catch information for catcher vessels delivering groundfish to shoreside processors is recorded on ADF&G fish tickets that summarize catch retained during a fishing trip, not a weekly reporting period. To resolve this discrepancy, the definition of ``Fishing trip'' at §677.2 and of fishery categories at §677.10(a)(1)(ii) have been clarified to allow the use of ADF&G fish tickets completed at the end of a fishing trip to assign catcher vessels to fisheries. The definition of ``Mothership processor vessel'' has been revised to clarify that a mothership processor is not used for, or equipped to be used for, catching fish. The definition of ``Processor'' has been revised to include those fishermen who deliver fish directly to restaurants. This change is necessary because information on retained catch is not obtained from restaurants under the recordkeeping and reporting requirements set out under §672.5 and §675.5. The definition of ``Retained catch'' has been revised to more clearly apply to all processors defined at §677.2. The definition of ``Shoreside processor or shoreside processing facility'' has been changed to more clearly separate this type of processing operation from other types of processors (e.g., catcher/processors, mothership processor vessels, or fishermen who sell fish to restaurants or to another person for use as bait or personal consumption). The definition of ``Fishermen'' has been added to clarify reference to this term under the definition of ``Processor.'' In §677.2, the term ``At-sea processor'' has been removed because this term is not referred to in regulations. The terms ``Standardized cost of an observer day'' and ``Standard observer day'' have been removed because these terms no longer are applicable. 5. In §677.6, the following changes have been made.
