In a regular Monday morning meeting on 4 April, Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and minister of the NUB, said: While the government has coped effectively with the North Korean issue ever since it declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty by relegating work to each relevant office, people with less training have erred. Thus, he expressed his displeasure as head of the diplomatic and security team. Concerning the phrase "people with less training" mentioned by Deputy Prime Minister Yi, a relevant official at the NUB said that this phrase refers to Hwang Pyong-tae, ROK Ambassador to the PRC, who invoked public criticism for raising the "untimely theory of attaching importance to China," and to Vice Foreign Minister Hong, who revealed a readiness to "withdraw" the condition of "envoy exchange first" during a recent debate with National Assemblymen.
