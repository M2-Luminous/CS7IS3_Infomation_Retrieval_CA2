Hundreds of plainclothes police roam Tiananmen Square -- the vast focal point of the spring 1989 pro-democracy protests, crushed by the army on June 4 that year -- ready to nip in the bud any undesirable commemorative activities. Easily recognisable by their straw hats, dark glasses, and two-way radios, the uncomfortable-looking officers mingle among the crowds of Chinese families, moving in quickly to videotape the movements of any suspicious-looking characters -- such as camera-wielding foreign journalists. "They seem to be more nervous this year than ever," said one diplomat, putting the official paranoia down to fears of instability amid rising social discontent and concern about the health of 89-year-old patriach Deng Xiaoping. The city is crawling with uniformed officers from its 50,000-strong People's Armed Police (PAP) force, developed since 1989 into a strong riot-control unit able to put down disturbances without calling on the Army -- whose unsuitability for dealing with civil unrest led to the June 4 bloodshed. But, should the PAP fail to restore order quickly, the authorities appear ready to resort to extreme measures again. President Jiang Zemin recently credited the "resolute measures" taken by the Army in 1989 for China's present stability. Security is particularly tight around the homes of dissidents and their families -- with whom some foreign journalists, under an obscure regulation, were recently warned to break all contact or face the consequences. Many dissidents are already in detention after an intensive police sweep that began in the spring following the most significant resurgence in their activities since 1989. Others, including Tiananmen leader Wang Dan, have left the capital temporarily, either at the orders of the authorities or simply to avoid harassment. Those who remain complain that their every move is being watched. Ding Zilin, a People's University professor whose son was shot by soldiers in 1989, was preparing Thursday to launch a hunger strike in the evening to protest the intensive police surveillance of her home. Ding's husband Jiang Peikuang said police had warned friends who also lost relatives in the massacre not to join them. The northwestern university district, base in 1989 of the protests' student leaders, is another focus for police attention. Everyone entering university compounds must now show their identity cards, while several student activists have been sent home early for the holidays. "They're erring on the side of caution, on the side of stupidity -- no one wants to be responsible for letting things get out of control," said a diplomat. Such "stupidity" is reflected in an apparent directive to stop all and any large gatherings -- even if most people present are likely to be foreigners. In recent days, an innocuous-sounding foreign-embassy bazaar in a five-star hotel was threatened with closure, a painting exhibition by a diplomat's wife cancelled, an embassy party in one park banned, and a foreign journalist's party in another scuppered by an electricity overload and police road block. "Their tactics have changed since 1989 -- now they are simply not going to allow people to get together," the diplomat said. Their tactics also include efforts to temporarily diffuse popular tension over high inflation and other social ills by reimposing price controls here on a range of staple goods, while ensuring that the capital's shops are particularly well-stocked. "Lots of luxury items that are usually quite difficult to come by are suddenly in the shops at very cheap prices," said one Beijing resident. Should these efforts to lull the population into a sense of well-being fail to dissuade any foolhardy individuals from commemorating the Tiananmen Massacre openly, the forces are now in place to deal with them quickly and severely.
