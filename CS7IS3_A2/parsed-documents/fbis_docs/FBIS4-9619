[Mesic] No, not yet. [Vlahovic] Is it not unusual that, while you are not only a member of the ruling party but one of its leaders, you are founding a new party? [Mesic] Our membership will formally be canceled when we found the party and when party documents are adopted at the constituent assembly. [Vlahovic] After Josip Manolic's replacement, you said you feared that a large number of people would be persecuted on all levels and in all HDZ structures. Has it come to that, and if it has, how extensive is it? [Mesic] Fortunately, it has not yet come to major persecutions "on the vertical level," but there is roll calling. Unfortunately, there have been unprecedented provocations against Josip Manolic, president of the Chamber of Counties, like those in the darkest Stalin period in Russia. Among those who spoke up was the German HDZ Youth, which declared both Manolic and myself bolshevik criminals. They even resort to name calling. Meetings in villages and towns at which Manolic is exposed are in full swing. Something like that is not customary in democracy, but here, after confronting opinions, there is public lynching. Therefore, we often go back to totalitarianism. [Vlahovic] Apart from Mr. Manolic, are other deputies also under pressure? [Mesic] All deputies suspected of joining myself and Joza Manolic are being interviewed and questioned at present. [Vlahovic] Who conducts those interviews? [Mesic] Members of the presidency and the party president himself. [Vlahovic] After the discussion on Manolic, has the HDZ Presidency talked about your dismissal, too? [Mesic] They never discussed it, but it is not difficult to conclude that it was just a matter of time when they would put the subject on the agenda. I was the one who was attacked first. Remember, they suggested that I leave the country so they could finish some discussions, which I allegedly hindered. I refused to do so and said the only thing I would do would be to go on vacation. I could make that concession, as I underwent a minor operation in the meantime and returned to work a month later. Naturally, people think I would agree to a kind of sinecure, but I did not become politically active with that in mind. My goals are much bigger and I cannot be bought by sinecure. Tudjman Is Neither a Leftist Nor a Rightist [Vlahovic] What is actually the reason behind your conflict with President Tudjman? In your opinion, is President Tudjman a leftist or a rightist? [Mesic] He is neither a leftist nor a rightist. He likes authoritative power and thinks he can lead a party in a bureaucrat-like manner, but that is impossible. A party is a living being and cannot stand that kind of leadership. Therefore, those of us who have been in the party since its establishment are not satisfied with that kind of party leadership. We wanted the HDZ to be a party that would realize our program goals and become a democratic party that can discuss all questions and that the decision of the majority be implemented. [Vlahovic] At what point did President Tudjman start to deviate from those program principles? [Mesic] When he started to interfere in all institutions of the system, from the parliament to the judicial system. Dictatorship is introduced by attacking institutions. We want to defend institutions -- in other words, democracy. [Vlahovic] Who, in your opinion, influences the politics of President Tudjman the most? [Mesic] Probably someone close to him. I have not been close to him in about two years, so I do not know who is the most influential. I think the president himself is the man, for his vision of democracy is something that objectively is not what he thinks it is. [Vlahovic] Do you think they will attempt to dismiss you from your position as president of the parliament? [Mesic] I do not know what they will attempt to do, but the issue of the ratio of powers in the parliament will be settled right there. The way in which they went after Manolic was one of the causes for my reaction. When, at the session of the party presidency, we decided without voting -- I repeat, without voting, for they keep claiming it was a unanimous decision, and there was no ballot whatsoever -- to pass the case of Manolic on to the court of honor, they should have done that. That would be a democratic procedure. However, to telephone the parliament to begin that action, right after or even during the session, to collect 36 signatures that very day, that is Bolshevism at its peak. New Relations in the Parliament [Vlahovic] Parliamentary crisis is obviously mounting. Are you going to cause early elections? [Mesic] No, that is not the issue. This is all about new relations in the parliament, which does not necessarily mean early elections. This is not about the president of the republic either. He has his constitutional authority and he must do it, but those of us in the parliament have our constitutional authority as well. Therefore, this will only strengthen the autonomy of the parliament and democracy. There is no reason for early elections, especially since we accept and support the program of the government. [Vlahovic] How will the founding of the Croatian Independent Democrats influence the HDZ? [Mesic] Some members of the HDZ who are not satisfied with the implementation of original principles of the party will surely join us or, to be precise, they will stay true to those original principles, for they are our starting point. [Vlahovic] What kind of reaction do you expect from the state officials -- for example, from President Tudjman? [Mesic] I expect more sensible politics, especially as it has turned out, in the case of Josip Manolic, that parliament is unlike any other institution. I hope that the president and the people who advise him will realize that the question of relations in the parliament is one thing and the question of other institutions is quite another. Relations in the parliament cannot be settled by extra-parliamentary games. [Vlahovic] A part of the public, especially some political parties, fear this could lead to a dictatorship. [Mesic] There will be fewer of those fears after this, for we are about to prove that we are a pluralistic and democratic society and that democracy has deep roots here. Warmongers Safe in Their Seats [subhead] [Vlahovic] Are you counting on the support of the opposition? [Mesic] HDZ leaders have been trying to convince our representatives that many members of the opposition will now join the HDZ. We will see. [Vlahovic] What do you think? [Mesic] I think that is wrong information. [Vlahovic] Do you think there is a connection between the announced large number of strikes and those political developments? [Mesic] No, but we predicted it would come to that. By means of monetary technology, we curbed inflation and reached the point where we must increase production and involvement of capital. Furthermore, to be involved in a war, which we are supporting in this or that way -- it is quite clear that we supported the Herzegovina Croats in their conflict with the Muslims -- this unnecessary and absurd war, which brought nothing but death and destruction to both the Croats and the Muslims, to finally sign the agreement on confederation. And now to interpret this as a natural consequence is an offense to all those who were involved and paid a high price for the war. We must say how much the war cost, where the money from sold apartments and companies goes, and where the money given by the Croatian emigration is. For I know very well that some countries offered to give us weapons for free, and was it necessary to purchase and pay a high price for something we could get for free? We could get weapons from countries that support us, provided we stop the conflict with the Muslims. However, the conflict kept escalating. And now, some people in Bosnia-Herzegovina who initiated the conflict between the Croats and the Muslims are firmly holding their positions and are probably trying to thwart the Washington agreement. We Must Find Out Where the Money Went [Vlahovic] You mentioned the money given by the Croatian emigration with regard to embezzlement several times. Do you have any clue, or perhaps even proof, of how the money is being spent? [Mesic] We know that the least amount of funds went to economic processes and programs. We must find out where the money went. [Vlahovic] According to Prime Minister Valentic, Croatia is now at the most critical stage of economic stabilization. Do you think those stormy developments on the political scene will influence the implementation of the stabilization program very much, and if so, how? [Mesic] The very process we are initiating will enable the world to trust Croatian democracy a bit more. We are not trying to cause a crisis; we want to strengthen Croatia as a law-governed state. Then Croatia can also be a serious partner to foreign investors. [Vlahovic] You said you supported the government's policy, but President Tudjman strongly supports Prime Minister Valentic, too. Have you also contacted the prime minister? What is the position of the government in this situation? [Mesic] Yes, I talked to the prime minister on Tuesday [19 April] as well. There should be no crisis in the government. We must give it all our support, provided that this process of democratization wins us some foreign capital and investments. That is our way of helping the government. [Vlahovic] With regard to your views on transformation and privatization, do you think the government is closer to your views or to politics created by President Tudjman? [Mesic] The government has taken a first step toward denationalization, and it was those HDZ hawks that made it take the subject off its agenda. We demand that the process of denationalization be addressed, that people be given back what is rightfully theirs, and also, regarding tenants, that they be protected and put on an equal level with everyone else. It is possible to do all that, if we start with new economic projects and if we immediately sell all military-owned and other apartments and allocate those funds to the construction of new apartments. Avoiding Essential Problems [Vlahovic] You have mentioned hawks again. Who are those people? Are they in the state leadership? [Mesic] Yes, those are the people who think problems can be solved by means of some palliative measures. They are obviously avoiding the essential problems more and more. [Vlahovic] Does your leaving the HDZ mean that the ruling party now overwhelmingly holds that it is impossible to reach a political compromise between the Croats and the Muslims and preserve the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Mesic] There is something I cannot grasp. Some people -- I will not name them but they know what I am talking about -- harbor an illusion that they can negotiate the division of Bosnia with Milosevic and then solve Croatian problems. There cannot be any agreement with Milosevic regarding the division of Bosnia. It would result in a chain reaction; there would be new aggressors, and the world will not allow that. The only way out is to form an alliance with the Muslims and those Serbs who support the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina and then to make an agreement with that state as with any other state. [Vlahovic] In his reply to President Tudjman, Manolic mentioned organized crime in Herzeg-Bosna and the fact that it is supported by some Croatian institutions. Who are those men? [Mesic] That is difficult for me to say. The institutions that are involved in that must say so. Today we can only talk about what we see is happening. If people buy enormous amounts of fuel that cannot be spent by Herzeg-Bosna, that means that they are selling it to someone else. Therefore, it is a chain reaction, but it is not up to me to determine what this is actually all about. To Attain Autonomy of the Parliament [Vlahovic] As president of the parliament, what prevented you from initiating the establishment of parliamentary commissions that would examine those phenomena that were also discussed in the parliament? [Mesic] The parliament and its commissions of inquiry cannot as yet be efficient, for they must be regulated by law. Such a law is now being drafted and I believe it will soon be adopted. We tried everything so that the parliament, apart from its main function as a legislative body, can also act as a controlling body, and by means of parliamentary committees, we are trying to influence all institutions to implement regulations brought by the parliament. I do not want to undermine the responsibility of the parliament, but considering the pressure we have been under, it has not been easy to attain autonomy of the parliament. [Mesic] Your group has demanded that the right wing of the HDZ leave. In your opinion, which people should not be in the political leadership? [Mesic] We are no longer asking anyone to leave. We are leaving instead. [Vlahovic] Can you comment on the position of Croatia and the prospects for implementing the Washington agreement after the fall of Gorazde? [Mesic] Obviously, there have been some secret agreements and underhanded deals. The fall of Gorazde is nothing but a conspiracy against the sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We will probably find out who was involved, but now we must use all available means and international mechanisms to make the international community finally commit itself on who is the aggressor and take steps against it. There have been many victims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but there will be even more victims if one allows the division of Bosnia- Herzegovina. Gorazde is the final lesson for the international community to take action. [Vlahovic] You said that for some two years now, you have not been in the circle that creates the politics of the ruling party. Therefore, you have not agreed with the politics of President Tudjman for two years. Why did it take you so long to go public about that? [Mesic] I did not participate in making decisions, but I have been trying through various party and state mechanisms to influence Croatian politics in the country and abroad. I thought it possible to set it straight, but now we realized that if one cannot have an open and honest discussion within the party about problems that will tomorrow be much more topical than they are today, then we must act in this way. [Box 1, p 3] International Support [Vlahovic] Which members of the opposition did you contact? [Mesic] Leaderships of all parties, but for one reason only: to convince them that we will not tread on their political ground. We respect their programs and their membership. We do not want to see some uncontrolled processes happen. We want those parties to keep their space, to become even stronger, to the benefit of Croatia. Our action also aims to strengthen Croatian democracy. Croatia comes first for us. But what kind of Croatia? Democratic, social, human Croatia, in which human rights will be protected. Croatia in which crime and mafia cannot survive. [Vlahovic] Do you have international support? [Mesic] The world still supports democratic processes, and this is an absolutely democratic process. We will be absolutely supported by the world. Those who advise the president to strike at democratic processes are not working for the benefit of him or Croatia. [Box 2, p 3] Where Is the Money Emigration Gave Us? [Vlahovic] Conflicts in the HDZ have been noticeable for a while. Why solve them at this very moment? Why are you forming a new party right now? [Mesic] We had no other choice. We tried to settle this in the party by discussing all problems, which are evidently present in the society. We put all that on the agenda. However, the party, or better yet the president, disregarded that. We must have an honest discussion, but if that is not possible within the party, then we will do it in public, for the public is the best judge. We must say whether we are satisfied with the transformation or not. Nowhere in the world could the rumor about 600,000 German marks of state funds to purchase an apartment for a minister so he could then buy it for 40,000 German marks hold. Where will those state officials who will succeed the present ones live? Judging by the results of the present ones, I am not sure they will hold on to their positions for very long. And finally, there is the question of funds provided by our emigration. Those are enormous amounts of money about which the parliament knows nothing and neither does the Croatian Government. Those funds are in foreign banks and we do not know who controls how and why they are spent. Croatian emigration and the public must know where the money is. [Vlahovic] Could that not be discussed in the ruling party? [Mesic] No, that was strictly a taboo. [Box 3, p 4] Who Is Responsible for the Politics Toward Bosnia-Herzegovina [Vlahovic] You said there were indications that the Washington agreement will not be implemented. Who will fail to do so? What will be the consequences? [Mesic] It is not that some will fail to do that, but I am certain that some are trying to block the Washington agreement. They appear to be supporting it, but are actually working against it. They will not succeed in that; they will only manage to compromise themselves and the people they represent. [Vlahovic] Can you tell us who is the creator of the politics toward Bosnia-Herzegovina that lead to founding concentration camps for the Muslims, destruction of the Mostar bridge...? [Mesic] The Croat-Muslim conflict was harmful for both nations, but it did not do much good for the Serbs either, for they thought the world would tolerate the aggression. In fighting against each other, the Croats and the Muslims suffered heavy casualties, and now everyone is friends again now that they have signed the agreement. That means it should not have come to the war in the first place. The problem was in bringing the political decision to confront the Muslims. Who is behind whom? I do not know. When Josip Manolic criticized Gojko Susak -- for he was in charge of Bosnia-Herzegovina, he went there, we did not -- and, after all, we could see on television who was photographed together: Vice Vukojevic and Gojko Susak, it is not difficult to conclude who supported which option. However, President Tudjman allowed no criticism and, in his address in the Club of the HDZ Representatives, he took responsibility for that politics. [Box 4, p 4] Susak Is Incompetent [Vlahovic] At the latest session of the Parliament, Minister Susak and his responsibility for the explosion in Duboki Jarak was in the focus of discussion. What do you think about the demand of the opposition to reconsider the question of his political responsibility? [Mesic] Commissions in charge of that matter will definitely reach certain conclusions, and judicial authorities will make corresponding decisions. However, this is a matter of political responsibility of the person who organizes the work and rules of behavior in the army, and that is the Defense Ministry. We know who is in charge. When it comes to such extent of damage and such heavy casualties, then it would be honorable for the minister to offer his resignation; whether it will be accepted, that is another matter. I do not insist on that, but I insist that Susak offer his resignation. One million of inhabitants of Zagreb were in question, and the explosion could have spread to the nearby chemical plant and gas installations. There could have been unpredictable consequences, and our minister did not interrupt his visit to Herzeg-Bosna, a sovereign state, and we know he did not go there in cooperation with the Sarajevo authorities, and he did not come to the sight of the explosion nor did he return to his ministry. Ask him where he went. [Vlahovic] To what extent is Minister Susak responsible for such politics? [Mesic] I do not think he knows how responsible he is, because he is not competent enough for the job. Let us face it, he cannot do the job. [Vlahovic] Who should answer this question, then? [Mesic] The supreme commander, of course.
