FR940513-2-00074 FR940513-2-00039 Applications funded under this section should result in the development of effective and innovative models which demonstrate linkage of the aging and disability networks. These models can build on existing models that have been successfully implemented by public and private organizations at the national, state and local levels. Projects may focus on various aspects of systems development such as access/care coordination, quality assurance, management of home and community based care, interagency coordination and the financing mechanisms employed by the two different groups. In developing new models, successful applicants will seek the advice, input and cooperation of experts and practitioners in the aging and disability fields. Program activities may include conferences, work groups for the design of new approaches, and development of issue papers. Applications should include provision for wide dissemination of the new model and a plan for marketing the model to others in a manner which actively encourages and facilitates opportunities for replication. Under this priority area, AoA expects to make approximately 4&hyph;6 awards with a federal share of up to $150,000 each year for a period of approximately three years. The deadline date for submitting applications under this priority area is July 12, 1994. 1.4␣Employment of Public Assistance Recipients in Home Care Home care remains one of the fastest growing workforce areas in today's economy. This growth will only increase as the emphasis on home and community based long term care continues, especially if provisions for such care are included in a health care reform bill approved by the Congress. However, shortages of home care workers affect the access older and disabled persons have to needed care, as well as the continuity and quality of care they receive. This priority area addresses the need for demonstrating approaches to increasing the size and stability of the home care workforce by employing public assistance recipients, a group of persons typically outside the workforce. It also reflects the Administration's commitment under proposed welfare reform to foster gainful work for those caught in the current welfare system. Many past efforts to employ persons on welfare in the home care workforce have been unsuccessful. A major deterrent has been the perception_and in some States the reality_that welfare payments and Medicaid benefits exceed the wages and benefits offered by the home care industry. This priority area is intended to demonstrate that this deterrent and others can be overcome by replicating existing, proven approaches or developing new approaches for employing welfare recipients in home care. Examples of existing approaches that merit consideration for replication are described below. Information on these programs is available by calling the Office of Program Development at 202&hyph;619&hyph;0441. •Denver Department of Social Services (DSS) project ``Apprenticeships for Health Services Paraprofessionals''_This approach, funded two years ago by AoA, successfully trained, placed, and provided initial career advancement ladders for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) recipients in nursing aide/home health aide positions. This was done in collaboration with the Department of Health and Human Services' Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) program and the Department of Labor's first successful nurses assistant/home health aide apprenticeship program. One key to the success of the Denver project was creative mixing of Title IV discretionary funding with those of others available in the community, e.g. Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), JOBS, and adult education, etc. The project also featured careful participant screening, extensive case management, mentoring, and supportive services, one year of training, internships, and apprenticeships resulting in an apprenticeship certification, guaranteed jobs and benefits, and guidance in future career paths. •Cooperative Home Care Associates (CHCA)_The CHCA program was established in the South Bronx in 1985 as a worker-owned cooperative that allows employees to participate in decision making about all aspects of the organization. They primarily train and employ single mothers who have previously been on welfare. After new employees complete a trial period, they can become worker-owners by pledging a member-equity investment, which can be deducted from weekly pay. The agency's wages are among the highest in the home care industry and the agency provides raises based on seniority. All employees receive health insurance, paid vacation, and sick time. The agency has provided funding for senior paraprofessionals to become LPNs. The annual turnover is less than 20 percent, far below the industry average. This priority area is designed to replicate and/or adapt the proven experiences of projects like those described above to new settings, or to demonstrate other innovative and promising approaches to employ public assistance recipients in home care programs. It is not intended to support the expansion of existing programs. Proposals shall contain an evaluation component that effectively measures project outcomes, particularly in terms of employment, wages and benefits received, retention, and reduction in welfare benefits. Project findings should demonstrate a program approach that will be of use to State and Area Agencies on Aging, local employment, social service, and other service agencies around the country. The proposal should contain a nationwide effort to disseminate project results to the aging network and other relevant agencies and organizations. State and Area Agencies on Aging, Tribal organizations, and other public and private non-profit organizations, institutions and agencies are eligible to submit an application under this priority area. As appropriate, applications should be developed in consultation with State and Area Agencies on Aging. The deadline date for submitting applications under this priority area is October 7, 1994. AoA intends to make approximately 2&hyph;3 awards under this priority area with a federal share of approximately $150,000 per year for a project period of two years. 1.5␣National Long Term Care Policy and Resource Center for Housing and Supportive Services As the nation engages in a debate to develop a national long term care strategy, it is important to recognize that a successful strategy must include choices for a wide range of housing options to serve as an alternative to institutionalization. For several reasons, among them the high likelihood that it can and does function as a service delivery point, housing is a significant factor which can affect how long term care home and community based services are delivered and financed. Too frequently, the significance of housing options and living arrangements have not been taken into sufficient consideration in attempts to develop comprehensive, coordinated long term care systems. Over the past several years AoA has supported a number of initiatives to expand elderly housing options. Our goal has been to increase the capacity of the aging network to work with other networks such as housing, finance, real estate, homebuilders, etc., and provide public education and information to the elderly and their families to make informed decisions about their housing choices. Important programmatic initiatives were launched in home equity conversion, shared housing, consumer housing information services, supportive services in federally assisted housing, accessory apartments, land use and zoning, home modifications and models for State Agency on Aging leadership roles in federally assisted housing. AoA has worked in partnership with other organizations, such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, to implement major initiatives in elderly housing. Despite these many program efforts elderly housing continues to be a complex subject which requires ongoing attention. It involves numerous levels of government and many public and private agencies. Because of the complexity of the subject it has been difficult for the aging network and others to develop comprehensive and coordinated approaches. Program development has been inhibited by a lack of up-to-date information, knowledge, expertise, and resources.
