The authority first wants binding promises from Pyongyang that the inspectors are permitted to carry out important control measures, IAEA spokesman Hans Friedrich Meyer told DPA in Vienna on Thursday [28 April]. "We will certainly not only stand aside and watch!" Last week, North Korea had offered to allow the IAEA to monitor the necessary exchange of the fuel rods. In the letter, the IAEA inspectors had been invited to be "present." "We explained to North Korea once again that we want to carry out inspection activities and what they are," Meyer said. As reported from diplomatic circles in Vienna, the nuclear authority wants to measure above all the burned-out fuel rods. The diplomats hope that such analyses will provide them with the information on whether plutonium was set aside for the construction of nuclear bombs. As early as in its first answer to Pyongyang, which accepted in principle the invitation from North Korea, the nuclear authority had pointed out that inspections are also becoming necessary again in the other nuclear plants. In particular, the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon is at issue. In contrasts to all agreements, North Korea denied access to the laboratory to the experts of the UN organization in the course of the latest IAEA inspection one month ago. As a result, the nuclear authority decided to refer the nuclear dispute to the UN Security Council.
