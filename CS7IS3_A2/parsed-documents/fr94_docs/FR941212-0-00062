FR941212-0-00062 FR941212-0-00017 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION 49 CFR Part 1039 [Ex Parte No. 346 (Sub-No. 31)] Rail General Exemption Authority_Exemption of Grease or Inedible Tallow AGENCY: Interstate Commerce Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission is exempting from regulation the transportation by rail of grease or inedible tallow, etc. (STCC No. 20&hyph;143). These commodities are added to the list of exempt commodities in 49 CFR part 1039, as set forth below. This exemption does not embrace exemptions from regulation of car hire and car service. On October 21, 1993, at 58 FR 54320, we requested comments on a proposal by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) to exempt from regulation the railroad transportation of grease or inedible tallow. The comments have been received and analyzed. We are approving AAR's proposal. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 11, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph H. Dettmar, (202) 927&hyph;5660.

Telephone (202) 289&hyph;4357/4359. [Assistance for the hearing impaired is available through TDD services: (202) 927&hyph;5721.] We reaffirm our initial finding that the exemption will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy resources. We also reaffirm our initial finding that the exemption will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
