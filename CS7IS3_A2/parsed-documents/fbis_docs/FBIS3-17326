[Nuri] Tajikistan's problem is not an ethnic, regional, or national one. It is not related to Tajikistan alone; it is a world problem. In other words, the war in Tajikistan does not involve only the Kulabs and the Khojands. The center of this war was all the Eastern and Western powers. When the first gathering was held [not further specified], more than 70 world correspondents came to Tajikistan and talked with them. They told all the Islamists that despite communist pressures they had preserved their religion and that if the expansion of Islam is not prevented in Tajikistan, the victory of the Muslims would be definite. Therefore, this was a plot that was hatched by the superpowers of the world. This was a plot that was engineered by the Zionists, executed by the United States, and implemented by Russia. Islam Karimov told the British that if Russia and Uzbekistan did not interfere in the Tajikistan war, an Islamic rule would be established. In other words, he proudly said: Since I, too, am someone who opposes Islamic regimes in the region, I am striving to annihilate Islamic fundamentalism. Thus, the Tajikistan problem is a world problem and the superpowers do not want an Islamic rule to be established. I have repeatedly said that Tajikistan is the door to Islam and the base of infidels. If the door to Islam is opened all the area that was formerly Muslim will turn to Islam and it will spread to all countries, but the infidels do not want this door to be opened. Thus, they have formed a barricade here from which they can attack regional areas; namely Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, as well as other countries. The extremely weak economic situation in Tajikistan has made the communist leaders sell the country's independence. Abdullodzhanov, chairman of the Council of Ministers, said that we even want to adhere to Russia. Some 70 percent of Tajikistan's budget is supplied by Russia. That country wants to take this area to revive the former Soviet Union. Also, there is a threat against the United States here because some days ago Russia signed a military pact with Kuwait for the sale of arms and thus paved the way for its presence there. The creation of a small Russia in northern Afghanistan is not only a threat to the people in this country but to the West as well. The United States thinks that Russia is under its control today. But Russia is doing what it wants, such as selling arms to other countries. By taking Tajikistan, Russia wants to continue its plans and gain access to warm water ports, either through Afghanistan or Tajikistan. In this case, the world will be placed under Russia's control. What Russia is now doing is against U.S. policies as well. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In view of the fact that the peace talks have reached an impasse, what plans does the Islamic Movement have? Does it consider talks with Russia and with the Tajik Government to be in its best interest? [Nuri] The Islamic Movement and all its officials will not refrain from any type of talks. In other words, they want talks. But these talks should not be a political game. They should be genuine talks that will benefit the nation. The Islamic Movement wants to hold talks with Russia. Before talking with the communist leaders of Tajikistan, we want to hold talks with Russia because it has been the cause of many adversities in our country and the entire world knows that 70 percent of Tajikistan's budget is supplied by Russia. Therefore, talking with the communist leaders of Tajikistan is meaningless. We have held more than 16 rounds of talks during the civil war since we knew that this war was not in the interest of the nation and it would not benefit either Islam or the people. We tried our best to make the people understand the truth. But it was obvious that several power-hungry people were bent on destroying everything. The person who was responsible for the failure of the talks was Rakhmanov, who is the leader of Tajikistan today. When parliament was formed in Khodzhand, Rakhmanov tried to sweet-talk the people and called for peace. He gathered all the commanders together and made peace among them. We decided to end the bloodshed and to let peace be established. We had a plan that Rakhmanov did not accept. The mujahidin commanders had told Rakhmanov that if he came to Dushanbe he would be welcomed with flowers, but he preferred to come with bloodshed. With his arrival in Dushanbe, murder and plunder started. House searches began and people were massacred. This happened because these people do not do their own thinking. Everything depends on Russia. This is why we want to hold talks with Russia so that we can understand its leaders' thoughts and stances and so that they will understand us, too. We fully believe in divine promise. We are fully confident of the spirit of the mujahidin. Even if this war continues for years, we will win. The communists are condemned to defeat by the mujahidin because the communists have never been on the front lines of the war. They bring the Muslims and the children of Muslims to fight. It does not make any difference to them. We have been told that the Jews are teaching their women and children English so that they will be ready when the time comes to flee and go to America or other places. Their children are not sent to war so that they will not be killed. It is the children of the people of Tajikistan--90 percent of the Tajiks are Muslim--who go to war. There may be communist forces in some places, but it is mainly the children of the Muslims who are involved in the war. This is a world plot based on letting Muslims be killed by Muslims. Nevertheless, we believe that we can hold talks and solve problems through political means. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What percent of the Tajik people are in the Islamic Movement and what role do Tajikistan's national and democratic forces play in the movement? [Nuri] When the Islamic Movement was an official party known as the "Islamic Movement Party," it had its special members and cadres. But when we emigrated, this movement became a general movement of Tajikistan. In 1975 the Islamic Movement adopted an organizational form, while before that there were dispersed movements. When communist rule came to Tajikistan, the elders and the 'ulema continued this movement clandestinely. In 1975, we gathered all the people's views into one place and prepared them for a struggle and for the expansion of Islam and of Islamic rights. Today, we can say that all the Muslims who are living for Islam at home or abroad are members of the movement. The role of the national and democratic forces in the Islamic Movement, and especially in northern Afghanistan, is very good. In other words, the democratic and national forces and all the expert forces who were employed in communist establishments and factories are all under the umbrella of the Islamic Movement today and are working with us. They also shoulder important responsibilities in the movement. They believe that in Tajikistan only Islam can solve the political, economic, and social problems of the people and that no other group or organization can do anything. Other organizations also support us. Through many efforts and struggles by the Islamic Movement in Afghanistan, which has given all it could, we have been able to establish a coordination center in Moscow. In short, I should say that in our current struggles all the ethnic groups, parties, and organizations support us. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is your opinion of the human rights groups and their lack of support for the just demands of the Islamic Movement of Tajikistan and of the Muslims? [Nuri] The behavior of human rights organizations toward us is surprising. There is a UN High Commission, which should help refugees and should not be dependent on any world policy. It should not differentiate among refugees, whether they are Tajiks, Uzbeks, communists, or Muslims. The UN Charter states that a calamity-stricken refugee should receive unconditional support. But, unfortunately there are 40,000 refugees in Tanduz [place name as received]. Only 8,000 of them were assisted by the United Nations. This assistance was stopped later on. For example, there are refugees in Mazar-e Sharif who are under Dostam's control. They have been assisted. But the refugees in Emam Saheb and Tash Kurgan [place name as received], who were helped up to a point, were taken to Bandar-e Shirkhan on the Tajik-Afghan border to make them return to Tajikistan. They were told that anyone who wanted assistance should go to Bandar-e Shirkhan. Some refugees went there and were placed under UN control. They then encouraged them to return to Tajikistan, but without promising them security. You, too, heard that many people who were repatriated were executed. The Medecins Sans Frontieres Organization announced that Muslim Tajiks in Tuz who did not give in to communism were massacred. They were the ones who reported on the dire and restless situation in the area. But they are still encouraging the people to return. We cannot say that it is the UN employees who are to blame because others are also not pursuing UN laws, but there are between 40,000 and 41,000 refugees in Tanduz who are not receiving any assistance. It is as though this organization does not officially recognize the refugees. Among their rights, which are not recognized, are education, health, and the protection of children. In their opinion, a needy person is someone who is not a Muslim and someone who professes Islam is not a human being. If a girl shoots at Husni Mubarak, the United Nations and the correspondents of the world will report on this extensively. But when children, women, and men are killed in wars and when young and old die of malaria or of other diseases, no one says anything. We have sent a letter to the UN offices in Mazar-e Sharif and in Pakistan and to Mr. Butrus-Ghali calling for humanitarian assistance for the refugees, but we have not received any reply yet. With the help of UN personnel, the water of a reservoir in Mazar-e Sharif, which was used by refugees, was poisoned and in one day 32 children and 200 others died. Everyone knew about this, but nothing was done. Only the head of the refugees there was deceived. Thus, the behavior of human rights organizations toward the Tajik refugees has not been good until now. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What are you asking from regional Islamic countries? [Nuri] As I have stated, the Tajikistan problem is not a problem in our country alone. It is a problem that is linked to all the Muslim countries. We should not ignore this. For example, it has been a year since Tajiks began living under dire conditions in Tajikistan and northern Afghanistan. There are about 100,000 refugees in Afghanistan, some of whom do not have shelter. These refugees have not been officially recognized by the Afghan Government until now, and politically they are not even considered full refugees. No Islamic country in the world has recognized them as refugees. No reports are heard on radio and television on these people and their problems. Let them not help because we know that the world is under pressure by the superpowers. Also, the Islamic countries too are being pressured by superpowers. They cannot overtly help the jihad in Tajikistan today.
