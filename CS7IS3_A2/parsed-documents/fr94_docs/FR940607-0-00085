FR940607-0-00085 FR940607-0-00018 C. In §291.410(d), and with regard to re-offering a property to an applicant, the rule is changed to provide that an unsold property will be re-offered to an applicant if no offer from the public has been accepted by HUD, rather than just received by HUD. D. Section 291.410(d) is further modified to show that written notification of interest in a particular property by the applicant may be sent via facsimile, and the Department encourages applicants to use this method of notification. Signed leases may also be transmitted in this manner, followed by submission of the original. E. Section 291.410(e) has been deleted from the final rule. The Department believes that this provision was redundant since §291.110, as published on October 20, 1993, in an interim rule amending the Single Family Property Disposition program, sets forth the same notification procedures. In the interest of simplification and readability, the Department has removed this provision. F. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of §291.425 have been changed to indicate that the sales price of any HUD-owned property acquired under this program will be discounted in an amount determined appropriate by the Secretary, but not less than 10 percent. This change will make the rule governing the homeless initiative consistent with an amendment to §291.110(a) in the October 20, 1993 interim rule for the Single Family Property Disposition program. IV. Discussion of Public Comments From Interim Rule The Department received 38 public comments in response to the proposed rule published on August 11, 1993. The following discussion summarizes the comments and provides HUD's responses to those comments. Every comment was reviewed and considered, although it may not be specifically addressed in this preamble. 30-day Public Listing Period: §291.400(c)(1) Comment: The Department received twenty-one comments objecting to the regulatory change which requires that HUD offer properties for sale to the public for 30 days prior to making them available for leasing to homeless providers. These commenters were generally concerned that only the least desirable properties would remain in the inventory after the 30-day public listing period for a variety of reasons: (a) The increased costs associated with repairing the least desirable properties; (b) the unsuitability of leasing remainder properties because of problems with accessibility to supportive services; and (c) the location of remainder properties often being in crime ridden areas. HUD's response: Section 1407(a) of the 1992 HCD Act requires that HUD first offer properties to the general public for at least 30 days before HUD makes such properties available for leasing to homeless providers. However, HUD believes that homeless providers will have a sufficient number of acceptable properties available for their programs in most housing markets when the 30 day marketing priority takes effect. This belief is based upon the number of single family properties currently in the Department's inventory and the number of new acquisitions projected throughout any given year. In addition, the Department will administer the exception provision of the law with attention to valid concerns of the participating homeless providers, and if in general a sufficient number of acceptable properties are not available to applicants after the public listing period, the Department will revisit the exception provision in the future. Exception to Public Listing Period and Consultation With Units of Local Government: §291.400(c)(2) Comment: Three commenters objected to the 200-unit exception to the 30-day public listing period requirement. One commenter suggested that exceptions be determined based upon the current level of usage of the homeless leasing program in an area, and input from each field office as to where and whether the exception should apply. One commenter recommended that the exception to the 30-day public listing period should apply whenever the inventory in a field office is less than 500 units. One commenter recommended that the Community Planning and Development Division in each field office work with Property Disposition staff to determine whether the exception to the 30-day listing period requirement should apply. HUD's response: The 200 property threshold, which will determine what field offices must offer their inventory to homeless providers on a priority basis, is based on HUD's experience administering the Homeless Initiative Program nationwide. The Department believes this is a reasonable benchmark which will ensure adequate property availability for homeless providers; however, if future program experience demonstrates a need for modification of this criterion to determine exception areas, the Department will respond appropriately. Comment: Section 1407(b) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 requires that HUD consult with units of local government in determining the area in which properties should be reserved for disposition under the exception to the 30-day public listing period. Several commenters recommended that HUD give local governments more input into the program. Eight commenters objected to HUD's exclusion of local communities from reviewing and approving of properties for the homeless on a case-by-case basis. Eight commenters suggested that HUD require that the program be consistent with the local CHAS. HUD's response: HUD has no control over which properties enter its inventory or where they will be located; therefore, there is no guarantee of property availability in areas designated by the locality for providing services to the homeless. However, in areas subject to section 1407(b), HUD will consult with local officials on an annual basis to determine which neighborhoods are targeted by the locality for provision of adequate supportive services necessary to conduct homeless programs. This consultation will be carried out in a manner to minimize any delay in making HUD owned properties available to homeless providers. While the language in section 1407(b) of the 1992 HCD Act provides for consultation on ``which properties should be reserved,'' HUD believes that Congress intended that the Department seek input from local governments on the specific geographic areas in these communities where the homeless population could best be served rather than seeking input on a property-by-property basis. Such a process would be administratively burdensome for both HUD and the unit of local government. HUD will make every effort to work with local governments and applicants; however, the decision on which properties are available is ultimately determined by the location of properties coming into inventory.
