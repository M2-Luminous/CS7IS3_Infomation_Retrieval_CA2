In the beginning of the 1990s, the Chinese Government worked out a plan to vitalize the industries of machinery, electronics, petrochemical industry, automobile and construction, and gradually make them pillar industries capable of driving the development of the whole economy. Sources from related departments show that in the past few years, these industries have generally maintained fairly high development speed, with their output value constituting a considerable part in the gross national product. They have also made significant breakthroughs in technical advancement, scale economy and some other aspects. An official from the Ministry of Machinery said that in 1993 the machinery industry finished a total output value of 360 billion yuan, an increase of 24 percent over the previous year. The output of mechanical equipment needed by the state's key construction projects has been largely increased, the research of key technical equipment has made smooth progress, such as the home- made 300,000-kw and 600,000-kw thermo power generating units, the cold and heat continuous rolling mills and blast furnace of the second-phase project of Baoshan Iron and Steel Company, which have reached the internationally advanced level. The country's electronics industry has begun its effort to organize large enterprise groups, in a bid to develop new and high- tech products with joint investment. In this aspect the ministry has already experienced success in building "Hualu" -- an ambitious video-corder production base, of which the first-phase project, capable of producing 1.5 million sets of key parts, became operational at the end of last year. So far, computers have been used in more than 20 industries including banking, railways, civil aviation, building materials, metallurgy, commerce and tourism, and the number of computers being used has exceeded 1.5 million. China's auto industry has been taking shape in recent years, with construction of the state's eight key production bases going smoothly and the output capacity rising fast. In 1993 the country's total auto output reached 1.28 million, up 20 percent from the previous year. The auto industry has introduced more than 200 items of technology in recent years, while at the same time making active efforts to increase the proportion of home-made parts. To date the proportion of home-made parts in "Santana" produced in Shanghai has exceeded 80 percent, while that of "Cherokee Jeep" in Beijing, "Peugeot" in Guangzhou and "Xiali (Charade)" in Tianjin have all exceeded 50 percent. As a result of improved quality, some China-made auto parts have already been exported. To make sure that the plan of "pillar industries" construction be fulfilled, the related ministries have all drafted special industrial policies to define the key points to be developed. For machinery industry, the key points are complete sets of equipment for transportation and energy, and basic machinery parts; for the electronics industry, they are integrated circuits, computers, telecommunications equipment and modern domestic appliances. The key parts for the construction industry are residential houses, public facilities and industrial buildings, while that for the auto industry are sedan cars, light trucks and auto parts.
