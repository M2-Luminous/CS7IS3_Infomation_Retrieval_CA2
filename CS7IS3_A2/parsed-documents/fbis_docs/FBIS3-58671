Writing in the 30 December Athens center-left daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA, Nikos Kiaos blames Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou for lacking a central policy, despite claims during his electoral campaign that PASOK was ready to govern and, hence, possessed solutions for the problems he inherited. Initiatives in the domestic field, according to Kiaos, have lacked the needed essential coordination. Measures have been taken "helter-skelter," resulting in the submission of only a few bills to the Chamber of Deputies. While low-key tones and consensual solutions were stressed in the first few weeks of government, in a departure from past acrimonious politics, governmental initiatives have indicated a return to "partisan patriotism" at times worse than the former New Democracy (ND) Government's excesses, Kiaos contends. While this occurred in the field of public transportation and in the armed forces appointments, the economy is the sector where the lack of a specific program has become most apparent, he notes. The government had announced a dialogue with the various social classes, setting the middle of January for the implementation of the measures to be adopted. Kiaos believes the deadline will pass without significant results, for the interlocutors of a "weak and unstable" government remain inflexible. Foreign policy is another sector that is deeply affected. The Skopje problem remains unresolved and Greece is taking over the EU [European Union] presidency at a time when relations with its partners are "particularly poor." Kiaos' proof of the lack of coordination is that Papandreou neglected to meet with either the minister of foreign affairs or his deputy before they traveled to Brussels on 20 December, where the former was to deal with the Bosnian situation and the latter participated in the meeting of EC foreign ministers. While the government has only been in place for a brief time, this short period has been sufficient to give an indication of its future, unsatisfactory course, Kiaos concludes. The lack of governmental coordination is discussed in an article in the 24 December right-of-center Athens daily ELEVTHEROS TIPOS. The article focuses on the disagreement between Minister of National Economy Yiorgos Yennimatas, who advocates an "immediate and drastic" cut in interest rates, and Bank of Greece Governor Yiannis Boutos, who "categorically" opposes such a move, arguing that Yennimatas' positions "do not take into account the real economic situation." The article also stresses the personal side of the disagreement, pointing out that the two officials are on "different wave lengths" within PASOK and that Yennimatas was displeased with Boutos' appointment at the helm of the Bank of Greece. Furthermore, it contends that Yennimatas is being "undermined" by other party "heirs apparent," as well as certain--unnamed--close Papandreou aides intent on his replacement. Finally, the article cites Bank of Greece sources as stating that Yennimatas is under pressure from a number of state-owned bank governors to lower the interest on government bonds to allow them to reduce interest on deposits, and hence on loans to commercial and private entities, with a view to increasing their own profit margins.
