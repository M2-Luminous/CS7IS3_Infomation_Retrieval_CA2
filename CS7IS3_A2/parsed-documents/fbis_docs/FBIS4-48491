The UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] negotiating team this morning informed its government counterpart that it was not able to take part in the talks because the UNITA leader had not given the green light to the issues raised by the UNITA negotiators about Vorgan [Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel]. The government accepted the UNITA negotiators' request for an adjournment because that is the prerogative of the two teams. There are decisions that the two negotiating teams cannot make without consulting their leaders. Today the two delegations held separate meetings. A well-placed UNITA source said in Lusaka today that the issues raised with Jonas Savimbi are not only linked to Vorgan, but also to the government's reaction to UNITA's participation at various levels of government. UNITA says the (?government's reaction) has been negative. There is nothing scheduled for tomorrow. It all depends on UNITA. Meanwhile, the government continues to wait patiently.
