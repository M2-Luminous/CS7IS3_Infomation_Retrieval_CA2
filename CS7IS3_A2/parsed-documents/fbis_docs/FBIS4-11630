This spirit saw in these threats to an Afro-Arab country not only a danger to this state's security and territorial integrity, but also a danger to the security, future, and stability of the Arab region as a whole. The decision, adopted during the 101st session which just met in Cairo, expressed great concern about the foreign plots aimed at separating the south and the support for the secessionist rebels, as well as the open incitement of the rebels to demand self-determination as a pretext to divide a sovereign state. The Arab states' concern arises from a recognition of the danger of breaking up a state which is a member of the Arab League, not only for the effect such secession would have on the state concerned, but also for the encouragement this gives other separatist movements. This would fragment Arab unity and provide room for foreign interference in the internal affairs of other states. [passage omitted] The current obstacles to the march of peace in Sudan will not affect the determination of its sons and will not thwart their efforts. Indeed, these obstacles will add strength to their strength, through the unanimity of all Arab states to work to preserve the territorial integrity of Sudan and to confront any threat to it. All this was confirmed by the speeches of the foreign ministers of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Jordan, Morocco, and Iraq at the Arab League session. They all stressed that Sudan's territorial integrity and security were that of the entire Arab nation and any threat to this integrity and security was a threat to all Arab states. [passage omitted] As Foreign Minister Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih has confirmed, the government and people of Sudan are working with determination and sincerity to find a peaceful solution to the southern problem based on just and comprehensive acceptable to all parties and have responded to all the initiatives of brothers and friends. These initiatives, however, will not bear fruit unless there is an end to the interference by some states and circles in Sudan's internal affairs, as well as their plotting to separate the south. Sudan is well able to resist these plots, supported as it is by the solidarity of the Arab states and other brothers and friends. Success comes from God.
