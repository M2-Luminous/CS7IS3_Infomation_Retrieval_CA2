After they had used chemical agents several times, they launched infantry attacks, which, as in the past, were futile and unsuccessful. Unable to realize their intentions, the Chetniks shelled civilian facilities according to their old scenario, though not as intensively as in the past few days. The aggressor has used all the available weapons in the offensive on our defense lines. Fresh forces are coming from the so-called Yugoslavia. This is evident from the mobilization calls sent via the aggressor's media. The media reports that brothers from Nis will help (?these) Serbs in liberating Serbian territories. To what extent the aggressor considers important the regions of Bugojno, Turbe, and Vlasic is evident from the fact that it has issued mobilization calls to women. The Serbian media is devoting most space to appeals for blood donors. This is the best illustration of the losses that the Golden Lilies of the 7th Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina have inflicted on them.
