Nor does it hesitate to claim that the Arab party is responsible for halting this progress. It does not conceal that it wants complete Arab recognition, an end to the Arab boycott, open borders, established diplomatic and economic ties, and so forth, without its officials uttering the words "complete withdrawal," which they have all failed to say so far. Here, we can see the large gap separating Israel's proposals and the principles and foundations of the peace process, particularly the UN resolutions on whose basis the regional peace process started. The Israeli leaders are apparently still gambling on drawing Syria into bargaining over land and rights, despite the conviction that it is impossible to make peace with Syria without returning the entire Syrian Golan Heights, without Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, and without establishing just and comprehensive peace in an area that will not see stability or tranquility without a just solution and a comprehensive peace. As long as the Israelis insist on marketing their own concept of peace, their own excuses for keeping land, and their own incomplete view of peace in the region -- a view based on individual solutions and unilateral deals -- it is only natural that the climate of disappointment persists. Political observers in the Arab and international arenas realize that Israel is responsible for these disappointments and for the failure of international efforts so far to achieve any results. They realize Israel is responsible for the failure to resume the bilateral talks, and, consequently, for not achieving any progress worth mentioning in the entire peace process. Therefore, the whole world now realizes, more than at any time before, what direction has to be followed, and where pressure should be applied to activate the peace process and save what is left of it in a responsible and serious way. We do not think anyone in this world wants Arabs to relinquish their rights and their land, or to abandon the most basic principles on which the peace process was based. This would not achieve peace. Even if it was achieved superficially in one aspect, it would not survive. In this case, it would be an empty peace, lacking the most basic principles of continuity. Establishing peace and seizing the opportunities available today to achieve it require, before anything else, a commitment to implementing the UN resolutions in letter and spirit, and complete withdrawal to the borders that existed before the aggression of June 1967. Only then will the statement on goodwill, which the Israelis keep bragging about, come forth. The occupied territories are Arab and the usurped rights are Arab, not the opposite.
