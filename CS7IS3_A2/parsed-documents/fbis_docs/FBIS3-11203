In a communique published in the Haitian capital, Bonn explained its decision as a consequence of the serious economic and political crisis resulting from the 30 September 1991 coup d'etat. The foreign representations in Port-au-Prince have been obliged to buy fuel at a very high cost on the black market for several months. Some neighborhoods in the capital have electricity only three hours a day. Bonn deems this necessary closing regrettable because of the traditional friendship and excellent cooperation between the two countries in the past. While pointing out that humanitarian aid will be maintained as long as possible through nongovernmental organizations and churches, the German Government advises that financial and technical cooperation remains suspended. The consular tasks [word indistinct] of the Port-au-Prince embassy will henceforth be performed by the General Consulate of the Federal Republic of Germany in Florida, the communique adds.
