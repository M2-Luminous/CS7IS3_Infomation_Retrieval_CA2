Variations on the theme of "Radetskyy's march" were crowned with a mighty chord -- the suggestion that the ground was being sounded out "for the introduction in Crimea of a special form of rule whereby the Crimean president would be subordinate to a representative of the Ukrainian president." Of itself the report is such that it could cause the utmost tension not only of sinews but also of all other muscles, including the heart: There would be no worse news today for the CIS, Europe, and the rest of the world than the specter of mounting military confrontation between Russia and Ukraine. Reports from Nikolay Semena, our correspondent in Crimea, and from the journalists of other mass media and explanations from official Kiev allow us to relax a little: The Ukrainian defense minister has not visited Crimea and a group of high-ranking military officials from that independent state visited the peninsula under the plan for inspection visits. Nonetheless, we cannot relax completely. Armed conflicts are always preceded and then constantly attended by a "war of words." But while on the battle fields absolutely standard firearms and heavy weaponry are used, on the news agency tapes, in the newspapers, and on television and radio weapons of mass destruction are often fired and blown up -- weapons known in journalists' jargon as "black propaganda" [chernukha]. And the blacker it is the more perfect in the eyes of its designers and purveyors and the broader its range. Disinformation as a means of pushing public opinion toward approving necessary political decisions and supporting "certain steps in a particular direction," and psychological warfare as a selection of tools to destabilize and upset interstate relations is the subject of a separate conversation. For the time being I should like to say the following: All my personal experience of work in trouble spots, be it in Abkhazia or South Ossetia, attests that disinforming "black propaganda" feeds conflicts more powerfully than irresponsible statements, actions, and steps by some statesmen and politicians. It kills people more surely than an AKM-47 or RPG grenade throwers and it kills them in the literal sense -- I do not have the space now to cite the examples and names I know. I have frequently held in my hands a radio intercept of talks between some "source" and some reporter in which the former has given an account of, for instance, "atrocities committed by the Georgians" and the latter has shyly wondered whom he should quote. "I shall tell you later," the "source" has reassured him. I don't want it later, I would like it now. But since that is not entirely possible let us restrict ourselves to general considerations: Attempts to turn the bluest sea in the world and indeed other not entirely happy regions and spheres into a black sea of disinformation are fraught with danger.... It remains to ascertain how eagerly public opinion will demand similar attempts to aggravate Russian-Ukrainian and not just Russian-Ukrainian relations (see the list of CIS countries). Specific sociological research methods would be a good thing here but for the time being my personal feeling is enough: They would not be particularly eager to make this demand.
