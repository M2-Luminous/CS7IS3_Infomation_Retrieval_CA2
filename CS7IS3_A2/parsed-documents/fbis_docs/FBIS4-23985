FBIS4-23985 "drafr119_e_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-119 Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia Renews Appeal for ECOMOG Deployment Renews Appeal for ECOMOG Deployment AB2006131594 Monrovia Radio ELBC in English 0900 GMT 20 Jun 94 AB2006131594 Monrovia Radio ELBC English BFN [Text] The Liberian Peace Council [LPC] is again appealing to the West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], to be deployed in areas under the LPC's control. The LPC secretary general, Octavius Walker, said the LPC has persistently called on ECOMOG to deploy in Rivercess, Sinoe, Grand Gedeh, and other areas. He said ECOMOG has refused to do so because ECOMOG wants the LPC to declare unilateral cease-fire (?even though) it is not a party to the Cotonou Accord. But Mr. Walker told LINA [LIBERIA NEWS AGENCY] on Saturday [18 June] that he does not understand why ECOMOG cannot take advantage of their offer when the peacekeepers responded to a similar offer in Tubmanburg, Bomi County, at a time there was fighting in the Bomi area. Mr. Walker said since there is no fighting in Rivercess, Sinoe, Upper Grand Gedeh, and Grand Bassa Counties, ECOMOG should test the willingness of the LPC to cooperate in the peace process by deploying peacekeepers in those areas. Meanwhile, the ECOMOG High Command has insisted on the cessation of hostilities as a precondition for deployment.
