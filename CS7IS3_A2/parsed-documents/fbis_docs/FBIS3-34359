In an interview with AL-AHRAM held at his place of residence in "al-Husayn" in Aden, al-Bid stressed that Yemen cannot allow itself to be a base for domestic or foreign terrorism, especially to the extent that is harming the Egyptian people. He said that all the Arab countries will find themselves in a difficult situation if they do not stand united against terrorism. Al-Bid added that the YSP leaderships went voluntarily to the capital, Sanaa, with the backing of all the electoral districts. He said that the party has made sacrifices that eliminated the discrepancy in development resulting from the past division and isolation, in order to create a state of law and order, a state that takes the united Yemeni homeland into the 21st century and not back to the 19th century, a state governed according to a new Yemeni social contract and not merely a signed document of pledge and agreement or "a forced return to the family house" -- which is what would ensue once that document is bypassed and negated and the guarantees, executive programs and timetables for implementation are abandoned. The YSP secretary general went on to say that the current crisis has posed a real test for his country of its ability to establish a state of institutions, modernity, and stability despite the complications of confrontation. He said that there has been no clear, unified vision of a unified state. He added that the anti-YSP forces have not given it enough time, and they have pushed it into an unenviable position through the assassination of leading figures and statesmen, and even the violation of houses. Al-Bid said that he regards the "Pledge and Agreement Document" as a mere "way station" to put the course of unity in the unified state into the hands of the Yemeni people. He noted that the crisis is not a personal issue between him and President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih but a crisis among all the ruling Yemeni organizations, bodies, and parties that are participating in the current dialogue. He added that all the agreements signed during the past four years since unity was established have been set aside and in practice we have moved in the opposite direction. He stressed that the principles of democracy, coalition, and a state of law and order are enough to take care of the unity program and advance it. Al-Bid began his interview with AL-AHRAM by saying:"It was a historic moment when we went to live in our capital Sanaa to establish our program, which the Yemeni national movement has long struggled to achieve. During our stay in Sanaa, we exerted all our efforts, but unfortunately we discovered that not all of us had a clear vision of the practical program. In other words, events showed that our vision of and belief in the program was not identical. Still, we do understand that a historic task such as this one is not easy to accomplish without suffering, sacrifices, and enough patience. The forces opposed to this program did not give us enough time to think calmly. They placed the YSP in an unenviable position through assassinations and by targeting leading figures and statesmen, such as the Chamber of Deputies speaker, the prime minister, the justice minister, and the YSP Political Bureau members. All of them were targeted directly and the last thing these forces did was to violate our houses. The Yemeni vice president said: Yet we exerted every effort for the sake of unity and we do not regret what we have offered for our cause. We also tried to choose the path of democracy and proposed a coalition to sponsor the unity plan, because we saw various conflicting trends in the Arab world. We thought perhaps this initiative would act as a way out and confront everyone with their responsibilities for building a homeland at this difficult juncture. Al-Bid affirmed that all the signed agreements have been put aside and that work was being conducted according to the others' convictions, making no effort to draw up a democratic, unionist plan for Yemen. He explained: We have now reached an understanding within the framework of the Pledge and Agreement Document, which is a document of national consensus that we subscribed to and had our own view on. We agreed that it should form the common ground for us to rectify the path of unity. Anyone who wants unity has to defend under appropriate conditions -- a state of unity, for which I was most enthusiastic. After the 22 May "joy" we had in Yemen, which left behind overwhelming passions, I consider that the 18 January "joy" brings national awareness. Hence, let us pause at this juncture and proceed together to rectify the course of unity guided by the hands of the Yemeni people. I believe that a genuine state of unity that entails the requirements for construction and the establishment of this democratic plan is primarily a "compound" state. The gist of the document leads to this goal, but we the Arabs regrettably always work according to passions, not reason. If we relied on reason we would have been wiser. The secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party went on: Nearly four years have passed since unity was established but the question remains: What is the situation now in Yemen? He replied: They say that the YSP is pursuing separation. When we went to Sanaa with our sons we were treated like immigrants. What did we go for and who dictated that we should go there? We went voluntarily and won the support of all electoral constituencies in the southern and eastern governorates and our citizens. This party offered what it should offer for unity, carried the banner of democracy and coalition, demanded a country of law and order, and offered sacrifices on behalf of the entire nation--150 cadres and leaders from our membership. We did not stop where the gangs and those behind them wanted. He emphasized: The Socialist Party thinks of the future; it is not limited to just one individual. When we embarked on unity, we realized that we were chasing a dream. Some of us were overwhelmed by the sense of the saying "Moving from one framework to another provides an opportunity." Despite this, we all felt that we were the partisans of a cause and backers of a unionist, democratic plan, considering the plan's regulatory mechanism on the one hand and the actual situation in Yemen on the other. Al-Bid pointed out that the YSP had presented 18 points, which were supported by the Yemeni masses. "We conceded these points in return for the "Pledge and Agreement Document," the document on national consensus. Now, we want to implement this document." He added: "The document is not ideal, but neither is it impossible, as some believe. However, it contains our minimum goals; and we need to approach it responsibly, not by merely signing it and `returning to the house of obedience' [legal term meaning for a court to order a reluctant wife to live with her husband]. Our relationship with the leadership in Yemen does not mean that we should return to the house of obedience. We are looking to establish a new social contract, which was delineated in the pledge and agreement document. We now have to proceed from another starting point. Our Yemeni character will enable the leadership to overcome all their differences." The YSP secretary general affirmed that individual security cannot be separated from public security in the state. Security cannot be restricted to the leaders without thinking about the security of the state as a whole. "The document affirms the importance of establishing a state of law and order, a state that can rectify the differences in progress between the two parts of Yemen and the isolation that existed in the past, a state that will enter the 21st century without returning to the 19th century. When we signed the unity paper, I did not have in mind returning Yemen to the 19th century." Al-Bid then responded to reports about tampering with the budget for the oil project at Hadramawt, the objective of which is said to be to divert funds to buy weapons and ammunition in preparation for a military confrontation between the two sides. He said: "This agreement must be approved by Parliament and the Council of Ministers. It is signed by foreign companies. The things that are rumored and have been published are impossible. How can funds be withdrawn or added in an agreement made by the YSP? Those who spread these rumors should have provided their evidence. Otherwise, these accusations can be categorized as cheap and absurd, especially since they deal with money. Shame on them." Answering a question on the degree of understanding between the Chairman of the Presidential Council 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his deputy, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, and whether their relationship has reached a dead end, al-Bid said: "First, the issue is not personal. Reports always claim that the conflict is between the president and his deputy. True, we are responsible for leading this country, but we do so through organizations, parties, and councils. The issue is now out of the hands of the coalition parties and in the hands of the sides now taking part in the national dialogue. Any honest person will take a positive stand on this document by providing guarantees and starting to implement the measures in the relevant documents within a definite time frame." He affirmed that the Committee for Dialogue Among the Yemeni Political Forces is entrusted with taking a decisive stand on the whole subject, saying: We support any decision they reach regarding this crisis. I believe that this is a real test of our belief in our cause, the cause of building a unified and democratic Yemeni homeland. There is widespread support for this cause; this proves that Yemenis are capable of resolving their differences on the basis of the pledge and agreement document according to the democratic process. There is broad conviction in all Yemen that Yemenis want a life of recognized establishments, civilian normality, and stability for themselves and those around them. Therefore we will not be influenced by all the elements who want to push Yemen to a clash. Al-Bid added: "The crisis has shown that the Yemenis reject terrorism and violence, for these things conflict with the democratic process. It also showed their desire for social justice and for a homeland united in a state that is "fitted together" [ murakkabah] and can resolve the differences in development, competition, opinion and counter-opinion, and diversity." He explained: "If 22 May 1990 was Declaration of Unity Day, then 18 January is the day of rectifying the unity process. Rectification always faces difficulties, especially as it normally conflicts with habitual practices. The force of habit deprives people of their will; as the Yemeni proverb says, "Stopping a habit causes hostility." Despite this, the crisis is not over. Our worst fear is that the document will just be used to bypass the crisis and to deprive it of any substance. The document therefore needs an executive program and timetable with priorities. One of the priorities is to arrest the outlaws who carried out the bombings and assassinations. Al-Bid went on to say: "We do not want Yemen to be a base for terrorism, either in the Arab homeland or worldwide, because it is unthinkable for Yemen to follow a democratic course and be a base for terrorism. But it is worth recalling that many Arabs became involved in Afghanistan with the support of foreign international powers; but when these Afghan Arabs returned to their Arab lands and peoples that enjoyed security and safety, such as Egypt, Algeria, and Yemen, they began to suffer from this tribulation [terrorism]. All these are signs of an alternative plan for ruling. It is a terrorist plan that opposes development and is threatening the Arab nation. We believe that the Yemeni unity program is the nucleus of a pan-Arab, democratic, and unionist plan and we are enthusiastic about it. There is no harm in continuing with it despite the difficulties in implementing it, but we should be wise and deal with the reality consciously." Regarding the extent of foreign intervention to escalate the Yemeni crisis, al-Bid said: "We have a crisis, but it is under discussion and the subject of a national dialogue. We should not blame it on others. The Arabs have this habit, in the past and now, of blaming foreign interference for their domestic crises in order to end them. If we look at the recent past to find those who had foreign ties, the question then becomes: Who are they? Who are these, whom we have reared and fed? Therefore, there is no need to open these files now. We are facing rulers whose mentalities are not equal to the cause. Yet this could help in rectifying the unity process." He noted that the majority of regimes in the Arab countries are not thinking about development and stability as much as they are thinking about holding on to power. We believe that democracy is the right way to achieve stability and development. The Arab countries will find themselves in a difficult situation if they do not stand against the creeping terrorist tide.
