This will set up Mr Kriel for a head-on clash in the election campaign against African National Congress [ANC] Western Cape premiership nominee Dr Allan Boesak. It is understood that Mr Kriel's main "rival" for the post, Cape administrator Cobus Meiring, fared less well than his supporters expected. The party's head council will meet on Monday to integrate and finalise the candidate lists but as one senior delegate said, it would "look very strange" if Mr Kriel did not get the nomination after the substantial support he received. Cape NP delegates met at various centres in the province on Saturday to elect candidates for the national and provincial election lists. Mr Kriel gained the most support from altogether 1,300 delegates from the rural and metropolitan areas -- meeting in Worcester and Stellenbosch respectively. There has been much speculation over recent weeks about the party's top candidate for the region. Several months ago Mr Kriel announced he would be standing for the Western Cape regional parliament and indicated he would aiming for the top post. Cape administrator Cobus Meiring had also indicated his willingness to stand for the post. It is understood that MECs [member of Executive Council] Peter Marais and Mrs Martha Olckers and MPs Gerald Morkel and Patrick McKenzie are also placed in the top 10 nominations for the provincial parliament. Cape NP leader Dr Dawie de Villiers is believed to have topped the list for national assembly candidates while finance spokesman Dr Francois Jacobsz, MEC Frik van Deventer, Deputy Trade and Industry Minister David Graaff and National Education Minister Piet Marais also are among the top 10. All NP candidates lists are expected to be released early this week before the party's federal congress which starts on Tuesday at the World Trade Centre in Kempton Park.
