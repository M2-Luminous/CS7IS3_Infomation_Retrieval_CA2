Speaking to newsmen in Islamabad yesterday evening, Benazir Bhutto said the Kashmir dispute is a vital element of Pakistan's foreign policy. She said Pakistan strongly believes that the struggle of the Kashmiris is legitimate and hence Pakistan should continue to support them diplomatically and politically. The prime minister said the basic objective of raising the Kashmir issue at the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva was to highlight it at the international level. She said its effects can be judged from the fact that during the Commission's session, there was some respite in Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir. India was constrained to discourage its 600,000 soldiers from committing human rights violations and to grant permission to the international human rights organizations and diplomats of Islamic Conference Organization. Turning to the nuclear issue, Benazir Bhutto stated in clearcut terms that Pakistan will not sacrifice its peaceful nuclear program at any cost. She categorically stated that Pakistan is pursuing this policy after thinking about it fully, as it cannot sacrifice its knowledge and expertise in this vital field. She said it was India who violated the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty by exploding a nuclear devise. Referring to Pakistan-U.S. relations, the prime minister said talks are being held in Washington on ways to strengthen the friendly ties between the two countries. Describing the Pressler Amendment as a hindrance to ties, she said her government's policy is to see that Pakistan does not come under any pressure due to this amendment. She said pressure should be exerted on India, who has violated the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
