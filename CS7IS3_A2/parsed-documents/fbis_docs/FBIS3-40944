So today we continue the topic of a nuclear-free Ukraine. Talking with our correspondent Vitaliy Lytvynov, Colonel General Ivan Oliynyk, deputy defense minister for arms issues, speaks on the military, scientific, and technological aspects of the implementation of the trilateral statement and an appendix to it on the elimination of nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine: Oliynyk, in Russian with superimposed Ukrainian translation: "The atmosphere at the meeting between the three presidents on 14 January 1994 was exceptionally friendly and benevolent. It was one of respect. The timing of the meeting was no accident. It had been predetermined by a number of factors which need airing and explaining today. Factor 1 is the technical condition of the nuclear warheads in Ukraine today. Factor 2 is our difficult economic situation. And, finally, Factor 3 is that both the president and government had to implement the decisions taken by the Ukrainian Supreme Council." Lytvynov: The world has reacted to this in a very positive manner. The interpretation of this issue here in Ukraine, however, is not uniform, in particular because the people are concerned about us actually becoming defenseless should we rid ourselves of our nuclear forces. This is how our collocutor answered this question: Oliynyk: "The condition of the arms and the purpose of their use in Ukraine (?did not have any bearing) on the issues of our security. We do not control these weapons, we cannot maintain them in the technically perfect condition and we cannot but implement the decision taken by our state to become non-nuclear in future." "With regard to our security, it can be viewed from two standpoints. That is, relying on our own forces and creating non- nuclear weapons that can enable us to ensure the protection of our state; after all, we are a great rocket and space power. It should also be said that we hope the pledges that were given by the United States, the Russian Federation, and Great Britain will be carried into effect both in respect of our state and the international community." Correspondent: Answering the question on how long, what is the duration of the process of nuclear disarmament the Ukrainian deputy defense minister said: Oliynyk: "This is a lengthy process which is to be determined by the technical condition and the possibility to safely move these weapons over a long distance by transporting them. Everybody today wants to hear when the first and the last weapon will be removed. The state must have its own state secrets, for these are very dangerous and unusual weapons. That is why to advertise today when a train will cross Ukraine by railway over a distance of over 700 km to our western borders is unnecessary and risky. We must keep this transport a secret, to ensure safe transportation."
