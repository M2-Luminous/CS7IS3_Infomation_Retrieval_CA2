FBIS3-25256 "drafr030_c_94018" FBIS-AFR-94-030 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Feb 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Spokesman Denies Accusations MB1102200294 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network in Afrikaans 1800 GMT 11 Feb 94 MB1102200294 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network Language: Afrikaans Article Type:BFN [Excerpts] The Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN today claimed that President F. W. de Klerk had told lies when he revealed details last year about South Africa's nuclear weapons program. The paper reported that the court records of the trial behind closed doors in 1989 of an air force officer, Brigadier Johan Blaauw, indicate that South Africa and Israel exchanged nuclear weapons technology, and that extensive cooperation had taken place between the two countries. [passage omitted] President De Klerk said today that a statement on the matter will be released as soon as possible. In its reaction to the report, the Atomic Energy Corporation has denied that South Africa provided nuclear weapons technology to other countries. Chief Executive Officer Dr. (Waldo Schtupf) said in a statement that President de Klerk was correct in saying that South Africa had never exchanged nuclear weapons technology. He said tritium has several commercial uses and South Africa had purchased the material from various sources. On the delivery of uranium oxide to Israel, he said South Africa has for a long time been involved in trading in the material and had delivered it to several countries, including some which do not manufacture nuclear weapons. Cape Province Attorney General Frank Kahn said the police have been instructed to investigate the publication of documents relating to the trial, which had been held in camera.
