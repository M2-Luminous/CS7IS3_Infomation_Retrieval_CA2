Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev signed NATO's cooperation plan in the presence of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Brussels Wednesday [22 June]. In an interview with BNS, Januska also emphasized the significance of other accords between Russia and NATO, which will create "clear and stable relations, enhance stability and security in Europe." The Lithuanian official said a separate political agreement between Russia and the alliance proves that Partnership for Peace cannot resolve all problems hindering stability in Europe, but is only a part of a possibly much wider strategy. "It is evident in this context that certain consultations between NATO and Russia, carried out beyond the partnership framework, concerning nuclear arms, their control, problems of mutual disarmament, restrictions on deployment of troops and hot lines for cases of potential conflicts, are understandable in creating an atmosphere of trust in Europe," the deputy minister said. In Januska's words, Lithuania may also be interested to develop a program for wider cooperation with NATO. Considering Lithuania's determination to become a fully-fledged member of the alliance, and how Lithuania's individual needs to cooperate with NATO will be evaluated, possibilities of a wider accord between Lithuania and NATO could be discussed, at the same time expanding practical cooperation within the partnership program, Januska said. Hopefully, the deputy minister said, a role in building European security will be given not only to big, important and well-armed countries, but also to nations, which found themselves in an uncertain security situation not through their own fault.
