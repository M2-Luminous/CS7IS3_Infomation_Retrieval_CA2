SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Wildlife Laboratories, Inc. The NADA provides for the subcutaneous use of melatonin implant in healthy male and female kit and adult female mink to accelerate the fur priming cycle. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marcia K. Larkins, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;112), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;0614. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Wildlife Laboratories, Inc., 1401 Duff Dr., suite 600, Fort Collins, CO 80524, filed NADA 140&hyph;846 which provides for the subcutaneous use of melatonin implant in healthy male and female kit and adult female mink ( Mustela vison ) to accelerate the fur priming cycle. The drug product is an implant consisting of a silicone rubber elastomer that contains 2.7 milligrams of homogeneously dispersed melatonin. The NADA is approved as of June 21, 1994, and the regulations are amended in part 522 (21 CFR part 522) by adding new §522.1350 to reflect the approval. The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom of information summary. In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and §514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(i)), this approval qualifies for 5 years of marketing exclusivity beginning June 21, 1994, because no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) has been approved in any other application. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
