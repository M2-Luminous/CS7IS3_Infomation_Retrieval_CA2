Mr. Tshisekedi, whose words were reported today by the weekly L'INTRUS, made this statement at the end of a meeting with the Belgian ambassador to Kinshasa, Jean Coene, who visited him yesterday. "I will not be represented anywhere. I am and will remain the prime minister," Mr. Tshisekedi said, adding that "if the HCR members are manipulated by Mobutu, they will find us in their way." Following the agreements signed between the presidential group and the radical opposition after four months of negotiations, the HCR has merged with the PT to become the HCR-PT. It is now the duty of the HCR-PT to appoint the new prime minister charged with managing the transition. On this point, Mr. Tshisekedi said he considers the negotiations "as an amendment of the transitional constitution drawn up by the CNS which does not call the gains of the CNS into question." The HCR-PT is currently meeting in various commissions to contribute to a "joint decision" on the transition by both the CNS and the political conclave of the Presidential Group.
