Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who came to power only two months ago, decided to resign with his cabinet en masse Saturday only a few hours before the House of Representatives was to vote on a no- confidence motion submitted by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party. The minister of international trade and industry told reporters after the extraordinary cabinet meeting to decide on the resignation that a psychological impact on the Japan-U.S. trade talks is unavoidable. He expressed hope that a new cabinet will be formed as soon as possible to tackle the issue, adding that a broad policy accord has already been reached and the basic approach toward the conclusion of the talks will not change. He said a package of economic deregulation measures to be completed by the government toward the end of the month will be carried out as scheduled.
