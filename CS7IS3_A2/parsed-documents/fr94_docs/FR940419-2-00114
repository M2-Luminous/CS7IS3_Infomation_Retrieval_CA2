FR940419-2-00114 FR940419-2-00067 [Docket No. 030&hyph;01204, License No. 01&hyph;00643&hyph;02 EA 92&hyph;204] Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Birmingham, AL; Order Imposing Civil Monetary Penalty I The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Birmingham, Alabama (Licensee) is the holder of Byproduct Material License No. 01&hyph;00643&hyph;02 (License), issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR parts 30 and 35. The Licensee is authorized to possess and use byproduct material for diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures, and for research and development purposes. This is a broad scope license and use of licensed material on humans is permitted by or under the supervision of a physician authorized by the Licensee's Radiation Safety Committee, subject to the training and experience requirements in 10 CFR Part 35, Subpart J. The License was most recently amended on April 10, 1992, and was due to expire on July 31, 1992. The License is currently under timely renewal. II On September 13, 1991, an allegation was received by the NRC relating to possible administrations of radiopharmaceuticals in excess of prescribed dosages and possible falsification of records to conceal the misadministration. As a result, an investigation was conducted by the NRC Office of Investigations from October 9, 1991, through September 14, 1992. The results of the investigation indicated that the Licensee had not conducted its activities in full compliance with NRC requirements. A written Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) was served upon the Licensee by letter dated September 13, 1993. The Notice addressed the nature of the violations, the provisions of the NRC's requirements that had been violated, and the amount of the civil penalty proposed for the violations. The Licensee responded to the Notice by two letters dated November 9, 1993. In its response, the Licensee admitted Violations A and C.1, denied Violations B and C.2, and requested partial mitigation of the civil penalty based on its prior performance. III After consideration of the Licensee's response and the statements of fact, explanation, and argument for partial mitigation contained therein, the NRC staff has determined, as set forth in the Appendix to this Order, that the violations occurred as stated and that the penalty proposed for the violations designated in the Notice should be imposed. IV In view of the foregoing and pursuant to Section 234 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (Act), 42 U.S.C. 2282, and 10 CFR 2.205, it is hereby ordered That: The Licensee pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000 within 30 days of the date of this Order, by check, draft, money order, or electronic transfer, payable to the Treasurer of the United States and mailed to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Document Control Desk, Washington, DC 20555.

Copies also shall be sent to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address and to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region II, 101 Marietta Street, NW., suite 2900, Atlanta, Georgia 30323. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of the hearing. If the Licensee fails to request a hearing within 30 days of the date of this Order, the provisions of this Order shall be effective without further proceedings. If payment has not been made by that time, the matter may be referred to the Attorney General for collection. In the event the Licensee requests a hearing as provided above, the issues to be considered at such a hearing shall be: (a) Whether the Licensee was in violation of the Commission's requirements as set forth in Violation B and Violation C.2 of the Notice referenced in Section II above, and
