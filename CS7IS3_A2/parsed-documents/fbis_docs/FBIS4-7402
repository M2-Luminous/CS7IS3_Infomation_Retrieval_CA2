The strength of these "institutions" lies not only in the area of education. Their influence has spread into the political arena as well. Islamic boarding schools have actually been influential since before the revolution. In fact, when there were kingdoms, Muslim scholars and Islamic boarding schools formed a clique which controlled royal actions and policies. For example, King Amangkurat I once killed about 6,000 Muslim scholars in front of his people because they opposed his policies. During the Old Order, an Islamic-oriented organization was part of almost every political party. For example, the Jam'iyyah Muslimin (JAMUS) was part of the PNI [Indonesian National Party]. These tendencies went quite far. The Old Order embraced the Islamic masses in the Islamic boarding schools. Since that time all Indonesian political forces have been racing, as it were, to gain legitimacy through the Islamic masses. In other words, the Islamic boarding schools, the basis of Islamic strength, have been leading sources of support for votes and influence. Is that true? The following is EDITOR's Usman Sosiawan's interview with Lt. Gen. (Army) R. Hartono, ABRI's social-political chief of staff. Hartono, former commander of Military District Command V/Brawijaya and governor of the National Defense Institute, is well known as a Madurese who is close to the Islamic boarding schools. We recorded some of his comments when we stopped him as he left a program on provisioning held at Makostrad [Kostrad Command Headquarters] on Friday 4 March. [Sosiawan] What is your response to the Army chief of staff's visit to several Islamic boarding schools? [Hartono] It's normal. The Army chief of staff is also the territorial developer. It's only natural for him to go there, to approach them, and to introduce himself. [Sosiawan] There isn't any political intent? [Hartono] No. It's one of the principles behind ABRI's territorial development. [Sosiawan] Is it true that the Islamic boarding schools are considered of great potential importance for the support of political power? [Hartono] Wait a minute. If you mean Islamic boarding schools in the sense of the word Islamic and if we start from the meanings of faith and devotion, they certainly are going to talk about state and national problems. In that case, what do you call it, political or what? It's political too. But we must remember that its involvement in politics is in fact determined by individual qualities, including the quality of those institutions themselves. [Sosiawan] How far does their involvement normally go? [Hartono] Well, they have education from, let's say as we generally understand it, from kindergarten to college. Clearly we're not speaking to their involvement. But should we provide them with an understanding of politics, which I think has to be given to them in the Islamic boarding schools? I say we have to, again referring to the faith and devotion that I mentioned before. That means, you know, that they must think about national and state problems. [Sosiawan] There has been a tendency for some figures to reach out for sympathy from the Islamic boarding schools. Your comments? [Hartono] Don't put it that way. [Sosiawan] As an example, a number of ministers and even the president attended the RMI [Robithotul Ma'ahidil Islamiyah] meeting recently. What does that mean? [Hartono] Don't make any connection between that and looking for influence or sympathy. It's not the case. It's like the Army chief of staff's recent visit to the provinces. As Army chief of staff, let's say it's because he's relatively new, he certainly has to visit and become acquainted with the provinces, including the territorial development units within them.
