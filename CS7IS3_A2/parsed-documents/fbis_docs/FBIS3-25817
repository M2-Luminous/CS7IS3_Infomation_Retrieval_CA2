The circular says: In recent years, owing to the flow of surplus labor in rural areas into nonagricultural sectors, the number of rural workers moving from region to region has grown constantly. While the sizable flow has promoted economic development in various regions and improved the people's livelihood, it has also given rise to problems which have upset production, living order, and social stability. The problems are particularly noticeable during the Spring Festival. According to departments concerned, the total flow of rural workers from region to region will soar dramatically this year. This being the case, all localities and departments concerned must work together to intensify preparations, tighten management, and take timely steps to guide the flow. The circular urges all regions and departments concerned to provide the needed services and guide the flow by tightening macroscopic management and developing the labor market so that labor resources in rural areas can be developed, used, and rationally deployed; and so that, on the premise of ensuring agricultural development, surplus labor in rural areas can be guided to relocate rationally and flow in an orderly manner, and economic order in society can be maintained. The circular says: All regions and departments concerned must attach importance to guiding the flow of rural workers during the Spring Festival. Leading comrades should be assigned to take charge of specific projects, and responsibilities should be fixed at various levels. Moreover, measures to guide the flow should be drawn up on the basis of past experience. Certain organizational, managerial, and publicity projects must be accomplished beforehand. Labor departments in all localities must have more efficient control over employment as well as the flowing labor force. They must always keep abreast of the situation and promptly notify government leaders and relevant departments. They must work with railway and communications departments in organizing round trips home for contract workers over the Spring Festival. In accordance with the volume of the flow and the destinations of rural workers, railways and communications departments must draw up transportation plans ahead of time and accomplish all the necessary preparations, including transportation arrangements. All regions and departments concerned must actively support the work of railways and communications departments. To assist departments concerned in guiding the flow of rural workers, public security departments must maintain security and order at railway stations and ports where rural workers gather, and firmly crack down on train and highway robberies and all other lawless conduct. The circular stresses: During the Spring Festival, all regions and departments concerned must, as required by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, intensify their work in studying and drawing up policies and measures to develop the labor force and labor market in rural areas while studying ways and means to promote agricultural development. Through intensive agricultural development, more township and town enterprises and tertiary industries should be established, the construction of small towns should be expedited, and surplus labor in rural areas should be encouraged to relocate locally. Meanwhile, we should continue to sum up and popularize the experiences of various regions in helping each others with labor services. In accordance with the needs of the labor market, we should, through the organized import and export of labor, guide surplus labor in rural areas to move rationally and in an orderly manner.
