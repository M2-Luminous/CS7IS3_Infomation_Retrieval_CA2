According to the population projections drafted in 1991, based on the data on the labor force in the Demographic and Health Survey (ENDESA-91), the total domestic population in the economically active category was about 3.7 million. Males accounted for 2.2 million of this figure, and females for 1.5 million. There is no great variation in the unemployment situation between the rural and urban areas, although the percentage of the workers who are unemployed is slightly higher in the latter. When the unemployment figure is broken down by sex, however, the women's situation clearly reveals their social disadvantages. While only 11 percent of the men are unemployed, this is the case for 46.7 percent of the female population. And there is one fact that would be hard to believe if it were not well-documented. Unemployment is higher among those with high-school education than among those without. The data in question are contained in the monograph entitled "The Labor Force in the Dominican Republic," edited by demographer Nelson Ramirez. This study was based on the results obtained in the Demographic and Health Survey carried out by the Institute for Population and Development Studies (IEPD), one of the entities of the Dominican Association for the Welfare of the Family (PROFAMILIA). A novel method was used to measure the levels of popular participation in economic activities and the unemployment rates. In an approach different from those traditionally used, the ENDESA-91 included in the unemployed category "not only the individuals who were looking for work during a reference period (the week preceding the survey) and those who plainly declared themselves to be unemployed, but also all the individuals prepared to work for pay or profit." With this approach, the survey regarded as unemployed all those individuals who want to work but were not seeking employment because of their conviction that they were unlikely to find jobs (a group with significant weight in the underdeveloped societies). Thus the rates determined as a result of this study differ from those based on the figures in the population census. Nor are they the same as the figures obtained in the occasional manpower surveys carried out by government bodies and organs. At the time the ENDESA-91 was completed, 67.9 percent of the population 10 years of age or older was included in the figure representing the total manpower available for the production of economic goods and services. Eighty percent of the men and 55 percent of the women were included in this figure. All of the figures agree in showing differences between the levels and forms of participation in economic activities between men and women. A breakdown by age shows that the rates of male participation are on "a very high level up to the ages of 50-54 (and up to even higher age brackets in the rural areas), while the rates of participation for women begin to decline as of the age of 40." The data pertaining to child labor, especially the employment of males, is pertinent. According to the ENDESA-91, "one out of every two boys between the ages of 10 and 14 is on the labor market." The same high rates are seen for men 65 or more years of age. In this bracket, six out of every 10 are still economically active. In the rural areas, the figure is seven out of 10. "The shortcomings from which the socioeconomic systems in general, and the educational and social security systems in particular, are suffering" constitute the corollary. In terms of education as a condition for participation in economic activity, the differences between men and women become significant. While for males "the level of economic participation seems to be independent of the number of years of study completed, a clearly defined positive relation is seen for the female population in this regard. The higher levels of participation in the labor market correspond to higher levels of education." Although significant, the unemployment rates for men and women obtained in the ENDESA-91 survey are less dramatic than those based on the traditional methods of measuring this phenomenon. Naturally, the study warns that these more positive rates pertain exclusively to occupational levels "and not necessarily to the quality or productivity of the work done." In this connection, the possibility that "within a context of increasing social crisis and serious deterioration of the purchasing power of the population, larger population segments have been forced to enter the labor market--even if only by means of self-employment in marginal activities--in order to cope with this situation" is noted. A similar inference might be made for the female population. If there is no visible impact on the rates of participation as a result, the explanation might be that the increase in the level of employment "is concealed within the much larger increase in the labor force (and in the number of unemployed workers)," or is obscured by the new conceptual method used to describe the economically active population (EAP). Although an increase in the employed population (for both sexes) has been seen in recent decades, the increase between 1981 and 1991 has been by far the most notable. The other side of the coin, that is to say unemployment, has afflicted urban males more than those in the rural sector, while the situation is the reverse for females. "In connection with these figures, it should be noted that in both sectors and for both sexes, the clear unemployment picture for the younger population segment is much more serious than the situation of those in the middle or older age groups. In fact, the rates are relatively low for men over 30." The fact that individuals with less education have a lower rate of unemployment than individuals with a high-school education might be linked with the fact that the former group is "more urgently forced to engage in self-employment in informal activities as a strategy for survival." However, a comparison of the individuals who have had a high-school education with those who have university backgrounds shows a more positive balance for the latter. According to the ENDESA-91 survey, the reason for the difference is to be found, on the one hand, in the fact that individuals with a university education have a greater need to work in order to pay for their studies. And on the other hand, the incorporation of a large number of the individuals who have completed professional training in productive activity is "facilitated by the level of training achieved and the greater readiness of these individuals to work." In studying the unemployed population (those seeking jobs or wanting to work), the ENDESA-91 found that "23 percent had been in that situation for one month, another 27 percent for between one and five months, and 9 percent for between six months and a year, while the remaining 41 percent had been unemployed for a year or more (two or more years for the majority)." Finally, the survey pointed out that this last percentage (individuals unemployed for a year or more), which is made up principally of the majority segment of the unemployed not seeking work, provides an indication of the rigid nature of the supply of productive jobs." ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rates of Economic Activity by Age and Sex Categories | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(in percentages) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |National Totals | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Age Category |Males |Females | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |10-14 |49.1 |23.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |15-19 |78.0 |57.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |20-24 |89.0 |73.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |25-29 |94.6 |73.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |30-34 |96.8 |73.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |35-39 |94.3 |75.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |40-44 |96.2 |68.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |45-49 |94.6 |60.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |50-54 |95.0 |45.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |55-59 |87.7 |38.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |60-64 |86.1 |28.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |65 or older |59.2 |16.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rates of Unemployment in the Population 15 Years of Age or Older | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(in percentages by level of education and sex) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Level of Education|Both Sexes |Men |Women | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |None* |17.9 |5.1 |44.8 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1-4 years primary |22.0 |6.6 |47.3 | |school | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |5-8 years primary |28.0 |10.9 |50.0 | |school | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |High school |30.6 |15.0 |47.1 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |University |17.8 |8.6 |26.5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |*Preprimary schooling included | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
