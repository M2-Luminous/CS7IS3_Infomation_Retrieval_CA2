During a national workshop in Ciego de Avila on the diseases that animals can communicate to humans, there was unanimity of opinion that this can not be a task of the Ministry of Public Health alone, but of other institutions and the population in general. A call was made to the Ministries of Sugar Industry, Agriculture, Education, Fishing Industry, and Veterinary Medicine to cooperate in that area. Dr. Raul Cruz de la Paz, head of the national program for control of diseases transmitted by animals, pointed out that it is necessary to double preventative measures to prevent many of these cases. It was advised that in May, the Pedro Couri Institute of Tropical Medicine will begin experimentating with the Cuban vaccine against leptospirosis in human beings. Leptospirosis is the most dangerous disease transmitted by animals in Cuba. In 1993, 1,446 people were affected by this disease, of whom 75 died. The leptospirosis section of Ciego de Avila was classified as the best in the country, in 1993, for its complete and systematic work.
