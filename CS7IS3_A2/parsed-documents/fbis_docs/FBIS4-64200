According to the report, over DM11 billion in federal orders went to eastern Germany in the second half of 1993, an increase of 5 percent against the first half of the year. Goehner spoke of a "very satisfactory report," especially because it takes into account the many large infrastructure investments in the new laender. More than 90 percent of federal construction projects in the new laender were carried out by east German enterprises. In 1992, only about DM7.5 billion in federal orders went to eastern Germany. Goehner said that developments indicate the chancellor's calls for double the volume of orders from the new laender have been largely fulfilled. The point now is to keep up this figure. Apart from the orders initiative of German industry, which ordered about DM35 billion in goods and services in the new laender in 1993, the FRG's efforts are a major contribution to the boom in eastern Germany. Success is due mainly to east Gemran enterprises' entitlement to participate in cheap west German tenders, whereby east German enterprises can execute an order for the same price as the cheapest German bidder. To encourage the emergence of a middle class, these enterprises will be paid a bonus of up to 5 percent, irrespective of the size of the order. Goehner appeared disappointed that no other west German land apart from Hesse and Berlin had adopted the preferential guidelines for east German enterprises.
