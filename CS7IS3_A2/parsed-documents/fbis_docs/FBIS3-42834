Pyrozhenko, candidate of geographical sciences: "Where Are We Living Today?"] [Text] There are problems with the safe use and renewal of forest resources. A geographic approach has to be taken in formulating ecologically and economically sensible concepts for forest management since it encompasses the entire complex of economic, social and ecological issues at hand. Ukrainian forests are subject to intrusive anthropogenic factors in heavily industrialized areas with large power plants. The extensive forests in the zone of the Chernobyl nuclear accident and adjacent territories of the Kiev, Zhytomyr, Chernihiv, Rivne and Volyn oblasts differ as to type and functional designation and the degree of radioactive contamination. On the average, forests take up 27.3% of the land area, a figure that reachers 36% in the 30 km Chernobyl zone. This represents 2.4 million hectares, or 38.4% of the forest lands of Ukraine. Artificial reforestations accounts for 50.3% of the area in those regions, versus an average of 68% for Ukraine as a whole. Coniferous forests predominates (63.0%), followed by hardwood forests (17.5%). Most (48.5%) are young and mid-age (37.5%) growths. Cesium-137 is the most widespread contaminant of the three major radionuclides (cesium, strontium, plutonium); however, in the 30 km Chernobyl zone strontium-90 and plutonium are the dominant contaminants. Utililization of these forests for timber and recreation and their levels of radioactive pollution is depicted in Fig. 1. The map shows that the forests can be classified into eight types: 1--Conservation and recreation; 2--Conservation and timberland; 3--As category 2 in combination with radiomonitoring; 4--As 3, but with moderate commercial use; 5--As 3 but with low level commercial exploitation; 6--Conservation and limited commercial exploitation; 7--Conservation with radiomonitoring; and 8--Conservation and protected against commercial use. Forests that predominate in the Kiev Oblast--which suffered the most from the Chernobyl fallout--fall mainly into categories 7 and 1. The primary categories in Zhytomyr Oblast are 3, in Chernihiv Oblast 2 and 3, in Rivne Oblast 3 and in Volyn Oblast 2. The most contaminated forests to which access is forbidden are found in the Chernobyl and Polissya forest preserves in the Kiev Oblast, and in the Narodnytskyy, Ovrutskyy and Slovechanskyy preserves in Zhytomyr Oblast. This classification does not include forests in the 30 km zome or the dead 'brown forest' there. This for of classification may make it possible to include the radiopolluted forests in the timber economy. For example, in the Kiev Oblast 14.0% of the forest areas have economic (including recreational) value, 66.0% have limited potential with mandatory radiomonitoring, and 20.0% (excluding the 30 km forbidden zone) are out of bounds for any type of use. The corresponding figures for the Zhytomyr Oblast are 4.5, 75.2 and 37.3%, in the Chernihiv Oblast 37.3 and 62.7%, in the Rivne area 9.7 and 90.3%, and in Volyn Oblast 52.2 and 42.8%. In terms of economic potential the last three oblast are in the most unfavorable position, although even they have undergone changes in the way their forests are categorized. Constant efforts are required to maintain and renew the forest resources where radioactivity ranges from 1.1 to 5.5 Ci/sq. km. and higher. These efforts are hampered by poor working and living conditions, particularly where tree husbandry is concerned, and danger of radioactivity. Both factors contribute to a shortage of labor. Forestry workers--especially loggers--have been shown to receive 1.5- to 2.5-fold as much irradiation as other segments of the population. Accordingly, such work must be curtailed on territories where radioactivities exceed 10 Ci/sq. km., and the work force must be further reduced by employing tree planting machines that have already been approved for use in the 30 km zone. In summary, the forestry industry must be carefully reassessed and nurtured in the Kiev, Zhytomyr, Chernihiv, Rivne and Volyn oblasts. Full utilization of these resources must be based on the above classification and economic impact projections of the Chernobyl accident.
