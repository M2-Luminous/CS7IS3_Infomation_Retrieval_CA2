The League drops to 10 percent, on a par with National Alliance. Forza Italia thus gains percentage points, the left holds on, the center drops behind. Rete [Network] and the Greens move up together with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi; National Alliance, Democratic Alliance [AD] (with the secularists), and Communist Renewal hold their positions; the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and the League move slightly back; Martinazzoli's PPI and Segni's Pact for Italy lose ground, as do [Christian Democratic Center, CCD, leaders] Casini and Mastella's centrists. These are the results of the CIRM weekly survey of Italians' electoral preferences, as broadcast by TMC yesterday evening. These results, however, must be treated very cautiously, because they are based on a proportional share of the vote, whereas 75 percent of the seats must actually be won in each individual constituency, following a direct contest between candidates, in which "local" factors not taken into account in surveys also come into play. Furthermore, the results must take into account the fact that 71 percent of the 2,500 interviewees said they had made up their minds, whereas 29 percent have not yet decided for whom to vote. The undecided, however, constitute a shrinking percentage -- last week they made up 33 percent -- and largely belong to certain sociodemographic categories: women, particularly housewives, people over 55, people with no formal education. Among the undecided, a particularly important group are those who profess to support the "center." CIRM emphasized this fact, adding that, whereas in previous elections undeciveness was spread across the parties, this time it involved mainly the "center." Researchers warned, however, that this does not necessarily mean such people will eventually vote for Martinazzoli and Segni's candidates. The "center" interviewees range from Berlusconi to the progressives' right wing and those PDS candidates who are considered to be more "moderate." In addition, in order to interpret these percentages, it is necessary to establish who will ultimately win the vote of those who identify with certain political forces -- for example, republicans and socialists -- that are profoundly divided in terms of the alliances. There are [Italian Socialist Party Secretary] Del Turco's socialists, who are aligned with the progressives with [Enzo] Mattina's socialists; there are Piro and Boniver's socialists [Federation of Italian Socialists], who want to reach an agreement with Martinazzoli; and there are those, such as Signorile, who have already reached an agreement with the center. The same applies to the republicans: Some are siding with AD and the progressives; [Italian Republican Party, PRI, Secretary] La Malfa occupies the center with the PPI; and Castagnetti and Gorgoni are siding with Segni. [Radical Party leader] Pannella, on the other hand, constitutes a typical case. He has chosen a center position, whereas those who say they want to vote for him identify with the progressives. What will these voters do in the constituencies when they will be forced to choose between a "progressive" candidate and some other candidate? In this flurry of men and acronyms, of pacts and alliances which are born and die within a few hours, the only possible reading of the results is one in terms of major groupings: left, center, and center-right. Within this framework, the center-right alignment headed by Berlusconi, [National Alliance leader] Fini, [League Secretary] Bossi, and Casini is predicted to win 49 percent of the vote, compared with 45 percent seven days ago. This figure is obtained by adding Forza Italia's 24 percent, National Alliance's 10 percent, another 10 percent corresponding to the League, and the 4 percent mustered by CCD, which has lost one percentage point. The CIRM opinion poll shows a Knight [Berlusconi nickname] sailing full steam ahead, moving from 19 percent to 24 percent of the vote in a single week -- a result which must have been influenced by the electoral show at the EUR [Rome suburb], and the wide coverage given to the "convention" by certain TV networks. Fini obtained the same results as the previous week, whereas Bossi lost one percentage point. This confirms the downtrend in the Bandwagon's [League nickname] share: On 21 January CIRM gave it 13 percent of the vote, on 28 January 12 percent, and on 4 February 11 percent -- and yet the League's congress took place only one week ago, offering ample opportunity for TV and press coverage. The PPI and Forza Italia's "center," still struggling with the problem of certain "thorny" candidacies, lost another three percentage points, dropping from 20 percent to 17 percent. This confirms that Berlusconi entering the field penalized Martinazzoli and Segni, who mustered 23 percent of the vote only one week ago. The same applies to National Alliance which, had the Knight remained in place at the head of his business empire, could have aspired to 15 percent of the vote. What about the left? Despite Berlusconi's forceful entry on stage, the progressives' alliance, though badly shaken by fierce disputes over the candidacies and by AD's threats to "disengage," can still count on the same share as last week: 34 percent of the vote. Does this signal a reversal of the trend of the previous two weeks, during which the "glorious war machine" seemed to be misfiring? On 28 January support was down to 36 percent of the vote, whereas on 21 January it was 39 percent. The Oak [PDS nickname] lost one percentage point, dropping from 20 percent to 19 percent, whereas Rete and the Greens, who are grouped together by CIRM researchers, gained one percentage point, up from 4 percent to 5 percent. This is the same figure given for Communist Renewal and AD, which remain stationary.
