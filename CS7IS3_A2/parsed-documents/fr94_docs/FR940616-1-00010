ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This rule making proceeding proposes to allow transmitters authorized under part 22 to be concurrently licensed and used for both common carrier and private carrier operations. The purpose of this proposed rule is to promote economic efficiencies for carriers in providing paging services. This proposed action will lead to more effective use of carrier resources without undermining the Commission's rules. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before July 11, 1994. Reply comments must be submitted on or before July 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dan Abeyta, Common Carrier Bureau, Mobile Services Division, (202) 632&hyph;6450. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a synopsis of the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rule Making and Order (NPRM and Order) in CC Docket 94&hyph;46, adopted May 13, 1994 and released June 9, 1994.

Paperwork Reduction The proposed action does not impose a paperwork burden on the public. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, the Commission's initial regulatory flexibility analysis follows: Reasons for Action and Objective This rule making proceeding is initiated to obtain comment regarding changes in the provision of common carrier and private carrier paging services through the use of a single transmitter. The purpose of the proposed rule is to promote economic efficiencies for carriers in providing paging services. Legal Basis The proposed action is authorized under Section 4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(j), 303(r). Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements None. Federal Rules Which Duplicate or Conflict With These Rules None. Description, Potential Impact, and Number of Small Entities Involved A rule change in this proceeding would benefit providers of common carrier and private carrier paging services by reducing costs. A number of these providers are small entities. Any Significant Alternative Minimizing the Impact on Small Entities Consistent with the Stated Objectives We have determined no specific alternative. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration will be served with a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rule Making and Order in accordance with Section 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603(a). Synopsis of NPRM and Order By this NPRM and Order, the Commission proposes to delete 22.119 of the Rules, which prohibits the concurrent licensing and use of transmitters for common carrier and non-common carrier purposes. In this regard, the Commission notes that several factors make it appropriate to reevaluate the ยง22.119 prohibition and to propose deleting or modifying the rule. First, advances in technology, such as improved digital transmission techniques and store and forward technology, have resulted in dramatically increased capacity, thus reducing the need for a transmitter to be devoted on a full-time basis to common carrier uses. Second, licensees providing wider-area service could achieve substantial economies of scale by sharing transmitters when building out a regional or nationwide system without diminishing the licensee's current quality of service. Third, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (1993 Budget Act) enacted by Congress amends Section 3(n) and Section 332 of the Communications Act of 1934 to create a comprehensive framework for all mobile services. The Commission has initiated several rulemakings to implement the provision of Section 3(n) and 332 of the Act, as amended by the 1993 Budget Act. Lastly, increased competition in the industry provides an assurance that service to existing customers will not suffer from joint use of transmitters when the carriers are offering distinct services on different frequencies. Because of these factors, the NPRM and Order tentatively concludes that permitting a single transmitter to operate on both common carrier and private channels will cause no disruption or impairment of service to existing part 22 subscribers. Nevertheless, the NPRM and Order seeks comment on whether the proposed rules should be limited to circumstances where the joint use will facilitate the provision of national and or regional service as an overly to local paging service or where the part 22 licensee is utilizing batched paging. Ordering Clauses Accordingly, it is ordered that pursuant to Sections 4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(j), 303(r), this Notice of Proposed Rule Making is issued.
