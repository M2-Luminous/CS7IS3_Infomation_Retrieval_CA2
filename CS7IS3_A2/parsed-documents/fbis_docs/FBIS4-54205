That day, the UN Command announced that it plans to ask North Korea to hold a senior secretaries' meeting of the committee at the earliest possible date to discuss the issue. Assessing the current attempts of North Korea as being driven by the hidden intention to disperse the international concern focused on the issue of nuclear inspection, the government decided to inform North Korea of its stance through a UN Command channel rather than taking a formal government-level reaction. Regarding this, a government authority said: "The issue of substituting the present system of the Armistice Agreement, including the replacement of the Armistice Agreement, should be resolved independently by the North and South, the parties concerned. This corresponds with the spirit of the North-South Agreement," and added that "the North side should sincerely abide by the Armistice Agreement and normalize the MAC at an early date."
