Members will spend the next few days analyzing the address by the head of state, General Sani Abacha. The conference adjourned sitting soon after members (?checked) into the conference. Inaugurating the conference, Gen. Abacha said that the tenure of power for the administration would be determined by the outcome of the National Constitutional Conference. State House correspondent, Ogie Ogbonnaya Ogie reports: [Begin recording] [Ogie] Gen. Abacha said that the clarification was necessary as a result of the debates and arguments which the tenure of office of the administration had generated in some quarters. [Abacha] We are aware that it's neither in our personal interest nor that of the nation to perpetuate ourselves in power. [applause] Nothing could be further from our plans. It ought to be clear, according to the laws guiding politics that [words indistinct] political factors viewed from all quarters of national life, the most logical process will be activities leading to elections into the various tiers of government which the Constitutional Conference will recommend. [applause] How do we now begin searching for an exit date when it is unclear what the Constitutional Conference would decide? The amount of time required to establish the framework for realizing the various decisions of the conference depends on the nature of those decisions. An attempt to fix a date totally without reference to the decisions of the conference will not only appear to jump the gun but will surely be seized upon by a fresh [word indistinct] of cynics to suggest the administration is teleguiding the conference. We are also not unmindful of the high price the last administration had to pay when it set dates and had to change them because of one exigency or the other. [applause] We wish to avoid that mistake and ask that our actions and commitment to the democratic process should speak for themselves. [Ogie] In the 30-page inaugural address, the head of state also listed areas which the conference must properly examine and spell out its acceptable constitutional provisions to ensure fairness, justice, and equity as well as allay the fears of some ethnic groups who have been complaining of marginalization. [Abacha] You have the mandate to deliberate upon the structure of the Nigerian nation and state and to work out the modalities for ensuring good governance, to provide for our people a system of government guaranteeing equal opportunities, the right to aspire to any public office irrespective of state of origin, ethnicity, or creed and thus engender a sense of belonging in all our citizenry. [applause] Our 34 years of sovereign existence has been beset with a history of continuous political uncertainties. We have had crises of legitimacy, crises of succession, crises of authority, and crises of nationally acceptable leadership. Our country is today resolved to terminate this vicious circle of crises. [Ogie] Gen. Abacha also advised the conference to critically examine the advantages and disadvantages of both the parliamentary and presidential systems of government and produce any terms of democratic government or recommend a system that will be consistent with the Nigerian culture, ethnic diversity, and other peculiar social systems to developing countries. The head of state also identified the judiciary, social services, state freedom, security agencies, and the economy as areas which the conference must give priority attention to in its deliberations. Gen. Abacha said it was a challenge for the conference to find solutions to military interventions in politics. [Abacha] This conference has the crucial responsibility to examine why out of the nearly 34 years of our independence, 24 years have been spent under military rule. It is clearly a manifest, not least among the Armed Forces themselves, that there is a great wealth of opinion that the cycle of military interventions be terminated. [applause] It has become imperative that [words indistinct] permanent, irrevocable, and binding arrangements will permanently end the coup culture in Nigerian politics. We will do all to identify and rectify the systematic [words indistinct] line rather than dwell on simplistic behavioral explanations if we are to make any sensible progress in this regard. [Ogie] The inaugural ceremony attracted people in various walks of life. Service chiefs, members of the Transitional Ruling Council, ministers, state administrators, (?governors) and their families also witnessed the occasion. [end recording]
