FR940727-2-00131 FR940727-2-00074 Environmental Impact Statement: Lee County, et al; Alabama AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared for a proposed highway project in Lee, Macon, and Russel Counties, Alabama. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Joe D. Wilkerson, Division Administrator, Federal Highway Administration, 500 Eastern Boulevard, Suite 200, Montgomery, Alabama 36117&hyph;2018, Telephone (205) 223&hyph;7370. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA, in cooperation with the Alabama Department of Transportation, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on a proposal to improve a segment of U.S. Highway 80 in Lee, Macon, and Russell Counties, Alabama. The proposed project begins at Interstate Highway 85 (I&hyph;85) and extends to the east for approximately 58 kilometers (36 miles). The proposal would serve as the primary connecting route between the Phenix City metropolitan area and the Interstate highway system. It is anticipated that improvements will generally be made along the existing alignment of U.S. 80. The improvements to the travel corridor are considered necessary to provide for the existing and projected traffic demand. Alternatives under consideration include: (1) alternate route locations, (2) improving the existing roadway, (3) taking no action, and (4) postponing the action. Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies and private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have an interest in this proposal. A public involvement meeting will be held when sufficient information is available. Public notice will be given of the time and the place of the meeting and hearing. No formal scoping meeting is planned at this time. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.
