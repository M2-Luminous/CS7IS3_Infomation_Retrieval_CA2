The important thing is for the summit meeting to be successful. Everything is important regarding the question of the reconciliation between the South and North and of national unification, including the North's nuclear issue. The issue of averting a war at this very moment is also very urgent. For the realization and success of the summit talks--on which the future fate of our nation depends--both the South and North should approach this issue in a sincere and prudent manner. This is because we should solve the question of our nation's survival, not the issue of systems or regimes. In this regard, we think it fortunate that the North side has agreed to our side's proposal for a working-level contact at Panmunjom on 28 June. This notwithstanding, the North side is still continuing vilifying broadcasts toward the South and has spread word that President Kim Il-song told a Japanese woman that he hopes the summit will take place in Pyongyang on 15 August. If this report is true, we have to take issue with his real intention regarding his preference for 15 August. The day of national liberation is really a good date, however, the problem is that the North will be holding a political event, the so-called "15 August pannational rally," on that day. Needless to say, the "15 August pannational rally" is part of the North's idea for the convocation of "the political consultative conference"--whose realization the North has pertinaciously advocated--in connection with its strategy for the reunification front against the South. If they propose holding the summit talks in tandem with such a pannational rally, we cannot but suspect their ulterior motive on two points. First, we suspect that they might weaken the significance of the summit talks if it is part of the pannational rally. Second, we suspect that under the pretext of opposition from the South, they might attempt to bring the summit meeting itself to naught and, at the same time, to avert sanctions related to their nuclear development. Under whatever circumstances, if the summit meeting is suspected to be connected with such an ulterior motive, it will be meaningless, therefore, we find this very unacceptable. As proposed to us through former U.S. President Carter, the North has to prove its sincerity and seriousness to the unconditional South-North summit talks. To this end, it should change its irritating or antagonistic attitude toward the South. It ought to call off vilifying and seditious broadcasts against the South that spoil the atmosphere for the summit talks and to give up the idea of launching a big offensive of political propaganda by convening the pannational rally with the participation of a South Korean Federation of General Student Councils [Hanchongnyon] representative. Of course, it is not so easy to remove the antagonistic sentiments--which have been pent up over the past half a century of national division--and to achieve the long-cherished national desire for unification. It is, therefore, all the more necessary for the South and North to show a sincere and serious attitude to the reconciliation and dialogue between the South and North. National unification will be more remote if the North, as well as the South, should try to make use of the summit talks to maintain their respective political power; and in the North's case, from the viewpoint of its strategy toward the South. We should also make a prudent approach to the time and venue of the summit talks. North Korea, too, should corroborate its sincerity for the realization of the summit talks at the preliminary contacts.
