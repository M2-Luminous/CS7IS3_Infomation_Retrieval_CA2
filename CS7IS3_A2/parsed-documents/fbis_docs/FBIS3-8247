Therefore, if it later comes to light that a civil servant had, for example, cooperated with the agents of Department III/III [former secret service], the sanction can only be public humiliation, said Fabian Jozsa, whom we interviewed on the implementation of the bill on examining the political past of people in certain important positions. [Jozsa] The government does not intend to issue an order on executing the law on agents because the law precisely regulates the steps of examination. However, regarding certain technical details of the procedure, instructions will have to be issued, but these will only help the work of the committees. The premises, the necessary equipment, and the fees for the participants will have to be ensured. Naturally the government will bear the costs. It is worth mentioning that the law on the legal standing of civil servants has to be applied in the case of the committee members who will carry out the examinations -- who will be judges elected by parliament for a limited period -- because the service conditions of the judges will be suspended during this time. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Do I understand correctly that many committees will operate? [Jozsa] Yes, as a result of a deputy's proposal, the bill makes it possible for the necessary number of committees to operate to fulfill the tasks. Parliament will have to decide this issue. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The original proposal contained the names of people to be examined in order of importance, thus determining the order of the examinations at the same time. Therefore, the parliamentary deputies will be first, followed by the president of the republic and the government members, while certain heads of state-owned banks and insurance companies will be examined last of all, this being the last point on the list. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] When will the bill come into force? [Jozsa] According to the plans, only the rules on forming the committees and their activities will come into force when the law is announced; the other rules will come into force on 1 July. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Does this mean that we cannot expect any examinations before the elections? [Jozsa] It would be technically impossible to begin the examinations earlier. However, this will not be a problem because the examinations will have to be started right after the new Parliament is formed. The law does not actually extend to the parliamentary candidates, therefore, this cannot influence the decision of the voters. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] In what period of time does the examination of these people have to be completed? [Jozsa] The law stipulates one year; all these people have to be examined during this period. The same will happen if someone takes up his position later; his examination will have to be completed within one year of his taking up his position. The law will remain in force until July 2000; therefore, the Parliament formed after the 1998 elections will also be examined. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The bill does not envisage the application of sanctions, but can people who are found to have cooperated with the III/III service expect to face legal consequences as far as their employment is concerned? [Jozsa] No, but this would be out of the question in the case of people in elected positions. The law stipulates public humiliation as the only sanction. I believe that this will make everyone think, and former agents will voluntarily leave after -- or even before -- the examination. It is worth mentioning here that, in addition to former III/III members, the law also applies to all those people who regularly received agents' reports because of their position, namely the former secretaries of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee, the former members of the Political Committee, and former prime ministers, interior ministers, and defense ministers. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Are you planning to examine the candidates before filling positions that fall under the government's sphere of authority? [Jozsa] The law does not give authority for this. Prior examination cannot be a condition for employment because this would be against the Constitution. Therefore, if someone is later found to have, for example, cooperated with Department III/III, public humiliation can be the only sanction in this area, too. At the same time, naturally, the person who makes the appointments will try to find people with immaculate past records in other ways; for example, a statement by the candidate could be a solution. However, a false statement cannot have legal consequences as far as employment is concerned.
