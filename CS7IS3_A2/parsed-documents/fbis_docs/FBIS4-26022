Owing to the differences between the IAEA and Korea over the replacing of nuclear fuel rods since March this year, the situation concerning Korea's nuclear issue, which had been developing in a positive direction, unexpectedly took a sudden turn. While the IAEA decided on 10 June to suspend enforcement of the technological cooperation plan with Korea on uranium exploration and the peaceful use of nuclear energy, Korea declared that it would withdraw from the agency immediately. On the other hand, the United States carried out frequent activities within and without the United Nations, expecting the Security Council to impose sanctions against Korea. It remains fresh in our minds that the United States has lobbied for this on more than one occasions, but its proposal was not well received by the international community. There was even objection to the proposal from U.S. political circles and the media. The Chinese delegation has always been against the Security Council's involvement in the Korean nuclear issue and a resolution on this adopted by the Security Council which includes sanctions. The Chinese representative has pointed out on numerous occasions that the four parties of the United States, the IAEA, Korea, and the ROK should iron out their differences and resolve the problem through dialogue and talks within the tripartite framework. Neither threats nor pressure will work; they will only intensify the contradictions and play a destructive role. Based on this principle, the Chinese delegation, in light of the given circumstances at that time, adopted a constructive attitude and comprehensively expounded the position of the Chinese Government on the question following the statement issued by the Security Council chairman on the Korean nuclear crisis in hopes that efforts would be made by the parties concerned to continue the talks and seek an appropriate solution. Facts have proved that with the concerted efforts made by the parties concerned, the talks on the Korean nuclear issue at the previous stage developed in a positive direction despite the difficulties encountered. The United States reached a principled agreement with Korea last June, Korea announced a unilateral decision on suspending its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], and Korea reached new agreements with IAEA and the United States, respectively, on 15 and 25 February this year, followed by the IAEA's inspection of Korea's relevant nuclear facilities and completion of most of its mission. At present, differences and difficulties have cropped up concerning Korea's nuclear fuel rods. It should be noted that these differences and difficulties are temporary, as they have cropped up in the course of efforts made to resolve the problem. Meanwhile, there is still room for maneuver and a possibility of reaching a solution. On the Korean nuclear issue, China has always regarded the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, as well as peace and stability on the peninsula, as the two major targets. This position has become the common understanding of the members of the Security Council, and has won widespread support from the international community. As long as the parties concerned have such sincerity and make unswerving efforts toward this dual objective, it is possible gradually to iron out the differences and reach an understanding. The most important thing at present is that the parties concerned should keep calm and exercise restraint. There is an ancient Chinese saying: "Think of reason when you are enraged and never forget principles at the critical moment." In the face of the temporary disputes, if one side insists on imposing sanctions and exerting pressure, and even hastily threaten to use force, the positive achievements attained at the previous stage between the four parties and three sides will come to nothing. Moreover, the contradictions will be intensified again. The international community will not want to see or accept the consequences arising from shutting the door to negotiations. The deterioration and turbulence of the situation on the Korean peninsula not only will cause devastating damage to northeast Asia, but also will affect world peace and stability. As the matter is serious, the parties concerned should think thrice before taking action, and should define the reason and principles clearly. Sanctions and threats will be of no avail. The best option is to calmly and patiently hold talks. After all, dialogue is better than confrontation.
