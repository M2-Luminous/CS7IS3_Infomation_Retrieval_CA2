Not because of a whim of those who valiantly denounce an act which is so abominable, but because there are indications--which perhaps could not be fully proven--of the intimate association, murky and punishable by law, between unscrupulous politicians and traffickers who seek support from persons in a position to decide the fate of many things. If Juan Jose Chaux and Lucas Lebolo Conde stated that certain aspirants in their departments have an abundance of money at their disposal, it is because--in the absence of tracks which all those involved seek to erase--the millions which finance the politicians are circulating and thus ensure loyalty to the generous donor. It is said there will be filters to prevent what is already a shameful reality for our parties, and that the controls will prevent those Colombians, who more than anyone else should preserve their political and moral transparency, from being bribed on a continuing basis. But for some time now we've talked of these things--of strict vigilance over the financial records and resources of these coffers--but the evil of the surreptitious and corrupting influence of this illicit traffic has not abated. On the contrary, its harmful effects persist and we see situations which bring dishonor to a political tradition of which we were proud. What occurred with extradition in the Constitutional Congress and now, in recent times, with the confiscation of property obtained as a result of drug trafficking are two dishonorable chapters which are a confusing mixture of vanity and cowardice. It is not sufficient to have dismantled the infrastructure of a powerful cartel, nor to have eliminated its most prominent godfathers and capo regimes in order to reverse the unhealthy penetration of their harmful practices--from the bribing of consciences to indiscriminate or selective terrorist acts. Other less bloody, but nonetheless criminal and corrupting organizations, seek similar ends. Though they may use greater discretion, the attack on morality and on good political and administrative practices is of equal or greater magnitude. It is no secret to anyone that there are cartels and independent traffickers throughout the breadth and length of Colombia. What's more, in every city in Valle Department there is a drug "trust" [preceding word in English] with a commander and troops. In the coastal region, the same thing. In Medellin, there is still a considerable presence. In Bogota, an old organization has lowered its profile, but has not ceased to defend its power. And even in jungle regions where the growth of businesses in many products attracts the voracity of the traffickers, very rich and powerful groups have formed which are independent of those operating in some of its municipalities and which continue to maintain an understanding with politicians in order to put themselves out of harm's way with regard to official action, whenever they need a favor from someone in public office, at whatever level. As is evident, the above statements must be a cause of concern to public opinion and to the sectors of the country which vigorously reject the deterioration of our political class and its permeability to money derived from the deepest depths of crime. Criticisms such as those made by Enrique Gomez against the council members in Cartagena, and on which he will now expand citing new motives, as EL ESPECTADOR anticipated, reassure Colombians who view with alarm the increase of immoral activity by public officials in Congress, the assemblies, and the councils. Together with the majority of our compatriots, we cherish the hope that those promised filters for the upcoming campaigns function effectively, and that the party leaders contribute, with a scrupulosity that will benefit the campaigns, so that the authorities feel the incentive of some political organizations prepared to rescue public life from the mire of concupiscence and not to serve as accomplices, out of purely electoral interests, to the owners of the putrid fiefs of our departments and municipalities. Our democracy will have lost much if its congressmen, deputies, council members, governors, and mayors are the product of the corrupting influence of crime or the intimidation of an insurgency also corrupted by its desire for riches.
