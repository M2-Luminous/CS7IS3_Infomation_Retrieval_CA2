Hainan asked me to serve as an advisor. The center gave recognition. After returning to Hong Kong, I immediately wrote a letter to Deng Xiaoping and the CPC Central Committee, relating the inspirations I got from Li Ka-shing's intention to invest in Hainan, my feelings generated by the visit to Hainan, and the views of the CPC special economic zone committee; I suggested that Hainan be made a province, thereby becoming a large special economic zone which would allow the free entry and exit of goods, people, and capital and become a second customs territory (it was necessary to use barbed wires in Shenzhen and create a "second line" zone, whereas Hainan was an island in the first place), and that goods flowing to or from the hinterland could be treated as exports. I especially suggested that Hainan be turned into a large special economic zone and a free port through consulting the experience of Hong Kong and utilizing Hong Kong's capital and trained personnel. Deng Xiaoping referred this letter to Zhao Ziyang, asking Zhao Ziyang to dispose of the matter. Zhao immediately referred it to Gu Mu [6253 3668], asking him to form more concrete ideas. Zhao wrote some comments on my letter: (the gist) agree with Xu's idea; already thought about making Hainan a province; it is now proper to consider establishing a special economic zone and a province; before the large special economic zone becomes reality, it is proper first to restore the preferential policies originally granted to Hainan. Soon afterwards, the center ordered the preparatory group for the establishment of the province headed by Xu Shijie [6079 1102 2638], former secretary of the CPC Guangzhou Municipal Committee, and Liang Xiang [2733 3276], former secretary of the CPC Shenzhen Municipal Committee, to enter Hainan. The news that Hainan would be made a province and a large special economic zone caused a sensation at home and abroad. Waves of people making investment-related investigations, conducting business negotiations, and seeking jobs crossed Qiongzhou Strait continuously. Before becoming a province, Hainan was already bustling with activity. After Hainan was officially made a province on 25 April 1988, the CPC Hainan Provincial Committee and the Hainan Provincial government formally asked me to serve as an advisor, and the center also gave recognition. Regrettably, policies on the special economic zone have never been fully implemented, and there has been no progress in regard to Li Ka-shing's investing in Hainan. The process of putting forward the idea of developing Hainan Island was the process in which I first came to understand Hong Kong and then realized that it was necessary to fully utilize the entity and experience of Hong Kong. After I came to work in Hong Kong, I gradually came to realize the importance of the issue of the need to fully utilize Hong Kong in China's reform and opening up. The change from believing at the beginning that Hong Kong only served as a channel and springboard for imports and exports to utilizing Hong Kong in an effort to attract overseas funds, to understanding the need to consult Hong Kong's economic development experience, to consulting the British Hong Kong government's successful ruling experience in the process of formulating the Basic Law, and to utilizing the unique mixed Chinese-Western culture of the people of Hong Kong constituted a process of gradual development over several years. Consulting Hong Kong's experience involves many spheres ranging from economics to politics and culture, and the exercise will have rich contents. It is now still rather difficult to put all the relevant understandings in a clear form. But I believe that in the process of economic and political reforms in China in the late 20th century and early 21st century, fully utilizing Hong Kong's experience is an issue which warrants great attention. The earlier and more deeply people come to understand its value, the sooner and more extensively it will contribute to the development of the hinterland and Hong Kong. Note The Hainan Automobile Incident: In January 1983, the CPC's central leaders such as Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang, and Gu Mu inspected Hainan Island, and decided to accelerate the reform and opening up of Hainan Island; the CPC Central Committee and the State Council approved and circulated the document, "A Summary of Discussions of the Issue of Accelerating the Development of Hainan Island," in April, and issued the Eight Rules on Expanding Hainan's Autonomy on External Economic Relations and Trade of the CPC Central Committee in October of the same year. Under the Eight Rules, Hainan Island could independently decide to import 17 state-controlled commodities, of which the main one would be automobiles. This was a special privilege that the other special economic zones did not have. In addition, it was also stipulated that Hainan Island be allowed to keep all the foreign exchange earned from the exports it delivered. This rule was also more favorable than enjoyed by other special economic zones. For instance, Shenzhen was allowed to keep 70 percent, and had to hand over 30 percent. The Eight Rules did not clearly stipulate that the 17 commodities imported by Hainan Island not be resold to the hinterland areas of the mainland. As there were no customs sites between Hainan and the hinterland areas of the mainland, Hainan was able to import state-controlled commodities and then resell them to the hinterland areas of the mainland, thereby acquiring a way of getting rich in a smooth, unhindered manner. Reselling automobiles could result in huge profits. At that time, the import price of a 12-passenger van-truck was $5,000, and reselling it could produce a net profit of $12,000. For a time Hainan Island became the "paradise" of automobile trading of the country, and tens of thousands of automobiles were being resold. The huge profits from automobiles were also accompanied by huge profits from foreign exchange arbitrage. The foreign exchange used by Hainan Island to import automobiles was all bought at high prices through arbitrage. According to newspaper reports, a unit in Hainan withdrew 1 million yuan in cash from a bank all at once, and used an automobile to transport the money to places such as Shenzhen to be used in foreign exchange arbitrage. Black market trading in foreign exchange was even more prevalent on Hainan Island. At the time of the climax of Hainan's activities of reselling imported automobiles, Liang Lingguang [2733 7227 0342], governor of Guangdong, reported to the center on the disorderly situation in Hainan. In December 1984, a task force headed by Vice Premier Wan Li investigated the automobile incident, and promptly formulated emergency measures, which required, among other things, that the automobiles already shipped to Hainan be immediately frozen and then shipped away under arrangements made by the center, that the center buy automobiles from Hainan on the basis of the listed uniform rate (1 U.S. dollar to 2.8 yuan), that free trading be prohibited, that implementation of all automobile purchase contracts concluded with foreign businesses be suspended, that the issue of compensations demanded by foreign businesses be handled by the center in a unified manner, and that there be investigations into the sources of foreign exchange used to buy the automobiles which had already been sold and into the tax matters related to those automobiles. After the emergency measures were implemented, Hainan's foreign trade came to a complete halt. Automobiles and imported materials were being stockpiled; high-price automobiles were appropriated by the center. The center would only pay the amount calculated according to prices based on parity exchange rates. As a consequence, companies in Hainan suddenly lost all the huge gains made through reselling automobiles.

The 1988 trip to North America was very fruitful. Within three weeks I visited a dozen or so cities in the United States and Canada, thereby greatly enlarging my horizon in terms of getting to understand capitalist countries. I saw the positive as well as negative social impact on people produced by the social welfare policies followed by capitalist countries, and some aspects of a situation where, under a democratic political system, political parties cared only about the present and did everything possible to win votes in their efforts to come into power, while giving little consideration to the consequences. At that time the United States was in the midst of the presidential election held once every four years. Reagan, a Republican President, was no longer running, and made Vice President Bush the presidential candidate. We visited over 10 metropolises along the east coast as well as the west coast of the United States, and met with executives of several dozen large industrial, commerce, and financial enterprises and some experts and scholars of economics and finance, some of whom were Republicans, while others were Democrats or independents. When discussing which party was likely to win in the general election, most of them, including a few Democrats, expressed the belief that Bush of the Republican party would win. Several large enterprise executives, who were Democrats, even took the initiative in openly saying that they would vote for Bush of the Republican party for the reason that they "like Bush's platform." The frankness was beyond my understanding. During my trip to the United States, a Hong Kong tycoon, who was a Consultative Committee member, accompanied me when I visited Washington and New York. He and Bush were friends. He got Bush to agree to meeting me on a private basis. At that time the campaign was gradually entering an intensified stage. That tycoon, who was a Consultative Committee member, met Bush first. When discussing the presidential election, Bush himself said that he was not very confident, for most of the several previous Vice Presidents who had run had failed. Bush believed that he himself was unlikely to become an exception. But as it turned out, he won. Later there were some changes in regard to Bush's plan to meet me. According to a source, the U.S. State Department argued that the meeting had to be an official one. I was asked about my opinion on the matter. I said to myself that an official meeting had to be approved by the State Council in Beijing and that there was not enough time. Thus the plan was shelved. Later, after being elected, Bush sent me a letter, expressing his regret for not being able to meet me and giving me two small gifts emblazoned with his name to serve as souvenirs. My impression of the U.S. presidential election was: only by making its platform in line with the wishes of the majority of the people and the electorate, would a political party have the possibility of coming into power. Surely, platforms used during the campaigns often are not or cannot be implemented, and some have even to be fundamentally altered, as candidates often break their promises after being elected. Nevertheless, voters are very practical and short-sighted, resulting in the defect of campaigning parties' writing a great deal of "checks" in order to win votes while disregarding all consequences. In order to win votes, political leaders pay great attention to having contact with all sectors of society, whether in ordinary time or during election campaigns. Bush's letter to me seemed to have been drafted and typed by his secretary and signed by him; the small gifts might have been specially prepared. He treated, in such a manner, someone whom he did not know and had had only an indirectly set appointment, and made appropriate responses to people, whatever social strata they belonged to--all this gave people the impression that he was courteous and respectful to people. Generally Chinese leaders would not handle things in such a manner. It is said that generally American leaders give responses to their own countrymen in the same manner. This not only shows their respect for their voters, treating them as equals, but also serves to increase "resources" for election campaigns. This is a phenomenon demonstrating the superiority of democratic politics. The June Fourth Storm. -- An Angry Tide of Patriotism (Part One): Sending Videos of the Student Movement, Made by the Hong Kong Media, to Zhao Ziyang In January 1989, Fang Lizhi wrote a letter to Deng Xiaoping, demanding the granting of amnesty and calling for the release of Wei Jingsheng, who had been arrested for involvement in the Xidan Democracy Wall activities. During February and March, some well-known cultural figures and a number of first-rate natural scientists at home wrote their respective joint open letters to the chief responsible persons of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, expressing support for Fang Lizhi's proposal and raising a series of democratic demands: reform the political system, release political prisoners, and terminate the practice of convicting people of ideological crimes. Many of those people were CPC members, and some were deputies to the National People's Congress and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Thus the actions aroused strong reactions at home and abroad. Many famous figures of the intellectual and scientific communities overseas responded by starting a signature drive to show solidarity. The political climate in China resembled to a great extent the situation before a huge storm. While in Hong Kong, I also strongly felt that a political storm was coming. I asked the propaganda department of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY to collect and sort out information about reactions from Hong Kong society and international reactions, and started the practice of transmitting to the CPC Central Committee and the State Council information about the outside world through the facsimile transmission device of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY (the small branch) on a daily basis, providing them with some reference information in the hope that they would take note of outside reactions when handling the matter. On 15 April 1989 Hu Yaobang died. University students of Beijing began to go to the streets. On 22 April, the day of the Hu Yaobang Memorial Meeting, tens of thousands of students gathered at Tiananmen Square. They sent three representatives to kneel down in front of the Great Hall of the People, demanding that responsible persons of the center meet them. But no one from the center went to meet them. I and several deputy directors of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY saw the scene on Hong Kong television. We all thought that such a way of handling things was not appropriate. Why could Zhao Ziyang and Li Peng not have come out to meet the students? If they themselves did not want to meet the students, they could have sent a secretary to meet the students. It was totally incomprehensible why they should have totally ignored the likely effects, letting students keep kneeling for several hours. Students acted out of their patriotism and their support for the reform and opening policy of the Communist Party of China. What was there to fear? Why should CPC leaders be afraid of meeting the masses and students? We really did not approve of the central responsible persons' approach which was characterized by being divorced from the masses. Beijing students progressed from carrying out marches and presenting petitions to staging a sit-in in Tiananmen Square, and from demanding a meeting with central leaders to demanding a dialogue with central leaders; but all the while the leaders in Beijing failed to deal with the developments in a timely and appropriate manner. The situation was getting increasingly grave, and there had been strong expressions of dissatisfaction from the outside world. I was extremely worried, and specially asked people to deliver to Zhao Ziyang and the Central Committee Secretariat, videos, made by Hong Kong reporters in Beijing and broadcast in Hong Kong, of the student movement in Beijing, and materials on reactions from the Hong Kong media, in the hope of arousing their attention so that they might dispose of the matter appropriately at an early date. After seeing them, Zhao Ziyang said to the delivery people that they provided more information than he got in Beijing and requested that such videos and materials continue to be sent to him from time to time. [End of Installment No. 115] [28 Aug 93 p 3] [Text] An Angry Tide of Patriotism (Part Two): The Political Bureau Meeting Determined That the Student Movement Was a Case of Turmoil; Li Peng Completely Jettisoned the CPC's Glorious Tradition of Relying on the Masses On 23 April, Zhao Ziyang left Beijing to visit Pyongyang, North Korea. The next day Li Peng gathered and presided over a Political Bureau meeting, at which Li Ximing [2621 6932 6900], secretary of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, and Chen Xitong [7115 1585 0681], mayor of Beijing, reported to the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on the student movement in Beijing. They exaggerated the situation, or even distorted facts and gave false information. As a result, the meeting concluded that the student movement constituted a "serious organized and planned political struggle guided by an anti-Communist, anti-Socialist program," and that the movement was a case of "turmoil" in terms of its nature. After the meeting, Li Peng told Yang Shangkun that he would report to Deng Xiaoping. On 25 April, Deng Xiaoping met Yang Shangkun and Li Peng. After listening to reports, Deng expressed agreement to their views and the Political Bureau meeting's conclusion on the nature of the student movement. After Deng Xiaoping expressed his attitude, on the same night Li Peng asked the party and government institutions of Beijing Municipality to transmit the decision made by Deng Xiaoping and the Political Bureau meeting, and informed the provincial and municipal party committees by telegram. He also asked Hu Qili to immediately arrange for RENMIN RIBAO to write an editorial. On the next day, that is, 26 April, RENMIN RIBAO published an editorial, entitled "It Is Necessary to Take a Clearcut Stand Against Turmoil," publicly claiming that the student movement "is a planned conspiracy, is a case of turmoil, and is in essence aimed at fundamentally rejecting the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system." On the same day Beijing and Shanghai held their respective meetings each attended by 10,000 CPC-member cadres, calling on all CPC members to take part in this serious political struggle. Upon learning the news, I felt that something was very wrong. According to analysis made at that time, a small array of foreign forces and anti-Communist forces did get involved in the student movement, and some even played some behind-the-scenes manipulation in the student movement, but the student movement was patriotic. The conclusion that the student movement as a whole was a case of turmoil represented an exaggeration of the seriousness of the problem, and an action of striking at a very large number of people. This action was not proper in view of the actual situation, and was very unwise. After being published, the editorial aroused strong reactions from cadres at large and the broad masses. On 27 April, nearly 100,000 college students of Beijing demonstrated in the streets. The CPC Beijing Municipal Committee had already issued, through organizations at the various levels, strict orders of dismissing and transferring those taking moderate actions to support turmoil instigators and of arresting and punishing those taking energetic actions to support turmoil instigators, but the students still received warm responses and support from the broad masses of residents and cadres when conducting marches. Before 26 April, the student movement mainly targeted Li Peng. After the publication of the editorial, things began to change, and Deng Xiaoping began to be targeted directly. Some children of senior cadres, close to the Deng family, spread the idea that "Deng Xiaoping was sold out by Li Peng." The student movement "escalated," thereby forcing Yuan Mu, Chen Xitong, and others to carry out a "dialogue" with student representatives. Their rigid attitude characterized by the insistence that the student movement was a case of "turmoil" not only failed to moderate the student movement, but added fuel to the flames. On 13 May several hundred students began a hunger strike as part of the petition effort. Students on hunger strike numbered several thousand on the next day. Tiananmen Square, Beijing, and the entire country were seething and were in an uproar. The were reports, from time to time, of students fainting and being sent to hospitals. The number of students on hunger strike continued to increase. Some even began to refuse to drink water. It was such a grave situation that forced Li Peng to come out to carry out a dialogue with student representatives. As shown by live television coverage, Li Peng put on executive airs and assumed a condescending attitude, while demonstrating no trace at all of the CPC's practice of mass work. Especially, on the one hand Li Peng told student representatives: "Neither the government nor the CPC Central Committee has ever said that you students are creating turmoil." On the other hand he refused to accept the demands contained in the petitions made by the students on hunger strike, would not conduct any substantive dialogue with student representatives, and refused to recognize that the students were being patriotic. Li Peng also said that he would express his own views at an appropriate time, thereby effectively declaring that RENMIN RIBAO's "conclusion on the nature of the movement" would not be changed. He continued to threaten representatives of the students on hunger strike, behaving in an abominable way. The scene was really unbearable to watch. After seeing the scene, I and some of my colleagues at the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY were totally disgusted, believing that the CPC's tradition of believing in and relying on the masses was completely jettisoned by Li Peng. It would had been better that he had not come out to conduct the dialogue. After he engaged in dialogue, the situation was certain to further deteriorate. Just a day later, on the night of 19 May, Li Peng, shouting at the top of his voice, declared at the meeting of party, government, and military cadres in Beijing that the student movement was a case of turmoil, and that it was necessary to fight back against turmoil. Yang Shangkun claimed that troops were already being ordered to enter Beijing. Zhao Ziyang did not participate in the meeting. I felt that Zhao Ziyang might have already been driven out of power and that the situation would deteriorate quickly. The next day the marshall law decree signed by Li Peng was made public, triggering even more powerful resistance activities in Beijing and Hong Kong, and the situation became even more serious. In Beijing a million people staged marches and demonstrations, demanding the rescinding of the marshall law decree. The slogan, "Down with Li Peng," was heard all over Beijing, and even some workers at the CPC Central Committee and the State Council took part in the activities, holding banners. The powerfulness and scale were unprecedented. [End of Installment No. 116]
