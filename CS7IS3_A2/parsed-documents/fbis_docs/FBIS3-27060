The dictionary -- a comprehensive collection of entries of terms, terminologies, inferences, doctrines, writings, documents, and meetings on Deng Xiaoping's thought and theory -- is an effective tool for studying, researching, and propagating his thought and theory. While primarily reflecting Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the dictionary also fully covers his previous theoretical contributions. Entries in the dictionary are classified into major entries and general entries. The dozen or so major entries contributed by such authoritative figures as Qian Qichen, Zhang Siqing, Zheng Wenhan, Gong Yuzhi [7895 5148 0037], Wu Jinglian, and edited by Chao Feng [1560 1496] separately and briefly introduce Deng Xiaoping's thought and theory as well as his contributions in other fields such as philosophy, politics, law, economics, military affairs, diplomacy, education, science and technology, literature and art, and party building. In carrying deep theoretical significance and academic values, the dictionary reflects the complete system of Deng Xiaoping's thought and theory.
