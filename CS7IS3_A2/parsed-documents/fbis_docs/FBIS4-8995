Otherwise, he could not have said that I supported the deputies' compromising draft for the election system to the senate, which had the large districts composed of three smaller ones. Most of the papers took on this information and came to various conclusions. I did not support such a proposal, and I cannot support it because I do not understand what the difference is between 81 electoral districts and 81 electoral districts associated into 27 larger ones. On the contrary, I said that I believed another draft to be more reasonable--that is, the one about which I had been informed by the deputies and that involves 27 electoral districts in which triple elections would be held on the basis of three independent lists of candidates. This would be a majority system, which would be different from the subsequent one in that three mandates would be won simultaneously in triple elections. I am aware that those are details that are uninteresting for many readers. However, because I like order and precision, I have decided to react.
