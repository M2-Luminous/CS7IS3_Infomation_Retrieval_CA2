Based on this information, it appears that the crime was carried out by people who were acting on the orders of the Turkish Secret Services. One of the victims, (Ozker Tufansu), was a major witness for the Republic of Cyprus to overturn claims by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' regime that 22 Turkish Cypriots who were living in the free areas had been brutally mistreated by the police. Tufansu, who was in the free areas, fled to the occupied areas but later returned. Ten days before his assassination, he revealed Turkish activities to the police. A few days ago, two deserters who were soldiers at the Attila line [the buffer zone] came to the free areas because they said they could not tolerate the occupation regime's suppression. Approximately 400 Turkish Cypriots live in the free areas today and 180 of them are deserters.
