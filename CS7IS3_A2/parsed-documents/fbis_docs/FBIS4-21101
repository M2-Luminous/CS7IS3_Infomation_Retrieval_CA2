Twenty-three-year-old Kamlaksha Shetty, arrested late in October while trying to smuggle a kilogram of heroin out of the country, was pleading with police officers to somehow get him off the hook. [Passage omitted] The arts student at Bhavan's college in Andheri, the police said, had concealed over 100 plastic capsules containing three grams of heroin each in his stomach and intestines, to smuggle them to Mauritius. [Passage omitted] Shetty's father retired a few years ago from his job as senior technician in a city engineering firm. "No one in the family is earning any money," Shetty says. Perhaps that led him to agree to being a "carrier," as the police term it. In jeans and brightly-patterned cotton shirt, Shetty is the typical college student. Anyone meeting the dark curly haired, third-year student of history and philosophy on the street would expect a degree of bravado in his talk. [Passage omitted] Now, as the enormity of his crime slowly sinks in--under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, Shetty will spend 10 of the best years of his life in jail--the bluster has all evaporated. What was merely a schoolboy lark has turned out to be serious indeed. "There was a man, Noormohammed Salewala, who used to hang around in the college canteen with us, and joke with me sometimes," Shetty says. "One day he asked me if I would do a small job for him. He would pay me Rs 30,000, he said." Shetty is merely the youngest of an emerging new breed of white-collar drug-traffickers, lured by the easy profits and glamour associated with what is virtually an industry--growing explosively, exponentially. He seems to have all the attributes of the new breed--his parents are well-placed and fairly well off, and his brother works in advertising. [Passage omitted] Today, the average drug-trafficker could well be the clean-cut, slick talking boy next door. Or like Major Motilal Tiku, arrested in November last year after he helped drug-traffickers set up an export unit as a cover for their activities, they may be firmly entrenched in the ranks of the establishment. Apart from the odd policeman, the narcotics cell's bag of drug-sellers last year also included an assistant collector of central excise, two doctors, and a brace of laboratory assistants. In fact the cell made the largest-ever seizure of mandrax tablets in the world--five tonnes on January 13--after officials discovered that a doctor was routinely manufacturing heroin at his Kurla home. Dr Imtiyaz Mohammed Iliyas, 33, told the police that he had opened a dispensary in a Vakola shop allegedly given to him by industrialist Ramakrishna Bajaj. "I practiced for one year," he says, "but I never earned enough to feed my family." Iliyas got into the drugs trade through a classmate who told him that his dispensary was an ideal place to "park" charas until it was picked up. He was paid Rs 10,000 for every consignment the drug-runners stored there. Periodically, he also sold small quantities of heroin in the local market, around one kilogram at a time. One of these deals went sour, and by 1990, he had been arrested by the police, but was released on bail. The case is still pending in the sessions court. A scared Iliyas fled to Indore after one of his regular buyers, Babita Shardul, was arrested by the police. But by then he had managed to place his brother Anis, 42, in the business. Anis was himself later arrested by the narcotics cell. Iliyas returned to Bombay in 1992, and put up his shingle in Chunabhatti. He joined the ONGC [Oil and Natural Gas Commission] as a medical officer. Again, he says, he had money problems, and turned to his friends in the drug trade to bail him out. Put in touch with one of the big fish, Prembhai Shetty, he was taught how to prepare mandrax tablets from methaqualone powder. Meanwhile he was preparing heroin at home, with raw stock from his Pathan friends, and selling it at a profit of Rs 10,000 per kg. When arrested by the police this year, he took them to the Victoria Docks and showed them two 20-foot containers full of nearly five tonnes of mandrax. Major Motilal Tiku, Kashmiri and formerly of the Dogra Rifles, presents a case fraught with national security implications. After retirement in 1985, he set up a factory in Raigad. His involvement with the drug traffickers began last year, after he was approached for help with export formalities. Major Tiku's two sons are highly placed. One of them, Rajendra, is in the IPS [Indian Police Service], and is an inspector-general of police (crime) in Jammu and Kashmir. The other, Pradeep, holds the rank of lieutenant colonel in the army, and is presently posted in Assam. These delicate postings, combined with their father's involvement in the drug trade, would render them ideal targets for blackmail by agents provocateurs. Except for the fact that both men have apparently severed relations with their father, the latter's involvement could well have serious security implications. Major Tiku claims that he even advised the drug traffickers to set up a small unit to manufacture chemical items, as a cover for their activities, and promised to help them get a bank loan and complete all the necessary formalities. The police were led to him after they arrested two accomplices with more than 200 kgs. of mandrax tablets in their possession. Last October the narcotics cell also arrested Bishistha Narayan Singh, an assistant collector of central excise, who misused his official position in helping a drug-runner analyse a batch of mandrax tablets. [Passage omitted] "There seems to be no reason but plain greed to explain why all these people have gotten into the business," says the DCP [Deputy Commissioner of Police], Mr Sur. "They seemed to have nearly everything they could wish for, and yet that's not enough." The sheer geographical spread of his work prompted Surendrajit Singh, a 65-year-old coach attendant on Western Railway, to enter drug-trafficking. For 10 years before he was arrested in 1991, he smuggled contraband across the country--most often taped to the insides of water tanks and the supply pipes of the toilets in the compartments he was stationed in. He was caught, finally, with a load of heroin he had ordered from a supplier in Rajasthan. "The city, serviced by 37 airlines and two ports, is the ideal stop-over point for drugs," says Mr Sur. "And with the far-flung network of railway lines, narcotics are travelling on the railways into the hinterland." During the period from 1990, when Mr Sur took over the Narcotics cell, a total of 17 tonnes of narcotics has been seized, running into around US$500 million in international markets. Typically, law enforcement officials are able to seize less than 10 per cent of contraband. [passage omitted]
