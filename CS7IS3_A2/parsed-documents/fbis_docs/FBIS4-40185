Kuryakov with N.T. Ryabov, chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, and Doctor of Law Yu.A. Vedeneyev of the Institute of State and Law, in which they discussed the articles that have appeared in the press recently questioning the validity of the 12 December referendum on the Constitution of the Russian Federation. Referring to the allegations, Ryabov starts by noting: "The newspaper IZVESTIYA has called them political dynamite but I would call them political soap because dynamite and soap are rather similar in external appearance but are quite different in their effect. Also, these press articles leave behind only soap bubbles. So, we have not paid any particular attention to these analysts and their deductions." One of the main areas of criticism has been about alleged discrepancies in the total numbers of votes cast, "but these authors have either forgotten or have deliberately omitted the other five parties that took part in the elections. They did not surmount the five percent barrier, but some people did vote for them; they accounted together for 4.7 million votes. So if one compares the number of votes cast in favor of the Constitution with the number of votes cast for the party lists, one can see that the Constitution was passed." Ryabov goes on to examine various details of the allegations and produced documentary evidence to show that they were untrue. He concludes: "There is not a single documented fact that proves these falsifications, and certainly none showing massive falsifications, which these few authors write about so ecstatically." Legal expert Vedeneyev points out that the Supreme Court has issued a decision confirming the validity of the referendum. Ryabov recalls that on 16 March 1994 the Supreme Court had rejected the Russian Communist Workers' Party appeal for the referendum to be deemed invalid. International observers had also approved the validity of the voting, he says. Vedeneyev says that the political forces which did not like the election results were trying to cast doubt on them. "There is also an attempt to instill uncertainty and dissatisfaction in the public consciousness and once again to initiate the atmosphere of crisis, which was characteristic of 1993." Ryabov agrees and goes on: "This sort of article is coming from representatives of certain political forces that are either outside the legitimate political system such as the Russian Communist Workers' Party or else are formally within the real political system, but because of the forms and methods of struggle they use cannot be fully part of this system." Ryabov suggests that these allegations had been raised now in response to the draft law guaranteeing electoral rights, which has been submitted by the president to the Federal Assembly. Ryabov concludes by recalling that all legal suits against the validity of the referendum had been rejected and the authors of the recent allegations "for some reason are not in a hurry to apply to the courts."
