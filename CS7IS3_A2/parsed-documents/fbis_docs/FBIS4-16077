Referring to the 9 April meeting between [Igor] Smirnov and President [Mircea] Snegur, Caraman said that if they had discussed merely political issues, the negotiations could have failed. He also explained that experts of both sides are now elaborating different ways of establishing economic relations between the two banks [of the Dniester River], especially the cooperation between the banking networks, bilateral payment of goods, gas supplies, and so on. The Tiraspol leader also assessed that the ratification by the Chisinau Parliament of the agreement on [Moldova's] joining the CIS will make easier relations between Tiraspol and Chisinau. "The dizziness of independence parades is over. Politicians have understood that survival will be impossible if we stay separate," said Caraman. Referring to the [Ilie] Ilascu case [person held prisoner by the Tiraspol authorities], Caraman declared that his fate is in the hands of the people [certain persons]. "Ilascu or his relatives will have to write a pardon demand. If they do not, even Smirnov cannot have the right to help him," Caraman said.
