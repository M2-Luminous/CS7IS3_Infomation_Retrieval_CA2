He anticipated a dramatic development if the European Union [EU] foreign ministers do not solve their problems on Tuesday [22 March]. [Begin Kooijmans recording, in English, followed by Swedish translation] I know that the word crisis is used very often, sometimes too early, but I would find that a very dramatic development, which would stall also other forms of cooperation within the European Union. [end recording] [Correspondent] This was said by the Dutch foreign minister, Peter Kooijmans, who this afternoon arrived in Stockholm almost directly from the dramatic night in Brussels. He said that it is not a crisis yet, but if the Twelve have not solved their institutional questions by next Tuesday, it will become almost impossible for the EU Parliament to discuss the EU's enlargement before the elections in June, in order that the timetable of 1 January can be adhered to in the case of the four countries which have their membership agreements ready. This would be a very dramatic development, the Dutch foreign minister said. Kooijmans was very critical of those countries which are now putting the brakes on over the question of the blocking majority, as he said. He does not see any logic in that; the way the others want to deal with the matter is the same way that has been applied in all other cases when the EU has received new members. In addition, the EU Parliament would never accept the views of Great Britain and Spain, he said. He therefore sees no need to show flexibility toward the two countries. He also said that if their governments have problems with their parliaments at home, like the British Government has, why not say to the critics that this problem has already been solved, it was solved at the EU summit in Lisbon when the procedure concerning the new members was taken up. So, one can judge from the statements of Dutch Foreign Minister Kooijmans that there is no room for compromise, and during the night he did not see any such signs from the British side either.
