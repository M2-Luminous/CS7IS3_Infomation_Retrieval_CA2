Optimism is growing. Spring sunshine finally flooded over the rain-drenched mountains after a national conference that was the very lift that experienced party officials had been hoping for. A brand new leadership had been elected with Borge Brende and Elisabeth Aspaker as new deputy chairmen. The new party leader had successfully negotiated his closing speech and the tricky questions at the news conference, and many people felt that they had been given "brass band music in their hearts," as former party leader Jan P. Syse put it earlier in the conference. Petersen also gave clear marching orders on the EU [European Union] question: "There will be no membership unless the Conservative Party is involved and does its share of the job! If there are people in the Labor Party who believe that the EU race is theirs alone, they are wrong," he said. His feeling is that opposition within the party to the EU -- with only 2 percent no against 98 percent yes -- is not too large or so forcibly expressed that the party cannot live with it. Jan Petersen, who was elected with acclamation and without any rival candidate yesterday morning, said that one of his main tasks -- alongside the EU question -- will be to bring the Conservative Party back to the position of the dominant challenger to the Labor Party. "The situation of being the Storting's third largest party is a situation with which we feel most uncomfortable," he said. The new Conservative leader wants to bring out the differences between the Labor Party and the Conservative Party more clearly and thinks that he has a stockpile of enough issues that can show that the two parties are still as different as they were perceived to be in the past. Both he and others in the party have a great deal of patience when it comes to the length of time it will take to resurrect the party from support of around 17 percent. "Now we must forget the opinion poll figures for a couple of years." Petersen also tried to look at the everyday lives of people from a viewpoint outside the Storting. "Let us never forget that there is another Norway beyond the political Norway. A Norway where the main question is whether it will be possible to keep one's job into next year. Where the worry is not the budget deficit, but whether it is safe to walk home from the bus stop." The question of who actually is the leader of the new Conservative Party has been raised by many, given that Anders Talleraas will continue to be parliamentary leader and Kaci Kullmann Five is still expected to be a frontline figure on the EU question. The same questions surfaced at the closing news conference yesterday, and Petersen's replies chiefly had the thrust that this will not be a problem: "Come back in six months and you will see that this has not been a problem," Petersen said. He said that in the final analysis he will be the one who has to be in the frontline on all important questions, but that he needs all the good forces that can assist him in his job. He was unwilling to say whether or not Anders Talleraas should be reelected parliamentary leader and added that this was something for the Storting group to decide. [passage omitted]
