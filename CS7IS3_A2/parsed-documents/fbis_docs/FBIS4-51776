According to military officials, the MND has decided to hasten the purchase of three sorts of weapons demanded by U.S. Forces Korea because a budget for buying them has become available since adjustments of the Yulgok Project, such as the cancellation of the plan to improve the capacity of Phantom F-4s, were made as a result of a special inspection into the Yulgok Project in March, and because the ROK-based U.S. forces have strongly demanded the reinforcement in equipment of the ROK Army in preparation for a war since the beginning of this year. The ROK will hasten the purchase of the following weapons from the United States at U.S. Forces Korea's request for an early purchase of them with the reason of effective joint operations: AN-TPQ 37, an anti-artillery radar for detecting the enemy's artillery units (58 billion won worth); C-NITE, night shooting control equipment attached to Cobra helicopters that enables tow missiles to be fired at night (20 billion won worth); and a jamming device that disturbs infrared guided missiles (2 billion won worth).
