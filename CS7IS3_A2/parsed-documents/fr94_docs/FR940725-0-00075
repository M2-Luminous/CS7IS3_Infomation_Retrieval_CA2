FR940725-0-00075 FR940725-0-00011 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [WV 5&hyph;1&hyph;6307; FRL&hyph;4888&hyph;7] Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; West Virginia: Limited Approval and Disapproval of PM&hyph;10 Implementation Plan for the Follansbee Area AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is taking simultaneous limited approval and limited disapproval action on a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of West Virginia. West Virginia submitted the plan revisions in order to achieve the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10) and to fulfill other Clean Air Act (Act) requirements for the Follansbee, West Virginia area. The limited approval makes bilateral consent orders between the West Virginia Office of Air Quality and six companies federally enforceable and fulfills some of the requirements of the Act applicable to the Follansbee area. The limited disapproval disapproves West Virginia's submittal for the purpose of fulfilling its requirements under sections 172 and 189 of the Act to demonstrate that the SIP will provide for the attainment of the NAAQS. These actions are being taken under section 110 of the Act in light of EPA's authority pursuant to section 301(a) to adopt regulations necessary to further air quality improvement by strengthening the SIP. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule will become effective on August 24, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107; Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW, Washington, DC 20460; and West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, Office of Air Quality, 1558 Washington Street, East, Charleston, West Virginia, 25311. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas A. Casey, (215) 597&hyph;2746. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The air quality planning requirements for PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas, such as the Follansbee area, are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of Title I of the Act. Among other requirements, the Act requires that SIPs provide for reasonably available control measures (RACM) including reasonably available control technology (RACT), emissions inventories, and demonstrations (including air quality modeling) that the SIP will provide for attainment of the NAAQS by the statutory attainment date. On January 7, 1994 (59 FR 988), EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) that proposed limited approval and limited disapproval West Virginia's November 15, 1991 PM&hyph;10 SIP submittal for the Follansbee, West Virginia PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area. The submittal is not fully approvable because it does not demonstrate attainment of NAAQS, and, therefore, does not satisfy the requirements of section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act. Specifically, the modeling is unapprovable as a demonstration of attainment because of deficiencies in estimating emissions from coke oven batteries and other sources, the lack of an approvable analysis of intermediate terrain, and the nonguideline use of the Gaussian Plume Multiple Source Air Quality Algorithm (RAM) dispersion model in a meteorologically rural area. While the submittal does not meet specific provisions of Part D, it does contain some provisions (enforceable consent orders) which advance the NAAQS-related air quality protection goals of the Act. Therefore, EPA is approving the submittal for the limited purpose of approving the consent agreements and making them part of the SIP. EPA has evaluated the consent agreements for consistency with the Act and EPA regulations and has found that they provide State and federally enforceable provisions to decrease PM&hyph;10 emissions in the nonattainment area. While approving the consent orders for incorporation by reference into the SIP, EPA is taking no action at this time on the contingency measures contained therein with respect to the requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Act. The General Preamble to Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments established a November 15, 1993 deadline for state submittal of contingency plans (57 FR 13498). In addition to the limited approval and limited disapproval, EPA proposed to determine that PM&hyph;10 precursors, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds, do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 concentrations in the Follansbee area. (See section 189(e).) EPA based this proposal an air quality data presented by West Virginia in its submittal. The rationale for today's action is presented in more detail in the NPR and in the Technical Support Document (TSD) which is available at the addresses indicated above. Summary of Public Comments EPA received two letters of comment; comments were submitted by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection and by the Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation (WPS). 1. In correspondence dated February 4, 1994, West Virginia described its ``planned action'' to correct the deficiencies in its submittal. West Virginia stated its intent to correct PM&hyph;10 emission rates, perform an analysis of intermediate terrain, and replace RAM with an approvable technique for modeling certain area sources under rural meteorological conditions. Additionally, West Virginia also related its intent to alter the characterizations of certain buoyant volume sources.
