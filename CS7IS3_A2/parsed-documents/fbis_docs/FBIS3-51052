Construction companies are now charging much less for their services. The decline in costs has prompted the government to study the formation of a special commission to renegotiate contracts. With just half the allocation to extend the Fernao Dias Highway, which links Belo Horizonte with Sao Paulo, it will be possible to finish the job. A high-ranking DNER [National Highway Department] official has given another reason for the drop in public works costs: the DNER has paid for the contracted services on time, thus preventing the overinvoicing by the construction companies. The IDB [Inter-American Development Bank] and the World Bank are excited with this trend.
