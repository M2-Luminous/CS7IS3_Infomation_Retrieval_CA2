It says: No one imagined that matters would lead to a war in this way, as if the war was taking place among enemies, when they are, in fact, brothers. In its editorial today by Barzan al-Tikriti, the newspaper adds: Just as the majority [words indistinct] the declaration of unity, this saddening and painful event was not expected to take place between brothers in the way we see and hear from the mass media. The writer explained in his article that what is taking place could be viewed as a result of a relationship between two contradictory regimes that were placed within a framework of unity about which many people seeking or opposing the concept of unity voiced their doubts. AL-JUMHURIYAH points out in its editorial that what has caused the all-out war is that some people view the concept of unity as something that should be complete, or should lead to a destructive, all-out war as the only alternative. This is, of course, wrong in the view of everyone who honestly wants unity The editorial says that in order to make unity true and to guarantee it, the people should, before the leaders and officials, believe in it, understand it, and adhere to it. This, the newspaper says, will prevent differences among officials from affecting, threatening, and undermining unity.
