(AFMC) signed export contracts for Korean farm products worth 2.57 million U.S. dollars at the Berlin International Farm Products Fair, which ended Jan. 23, an AFMC spokesman said Friday. Fifteen Korean companies displayed 54 items at the fair, with the most popular being sweet rice drink, pumpkin soup, kimchi, odorless garlic and chicken soup with ginseng. Ginseng products, a main export item, were not displayed at the fair so the contracts were poor. AFMC will attend nine international farm products fairs this year, including the Berlin Fair, to make Korean products better known to the world.
