Gavrileva report on news conference given by Sergey Tsekov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Crimea; place and date not given: "We Are Working Without Fanfare"] [Text] The corps of journalists of Crimea welcomes the endeavor of Sergey Tsekov, the new chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Crimea, to continue the former tradition of holding a news conference following the completion of a stage of work of the Supreme Soviet. Sergey Pavlovich held his first important meeting with journalists during a lengthy break in the work of the first session, when it had become possible to speak about the fully formed leadership of the Crimean parliament. Work of Parliament [Question] Please assess the three days of business of the session. [Tsekov] I believe that the Supreme Soviet spent them entirely productively, the plan which had been mapped out by the action committee was fulfilled, the leadership elected, and the presidium formed--all without undue shouting and clamor, calmly, and in balanced fashion. I evaluate the makeup of the commissions positively also; the professional level of the deputies is quite high, and they are ready for work. [Question] When will the session continue? [Tsekov] The plenary sitting will open on 20 May; work in the commissions is under way at this time. [Question] What will be predominant in parliament's work--party or factional discipline? [Tsekov] I believe that factional discipline will prevail. [Question] How do you plan to establish relations with the kurultay faction following the well-known incident at the session? [Tsekov] They will be built as they were built before: on the basis of mutual respect. [Word illegible] misunderstanding of my position as chairman. I would like the Crimean Tatar deputies to understand that I was in a very difficult situation as regards the candidates for chairman of the Commission for Nationality Policy and the Affairs of Deported Citizens. It was this that dictated the proposal that I made. And we made the right decision in postponing the elections until 20 May--I hope that the kurultay delegation will have returned from Kiev by that time. [Question] What do you think, which group or faction of deputies has been the best prepared for work in parliament? [Tsekov] As the experience of the three days of work has shown--the Russia faction. And, of course, the kurultay faction also is prepared for serious parliamentary work. [Question] A record was set--one deputy went to the microphone 51 times. What do you intend doing to ensure that garrulous deputies not grab so much time for themselves? [Tsekov] We are required to observe the standing orders, and if they permit a deputy to take the floor either 50 or 100 times, this is a problem for the deputy, not the chairman of the Supreme Soviet and not the Supreme Soviet as a whole. It is possible that the Supreme Soviet will amend the standing orders accordingly. But the situation should not be dramatized. Crimea and Ukraine [Question] What advantages would treaty relations with Ukraine convey, in what way would this be better than the Law on the Delineation of Powers? [Tsekov] The economic situation in Crimea is wholly dependent on Ukraine because we are located in a single economic field. And mistakes that are made by the Ukrainian leadership are manifested most directly in Crimea, in a worse version even sometimes. Were a treaty to be signed, it would be easier for us to implement the right economic transformations. I could outline for you the first possibility of an improvement in the economic situation: the demilitarization of Crimea. In addition, we would remove the barriers between states, primarily with Russia.... [Question] Your future steps for filling the state sovereignty of Crimea? [Tsekov] These steps are clearly identified in the program of the Russia bloc: restoration of the constitution of 6 May 1992 and the formation of a delegation to Kiev in order to persuade the leadership of Ukraine of the need to build relations with Crimea on a treaty basis. [Question] What is the attitude of the Supreme Soviet of Crimea toward the impending elections of the president of Ukraine? Will Crimeans take part? [Tsekov] I was unable in these three days to ascertain the Supreme Soviet's attitude toward this problem, it is not a question to be discussed there, although I do not rule out this possibility. The attitude of the majority of political parties, however, is unequivocal: Crimeans should not take part in the elections. [Question] Do you consider it normal that the Supreme Soviet of Crimea is without the representation of Ukrainian organizations and Ukrainians in general? [Tsekov] I cannot agree because the Russia bloc did not promote candidates on a national basis. And seven representatives of Ukrainian nationality were elected to the Crimean parliament. [Question] Numerous demonstrations demanding the annulment of Crimean autonomy are taking place in Kiev. What if this were actually to happen--what might the steps of the Supreme Soviet of Crimea be? [Tsekov] I cannot even imagine this, to be honest. This is practically impossible. Theoretically, yes, but we have in the past four years amassed sufficient experience, and among Ukrainian politicians there have come to be people who are perfectly sober-minded and who understand the Crimea situation--they understand what drastic action on the part of the Ukrainian leadership could signify: It would mean not only the complete detachment of Crimea from Ukraine but also the breakup of Ukraine itself. Our actions? We would not agree with such a decision, of course, and would take the appropriate steps, together with the president, naturally. [Question] The Ukrainian and Russian press believe that the present composition of the Ukrainian parliament will adopt a tougher position in respect to Crimea. Do you share this viewpoint? How will you build your relations with the Ukrainian parliament? [Tsekov] I believe that the attitude toward Crimea from the toughness viewpoint will change and that the situation will ease. I was a people's deputy of Ukraine for four years and I know how we were viewed by the national democrats initially: unequivocal rejection of the statehood of Crimea and all that was happening in Crimea. But two or three years have gone by, and many of them have already begun to say that there is a Crimea problem and that it needs to be resolved on the basis of political dialogue and that Crimea should be given as much authority as possible. The same will be the case with the present Supreme Council of Ukraine also. Crimea-Russia-Ukraine [Question] Your vision of relations with Russia and Ukraine? [Tsekov] These are big questions, and we have answered them repeatedly. Mutual relations should be built on a treaty basis--with both Russia and Ukraine. [Question] How do you conceive of a treaty with Ukraine--what should it include? [Tsekov] Any treaty may be of three types--economic, political, and military-political. I would want a treaty between Ukraine and Crimea to be a treaty of equals. I do not rule out a military- political treaty with Russia being concluded together with Ukraine and I hope that Ukraine will ultimately, after a certain length of time, arrive at an understanding of integration. Sevastopol [Question] There is talk to the effect that the question of the transfer of the capital of Crimea to Sevastopol could be in the offing.... [Tsekov] This is not our suggestion, it came, as far as I know, from the Crimea Economic Revival Party. The reasoning is that the question of Sevastopol's integration in Crimea could be solved quite gently in this case. A paradoxical situation has taken shape: Sevastopol is an inalienable part of Crimea, but the organs of state power are not formed according to legislation of Crimea, although, in accordance with all legislative instruments, of Ukraine included, the authority is ours. Were we to solve this question, there could, consequently, be no question of a transfer. If not, transfer of the capital could be assumed to be an option. [Question] Do you consider the administrative association of Sevastopol and Crimea essential, and if this is realistic, in what kind of timeframe? [Tsekov] Of course, Sevastopol is an inalienable part of Crimea, they must be together. The timeframe is a difficult matter. But work on this needs to be started at once. Military Matters [Question] You are a supporter of a gradual demilitarization of Crimea. How will this process take place? What is the size of the forces? [Tsekov] You know well enough the program of the Crimea Republican Party and the Russia bloc--it speaks of the need for military reform and says what is implied by this specifically: phased demilitarization of Crimea with the retention of a contingent of troops of reasonable sufficiency; territorial defense of Crimea within the framework of CIS collective security; the creation of a republican guard of Crimea for defense of the constitutional system of the Republic of Crimea and public safety. Various figures for the size of the forces are cited--60,000, 40,000, even 80,000--but I do not know the true size. [Question] The Supreme Soviet has a Commission for Military Matters, Security, and Servicemen's Protection, and representatives of the Russia bloc constitute its majority. There are servicemen of both Russia and Ukraine in Crimea. Which servicemen's rights will this commission protect? [Tsekov] I understand it to be a question of the rights of all servicemen stationed on the territory of Crimea. Party and Speaker [Question] Do you intend combining the offices of chairman of the Supreme Soviet and party chairman? [Tsekov] I do not at this moment consider that I have to quit the post of party chairman--as you know, the law permits this. If the congress considers otherwise, I am prepared to comply with this decision. But just as I was a member of the Crimea Republican Party, I would remain a Republican. [Question] Who is today the ideologist of the Crimea Republican Party after the previous ideologist has declared his opposition? [Tsekov] The Crimea Republican Party had several ideologists-- one was the president of Crimea, a second suspended his party membership, a third was to some extent myself, a fourth--V. Terekhov--is continuing his work. The Supreme Soviet and the Executive [Question] Many edicts of the president of Crimea are not in effect today. What will the steps of the Supreme Soviet be? [Tsekov] I am inclined to believe that we should confirm these edicts and thus help the president in their realization. [Question] Will you be changing the structure of the government in accordance with the structure of the Supreme Soviet? [Tsekov] Questions connected with the formation of the government are within the competence of the Supreme Soviet. I said at the session that it is necessary first and foremost to consider questions of Crimea's economic position and the structure and composition of the government. It is possible that the deputies will agree, and if there are objections, this will be ascertained at the session. The powers should, however, be equal and should balance one another. [Question] Your personal opinion of the work of the government? How smooth will discussion of the composition of the government at the Supreme Soviet be? [Tsekov] I do not have a full impression of its work, although it is positive, on the whole. And the discussion--have you noticed that discussion of the composition has not been smooth in a single CIS parliament? [Question] How might you explain the president's aspiration to put together a Crimean Government of newcomers--what, is Crimea's intellectual potential exhausted? [Tsekov] You had better ask Yu. Meshkov this. But I would not say that he is trying to form a government according to this principle. It will consist 90-95 percent of Crimeans. As far as representatives of Russia in our government are concerned, this was necessary, and I fully approve and support this step of the president. What will happen in the future? Perhaps these people will become citizens of Crimea; it cannot be ruled out that their positions will be taken by Crimeans. But they have a sincere desire to help Crimea, I personally have no doubt about this. S. Tsekov--Speaker [Question] How do you feel in the role of speaker? Are you coping with this role? [Tsekov] I feel confident thus far. I do not know what the future will bring, but the first two days went better than I had expected. [Question] How controllable is our parliament? Is it submitting to the will of the speaker? [Tsekov] I have the impression that the deputies understand that it is necessary to hold plenary sittings efficiently and have learned rapidly how to avail themselves of the Council, and this was a problem--remember how they demanded that microphones be installed in the hall? We have left them, but it seems to me that they are availing themselves of them less and less often. [Question] Have you met with N. Bagrov? [Tsekov] I have spoken with Nikolay Vasilyevich by telephone and intend to meet with him in the very near future. The purpose? He is a chairman of the Supreme Soviet with great experience, and I would like to familiarize myself with this experience--but this does not mean that I will borrow it in full. On the whole, I believe that we must switch to civilized forms of intercourse. I criticized the chairman of the Supreme Soviet before I was elected to this office, but I do not intend doing so after I myself have become chairman of the Supreme Soviet.
