Inaugurating the seminar, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, said no country can afford complacency about the drawbacks of the system though there is room for satisfaction. He said parliaments have to adapt themselves with the pace of the growing change in contemporary society. It is the will of the people and, therefore, it should articulate their aspirations. He said parliamentary democracy will succeed when it addresses the agenda of the nation. Listing the recent steps taken in India, Mr. Rao said several parliamentary committees have been formed to ensure accountability of the executive. Any Indian parliament member can now identify the urgent needs of the people of his constituency and suggest schemes up to one crore rupees. Mr. Rao also said that parliament and press should complement each other. Quoting Mahatma Gandhi, Mr. Rao called upon parliamentarians to recall the face of the poorest man they met ever and ask whether the steps they plan are going to benefit him. Welcoming the delegates, the Lok Sabha speaker, Mr. Shivraj Patil, emphasized the need to discover devices to cope with numerous problems faced by the people. While the parliamentary system works on the basis of majority's views it will become less productive if the aspirations of the minority are neglected. Mr. Patil also called for striking a balance to make multiparty democracy meaningful. The deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha, Dr. Najma Heptulla, emphasized the need for stability of a parliamentary system domestically to ensure the stability of the world order. The seminar will discuss among other things the need to reform parliamentary system and the roles of presiding officers and the opposition. The nine-day seminar is being attended by a number of delegates from home and abroad including the former speaker of the House of Commons of Britain, Lord (Wheteral). Later, participating in a discussion on parliamentary system in India, the secretary general of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association [CPA], Mr. Arthur (Donahue), commended India's democratic system. He said the CPA is taking steps to monitor the forthcoming elections in South Africa. Former union minister and Janata Dal leader, Mr. I.K. Gujral, in his speech said Indian parliament, by and large, has ensured accountability of the government to the people.
