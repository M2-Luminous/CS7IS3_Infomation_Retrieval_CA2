Will farmers supplying a privatized factory be able to count on free shares? When will the one and the other be able to get free shares? Today the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers will deal with the draft of the new law on privatization of state enterprises. This draft enters into the composition of the laws creating the Pact on State Enterprises and, should it become law, will replace the standing law on privatization. The draft, prepared by the Ministry of Ownership Transformations, has already passed through the so-called interministerial coordination. Workers' and Farmers' Shares The draft foresees the cancellation of the right of employees to buy, at half price, up to 20 percent of the shares or interest in a privatized firm. Instead, the work force would receive for free up to 15 percent of the shares (interest). The draft imposes a condition, however, in that the combined face value of the shares for the employees cannot be greater than 18 average wages in industry (average estimate based on six months' worth of wages, beginning one month before the share is issued) multiplied by the number of employees in the firm. The employees would receive their shares over the course of six months from the time the joint-stock company, which resulted from the conversion of the state enterprise, is entered into the trade registry. At present, employees may buy shares in their firm only two months after the shares have been accessible to other investors; in other words, in reality, from about 12 to 30 months after the company has been entered into the trade registry. The draft states that employees who received free shares will not have the right to vote at general assemblies of the company until the time of "the first general assembly convoked following the disposal of at least half of the general amount of shares (interest) by the state treasury." The same rights as those held by employees would be offered to private farmers and fishermen who supply the factories with raw materials. However, they will have to submit a written declaration "of intent to acquire shares" within one month from the day the company was entered into the trade registry. Capital Privatization This path would change the name to an intermediary and could follow the progression of: --invitations to bid publicly; --open tender or negotiations undertaken on the basis of a public invitation. In the ordinance, the minister will be able to designate the rules for acquiring shares. Without the agreement of the finance minister, shares of privatized companies will not be available for purchase by, among others, state enterprises, state banks, or banks that are joint-stock companies, the sole shareholder of which is the state treasury. Direct Privatization In the standing law, direct privatization is called privatization by liquidation, and it assumes that the enterprise privatized in this manner can be sold, used as a contribution into a company, or accepted into a leasing arrangement ["repayable exploitation"] by a so-called employee-owned company. Decisions about privatization by liquidation are undertaken by the so-called founding agencies [organy zaloczycielskie] (for example, those controlled by voivodships), but they require the permission of the privatization minister. In addition, the draft states what kind of factories can be privatized using this method. Direct privatization cannot be carried out if one of the following three conditions is met: --at the time of the commencement of the preliminary proceedings, the factory employs more than 400 people; --the value of the sale of goods and services during the year before the preliminary proceedings is more than 12 million ECU's (converted to zlotys at the rate announced by the NBP [National Bank of Poland] on the day of drawing up the balance sheet for that year; --the sum of the statutory capital and the enterprise capital, counted at the end of the year preceding the commencement of the preliminary proceedings, is more than 8 million ECU's (conversion principle as above). The draft assumes that, in justifiable cases, the government, at the request of the privatization minister, may agree to direct privatization even if a firm fulfills the condition dealing with the value of sales. The draft assumes, among other things, that the installment payment of the debt on the factory in the case of leasing may last up to 10 years, and the ownership rights to the factory may be assigned to the employees after payment of one-third of the amount stated in the agreement (but not before two years). The time limit of two years may be reduced to one year, if the company has paid a minimum of half of the debt. In addition, the draft states that the participants in the employee-owned company may not be foreign firms or individuals residing permanently outside of Poland. Detailed Changes The draft also assumes many detailed changes, among others, surrendering the existing entry that "Privatization Directions" for this year are passed together with the budget. In the future, this document will be a supplement to the budget because, as is written in the explanatory statement, "privatization is not something separate from the whole of the economy. It is a basic element in the economy." The draft also regulates the principles for calling forth boards of directors of companies and guarantees a place in the boards for employees as well as for private farmers and fishermen. It also proposes deletion of the entry that a one-person company of the state treasury should be privatized within two years. In practice, this entry was not implemented in many cases because there were no takers for the privatized factories. Transition Provisions The draft assumes, among other things, that the proposals on converting enterprises into companies not considered up to the date the new law becomes effective will be considered in accordance with the new law. If, however, as a result of the new law's provisions, there is an obligation to supplement the proposal, the proposer of the motion must do so within two months of the date the law goes into effect. In addition, if, on the date the new law becomes effective, the state treasury has not yet begun making company shares available to the employees, they will receive them on the basis of the new law. Where such access has already begun, it will be completed on the old model.
