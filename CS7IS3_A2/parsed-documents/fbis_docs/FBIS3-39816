Is this really the case? Might this not make negotiations more difficult, because the EU will be all the more careful to find transit routes for its trucks? Minister Klima said: [Begin Viktor Klima recording] I think that we can now expect more understanding in Brussels. We can only achieve a positive result in the referendum [on EU membership] if we manage to keep the transit agreement. This is the positive thing about it. I agree, however, that there might be some shortsighted people who say: We will now need a thoroughfare through the Alps, and we want to use Austria for this. It will, therefore, be very important to stick to our clear position. [Hopfmueller] Will it be sufficient for us to insist on keeping the transit agreement? Let me give an example: The transit agreement will expire in 2004. But 2004 is also the year the Swiss completely ban transit trucks from their roads. This means that trucks that are no longer allowed to pass through Switzerland might go via Austria because the restrictions of the transit agreement are no longer there. [Klima] The year 2004 is not the result of a poker game where we can trade or change around, but it is a result of measures we have to take. Measures to further develop the railroad infrastructure, to strengthen combined transport. Once we have taken these measures -- and we have envisaged to complete them by 1994 -- we can be sure that the transport policy will have been adjusted in such a way that the infrastructure, that is the railroads, will be used. I am sure that if we really implement these measures we will get more transport onto the railroads and will thus reduce the road transit problem. Switzerland is taking a similar course. [end recording] Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek, Austrian People's Party [OeVP] chairman, adds: [Begin recording Busek] For me, and for the OeVP, this means that extending the railroad system in the Alps must have absolute priority. We must find a solution that involves building tracks underground, using noise-reduction technologies. I think we will have to win over the EU to participate in this solution. There is no doubt that this will be easier from the inside than from the outside. The question has been asked whether this will make the situation for Austria easier or more difficult. I think that our standpoint is now clearer for the EU; but things have certainly not gotten any easier. What is needed now is action. [end recording] Some time ago, the Swiss voted against the European Economic Area. Now they are saying no to truck transit. This means that the Swiss rate European integration quite differently from the Austrian Government. Chancellor Vranitzky said on possible effects: [Begin recording Chancellor Franz Vranitzky] You cannot compare any two countries. Switzerland has had international relations much longer than Austria. There is hardly any Swiss company that does not have strong international contacts. This brought Switzerland many advantages in the past. As you will know, Switzerland will be facing a number of very difficult challenges if it chooses to stay away from the European integration process. I talked to Swiss Government members this morning because I was interested in knowing how they interpret this matter. They voiced concern that international cooperation might get more difficult for Switzerland following this attitude, because international cooperation does not only consist of international transport, but there are many other things involved. As you will also know, Switzerland has concluded a transit agreement with the EU, which will lose its basis in the future. Switzerland is thus facing important negotiations with the EU although it is not a member and has not yet decided in favor of joining. [Hopfmueller] Following this Swiss decision, do you fear a psychological effect on Austria regarding the EU referendum that will be held in Austria sometime in the future? [Vranitzky] We made great efforts negotiating the transit agreement with the EU three years ago. In the meantime, the importance of this agreement has increased a great deal. It is undisputed now, and many people are attaching great importance to maintaining it. I think that maintaining the agreement will be our foremost aim in the EU negotiations, and I think that what you call a possible psychological effect must be seen against this background. [Hopfmueller] All negotiations, including those with the EU, are a kind of poker game. Can keeping tough in transit not mean giving in, say in agriculture? [Vranitzky] I do not see such a link at the moment. We have clear standpoints in both transit and agricultural policy, and we will clearly advocate them. [end recording]
