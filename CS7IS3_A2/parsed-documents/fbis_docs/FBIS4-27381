If so, is the demand for a renegotiation of these parts realistic? In this regard, Kim Chol-su, minister of trade and industry, spelled out the government position in these words: "Of course, we need to reexamine our past mistakes to learn a lesson from them. But we should refrain from wasteful backward-leaning argument, but engage in constructive and forward-looking debate." The government's feeling is summed up in the following words of another concerned official of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries: "After everyone has gone home upon completion of the negotiation, we feel we have lost something. So we are out on the field alone, trying to call back everyone to the negotiating table. But no one would show up." Needless to say, these words were uttered on the assumption that it is impossible to renegotiate. The following are the grounds of this assumption: First, it is too late to negotiate because our government already agreed to the UR basic principles on 15 December 1993, presented our final "country schedule" for market opening, and signed the final protocol acknowledging the overall outcome of the UR round at Marrackech, Morocco, on 12 April this year. It is no use trying to stop the train after it has already started out. Trying to overturn what was agreed upon at the multilateral talks is tantamount to keeping two tongues in one mouth and would only damage our international prestige. Second, even if a renegotiation is allowed, it will be impossible to make an amendment aimed at narrowing the scope of opening, although it is possible to expand the scope of market opening. According to this school of thought, inasmuch as it is the spirit of the UR negotiations to remove the tariff and nontariff barriers and expand free trade, an "amendment for a narrower opening" is impossible. Third, it is difficult to overturn even what was agreed upon at one-on-one bilateral talks. Then, how could a small nation like ours hope to bring the whole world into a renegotiation to change what was agreed upon at the extensive multilateral UR negotiations? Fourth, should the National Assembly refuse to ratify the agreement as demanded by the farmers' organizations, some civic groups, and the opposition parties, which call for renegotiation, our country would end up withdrawing from the Uruguay structure and being isolated from the international community. (In the words of Kim Chol-su, minister of trade and industry,) "It is unthinkable for our country, which has attained economic growth through exports, to refuse to ratify the UR agreement, for such refusal would make our country an international missing child. Nor is it possible to renegotiate." Fifth, should we refuse to ratify the UR agreement, we would have disadvantages in terms of tariffs and trade and suffer from a fatal economic blow. In brief, they argue that now that the negotiations are over, it is no use crying alone for a renegotiation. It would only damage our international prestige. If there is to be a renegotiation, it will be allowed only to expand the scope of opening. The UR negotiations being multilateral talks, not a bilateral negotiation, it is all the more difficult to make a belated amendment to what was agreed upon at the UR talks. Should our National Assembly refuse to ratify the agreement, our country would keep out of the UR system and become an international orphan. As a consequence, we would suffer from a fatal economic blow. The UR negotiations came to a close in Morocco on 12 April with the ministers of participating countries signing the final protocol and the agreement on establishing the World Trade Organization [WTO]. As far as the procedure is concerned, the WTO now only awaits its departure at full steam. All that needs to be done is for the parliament of each member country to ratify the results of the negotiations within this year before the agreement takes effect on 1 July 1995. All countries have already presented their schedules for market opening. The proponents of renegotiation argue that, primarily we should have renegotiated before the Morocco ministerial conference was held on 12 April and prior to submitting a final country schedule in order to attain the maximum advantages and reflect the results in the final country schedule for opening. Now that the ministerial conference is over and a country schedule for market reopening has been submitted, there may no room for amendment. But the proponents of amendment think otherwise. First, the basic provisions of the UR agreement cannot be changed, but it is possible to change the country schedule before the WTO is formerly inaugurated in the future. In other words, the scope and timing for opening agreed upon at the multilateral negotiations cannot be changed, but an amendment is possible within the agreed upon scope and timing. In addition, when a far more disadvantageous schedule than what was agreed upon at the multilateral negotiations is forced upon a country at bilateral talks, it is possible for this country to demand a renegotiation "in the name of the UR" or bring the case before GATT. Second, in the UR agreement there is no provision that amendment is allowed only to enlarge the scope of market opening. Such a provision, if there is one, wouldn't square with reality. In fact, after the basic provisions were finally approved on 15 December last year, the United States and Japan attempted to impose some tariffs on semiconductors, whisky, timber, and in particular nonferrous metals, by discarding their previous nontariffication agreement for these items. By seizing this opportunity, the ROK once drew up a plan to break its nontariffication promise and impose 3 to 4 percent of tariffs on specific items. The United States and Canada attempted to impose quotas on some items with a view to opening overseas farm markets in a way more advantageous to them. These moves are the clear attempts by various countries to amend previous agreements so that the scope of opening might be narrowed, indicating that depending on circumstances, it is possible to renegotiate to reduce the scope of market opening. Needless to say, one-sided change of the agreed upon scope is unacceptable. But if there is a sufficient ground, renegotiation for an amendment should be allowed. The proponents of renegotiation argue that it falls within the right of contracting parties to reverse an expanded scope of opening far exceeding the scope required under the UR provisions to "the normal level," aside from the question of whether the amendment is aimed at enlarging the scope of opening or reducing it. Third, once the contracting parties agree to change the previously agreed schedule of enforcement, the change needs an endorsement by all WTO members just as a matter of formality. But barring a flaw to such agreement, nobody would raise an objection. The proponents of renegotiation argue that there is no reason for a third party to oppose an amendment when the amendment is not to change a basic provision of the UR agreement, but to change a country schedule for opening under the basic principles of the agreement, in cases where the interested parties agree to the amendment. Fourth, these proponents argue that even in the worst scenario in which our country withholds the final signing until after the inauguration of the WTO because of the failure of a renegotiation to wind up by that time, we will not be kept out of the UR system. The WTO charter agreement provides that the agreement be ratified two years prior to the date of effectuation. Accordingly, all that the ROK should do is to join the WTO by signing it by a cabinet minister, and pending a formal ratification by the National Assembly, bring its case before the WTO as a member, calling for a renegotiation on matters at issue. Needless to say, if the renegotiation is completed before the WTO is formally inaugurated, it will pose no problem at all. Fifth, therefore even if our National Assembly delays (or withholds) the ratification of the WTO agreement and our government tries to renegotiate on some items, we will not become "an international orphan." The National Assembly's refusal to ratify the agreement can be fully regarded as a weapon for strengthening our negotiating position and need not be considered as taboo. In the case of the United States, it is unclear whether the U.S. Congress will ratify the agreement within the deadline. In accordance with Article 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) which provides that under no international agreement shall the major agricultural and livestock markets be open to the outside world, and according to other domestic statutes, the United States refused to open markets for 14 basic farm and livestock products in the past. Recently, a large number of U.S. senators have resolved to reject any opening of markets for 14 basic farm and livestock products in accordance with the AAA provisions. With considerable rough sailing and difficulty anticipated in the process of ratification by the U.S. Congress, the Congress is hardly expected to complete the ratification process within the time limit set by the UR agreement. In India there have been strong anti-UR demonstrations, and the prospect is dim for an early ratification by the parliament in which the government party is in the minority. It appears that a revision of the schedule for market opening is theoretically possible. But this possibility cannot become reality unless our trade officials have a strong policy will and public opinion unanimously backs them up. If so, it is necessary to delve into the reasons why our trade officials have failed in the negotiating process in the past. The reason mentioned most often is the lack of expertise on the part of the trade officials who took part in the negotiations. It is said that the inadequate knowledge of the UR negotiating provisions, the lack of international negotiating experience, and the lack of a good command of English have resulted in a disadvantage in the negotiations. Our trade officials were unable to interpret UR provisions properly and had to seek advice from a relevant U.S. research institute on a a slew of provisions they did not understand. A communications official who took part in the negotiation commented as follows: "We feel that people who talk about the lack of expertise are playing with words. In fact, where can you find anyone who has greater expertise than our trade officials? They do not work alone; they always get help from research institutions. They marshal all available brains at home. "The UR negotiation is not an Oriental style or Korean style negotiation. It has been conducted according to the practices of the United States and the EC, and the UR agreement is written in the letters of their alphabet. Naturally, there are many things which are in accord with their realities but which are out of accord with our legal system and our language. "The ability to negotiate differs not in accordance with individual abilities, but in accordance with the national ability. In many cases, the United States or the EC is too formidable an opponent. That is why we took actions in concert with countries in the same boat and produced certain results in areas such as antidumping charges, subsidy, and intellectual property. However, we could find no country which would act in concert with us in the field of farm products." In brief, this official claims that our negotiators did their best under an unfavorable condition, and that the unsatisfactory results were due to the inequality in ability between the strong and the weak. However, did they really do their best? Can they explain their failure to gain what is guaranteed under the provisions of the UR agreement with the idea of disparity in ability between the weak and the strong? No other country has ever opened its markets for a greater number of goods at greater rates and at a faster pace than the ROK did in GATT history. The ROK is among the countries subject to the greatest trade pressures from the United States. But never, not even once, has our government objected to U.S. trade pressures. "When there is some trade friction, it is not necessary for the whole country to clamor for an early settlement or make haste. When there is a demand from one of our trade partners, what we need is the attitude of trying to understand the position of the other side and be concerned about it rather than taking the demand as a pressure.'" Those are the words of our minister of trade and industry, the cabinet member in charge of trade matters. Other trade bureaucrats also stress that the disadvantageous results of the just-ended UR negotiation was "due to the U.S. pressures." Among the heads or trade ministers of developing countries, no one knows better than the head or trade minister of our country how to refrain as much as possible from making any remarks that may offend the United States. These days when someone clumsily makes an issue of U.S. trade pressures, he is apt to be branded as a sentimental nationalist lacking in international sense. It is questionable whether this kind of stance will be of any help in trade negotiations with the United States. Without a shift in thinking to the stance of regarding any unwarranted demand of the United States not as an "understandable request," but as an "unacceptable pressure," it seems highly unlikely for our trade bureaucrats to come forward on their own demanding renegotiation. Needless to say, we should not negotiate in such a manner as to harm the opponent in order to gain our own benefits. But only when we effect a shift in our thinking to an independent stance, is it possible for us to avoid getting insulted to our faces. This shifting is what our trade bureaucrats are yet to accomplish. In fact, the key to renegotiation is the National Assembly's refusal to ratify the results of the UR negotiations. If the National Assembly rejects ratification, the executive branch will have no alternative but to carry out a renegotiation. It provides the ground for the government in breaking the existing agreement and making new demands. It will be alright for the National Assembly to ratify the revised agreement arrived at later by renegotiation. As of this moment, all of the opposition assemblymen have signed their signatures on the pledge to oppose the ratification of the UR agreement in a campaign kicked off by the "National Campaign Headquarters for the Protection of Our Agriculture. They are 96 DP [Democratic Party], 12 UNP [United National Party], two KNP [Korea National Party], and one NPPR assemblymen. Of the 16 independent assemblymen, only two have signed the pledge, but all of the independents are expected to sign in the future. Still, the campaign needs to obtain signatures of between 25 and 30 LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] assemblymen in order to come up with 150 signatures necessary to foil ratification in the National Assembly. Currently, efforts are under way to persuade LDP assemblymen mainly through each county-level farmers association. As of early March, five LDP assemblymen, including Kim Pom-myon from Nonsan County, reportedly signed the pledge to vote no to the ratification motion. Currently, the signature campaign is in a temporary lull as DLP issued a guideline and otherwise stepped up internal control against the signature campaign. The "National Campaign Headquarters" has concentrated its efforts on 35 rural districts throughout the country, including four in the Taejon- Chungnam area and seven in the Taegu-Kyongbuk area, contacting DLP parliamentarians in these areas in an effort to persuade them. It is conducting a recall drive against uncooperative DLP assemblymen by collecting the signatures of one-third of the eligible voters. However, it is still questionable how much this campaign will prove effective. [passage omitted] The road to a renegotiation of the UR agreement is far and rough.
