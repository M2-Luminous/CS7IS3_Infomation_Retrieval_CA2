This is the first time that a large organisation like NAM has formally adopted our proposal to promote and initiate the hosting of the international conference, he said in a telephone interview from here. With the agreement, it means that NAM, which has 108 members, is prepared to make efforts to hold the conference which has all along been only proposed by several other parties. Abdullah is happy with the support given to Malaysia by heads of delegation when the proposal was discussed on Wednesday. He said that the contact group of the Islamic Conference Organisation (IOC) had also expressed support for Malaysia's proposal that NAM initiate the hosting of the international conference. The agreement was reached at the group's informal meeting where the Bosnian delegates gave a briefing on the latest situation in their country. The group had also discussed matters to be included in the NAM's final document on Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said.
