The negative reaction to the proscriptive sanctions of the edict on the part of a number of Western commercial banks, including some that are members of the London Club of Russia's creditors, was joined by the EU Commission [EUC]. Last week, EUC Deputy Chairman Sir Leon Britten sent a letter to Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, who heads the Russian delegation at the EU negotiations. The bewilderment on the part of Russia's Western European partners is quite understandable: The EU mandate was the centerpiece of negotiations between Boris Yeltsin and the EUC Chairman Jacques Delors, which took place in Moscow on 11 November, and then the president's edict, which nullified these agreements, came out in less than a week. Representatives of Russia's Choice in the government unanimously supported the edict; Viktor Gerashchenko, on the other hand, took an unequivocal stand against it (see KOMMERSANT No. 46, pp. 4-6), thereby provoking a statement signed on behalf of the Association of Russian Commercial Banks by Mssrs. Yegorov and Vinogradov. At the same time, a group of influential bankers in their response statement supported the position of the Central Bank of Russia's chairman, referring, in particular, to the impermissibility of torpedoing the agreements reached with the EU. How a Compromise Was Reached and What Is at Stake It took a year and a half of difficult negotiations to enable Boris Yeltsin and Jacques Delors to declare in November at the first Russian-European summit that practically all hurdles in the way of signing a partnership agreement had been overcome. The agreements, reached as a result of a series of mutual concessions and compromises, legally formalized the trade and economic equality in bilateral relations: The EU recognized Russia as a "country with an economy in a state of transition" (until then it had been treated as a "country with a state-run economy"). Europe also agreed to other major compromises. This included, in particular, the conditions for applying protective measures and most-favored treatment in trade; suspending quantitative restrictions; and freedom of commodity transit. An agreement was also reached on the question of antidumping procedures (the EUC applies them to 15 items of Russian exports). According to the agreements reached, antidumping sanctions are to be preceded by consultations, which will allow the disposal of the issues under dispute at the early stage of the conflict. In addition, the EU undertook an obligation to take into account Russia's competitive advantages resulting from the presence of its own raw materials base and the optimum volume in certain types of production. Certain progress also was reached in the commercial services market. Now the European partners are willing to remove all barriers in the path of unrestricted and competitive price formation: They have accepted the idea of the so-called "evolutionary provision." In accordance with this, an agreement between the parties is to be reached on all specific issues in this area before the partnership agreement expires. According to Aleksandr Shokhin's data, in the event that the West removes the restrictions, Russia can claim 20-25 percent of the space market. Overall, as the program for developing nontraditional exports is implemented, by the middle of 1990's income from exports may increase by $5 billion-$6 billion. An agreement was also reached on the provisions with respect to liberalization of coal and steel sales, as well as the terms of mutual trade in the event of EU expansion through addition of third countries. Also coordinated were positions on transborder trade in services. The parties agreed on granting the most-favored treatment to companies at the stage of formation and the national laws at the stage of their operations, taking into account exceptions from the national laws. This, as well as a number of other preliminary agreements, which in essence meant for Russia a breakthrough into European markets of goods and services, were reached upon the EU condition, among other things, of granting European banks operating on the territory of Russia most-favored treatment. Taking into account the need to protect Russian banks in open competition with Western ones, Moscow agreed to this proposal only on condition of applying to foreign banks Russian national laws with a number of exceptions. Aleksandr Shokhin held special consultations with Russian bankers on this matter. On 27 October EUC Deputy Chairman Sir Leon Britten was informed of the results of these consultations. Moscow's decision consisted of the following. At the stage of setting up their operations, EU banks would get most-favored treatment, and for five years after signing the Partnership Agreement with the EU the following exceptions from national laws would remain in force for these banks. First, the restriction on the number of branches opened by the banks on the territory of the Russian Federation; second, a limit on a minimum deposit in the amount equivalent to 100,000 ECU for each individual deposit; third, a ban on operations involving placement of assets, as well as conducting middlemen (brokerage) operations with joint-stock societies' stocks and privatization vouchers. The aforementioned exceptions were not to extend to joint-ownership banks with a more than 30 percent participation share of Russian shareholders. Over the transition period, Russia undertook an obligation not to change the terms of banks' operations (already opened as of the date of signing the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with the EU) in the direction of worsening (limiting) operational environment. These are Russian proposals that were accepted by the EUC. It was as a result of this compromise solution that the Commission petitioned the EU Council of Ministers, asking that a new mandate be granted for the completion of agreements with Russia. And it was granted precisely on the basis of these agreements. The provisions of this mandate--which, naturally, include agreements on banks--served as a basis of negotiations at the first Russian-European summit in Moscow on 11 November, where both parties unanimously declared a breakthrough in bilateral economic relations. It was agreed, in particular, that on 8-10 December Boris Yeltsin would visit Brussels and would sign together with Jacques Delors a Political Declaration, which would register the intent of the parties to conclude a partnership agreement as soon as possible. At the time it was assumed that its text in English may be initialed (after the experts fine-tune the draft) as early as in the end of December, and by the spring the agreement may be signed by all 12 EU countries individually. The situation, however, changed only six days later: The entire blueprint for a compromise was nullified by one stroke of the presidential pen. Rumors began spreading in Europe and in Russia that once again someone was directing his hand. A reasonable question then is: Qui prodest? How the Compromise Was Brought to Naught Let us remind the reader that the edict "On Activities of Foreign Banks...." signed by the president on 17 November simply barred foreign and jointly owned banks (which had not begun doing so before 15 November 1993) from working with residents of Russia until 1 January 1996. At the time of the signing of the edict, only two fully foreign-owned banks (Lionskiy Kredit, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, and a bank jointly owned by the Dresdner Bank [FRG] and BNP [France]) had begun their operations. The rest, who only intended to begin operations in the Russian market, "had their rights taken away." The reaction to the edict in Russian financial and political circles was swift. It left one with the impression, however, that many of those who by definition are supposed to prepare documents of this sort not only had nothing to do with it, but had not even been informed of its preparation. At least Viktor Gerashchenko, the head of the Central Bank of Russia, and Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, whose responsibilities include foreign economic relations, having disowned any participation in the edict's preparation, in essence questioned its legitimacy. Viktor Gerashchenko explained the issuance of the edict by the fact that "in the course of the election campaign some commercial banks, fearing competition and wishing to develop as monopolies, exerted certain pressure on the president's staff." Deputy Minister of Finance Aleksandr Pochinok, in turn, hinted that the ministry has nothing whatsoever against the presence of foreign banks in Russia. His boss, Boris Fedorov, however (at a meeting in the KOMMERSANT editorial offices, see KOMMERSANT No. 47, pp. 4-5) was more frank, and praised the edict in extremely positive terms. In the process, he did not miss the opportunity to drop that "nobody in the government is aware of what Shokhin agreed on with the EU." And he hinted that, in his opinion, the compromise reached with the EUC does not mean anything. What remains open is another, and also quite reasonable question: Why the decision on banks, which generally should have been made (or at least worked out and discussed) by the government, came out in the form of a presidential edict? What Next? While from the standpoint of domestic policy the edict once again showed the unpredictability of the presidential team's actions, which often prefers to act autonomously from the government, in the foreign economic sphere it jeopardized the holding of another summit between the president of Russia and the European Union (which is already scheduled for 9 December)--a fact about which the edict supporters remained modestly silent. Such a sudden change in the rules of the game may have far-reaching negative consequences for Moscow: The scheduled--already eighth--round of negotiations with the EU, which took place last week, already demonstrated this graphically. Now the Russian delegation had to "regroup in action" at the negotiations with the EU, searching for a new compromise. In Shokhin's opinion, there is no choice other than bringing together two positions that are hard to reconcile. That is: Until the agreement with the EU comes into force, offshore terms of the presidential decree will be in effect, and after the agreement in signed--the exceptions on which an agreement of the EUC already has been reached will go into force. It cannot be precluded, however, that watching Moscow's unpredictable maneuvers, the EU may lean toward toughening of the Union's negotiating position as a whole. There already have been some indications of this: During the latest round of negotiations in Moscow, the parties were unable to reconcile their positions on exports of Russian enriched uranium into the EU; neither is a solution to the "aluminum problem" in sight. It appears that now the EU will redouble its efforts in insisting on making special provisions in the agreement permitting the suspension of its action in the event that its substantive elements are violated. It is possible that the provision on violating the principles of a market economy, already removed at the proposal of Russia, will be reanimated again. This provision, in Shokhin's opinion, could be used by EU countries whenever the economic conditions worsened. Neither is the EU ready yet to accept Russia's request for access to European Investment Bank's credits. There is also another provision in the draft agreement that links economic partnership with Russia's observance of "human rights." It appears that the reaction of the London Club at the negotiations on the restructuring of Russian foreign debts also will come fairly soon. After all, members of this club are precisely the same banks that fell victim to the president's action. As is known, Russia has not accepted the club's proposal on forfeiting sovereign immunity in guaranteeing the debt. It looks as if the London Club is in no hurry now to come up with compromise proposals, however. If the banking conflict is not extinguished in the nearest future, we can also hardly expect a tidal wave of investment into the Russian economy, because that is precisely how the investment was supposed to be channeled--through foreign banks. In any case, the Deutsche Bank, one of Russia's largest creditors and investors, has already openly made a statement to this effect. [Box p 18] Statement of Four Banks As KOMMERSANT's editors have learned, on 3 December the leadership of four major Moscow banks, which operate actively in European financial markets, signed a statement (the text is published below), in which they disassociated themselves from the position of the Association of Russian Banks and the Moscow Banking Union on the issue of the fate of foreign banks in Russia. According to information received by the editors, Rosselkhozbank chairman Nikolay Likhachev was supposed to join "the statement of four" but for a tragic reason was not able to do it. In the opinion of KOMMERSANT experts, the statement authors' support for the Central Bank of Russia's position and that of many influential Western bankers regarding the impermissibility of discrimination against foreign banks was prompted not so much by a purely academic interest in the problem as the desire to minimize obstacles in the path of their own projects--current and future--in foreign financial markets. "On 23 November, Mssrs. S.Ye. Yegorov and V.V. Vinogradov, the top officials of the Association of Russian Banks [ARB] and the Moscow Banking Union [MBU], issued a statement on behalf of these public organizations, in which they supported the restrictive measures against foreign banks in Russia envisaged in the 17 November edict "On the Activities of Foreign Banks and Jointly Owned Banks With the Participation of Non-Residents' Capital on the Territory of the Russian Federation." This statement also contains a negative appraisal of the position of Central Bank of Russia Chairman Mr. V.V. Gerashchenko, who has expressed doubts regarding the expediency of such measures in the current circumstances. "We, the leadership of a number of major commercial banks, want to attract the public's attention to the fact that Mssrs. S.Ye. Yegorov and V.V. Vinogradov's statement were not coordinated with our banks and many other commercial banks that are members of the ARB and the MBU. This statement does not express at all a common position of all commercial banks in Russia and therefore may be regarded only as the personal viewpoint of the persons who signed it. "In this connection, we find it necessary to point out that we consistently (and no less than the leadership of public banking organizations) support the course of the president and the government toward the intensification of economic reforms, development of Russia's financial system, strengthening of the ruble, and protection of national interests in the banking sphere. Our banks, not in words but in deed, make a considerable contribution to the improvement of the Russian economy, its revitalization and modernization, and the preservation of the rich existing potential of domestic industry. We also make a considerable effort to gain worthy positions for Russian banks in the international banking community, for the development of equal trade and economic cooperation with foreign partners and for attracting to Russia foreign financial resources on a healthy basis. "We believe that the real effectiveness of the declared measures is questionable. Moreover. In the event that these measures are implemented, operations of existing branches and representations of Russian banks in foreign countries will inevitably become considerably more difficult; there will arise obstacles in opening new Russian banking institutions abroad; and the mistrust toward our financial-banking institutions, born of the catastrophic legacy of the former USSR, will rise again. The unpredictability of regulatory activity in Russia has revealed itself once again. "On a broader scale, by creating a prominent precedent, these measures may reflect negatively on the process--very important for Russia, and at the same time very difficult--of forming principally new politico-economic relations between our country and the rest of the world, first and foremost with partners from among the states with developed economies. For instance, by the estimate of some members of the Russian Government and a number of high-ranking European figures, these measures, to put it mildly, do not quite correspond to the agreements on the status of foreign banks in Russia, which have been reached with considerable difficulty at the negotiations with the European Union and which are to become a part of a package of global agreements between Russia and the EU, ready to be discussed at the highest level during the president of Russia's visit to Brussels scheduled for 9 December. "Legalization of restrictive measures against foreign banks in Russia, in our opinion, may reflect only the current interests of some influential commercial banks and other structures, which would like at any price to gain a monopoly position in the domestic market in order to earn superprofits in the current economic conditions. This, however, will not be produce any benefit toward the normal development of the entire banking system and the Russian economy as a whole." [Signed] D.

Now the Real Problems Are Ahead The Central Bank of Russia [CBR] this week issued permission for two Russian commercial banks to open foreign branches. The AvtoVAZbank intends to open an office (with the status of a branch) in Cyprus, and the Stolichnyy bank--a branch in Amsterdam (Netherlands). The Central Bank has not considered the National Credit bank's application for permission to open a branch in the United States, since the latter has not submitted all the required documentation to the CBR. For Stolichnyy, the process of getting permission to open a branch (the working capital is set at 100 million guilder) was long and torturous. Now the Russian bank will have to begin negotiations with the National Bank of the Netherlands regarding a license to operate there. In turn, in accordance with licensing rules, the Bank of the Netherlands in considering the question of issuing the Russian bank a license will have to request a paper from the Central Bank of Russia banking oversight service certifying the reliability and solid standing of the candidate. Nevertheless, KOMMERSANT experts believe that if anything is capable of burying Stolichnyy's dream of a branch in Netherlands, it is not the CBR's obstacles but its involvement in the campaign launched by a number of Russian commercial banks regarding limitation on activities of foreign banks in Russia. (At the conference of bankers in the former Supreme Soviet, a Stolichnyy representative supported applying restrictions to foreign colleagues). It so happens that Dutch banks--ING and ABN AMRO Bank--felt more painfully than others the blow dealt to foreign banks that have come to Russia. No sooner did they get general licenses from the CBR than they lost them. Moreover, the ABN AMRO Bank, having received a license from the Central Bank of Russia, signed an agreement to set up in Kazakhstan a joint bank ABN Amro Kazakhstan--apparently with a great hope of expanding operations through the opportunity to work with rubles. (The cofounders of the joint bank in Kazakhstan, with a charter capital of $5 million, were Kramede-Bank, and on the Russian side--the International Financial Corporation).
