This emerges from a letter sent by the Information Department of the Prime Minister's Office which was obtained by our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik. A resident of the settlement of Teqoa' in the territories wrote a letter to the prime minister asking whether the murderers of Jews, including the man who murdered his neighbor and was released, will be allowed to serve in the Palestinian police, or will Israel prevent this. The letter of reply from the Prime Minister's Office says, among other things, that the Israeli Government will continue fighting terrorism and hunt down those sabotaging peace, but will not be able to determine who can serve in the Palestinian police.
