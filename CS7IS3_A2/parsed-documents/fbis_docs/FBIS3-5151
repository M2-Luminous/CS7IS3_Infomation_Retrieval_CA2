This interview was possible because the SISA JOURNAL made a counteroffer to the Sanomaeng when it requested us to report the movement for the legalization of the Sanomaeng taking the opportunity of this rally. The SISA JOURNAL planned this article to contribute to the public interest by reporting as accurately as possible the intention and the development of the Sanomaeng. It took exactly five hours to meet him at a restaurant in Yongdungpo. He insisted that it was a necessary process in order to avoid the eyes of intelligence agencies that might chase them. They call it "sterilization." A member of Sanomaeng was with the reporting team all the time, but he did not know when the sterilization would end. We changed taxis four times. I suspect that the other member of the Sanomaeng checked our moves somewhere near the assigned place. The sterilization that started in Kwangwhamum at 1400 on 9 November finally ended at Yongdungpo after passing the Tongyodong intersection, Kungmin Daily News building, and Kungmin Bank building, Kongdokdong. It was 1830. Another 30 minutes had passed when a man showed up and introduced the Sanomaeng. This is how a reporter of the bourgeois news media (Pak No Hae once called SISA JOURNAL this in a magazine) and a socialist met. He has a much more polished outstanding appearance than I expected. His name was Yo Yun-chae, but it was an alias. He answered questions with the logic of a leader befitting a political organization classified as an antinational organization by the security agencies. He allowed taking pictures as long as his face did not show. [Reporter] Who are you? [Yo Yun-chae] Because of the National Security Planning Agency [NSP] has not figured me out, it is not good to expose myself entirely. If my identity is known, my activities will be limited. All I can say (about myself) is that I entered Seoul National University and studied there from the end of the 1970's to the early 1980's and I planned to put all my efforts into the farmers movement, but I decided to devote myself to the Sanomaeng due to the change of environment. [Reporter] Can you represent the Sanomaeng? [Yo] I am a central committee member and chief of policy making of the Sanomaeng. Now, our organization is run by the collective leadership. We had our interim discussion before I came. Accordingly, my words reflect the thought of the central committee members and, I think, I can represent the Sanomaeng. [Reporter] How many central committee members are there? [Yo] I can say there are fewer than ten. [Reporter] It is known that the Sanomaeng was in fact dissolved after Pak No-hae and Paek Tak-wung were arrested. At this moment, how much has the Sanomaeng restored the organization? [Yo] Naturally, there was a time when, in fact, the organization did not work after the two `accidents' (he expressed it this way). Those were critical blows. However, we put much effort into restoring the organization ever since, and now full members of our organization have reached 90% of the number of members in the past. But we lost supporters and collaborators. The restoration of the organization was accomplished within two months after the accidents. The question is whether or not we can secure political leadership. In the past, we judged power according to who could mobilize more people in mass rallies, but now times have changed. At this moment, the local organizations are located in Honam Province, Central area, and Yongnam Province. [Reporter] Socialism has collapsed internationally, and the influence of the opposition groups has diminished within the country. Do you believe that socialism can indeed be carried out in South Korea? [Yo] The collapse of socialism was the most difficult experience for us. The Sanomaeng has carried out a critical examination of socialist ideology ever since. After all, it was the problem of a country. Marx regarded communism as the extinction of countries through the extinction of classes, but Stalinistic socialism, on the contrary, pursued the reinforcement of a country. That was Leninism that Lenin did not like. We insist on socialism that restores the communistic point of view. In the future, the Sanomaeng will have its basis in the mass movement and will realize socialism through fair competition in the capitalistic society. Despite the merits of capitalism, there are some people who feel that `this is not it.' This is the reason for us to transform our organization from the centralized pyramid style of the past to the network-style organization that connects positions in all fields. With this renovation of the Sanomaeng and under conditions of fair competition, I am confident of victory in the election. [Reporter] The Sanomaeng was rather evaluated as a political organization that does not have a power base among the people. There is also a criticism that they are `socialists inside the flags'... [Yo] I accept that. The Sanomaeng approached the people not by taking root in organizations among the people but by depending heavily on some `stars' and the method of distinct propaganda and instigation. We were accustomed to barricading and confronting enemy face to face. But we will use tactics of positions from now on. We will penetrate into movements in all fields such as labor, students, citizen, and religious movements. Recently, the labor movement in the Ulsan region lends optimism. The Sanomaeng will not be a far away organization but will be a trustworthy organization. The most important point is the connection of all positions by political leaderships. After hardening the power base like this, we will make a socialist workers' party. [Reporter] Recently, Pak No-hae called the Sanomaeng `my illigitimate child' in an interview from prison with a magazine. What is your opinion about that? [Yo] It is true that there are many stories about comrade Pak. But he is not free. He is serving a life sentence in prison. I have heard about his agonies through the news media, but I think it is a process for him to grope along the way of human liberation under the changed circumstances. It will be more clear when he, who is still a central committee member of the Sanomaeng, is set free and becomes a free man. [Reporter] When will you form a party? Is it possible? [Yo] We believe the time will be either the end of 1994 or the beginning of 1995. The Sanomaeng should be legalized before we start the party. Because we have been under concentrated attack by investigation agencies, we have maneuvered via both legal and illegal tactics (it is called simultaneous construction theory in their terms). But we will launch struggles for legalizing the Sanomaeng directly from now on. We plan to start full-scale open activities in the near future. Even though it is not known to the public, socialist power is building within the labor movement now. Labor union movements in South Korea have not yet conducted a political campaign. If labor unions can conduct a political campaign, they will rise to become a socialist power. We are building a party that is based on the solidarity of socialistic powers and labor unions. At the same time, the People's Political Union (Professor Oh Se Chol of Yonsei University is the head) openly proclaims that socialism is active. Many people, including some former members of the Sanomaeng released from prison, are involved in this organization. [Reporter] If so, is the People's Politic Union a legal political organization that the Sanomaeng launched in advance? [Yo] Absolutely not. We will just maintain a close relationship because we have same direction. [Reporter] Funding will be needed to wage a full-scale struggle for legalization. How can you provide that? [Yo] It is run with the help of some patrons around us and membership fees from employed comrades. Sometimes we collect several 10 million won by holding a supply drive when we plan a big event. However, that is not enough. After all, forming a political party is costly, isn't it? It is yet in the planning stage, but we plan to run businesses by making the most of our members. We concentrated on running seminars for mental arithmetic in the past, but we will concentrate on manufacturing businesses this time. Then, we can build the fund consistently. [Reporter] Are there any plans for legalizing the Sanomaeng? [Yo] The election for the local government system in 1995 will be an important opportunity in our socialism movement let alone this administration. I think that the Kim Yong-sam administration will build the base for two-stage political reform by the revised election law. The socialist movement will be the first political challenge since the civilian government took office. What happens now will form the foundation of the Sanomaeng's future. We plan to ally with the progressive power and suggest `a combined meeting of labor unions and progressive organizations for the innovative local government system' and to respond with all our efforts. [Reporter] What relationship do you have with the other socialist political factions? Do you want only the Sanomaeng legalized? [Yo] For example, `international socialists', `short-term laborers' alliance', and `revolutionary socialist laborers' exist already as a socialist power. The government firmly defines these groups as illegal organizations. Eventually, the struggle for legalizing the Sanomaeng will achieve the freedom of ideology. We have to work together. South Korea is the only country that does not allow the socialists power on earth. These moves such as the revision of the National Security Plan law and the repeal of the National Security Law are optimistic signs. [Reporter] Isn't it in vain if the government does not recognize it? [Yo] If the government does not recognize us, we cannot legalize it with our power only. We plan to negotiate with them on the legalization. We can do it by responding according to the situation.
