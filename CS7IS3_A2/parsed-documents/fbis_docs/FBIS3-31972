Yesterday, after concluding a special National Directorate meeting, and which was attended by all of its members, the Sandinist leadership agreed to consider the document approved on 18 November 1993 by the National Assembly as the "fundamental political document" on the topic. In addition, the UNO [National Opposition Union]-FSLN agreement is for the FSLN, according to the agreements reached by the National Directorate, the "basis to discuss the constitutional reforms." The Sandinist National Directorate and the faction added that documents or draft bills presented by the other groups or factions must be recognized as legitimate positions of the other parties. The Sandinist leadership also decided that the FSLN negotiating commission, which is made up of Daniel Ortega, Sergio Ramirez, and Bayardo Arce, begins a round of meetings with the representatives appointed by the deputies of the Group of 13 (Social-democrats and conservatives) and with the representatives of the Political Council of the four factions "so as to strengthen the negotiating process of constitutional reforms in political terms." The Sandinist leadership also gave its political support to the Sandinist faction when it agreed that it "should be the sector to study and discuss the draft reform bill, which will result from the consensus reached by all parties," and that the "parliamentary negotiation ... will be conducted by the Sandinist faction." One of the directors of the Sandinist faction said that this mechanism will allow the National Directorate's negotiating commission to coordinate with the Sandinist faction, which will discuss the draft reform bill with the other groups in parliament that are not members of what we currently know as the "Group of 13." This position, which was unanimously adopted by the National Directorate yesterday, seems to resolve a problem that threatened to create a new crisis among some leading sectors of the FSLN. Last night, FSLN Secretary General Daniel Ortega confirmed that the differences between the two sectors had been overcome completely. After concluding a meeting with Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo on the transportation strike, Ortega stated that: "All differences between the faction and the National Directorate regarding the topic have been overcome entirely." According to Ortega, the decisions made yesterday by the National Directorate will not affect the discussion of the reforms, but they will rather "broaden other forces." Ortega added that this does not imply disrespect for or disregard of the agreements among factions. He reiterated that the FSLN wants to meet with various social sectors to analyze the reforms and, particularly, that Nicaraguans are given the opportunity to express their views regarding the draft reform bill through open town councils.
