The source told Interfax on Monday that one of the aims of the investigation was to reveal sources of possible information leakage from the FIS. "I don't think we have any 'moles' or 'rats' in our service, but extra caution will do us no harm," he said. He declined to either confirm or deny that the Ameses had been Soviet and Russian intelligence agents. "The investigation has nothing to do with the apprehensions that somebody penetrated our intelligence files and found the Ameses there," the source said. He said the West was bound to make the most of the Ames case to disorganize Russian intelligence and its networks abroad. He also said the CIA and other Western intelligence services are paying closer attention to Russia, and that there exists "a growing spy mania in the United States, comparable to that of the Cold War times."
