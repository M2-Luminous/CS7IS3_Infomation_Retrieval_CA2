During the past five years large quantities, including tens of tons of opium, heroin and morphine, have been seized by the Iranian National Security Forces from the smugglers, the bulk of which were en route to the European markets and possibly from Europe to other regions of the world. In their efforts to combat the well armed international drug smugglers, a number of Iranian law enforcement personnel were martyred. Meanwhile every once in a while, some international human rights organization or certain foreign countries criticize Tehran for its anti-drug activities. For instance in October 1993, Amnesty International under the pretext of protecting "human rights" criticized Iran for its death penalty policy for traffickers. The recent statement by the U.S. assistant secretary of state for international narcotics strategy, Mr. Robert Gelbard, who accused Iran of not being successful in its drug campaign is surely part of a general conspiracy to degrade the Islamic Republic of Iran's successful efforts in combating drug trafficking. Unable to convince the European countries and Japan to join Washington's economic embargo plans against Tehran, it is not a big surprise to see a senior U.S. official making such a baseless statement at a time when Iran is planning to further enhance its cooperation in combating traffickers both at regional and global levels, within the framework of the Economic Cooperation Organization as well as international organizations such as the United Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP) or Interpol. It is crystal clear that drug smuggling is a major international problem which knows no boundaries and without regional and international cooperation, combating traffickers and drug abuse will be a costly measure and a bit difficult for individual states. Therefore it is no wonder to hear a senior U.S. official to make such a baseless statement in order to merely degrade Iran's anti-narcotic strives. Indeed, it can be assessed that what Mr. Gelbard has said is part of Washington's general foreign policy strategy to isolate Iran by using all available means to crate a negative picture of the Islamic Republic in the minds of the international community. But, surely the antinarcotic planners of the country and the brave personnel of the National Security Forces will foil Washington's propaganda by adopting proper measures.
