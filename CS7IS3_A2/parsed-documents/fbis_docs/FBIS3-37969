[Chornovil] If I were president, I would not sign anything that would contradict Supreme Council resolutions on this issue. This does not mean that we want to become "very nuclear." However, if I have some property that costs a million and sell it for three kopecks, I am either a bad economist or a little mentally deficient. This means I should not be permitted to manage anything, even my own household. The compensations that we are offered are really miserable and do not cover our expenditures on eliminating these arms. The removal of all SS-24 missiles in 10 months, including those whose warranty time period is far from expiring, is simply unwise. In light of the developments in our region, we should have insisted on more security assurances as well. I believe that the process of nuclear disarmament could be protracted and last 10 to 15 years. This period would give us time to get back on our feet economically, and strengthen our defense potential. The world community would become accustomed to the fact that there is a country in East Europe named Ukraine. We need at least seven years to remove the nuclear arms envisioned by START I. [Kalinowski] What could be Ukraine's reaction if the merging of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus is followed by these states' reunification? [Chornovil] For Ukraine, this would be a very dangerous process, and I once pointed this out to Stanislav Shushkevich. In fact, a wedge would be driven between Ukraine and the Baltics, granting Russia access to Poland. Strategically, Ukraine would be surrounded. Ukraine, unlike Belarus, is still upholding its independence. Thus, it is clear that our reaction would be negative. However, we would not shout about this, because this would amount to meddling in another state's affairs. [Kalinowski] Would that be a death sentence on the Baltic-Black Sea Commonwealth? [Chornovil] Nobody has ever tried to implement this idea; it was still up in the air and discussed as a possible project. Due to your question, I have just realized another danger of this "wedge" -- it will ruin the project. [Kalinowski] I would like to bring up the open letter to Mikhail Gorbachev published in SVABODA on 22 October 1987. The letter carried your thesis that "the Soviet administration gave Belarus part of Brest and Pinsk Oblasts, that are ethnic Ukrainian territories." Many Belarusians were gravely concerned. [Chornovil] I have always advocated inviolability of borders. However, a large Ukrainian community resides in Brest Oblast, while the population in some parts is totally Ukrainian. Only a very uneducated or a very biased person would deny this fact. This is the way the border was demarcated. Incidentally, a Belarusian region near Gomel was annexed to Ukraine, while Kuban was given to Russia. The same happened to Taganrog that belonged to Ukraine until 1926. We should not dispute the current borders. Yet, we should guarantee that national-cultural demands of the Ukrainians are met in Belarus, and that these people maintain contacts with Ukraine. By the way in Transcarpathia, we have a rayon totally populated by Hungarians. This is a historic reality and one cannot do anything about it. Aside from supplying textbooks and training teachers for Ukrainian schools in that region, there can be no other presence of the Ukrainian state there. A similar situation is in Moldova where 600,000 Ukrainians live. Ukrainian elementary and high schools are opening there now, as was once done in Romania. Assisting ethnic minorities is part of interstate relations. If everything is done on the basis of the Helsinki agreement, such assistance will be advantageous for everyone and no hindrance for good-neighborly relations between Belarus and Ukraine. [Kalinowski] Observers have recently pointed out that relations, including economic ones, between Belarus and Ukraine have been deteriorating. Why is that? [Chornovil] In my opinion, Belarus has been too oriented toward Russia, instead of trying to create a certain counterbalance. If Belarus is too attached to one partner, it will never become an independent state. Even the United States does not buy more than a couple percent of its energy resources from one country, to avoid becoming dependent. If all the former Soviet republics united, the CIS could become an organization serving the interests of all its members, not just Russia. Unfortunately, Russia has been winning these states one by one by means of gifts, promises, and influencing the loyal nomenklatura.
