FR941117-0-00200 FR941117-0-00013 2. Definition of Nationally Recognized Municipal Securities Information Repository The Commission requested comment on whether the term ``NRMSIR'' should be defined in Rule 15c2&hyph;12, and whether specific standards should be established for NRMSIRs. If standards were to be established in the rule, the Commission requested comment on whether proposed standards set forth in the release were adequate. 152 The majority of state-based information gatherers and disseminators, and other NRMSIRs that addressed the issue of defining the term ``NRMSIR'' supported maintaining the guidelines already established by the Commission in the 1989 Release. 153 After reviewing the comment letters, the Commission has determined that the guidance established in the 1989 Release for NRMSIRs should be modified only as necessary to reflect the amendments to Rule 15c2&hyph;12. In determining whether a particular entity is a NRMSIR the Commission will now consider, among other things, whether the repository: 152 The Commission suggested that NRMSIRs (a) maintain current, accurate information about municipal securities, including final official statements, the issuer's annual final information, and issuer's notices of material events; (b) have effective systems for the timely collection, indexing, storage and retrieval of these documents; and (c) be capable of national dissemination of final official statements, annual financial information, and notices of material events through electronic dissemination systems, in response to telephone inquiries, and hard copy delivery via facsimile, by mail and by messenger service. The Commission also stressed the importance of timely public availability upon receipt of information by a NRMSIR. 153 See, e.g. , Letter of Bloomberg L.P.; Letter of Cypress Capital Corp. (a dealer chosen by the Louisiana Municipal Association to assist it in developing a repository to collect and disseminate information on Louisiana issuers of municipal securities). In discussing NRMSIRs in the 1989 Release, the Commission noted that in determining whether a particular entity is a NRMSIR, it would look, among other things, at whether the repository: (1) is national in scope; (2) maintains current, accurate information about municipal offerings in the form of official statements; (3) has effective retrieval and dissemination systems; (4) places no limit on the issuers from which it will accept official statements or related information; (5) provides access to the documents deposited with it to anyone willing and able to pay the applicable fees; and (6) charges reasonable fees. See 1989 Release at n. 65. (1) Is national in scope; (2) Maintains 154 current, accurate 155 information about municipal offerings in the form of official statements, and annual financial information, notices of material events, and notices of a failure to provide annual financial information undertaken to be provided in accordance with Rule 15c2&hyph;12; 154 In the past, the Division of Market Regulation has required that each NRMSIR maintain copies of all disclosure documents. In view of recent requests from information collectors and disseminators, the Division of Market Regulation will review, on a case by case basis, NRMSIR proposals to satisfy the requirement to maintain copies of disclosure documents through a contract with another entity (including the MSRB) that will maintain copies. See Letters from Laurence M. Landau, Vice President, Dow Jones Telerate, to Elizabeth MacGregor, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, (July 18, 1994) and to Gautam S. Gujral, Division of Market Regulation, SEC (August 4, 1994). See also Letter of Storch & Brenner (on behalf of R.R. Donnelly Financial). This flexible approach, requested by industry participants, may allow NRMSIRs to reduce the cost at which they can collect and disseminate disclosure information to broker-dealers and investors. 155 It should be noted that NRMSIRs are not being required to verify the accuracy of the information provided them. NRMSIRs are required to accurately convey the information provided to them. (3) Has effective retrieval and dissemination systems; (4) Places no limits on the persons from which it will accept official statements, and annual financial information, notices of material events, and notices of a failure to provide annual financial information undertaken to be provided in accordance with Rule 15c2&hyph;12; (5) Provides access to the documents deposited with it to anyone willing and able to pay the applicable fees; and (6) Charges reasonable fees.
