This morning, he separately received Chinese Ambassador Chen Zhenyou and French Ambassador Gerald Pavret de la Rochefordiere. He explained the Turkish position regarding the disarming of Cyprus. In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said: The fact that Kliridhis announced that the agreement to sign a defense agreement with Greece was made in Greece, and the fact that he then offered the disarmament, tells the Turkish Cypriot side a lot of things; we must be very careful. Denktas recalled that a former Greek Cypriot interior minister recently said there is a need to hoard some 20,000 to 30,000 weapons. This means, Denktas said, that when the time comes, the EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] movement will resume. Kliridhis' disarmament offer while this danger exists, reminds us of when Makarios returned the obsolete weapons to the British authorities in 1959, and then a year later, set up secret armies. People who went though those times must study the present proposals more carefully. The defense of the Turkish Cypriot side is bizonality, and its borders are being protected by Turkish troops today. Denktas went on to say: We expect a change of mind and a change of heart from the the Greek Cypriot side. The Greek Cypriot government must stop the provocations of Greek Cypriot youths against Turkish Cypriots. If it cannot, then this must be done by the United Nations. Denktas said he explained all these views to the Security Council officials who listened carefully and took notes. Replying to a question, Denktas said that the Cyprus question is a national cause for Turkey and concerns the future of the Turkish Cypriots. Turkey has never used the Turkish Cypriots as a tool of compromise until now and will not do so in the future. Turkey is helping the Turkish Cypriots to ensure that a sound and equitable agreement is signed, in line with its own interests and those of the Turkish Cypriots. I am convinced that Turkey will continue to help us, Denktas said.
