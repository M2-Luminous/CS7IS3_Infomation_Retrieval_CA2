This will cause coffee prices to rise on the international market. A Brazilian and Colombian ministerial meeting was held on 22 January during President Itamar Franco's visit to Leticia, Colombia. The Brazilian Government reported that stocks of coffee in its 20 leading cooperatives amounted to 629,000 sacks, which is more than the required 20 percent withholding established by the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (APPC). This information was disclosed by Ailton Barcelos, the acting industry, commerce, and tourism minister. He said the news caused "euphoria" among the Colombians -- who are the administrators of the APPC, which groups together 33 countries. He said the price of a sack of coffee plunged from $70 to $45 during the last four years. He estimated that the information provided by Brazil, which is the group leader, will prompt coffee producers to increase the price from $0.74 the pound to $0.85. Barcelos said: "This would have an extraordinary international impact." Barcelos will hand over his portfolio tomorrow to Senator Elcio Alvares (PFL-ES) [Liberal Front Party-Espirito Santo], but will remain at the Industry, Commerce, and Tourism Ministry as executive secretary. He recalled that in the fourth quarter of 1993, Brazil failed to keep its commitment to withhold 20 percent of its coffee production. Brazil exported 3,913 sacks during that quarter and, in keeping with the agreement signed with the APPC, should have withheld 20 percent to trigger a rise in coffee prices. Owing to the absence of a reliable information system, Brazil thought it had failed to honor its commitment with the international market, but a survey last week confirmed that there is more than enough in stock to meet the required withholding. "In other words, we are honoring our international commitments."
