The Su-30 or Su-35 is an advanced version with air-to-air refuelling capability with impressive performance characteristics. India has had a satisfying experience with Russian aircraft and it is therefore natural for Russia, now anxious to earn foreign exchange, to offer its latest product to the Indian Air Force [IAF]. In the past, the lAF's approach to acquisitions of new aircraft have been rather ad hoc; decisions taken to produce some categories of aircraft under licence have not resulted in actual production and plans for doing so have been abandoned. In some other cases, the acquisitions have been in driblets with the result that the country has not got the best possible terms that could have been obtained if the entire purchase had been negotiated in one lot. Therefore, there is a good case now to work out a long-term plan for the future composition of the IAF over the next 25 years and examine whether the Russian Sukhoy offer fits into that scheme. Unlike at the time when the Mirage 2000 was purchased, we are not under any immediate threat from new acquisitions by Pakistan, which might disturb the balance of air power in the sub-continent. No doubt there is the possibility of the US sale of F-16s to Pakistan. But that alone cannot be allowed to determine the choice of the next generation of high performance aircraft into the IAF. It is obvious that new Soviet aircraft will not be available on easy terms of credit as earlier. Since India has to pay in hard currency there has to be a rigorous cost-benefit evaluation of various options and the technology transfer and countertrade arrangements that could be available. Some may argue that Indian purchases of aircraft will provide a justification to the Americans to release F-16s to Pakistan. That argument can be turned around. Since there is the threat of a possible US sale of F-16s to Pakistan, India should explore all avenues and be ready to rectify any imbalance that may be caused by the F-16 transfer. Arms transfers are highly visible symbols of political relationship. In the post-Gorbachev era, Indo-Russian ties do not enjoy the same degree of closeness they once did. The Sukhoy offer would have to be influenced by the manner in which Russia agrees to solve the problem of supply of spares for equipment bought in the past. Russia will now have to prove that it is a reliable and dependable source of supply of armaments in the future.
