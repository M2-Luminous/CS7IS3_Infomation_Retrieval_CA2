Information received will be used in preparation of the Draft EIS and Final EIS. For most effective use, comments on potential issues should be submitted to the Forest Service within 45 days from the date of publication of this Notice in the Federal Register . Neutrally facilitated public meetings will be held in Grangeville, McCall, Boise, Pocatello, and Salmon, Idaho, and Hamilton, Montana, on December 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, 1994, respectively, for the purpose of identifying issues, developing Desired Future Conditions and mapping potential management zones. A response card will be mailed to the persons and organizations on the ``Frankly Speaking'' mailing list. Similarly facilitated public meetings will be held in Cascade, Idaho Falls, Lewiston, and Nampa, Idaho, and Missoula, Montana, to solicit comments on potential indicators, standards and management prescriptions. Response cards will again be sent to the ``Frankly Speaking'' mailing list to solicit input on these topics. Agency-sponsored open house meetings will be held at the Forest Headquarters offices of the Bitterroot, Boise, Caribou, Nez Perce, Payette and Salmon-Challis National Forests to gather comments on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement.

Eliminate issues of minor importance or those that have been covered by previous and relevant environmental analysis. 4. Select issues to be analyzed in depth. 5.
