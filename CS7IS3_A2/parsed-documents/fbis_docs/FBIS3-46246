This work is of strategic significance. The cross-century science and technology leaders must have a reserve force. In undertaking socialist modernization, it is imperative to train and select young scientists and technicians. Since the founding of New China, our country has trained and nurtured a contingent of scientists and technicians of a considerable skill level, and of all branches of the sciences and specialties. The contingent consists of nearly 25 million people of whom 17 million are natural science and technology personnel. They have played an important role in promoting scientific and technological progress, and economic development in our country. However, this is far from sufficient to meet our needs. Our country has a large population, and the 17 million scientific and technological personnel account for only 1.4 percent of the population. In the late 1980's, such a percentage was way below that of both developed and less developed countries. In the meantime, we have been unable to keep up with increasing needs with respect to quality, overall distribution, structural composition, and rational use of manpower. A serious aging problem exists among specialized advanced technology personnel, particularly among academic and technical leaders. In order to accelerate the training of young, specialized technological personnel, in 1991 the General Office of the State Council transmitted a document of the Ministry of Personnel -- "Opinions on How To Strengthen the Contingent of Specialized and Technological Personnel, and Promote the Growth of Outstanding Middle-Aged and Young Specialized and Technological Personnel"-- to the lower levels. Some localities and departments have since successively promulgated the relevant policies. The State Education Commission put forward a plan for nurturing outstanding cross-century young talent; the Academy of Sciences has set up a young scientist award; the State Natural Science Foundation has established a special fund for outstanding middle-aged and young people; Shanghai has been implementing a young specialized personnel training plan; and Tianjin has formulated a plan for building an echelon of cross-century science and technology leaders. However, these actions are far from sufficient to keep up with the rapid development of the economy, and science and technology at present. Recently, the Experts Department of the Ministry of Personnel held a symposium in Tianjin to explore the concept of and measures for nurturing cross-century academic and technical leaders. Those present pointed out: At present, we should further enhance our understanding of the importance and urgency of nurturing academic and technical leaders, as well as our sense of responsibility; and regard the task as a top priority in strengthening the contingent of specialized and technological personnel. It has been reported that the Ministry of Personnel, working in conjunction with other departments and various provinces and municipalities concerned, is formulating concrete measures for nurturing cross-century academic and technical leaders. We are convinced that so long as policies are appropriate and measures are effective, it is certain that outstanding young specialized and technological personnel will constantly emerge, and the overall skill level of our scientific and technological force will certainly be raised.
