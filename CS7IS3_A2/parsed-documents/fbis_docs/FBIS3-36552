He noted that according to the agreement with Russia, only the uranium due to Ukraine will be free of charge for it [Ukraine], which comes to approximately 25-30 percent of the fuel content of nuclear power stations. "But if one is to take into account the fact that Russia in fact increases the price of fuel by 40-50 percent every quarter, then one cannot talk about free Russian fuel for Ukraine," the deputy chairman of the State Committee for the use of Nuclear Power is convinced. "Even if Russia sells the fuel produced from our uranium at a cheaper price, Ukrainian atomic power stations will hardly be able to acquire it in sufficient quantities, because nuclear power stations are currently in dire financial straits."
