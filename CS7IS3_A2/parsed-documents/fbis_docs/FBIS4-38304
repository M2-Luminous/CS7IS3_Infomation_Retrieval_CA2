He said: Our forces -- the forces of legitimacy -- have restored more than 70 percent of the areas that had been controlled by the secessionists. He said that the forces of legitimacy are now at the entrances of Hadramaut, and are in control of more than 55 percent of city of Aden. The brother president emphasized our Yemeni people's rejection of those secessionists and agents who betrayed their people and sold the homeland's cause at a low price. He called on some brotherly countries, which claim to be really eager to save Yemeni blood, to stop interfering in our internal affairs and not to support the rebels. The brother president hailed the position of the fraternal State of Qatar -- government and people -- which advocates Yemeni unity, and the Qatari leadership's sympathy with, and support for legitimacy and Yemeni people. He said this in a (television interview?) with the Qatari television team.
