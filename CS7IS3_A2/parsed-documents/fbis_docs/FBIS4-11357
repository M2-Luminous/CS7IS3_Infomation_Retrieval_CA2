[Begin Cristiani recording] Making a good government is obviously necessary, and a good government must attend to the people's needs. We have made a lot of progress in the political field. The process is practically running itself. In the economic area, the new government must continue to promote development and trust. The macroeconomy has reached a level where this is possible. I believe the most important thing is to continue to stress the importance of helping the people, the social area. Mainly, we must continue to support education, health, housing, and all those programs aimed at solving the people's problems. The other day, when we were distributing checks at the Reconstruction Secretariat, we said that at the government level plans, very big plans, are made in general terms; because of this, many times the people's needs are overlooked. For the government, these needs may seem very small, but for the people they are very important. Therefore, it is very important for the government to continue supporting institutions, such as the Reconstruction Secretariat, the Social Investment Fund, and the Family Secretariat. Fortunately, the Social Investment Fund is negotiating more loans, and the Inter-American Development Bank seems willing to give this organization a third loan that will help the Social Investment Fund until it can begin making its own money. I also believe we must constantly work to eradicate corruption. Corruption may not be as common in the United States, but we are constantly hearing of scandals of corruption in developed countries. Japan has had serious problems with corruption. What can we say of Brazil? Therefore, this is something against which we must constantly struggle to ensure its disappearance, but we must not only struggle for corruption to disappear but also so that it will not reappear. Making the same mistake is very easy. [end recording] President Cristiani explained his earlier statements on the Farabundo Marti National Liberal Front's [FMLN] imminent division in the assembly: [Begin Cristiani recording] They have kept the FMLN united due to the need to present themselves as a sole political force in the elections, not as a divided force. I do believe, however, everyone here knows there are big differences among the various factions. We do believe division will eventually occur, and each group will adopt a more individual position as was foreseen from the very moment the FMLN registered its charter. They have described themselves as a party of several persuasions. There are five different persuasions within the party, and that is where the problem lies. They will now have to adopt specific positions, and we will now begin to see those differences. I believe five factions will be making separate decisions; this does not mean they will vote together at certain times, but we will see a difference in the way they make their decisions. I believe the parties that form the coalition will have to make a political analysis for the future. Had the Democratic Convergence run alone in these elections, it would not have done very well. They only won one seat in the assembly. If the coalition breaks up, the Democratic Convergence runs the risk of losing its status of political party because the votes it would receive in an election would not be enough. A similar situation is confronted by the National Revolutionary Movement. If there is a division within the FMLN where the various tendencies separate, we would even see a reorganization within the party. [end recording] Regarding the abstentions reported during the 24 April elections, President Cristiani expressed regret this is being used to hinder the electoral process, adding this is not something unusual when a runoff is convoked.
