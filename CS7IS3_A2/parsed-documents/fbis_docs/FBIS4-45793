In the past it was with statements of this kind that numerous conferences of North Sea border countries concluded. So far few deeds have ensued from the words. "Although the situation has improved, the North Sea remains a major headache," openly admitted federal environmental minister, Klaus Toepfer, when he submitted his report on water management in Germany at the United Nations Water Day on 22 March in Noordwijk in the Netherlands. He thereby obliquely alluded to what environmental ministers have been asserting for a long time: resolutions by the North Sea border countries to halve their inputs of pollutants by 1995 relative to 1988, have so far entailed few effective measures. With an average depth of only 80 meters [m], the shallow sea with the highest density of shipping in the world is forced to ingest large quantities of nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals, organic halogen compounds and oils. According to the federal environmental ministry, statistically, 75 tons [t] of mercury, 355 t of cadmium, 950 t of arsenic, 4,500 t of copper, 11,000 t of lead, 28,000 t of zinc, 50,000 t of phosphorus and as much as 1.4 million t of nitrogen reach the North Sea annually via tributaries and via the air. More than one million tons of the nitrogen arrive directly via the rivers and nearly 400,000 t are airborne. That is not without consequences. With increasing frequency, as a result of an oversupply of nutrients, it leads to algae blooms and oxygen deprivation. Ecosystems along the coasts are often disrupted. A study produced on commission from the environmental foundation World Wide Fund For Nature [WWF-Germany], "Nitrogen Inputs into the North Sea catchment Area," by the Hamburg Institute for Ecology and Policy [Oekopol], deals with the causes of the "overload of nitrogen" in the North Sea and measures for its reduction. Author Sabine Winteler emphasizes: "The report elucidates the manifold untapped scope and potential for a long overdue reduction of the turnover of nitrogen in the industry and industrial agronomy of the North Sea border countries." Summarized briefly, the conclusions are: agriculture bears the responsibility for more than 50 percent and traffic for another 20 percent of the nitrogen pollution of the North Sea. Total inputs of nitrogen have remained steady at a high level for years. Only drastic measures can help the North Sea any longer. The most important objective is refashioning agriculture into ecological farming. Toepfer takes a similar view in his report on water management in Germany: "Because of the largely closed cycle of materials ecological farming especially deserves support in problem areas for water management." He advocates designing subsidies and taxes in the agricultural sector more stringently than hitherto so as to support the goals of water protection. The major sources of nitrogen from agriculture are animal production and soil cultivation. With the changeover to labor-saving mass ownership of animals there was more intensive use of liquefied disposal of manure. In Winteler's words: "The resulting liquid manure has a high content of rapidly available nutrients." More than 75 percent of the nitrogen from liquid manure is available to plants immediately or rapidly and therefore is capable of not being carried off into the North Sea. Lutz Ribbe, director of the environmental policy section Euronature, of the European Nature Heritage Foundation, remarks, however: "Only 20 percent of all fattened pigs in Germany are in hers of more than 400 animals." In the Netherlands and Great Britain by now 50 percent and 75 percent, respectively, of the swine are. Manure activities outside the vegetation period are especially disastrous, leading to high losses of nitrates in the subsoil. Nitrates are hardly bound up there and mostly get into the ground water, the rivers and ultimately the North Sea. Not only the liquid manure but also the mineral fertilizers spread on the fields ultimately end up here. According to Winteler: "In 1980 the amounts of artificial nitrogen , an average 130 kilograms [kg] per hectare, applied in the former laender of the FRG were five times as much as before World War II." Experts in the federal environmental ministry also are aware of how important a more economical use of fertilizers is. For a long time a bill has been lying dormant there for an ordinance on the use of fertilizer, that will prevent excessive use of fertilizer. Hardly anyone, however, expects it to be passed any longer in this term of the legislature. In any event, there was no word of mention about the ordinance in Toepfer's water management report at the end of March.
