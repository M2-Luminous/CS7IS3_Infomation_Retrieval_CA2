This was a journey of 25,000 kilometers. From where do you have the best reports? [Meciar] We have good reports from each country, but the most important ones are, in any case, from China. We were received by President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng. The signing of an agreement on trade-economic and cultural cooperation opens up a huge market for Slovakia. This giant country appreciated the fact that Slovakia was one of the first countries in East Europe to come and discuss cooperation with the PRC. [Smolec] Ill-wishers are accusing you of flirting with a socialist country, are they not? [Meciar] The whole world trades with the People's Republic of China. China was the first of the Asian countries to recognize us as a state. There are no contentious issues between us. China has a dominant economic-strategic position in Asia. It is undergoing a complicated transformation process. In Shanghai, they are quite literally achieving a minor economic miracle. We want to learn from what the Chinese are doing. What China does well, we want to take up ourselves. I do not pay any attention to what the ill-wishers say. [Smolec] In China, Thailand, Pakistan, and Turkey, you shrewdly pointed out to politicians and businessmen that Slovakia was once a "power" in arms production. Now it is producing only 8 percent of its original output. We had politicians who forced us to repent for having experts who manufactured high-quality weapons. [Meciar] Others have come into the arms markets we left. We are offering these products to NATO. No agreements were reached with Germany or France; on the other hand, they reached an agreement with the Czech Republic. We did not come to an agreement with Great Britain. So, we are looking for ways of cooperating with others. For example, with Turkey, Thailand, and other countries. World experts admire the technical standard of Slovak weapons because, in some respects, it is unique. We do not want to turn Slovakia into the world's armory, but we see no need to destroy our arms industry. It is important that we are able to compete. We have to make up quickly for the loss we suffered through no fault of our own. The tradition of our products means a lot. Very few people know that the cannon that Columbus fired when he discovered America was made in Upper Hungary--that is, on the territory of present-day Slovakia. [Smolec] During your trip, did anyone express any doubts about Slovakia? [Meciar] The Slovak Republic was viewed everywhere we went as a reliable and responsible partner. They did not know much about us in Pakistan, but, when we told them about Slovakia, they expressed an interest in visiting it.
