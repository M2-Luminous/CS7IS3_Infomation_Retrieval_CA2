Judge Canovas acted on firm evidence; he lived up to his reputation as a severe rural judge. He lived as one who has witnessed a horrendous nightmare, until he was defeated by a terrible death. Nevertheless, Special Judge Milton Juica continued the task started by Canovas through confessions which went beyond the somber forebodings of the late solitary judge. This is what Ascanio Cavallo writes in an article [in LA EPOCA] entitled: "The Doors of Hell": Few people remember it now, but Carabineros General Rodolfo Stange tendered his resignation as Carabineros commander once before. It was on the afternoon of 1 April 1985, almost nine years ago, when it was reported that Judge Canovas Robles had just set bail for two Carabineros and indicted 14 others for their involvement, less than five months previously, in the abduction and killing of Communist Party leaders Manuel Guerrero, Santiago Natino, and Jose Manuel Parada. After reviewing aspects of this case, and the many harassments of which [former Carabineros Commander] General Cesar Mendoza was not unaware, Ascanio Cavallo states: Since then, Stange has done his best to improve the image of the Carabineros. He dissolved the Diconcar [expansion unknown], and little by little expelled Carabineros personnel who were involved in the DINA [National Intelligence Directorate], the CNI [National Intelligence Center], or in other similar organizations or had carried out similar duties. He cleaned up the generals corps, expedited the promotion process, and established an open-door policy to the public. Stange ordered the Carabineros to maintain a prudent low-profile during the plebiscite. He showed a previously unsuspected ability for political maneuvering during the transition by accepting the court appointment proposed by Patricio Aylwin's Administration without yielding almost anything. The case of the three Communist leaders was, however, hopeless. On 31 March, in his much-awaited first ruling, Special Judge Juica recommended that the military court indict Stange for serious nonfulfillment of military duties. This goes beyond the judicial measures that occurred as a result of Mendoza fall in 1985. Juica's ruling presupposes that the high command did not conduct the proper investigation and obstructed justice. Ascanio Cavallo's article in LA EPOCA adds: At least the attitude of the Carabineros has changed throughout the process. Canovas lived under surveillance and his credibility was subjected to continuous challenge while conducting the investigation. Many high-ranking officers systematically refused to accept that some of their men may have been involved in the homicide case, but tolerated the repeated lies from those responsible. Only in 1992, when Juica's investigation had yielded the first irrefutable evidence, did one high-ranking officer, General Mario Morales, publicly express his shame. The admonitions to which he was subjected and the isolation he was forced to endure, compelled him to resign by the end of 1993. Continuing its analysis on this case, the "Doors of Hells" adds: Subjected to these complex pressures, it has become difficult for Stange to exercise his command. Subtlety is not required to understand that the government wants Stange to resign. During a meeting that lasted more than two hours at President Frei's office on the afternoon of 31 March, the political team gave the Carabineros the long Easter weekend to decide. But the phrase urging Gen. Stange to conscientiously analyze the situation -- which was included in the communique that ensued from this meeting -- leaves virtually no room for doubt. It would be very difficult to find a case where the executive branch has appealed to the conscience of someone and have him remain in his post. The defense used by the Carabineros high command on 1 April is more aimed at the groups that requested Stange's resignation than at the government's statement. Nevertheless, the statement issued by the Carabineros high command could not have appeased the executive branch. The circumstances under which it was read -- with all the Carabineros generals standing behind Carabineros Deputy Commander Fernando Cordero who read the statement -- insinuated that the Carabineros would react as an institution, as they did in 1985 when the high command made it perfectly clear it could only be led by one of its own. Therefore, the past few hours have served to establish if this statement has the approval of Gen. Stange, or if it is a noble but unrealistic gesture of solidarity. The article ends by noting: The Carabineros high command believes charges of the involvement of its commander are partial and biased, but one cannot overlook the fact that the main conclusion of these charges is based on an independent investigation conducted over nine years by two special judges. Who is going to confirm if these are biased and partial opinions? The military courts, for example, may decide there is no merit in holding a trial after such a long period or in holding a trial in which the Carabineros may be interested parties. Whether or not Stange remains in his post is not a judicial question; it is strictly a political case. It has nothing to do with his work in modernizing Carabineros. Stange has the last word and, until he utters it, it is easy to predict the prevailing atmosphere: Tense, very tense.
