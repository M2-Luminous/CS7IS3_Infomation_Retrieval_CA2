Egyutteles and the MKDH are both in the five-party coalition government of Jozef Moravcik, while the MOS is a minor non- parliamentary party. The prospect of coupling with a third Hungarian party has become something of an apple of discord between Egyutteles and the MKDH. Initially Egyutteles propounded a coalition embracing all four Hungarian parties in Slovakia, which the MKDH opposed. Egyutteles now does not directly reject the idea of a three-way coalition but it is seeking reassurances from the MOS that after election MOS deputies will not desert the Hungarian bloc for some right-of-center Slovak party. The situation is further complicated by personal antipathy between Egyutteles Chairman Miklos Duray and MOS Chairman Laszlo Nagy, who in the past has criticized the former for nationalism. The MKDH backs MOS admission to the loose coalition currently existing with Egyutteles so that, in the words of MKDH chairman Vojtech Bugar, "not one Hungarian vote is lost" Egyutteles deputy Edita Bauerova said at a party press conference today that the MKDH had, however, not yet stated its conditions for any such coalition. A two- or three-party coalition will not affect requirements for entry to parliament. For both, a minimum of seven per cent of the vote is needed. Observers agree a four-party Hungarian coalition is probably out of the question because it would require ten percent of the vote. The Hungarian minority in Slovakia (i.e. the voting base for the Hungarian bloc) numbers some 560,000 people, 10.8 percent of the total population. Egyutteles is also toying with the idea of including candidates from the fourth minority party, the Hungarian People's Party (MLS, also non-parliamentary) on its election lists, as the law allows, but the MKDH does not hide its objections to this strategy. Whatever the outcome of these pre-electoral maneuvers, observers believe Egyutteles and the MKDH will retain their ability to tip the scales in favor of the anti-Meciar government. General elections will be held in Slovakia on September 30 and October 1.
