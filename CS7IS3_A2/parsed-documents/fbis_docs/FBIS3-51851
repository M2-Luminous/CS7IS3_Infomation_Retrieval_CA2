Source is cited in parentheses following each item. Officials at the Economy and External Cooperation Ministries said that despite current government optimism and expectations for renewed economic activity in 1994, Nicaragua's economy is still perceived throughout Central America as the worst in the region. The sources indicated that conditions during 1994 will be determined primarily by the agricultural cycle and international cooperation, both of which show decreasing tendencies. Funds received from international cooperation will be used mostly to pay $250 million in foreign debt. Of the $250 million liquid funds to be received as part of the international assistance package, only $70 million has been contracted as loans while $150 million is coming from the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) program. In the meantime, unions continue to protest government plans to privatize several state enterprises, including utility companies such as the Nicaraguan Institute of Energy and the Nicaraguan Telecommunications and Postal Services Institute.

The three officials agreed that one of the biggest causes of unemployment in Nicaragua is the government's structural adjustment program. The same sources said that unemployment in Nicaragua is expected to reach 60 percent of the economically active population. (Managua EL NUEVO DIARIO in Spanish 20 Jan 94 p 6)
