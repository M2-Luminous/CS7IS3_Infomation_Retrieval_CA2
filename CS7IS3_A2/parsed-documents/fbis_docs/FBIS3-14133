Highly placed political sources in Tehran said yesterday that Khamene'i is deterined to steer Iranian policy back to "its true revolutionary path" and to annul the experimental policy of normalization represented by Rafsanjani. Monashir Badi, the Iranian constitutional expert in Tehran, says: The fact that Rafsanjani holds the title of president of the republic causes a lot of confusion in Western capitals. People hear that title and think that Rafsanjani is like the French and U.S. presidents, but our system is totally different. The real head of state here is Khamene'i who can dismiss the president, dissolve parliament, and suspend the Constitution if he wishes. Now Khamene'i is trying to make Western states understand that in the end they will have to deal with him and not Rafsanjani. Kahmene'i sends this message by openly attacking the Western states with which Rafsanjani starts a secret dialogue. Yahya Nabbut, another expert on the Iranian regime, says: "Khamene'i has made it clear that Rafsanjani has no power in such fields as defense, security, oil, and contact with the masses. Now the supreme leader is also saying that the president does not have the final say on foreign policy." There is one issue on which conflicting signals have been coming out of Tehran. That issue is the number of Iranian pilgrims this year. Mohammad Mohammadi Reshari, who has the task of leading the pilgrims, has acceded to a government request that the number of pilgrims be halved. That is in line with President Rafsanjani's policy of cutting hard currency expenditure in some sectors so that the country can finance imports of such necessities as food products and spare parts. The cost of Iranian pilgrimage is estimated at $3 billion, based on 1989 figures, but some pilgrims buy more currency on the black market so as to be able to purchase commodities in Saudi Arabia which are scarce in Iran. Observers offer three points in support of the view that Iran itself is trying to reduce the number of pilgrims: 1. The contracts signed with the airline companies, including the Bulgaria Balkan company, only cover half the number of seats that were available last year. 2. The number of people who received official written invitations to special courses on pilgrimage rites and other related matters has decreased. 3. Government departments, semi-public establishments, and other big organizations have been informed that their quotas will be cut by half as part of the government's austerity drive. Iranian economy and finance ministries' reports indicate that Iran could save up to $1 billion by reducing the number of pilgrims. Iran is expected to suffer a fall of $5 billion in its other important savings in the next 12 months. Khamene'i, however, is worried that a cut in the number of pilgrims might trigger accusations that his government is interfering with religious duties. That could destroy his efforts to secure a place among the highest echelon of mullas. Badi says: "Rafsanjani was right to tell people that they have to save money. Khamene'i wants to blame others when a smaller number of pilgrims go to holy Mecca. The fact is that if the same number of people went on pilgrimage this year as 1992, the government would face a most serious balance of payments crisis and a more rapid collapse of its currency." Some observers in Tehran give a more Machiavellian interpretation of the conflicting signals from Khamene'i and Rafsanjani. They that this may be a double act to cause a diplomatic problem to make it possible for Tehran to prevent the Iranians from going on pilgrimage this year, which would enable the government to save $2 billion at least.
