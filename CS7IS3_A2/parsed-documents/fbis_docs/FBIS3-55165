Foreign Minister Trivimi Velliste is to be replaced by the current defense minister, Juri Luik. Trivimi Velliste himself will be sent to the United Nations as Estonia's permanent representative. The post of defense minister is to be ceded to parliament member Indrek Kannik. Finance Minister Madis Uurike is to be replaced by Kheyki Kranikh, a member of the liberal faction in the State Assembly, while Economics Minister Toomas Sildmae will give way to Toyvo Yurgenson, a deputy of the State Assembly. T. Sildmae's dismissal, however, has been opposed by representatives of Estonian entrepreneurial circles. Coming together for a hasty meeting on 3 January, they sent a joint letter of protest to the republic's president and prime minister. All the supposed candidates for ministerial posts are members of the ruling coalition in the State Assembly. A final decision is expected to be made before the first parliament session this year, scheduled for 10 January.
