Recklessly, unsystematically, and without any clear program it is striving to fill the coupon privatization coffers," Ivan Lexa, former state secretary in the Privatization Ministry and a "minister" in the shadow cabinet of ex-premier Vladimir Meciar today says in the daily SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA, published by Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). Lexa points to the fact that the government failed to approve Privatization Minister Milan Janicina's proposal according to which of the total 190 billion crowns (more than $6 billion) worth of the state-owned property put to privatization in the second wave, property amounting to 80 billion crowns should be privatized through the coupon method. Janicina intends to offer the maximum of state property for coupon privatization so as to please his future voters, Lexa says, adding that voters will, however, receive nothing of it since the "collapsing enterprises bring no profits and the prosperous ones are designated for others." He says ``the cream will be licked off by the investment privatization funds under which an "indefinite foreign capital and maybe dirty money" allegedly hide. [quotation marks as received] "For example, the chemical industry, a considerable part of the spa and all mines are to be privatized in such a way," Lexa asserts. On the other hand, the appearance of the diffused mass of anonymous owners without any capital share would necessarily lead to collapse, Lexa says, adding that the HZDS had sought to provide employees with shares to motivate them as owners. Renowned foreign experts are also expressing ever-growing surprise over the course of privatization in Slovakia, Lexa says. On the one hand they allegedly rejoice over the opportunity to obtain "Slovak factories cheaply," and on the other they do not understand an irrational approach by the current government, he adds.
