The session is being held to examine the issues of north Iraq, specially the events stemming from the recent Turkish air raids against the region and losses inflicted in these attacks on the border areas of Iran. Besides the aforesaid cases, the three foreign ministers attending the session will also follow up the manner of enforcement of the memorandums of understanding and agreements reached at the last session held in Tehran. At the current session various issues including Bosnia-Herzegovina and terrorism in the region have been discussed. However reports say that the main subject of discussion relates to the negotiations among the parties concerned over the events of north Iraq and their impact in regional states. Special attention of Iran, Turkey and Syria to the issues of Iraq, and their importance for each of these three states, or the outcome of the [words indistinct] occurrence in north Iraq can have impacts directly or indirectly in the neighboring countries. Such impacts have an unbreakable link with the national security of Turkey, Syria and Iran. While at the fourth session of these three countries' foreign ministers held in Tehran in June 1993, there was expressed concern over these adverse impacts within the framework of diplomatic wordings in the final communique, this concern has now emerged openly with the attack of Turkish war planes on Iran's border areas. However the question is asked too: What factors undermine the security stressed by these three states at numerous sessions held by their foreign ministers in Tehran, Damascus, and Ankara? Response to this question is evident in options for [words indistinct] and accessible even though faced with certain difficulties. The fact of the matter is that deployment of multinational forces on the soil and some territorial water of some regional states is one of the reasons behind eruption of such unrest once in a while. These are the troops which enter into action with the intention of backing the Kurds in north Iraq but bring suffering to them and to their pains by the way of their intelligence umbrella and their logistical support to military operations against the people of this region. At any rate it is hoped that by virtue of the identity of views among Iran, Syria and Turkey over preserving the territorial integrity of Iraq, current session of their foreign ministers in Istanbul will think about the negative impacts caused by Iraq's internal situation and find a solution to the problems which are rooted outside the region. This measure should be assessed not from the viewpoint of intervention in Iraq's affairs but in terms of the desire and commitment of Iran, Syria, and Turkey to bolster and stabilize regional security.
