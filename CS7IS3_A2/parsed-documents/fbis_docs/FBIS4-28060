About 500 business people, including 119 Chinese representatives, are today meeting at an investment forum in Sydney. Last week's first session of the forum in Melbourne resulted in 147 letters of intent worth a potential $1.2 billion [Australian]. Managing Director of the Australian Trade Commission Ralph Evans says the Chinese delegation has an extensive shopping list. [Begin Evans recording] There were up to $10 billion worth of projects and that $1.2 billion on which there have been companies that have signed initial letters of intent represents 12 percent of that. So, they have come with a very extensive shopping list and we would hope that more of it can be tapped into during the session here in Sydney today. [end recording]
