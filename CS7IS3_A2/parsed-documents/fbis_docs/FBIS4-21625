In an interview with the Japanese newspaper, former North Korean Army 1st Lt. Yim Yong-son, who defected to South Korea last September, said Pyongyang had selected areas along the Chinese border as missile launching sites, judging that an attacker would avoid these areas for fear of hitting China by accident, the report said. Saying he was quoting fellow soldiers at an Army engineering unit engaged in construction of missile bases where he worked before defecting to Seoul, Yim said that although North Korea's missile launching sites are located along the eastern coastlines of North Hamgyong and Kangwon Provinces and Wonsan city, the Stalinist North recently started building additional sites along the Chinese border. Some 5,000 people are working at such sites at Chunggangjin in Chagang Province and the job will be completed next year, the Japanese newspaper quoted Yim as saying. "I heard that North Korea, presuming that the United States and South Korea would not attack missile sites along the Chinese border for fear of hitting China if war broke out, began constructing the sites along its Chinese border," he was quoted as saying.
