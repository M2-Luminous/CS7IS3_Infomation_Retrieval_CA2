Bulger] [Text] Johannesburg April 20 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] could not be treated with kid gloves because it was now a full participant in the election process, African National Congress Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa told the Multiparty Negotiating Council [MPNC] at the World Trade Centre on Wednesday [20 April]. Mr Ramaphosa welcomed IFP delegates back to the MPNC which was sitting to consider constitutional amendments on the future of Zulu king goodwill Zwelithini. The amendments were agreed upon by IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi, ANC President Nelson Mandela and President F W de Klerk on Tuesday. While welcoming the IFP back, Mr Ramaphosa said the cost of the IFP's return had been high. He said up to 700 people had died in political violence since the IFP failed to follow through on its electoral registration last month. "The cost of bringing back the IFP into the election process has been very high for our people," Mr Ramaphosa said. He said a statement by IFP negotiator Walter Felgate that the IFP had deliberately played hard to get until the latest possible moment and had been worth millions of rands, made his heart bleed. South African Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo said he hoped the IFP was entering the election with a view to accepting the results. In a reference to kwaZulu's separatist notions, Mr Slovo said a "Savimbi option had no future in South Africa. Mr Felgate said the IFP was not entering the elections on a conditional basis and was totally committed to the electoral process. He said the IFP would work for peace and for a successful election. He said he had been quoted selectively about the publicity value of the IFP's strategy.
