FBIS4-43297 "drweu115_n_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-115 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 NORDIC COUNTRIES Finland Main Union, Farmers Group on EU Vote Stance Main Union, Farmers Group on EU Vote Stance 94P20875A 94P20875A CSO [Editorial Report] According to a Finnish News Service report carried on page 7 of leading national daily Helsinki HELSINGIN SANOMAT on 23 May, the organization representing agricultural interests has decided not to support European Union [EU] membership in the referendum to be held on 16 October. Esa Harmala, chairman of the Farmers and Forest Owners' Federation (MTK), announced this decision of the governing board in an interview, asserting that the group would not "campaign for membership under any circumstances." Depending on the outcome of the ongoing argument over farm subsidies, however, the organization in the future might adopt "a completely negative position" or maintain this slightly more ambiguous stance of not recommending how its constituency should vote. Harmala, who prior to being elected to head the MTK in April, was chief negotiator for farm issues at the Brussels talks on Finnish entry terms. In the interview cited, Harmala accused the government of having broken many of its promises made to farmers about these same terms, especially relating to subsidy issues. In contrast, Finland's largest labor union, the blue-collar Finnish Confederation of Labor (SAK), decided to back EU membership, as discussed by HELSINGIN SANOMAT reporter Jarmo Aaltonen in a story on 29 May. SAK delegates voted 79 to 19, with eight abstentions. In a second ballot demanded by an EU opponent in which the proposition was given more negative wording, the stand was confirmed by a 73-13 vote. Opposition was mainly concentrated in the Left Alliance Party (VL) with scattered support from Social Democratic ranks. Notable among opponents were leaders of some constituent unions, including the Merchant Seamen's Union (a Social Democrat) and the Electrical Workers' Union (a Left Alliance member). Opponents charged that membership would result in reducing the level of social services, destroying worker security, cutting wages, weakening the position of women in society, and ending Finnish sovereignty. One VL delegate repeated the familiar assertion that democracy would suffer when matters are settled in Brussels. The government's decision of 26 May to continue high farm subsidies through a "domestic support package" over a five-year transition to the CAP [Common Agricultural Policy] was seen by Aaltonen as having cost some loss of support for membership. The SAK also adopted a "separate stand" on the agricultural package, asserting that this would lead to: "an insupportable excess production, and is an attempt by producers to preserve their special privileges until the year 2000." In the end, the SAK leadership carried the day in a promembership resolution by asserting that the organization two years ago had voted to join the EU pending a favorable outcome in the entry talks, and that this had now been achieved. In a Finish News Service report of 2 June on page 6, NTK chief Harmala stated that the government's agriculture package did not go far enough to justify a change of mind regarding the body's attitude on membership. He now said the MTK would not adopt a final position on the referendum until it received assurance about the level of the the national subsidy package, and that the EU Commission would approve it. Unless such assurance is received in good time, he said, "...farmers and the MTK will be forced into actively opposing membership. He attacked the EU for rejecting Finland's demand in Brussels for step-by-step adjustment to community food-price levels, and doubted it would accept this arrangement now."
