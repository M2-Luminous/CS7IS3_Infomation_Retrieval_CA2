The Securities Depository will maintain a registry of all officially issued securities and any buying and selling transactions involving them. The depository will have data on the prices and quantities of securities, on property put up as collateral for them, and other information regarding securities. The data in the central depository should make securities more trustworthy, and enable putting them up as collateral for loans. Rein Usin, chairman of the board of Forekspank [Foreks Bank], said that plans call for setting up the depository within two months. The system would be developed by local specialists. A specialized system for the depository could have been purchased but, in addition to the high price (50 million kroons), this could have caused problems with compatibility.
