Ltd, the first profitable joint venture in the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone here, has decided to invest 10 million U.S. dollars more to expand production. The Sino-Japanese venture was one of the first transnationals to enter the free trade zone, which went into operation in March 1992. The extra investment will be put into the manufacturing of audio equipment and video cassette recorders, according to Cui Changshun, chairman of the company. He said that the products will be exported to the United States, Canada and Southeast Asian countries. Last December alone, the firm recorded a sales value of 130 million yuan by selling big-screen television sets, high-end audio equipment, camcorders and video cassette recorders. Of these commodities, 70 percent were exported and the rest were sold on the Chinese market. Cui attributed the economic performance to preferential policies enjoyed by corporations in the zone. The policy does not require licenses for import and export goods, which are also exempted from tariffs. The Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone is projected to cover ten sq km. Construction has so far been completed on forty percent of the development area, which has absorbed more than 860 projects and 2.3 billion U.S. dollars in total investment.
