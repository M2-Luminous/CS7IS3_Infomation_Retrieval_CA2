FBIS4-54610 "dreeu085__a94023" FBIS-EEU-94-085-A Daily Report 2 May 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Views Problems With Hungary Views Problems With Hungary AU0205114894 Prague CTK in English 1105 GMT 2 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0205114894 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava May 2 (CTK) -- Central Europe has long been burdened by the state of Slovak-Hungarian relations which are even perceived as an obstacle on its road towards the European Union and NATO, Democratic Left Party (SDL) Chairman Peter Weiss told CTK on Sunday. Relations between Bratislava and Budapest have been characterised thus far by Slovakia's apprehensions concerning the unwillingness of Budapest to endorse the current Slovak-Hungarian borders officially in the as yet non-existent treaty between the two countries. Hungary's complaints about the position of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia, a dispute over the Gabcikovo hydroproject on the Danube and minor controversies over the unwillingness of Hungary to conclude a readmission agreement or open new border crossings are among other disputed issues, Weiss said. "However, the problems between Hungary and Slovakia are not as dramatic as they are sometimes made out to be. We do not see the situation as a conflict," Weiss said. He accused the former Slovak Government of ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar and the current Hungarian cabinet of attempting to win points in the internal political scene "by excessively dramatising Hungarian-Slovak problems and putting the blame on each other." "If the French and the Germans have managed to reconcile, then Hungarians and Slovaks can also come to terms," he said. Weiss pointed to the fact that the SDL and the Hungarian Socialist Party of Gyula Horn, a favourite of the forthcoming Hungarian elections, are ready to conclude a basic inter-state treaty guaranteeing the inviolability of the common border and rights to ethnic minorities in both countries. Weiss stressed, however, that his will to historic reconciliation with Budapest has its limits -- all speculations about territorial autonomy for the Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia are unacceptable to us since they simply will not pass in Slovakia. Regarding Slovakia's relations with the Czech Republic, Weiss said they required primarily a matter-of-fact approach. Weiss, who is considered a possible candidate for Slovak future premier, further said: "We consider relations with the Czech Republic to be of a key importance. We want to proceed from all the positive steps achieved during the 74 years of our co-existence. Naturally the two countries are currently independent and have their own interests which they want to protect. But these interests should be pursued and protected on the basis of an expert and a matter-of-fact dialogue."
