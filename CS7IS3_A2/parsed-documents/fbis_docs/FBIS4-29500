Following is our radio review on results of the visit. Vietnam has traditional friendship and cooperation with Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Russia, and other republics of the former Soviet Union. After political changes that lead to the collapse of the former Soviet Union, relations between Vietnam and members of the former Soviet Union were suspended because these countries met with numerous difficulties. The first visit to Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Russia by the Vietnamese prime minister has breathed a new life into the traditional relations between Vietnam and these countries. After the visit, the mutual understanding, friendship, and cooperation have been developed in the principles of equality and mutual benefit. It is worthy of note that during the visit, Vietnam and Russia signed four important agreements, including the treaty on the principle of friendly relations between the two countries. The treaty is a foundation for the restructuring of cooperation to make relations between the two countries develop effectively. On this occasion, ministers, vice ministers, and businessmen who accompanied the prime minister exchanged views with their Russian counterparts to study the market and the possibility of cooperation between the two countries. Following the visit, ministries, branches, and enterprises of Vietnam and Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Russia will work out concrete plans for more effective cooperation. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said upon his return home from Moscow that Vietnam has resumed its friendship with members of the Commonwealth of the Independent States on the basis of new relations.
