FR940728-0-00029 FR940728-0-00010 Response : The overpayments may be recovered as explained in the response to comment (m). (o) Seven commenters submitted responses to the proposed de minimis exception of §230.461(h). One commenter stated that MMS does not have authority under the interpretations contained in the 1981 M-Opinion to establish such a provision. Another commenter stated that the amount should be set at 1/2 percent of the normal monthly payment to be meaningful. No support was received for the alternative of limiting section 10 refund requests to $100 or more. The other five commenters supported the de minimis idea, but suggested the limit be increased from $25 to $100 per payor code per month. Response : After considering the comments, MMS has concluded that instead of a fixed amount for the de minimis exception, MMS will periodically review the matter and establish a de minimis amount. Accordingly, the final regulations provide that a limit will be published periodically in the Federal Register. This limit will be based on the cost incurred to process a section 10 refund request. Based on the cost experience for fiscal year 1993, the initial limit is established at $250. Under these procedures, payors will be able to file credits for OCS leases totalling less than $250 for each reporting month, provided the payments subject to adjustment were made within 2 years of the date of the adjustments. Thus, even if a payor used this exception to avoid section 10's reporting requirements, the most it could recover for any lease is $6,000 (24 months × $250). III. Summary of Final Rule The MMS is adding new regulations at 30 CFR 230.451 through 230.461, which codify MMS' policy regarding the requirements of OCSLA section 10, 43 U.S.C. 1339. Except for the changes to the rules discussed above in response to the comments, MMS is adopting the rule as proposed with some minor working changes. A detailed discussion of each section is included in the preamble to the proposed rules, 58 FR 53470, explaining the purpose and effect of each section. Procedural Matters The Regulatory Flexibility Act The Department certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). There are not many small entities involved in offshore oil and gas operations. Executive Order 12630 The Department certifies that the rule does not represent a governmental action capable of interference with constitutionally protected property rights. Thus, a Takings Implication Assessment need not be prepared under Executive Order 12630, ``Government Action and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.'' Excutive Order 12778 The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that the rule meets the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Oder 12778. Executive Order 12866 This document has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 and is not a significant regulatory action. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 This rule does contain information collection requirements which have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget as required by 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and assigned approval number 1010&hyph;0094. National Environment Policy Act of 1969 It is hereby determined that this rulemaking does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and a detailed statement pursuant to paragraph (2)(C) of section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is not required.
