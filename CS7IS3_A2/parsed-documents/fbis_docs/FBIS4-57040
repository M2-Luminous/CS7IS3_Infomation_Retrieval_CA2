According to EFE reporters, after touring the Ministries Esplanade area -- where Planalto Palace, congressional buildings, and the Supreme Court building are located -- the military vehicles were parked in the vicinity of the cathedral. A military deployment like today's has not taken place in Brasilia since the time of the military regime (1964-1985), when the Army used to deploy its tanks to intimidate government opponents. The 7,000 PF personnel have been on strike to demand a salary increase, but their negotiations with the government have failed. Union leader Jair Meneguelli -- president of the Sole Workers Center (CUT, leftist), to which the National Federation of Police Unions is affiliated -- has demanded that the government resume negotiations. Meneguelli declined to comment on persistent rumors circulating in Brasilia that Franco, who last night ordered the military intervention in police headquarters, is promoting an institutional coup similar to the one engineered by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori in 1992.
