FR940325-1-00079 FR940325-1-00008 Under the proposed rule the Department would recognize two types of authorized leasing or subleasing. The first is the lease or sublease of public land grazing privileges associated with the base property. Such a lease or sublease would be authorized so long as the associated base property is leased or subleased together with the public land grazing privileges and the BLM authorized officer approves the arrangement. The second is a pasturing agreement under which livestock not owned by the permittee or lessee but under the control of the permittee or lessee is allowed to graze on the permit or lease area. In order to be authorized, such a lease or sublease arrangement would require approval of the BLM authorized officer. Other types of subleasing arrangements would be unauthorized. The Department is proposing to charge a surcharge of 20 percent on all grazing fee billings for the authorized lease or sublease of public land grazing privileges associated with base property. An analysis of the costs and prices indicates that a 20 percent surcharge as applied by the State of New Mexico, the lowest of the States charging for subleasing, would be appropriate and is consistent with the approach used by other western States. The Department also proposes to follow the example of the western States subleasing charges to establish a surcharge for authorized leasing or subleasing arrangements constituting pasturing agreements, as described above. The Department proposes a surcharge of 50 percent for the forage used in pasturing livestock owned by other than the permittee or lessee under a BLM permit or lease where the livestock is under the control of the BLM permittee or lessee. This figure is comparable to the $1.00 per AUM sublease fee charged by the State of Utah and would capture the typically larger profit associated with pasturing livestock. The surcharge would be 70 percent of the grazing bill when there is both an authorized lease or sublease of grazing preference and an authorized pasturing agreement. Sons and daughters of permittees and lessees would be provided with an exemption from the surcharges under circumstances specified in the rule. The proposed rule includes a provision for multiple-year billing of grazing fees. This provision was not included in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. It has been added in response to preliminary analyses of Rangeland Reform '94 that suggested a need to identify further opportunity for reductions in administrative expense and staffing needs. The proposed rule would allow the authorized officer to approve advance billing for up to 5 years where agreed to by the permittee or lessee and where annual authorized livestock use does not exceed 200 AUMs. At the end of the billing period or prior to any termination or transfer of the permit or lease, a separate billing would be issued to reconcile amounts owed or overpaid as a result of changes in the grazing fee. This provision focuses on smaller public land leases that result in disproportionately high administrative costs. Multiple-year billing would free limited staff and resources to work on higher priority resource concerns. The new provisions for free use provide for the authorized officer to approve free use under limited circumstances. Under this section, free use could be permitted where the primary objective of authorized grazing use or conservation use is the management of vegetation to meet resource objectives other than the production of livestock forage, to conduct scientific research or administrative studies, or to control noxious weeds. Section 4130.7&hyph;2␣Incentive-Based Grazing Fee Reduction Existing §§4130.7&hyph;2 and 4130.7&hyph;3 would be redesignated as §§4130.7&hyph;3 and 4130.7&hyph;4, respectively, and a new section 4130.7&hyph;2 would be added to provide for the calculation of the incentive-based grazing fee and the criteria for qualifying for the fee reduction. This section would provide for a 30 percent reduction in the grazing fee where the criteria for qualification are met. However, the criteria for qualification are not included in this proposed rule. The Department intends to use its best efforts to complete a separate rule that will establish the criteria prior to the start of the 1996 grazing fee year, and has reserved a paragraph for the criteria in this proposed rule. This section would provide that the incentive-based fee for qualifying applicants in the grazing year 1996 would be calculated by multiplying the base value of $3.96 times 0.70 (70 percent). This would yield a 1996 incentive-based fee of $2.77. Beginning in grazing fee year 1997, the incentive-based fee would be calculated by multiplying the base value of $3.96 times the FVI and 0.70. This calculation would again yield an incentive-based fee of $2.77 for the grazing fee year 1997 because the FVI, by definition, would equal one for grazing fee year 1997. In subsequent years the incentive-based fee would fluctuate in keeping with changes in the private grazing land lease rate as reflected by the FVI. Yearly increases and decreases would be limited to no more than 25 percent of the incentive-based fee in the prior year.
