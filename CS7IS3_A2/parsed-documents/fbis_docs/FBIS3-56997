[Begin Nazarbayev recording, in Russian] During our negotiations with President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk in Kiev yesterday, and during our conversation with chairman of the Dnepropetrovsk oblast administration Pavlo Ivanovych [Lazarenko], we were saying how greatly our economic ties have diminished in these past few years! Last year alone, the trade turnover between Russia and Kazakhstan amounted to 1.650 billion dollars. Experts believe it should equal 5 or 6 billion. Kazakhstan used to have terrific ties with Dnepropetrovsk oblast alone, and now they are reduced by 50 percent. What does it mean? No goods are supplied to Kazakhstan while people are losing jobs here. When no relevant products are supplied to us, we are unable to launch a certain production line. Everybody loses in the long run. Now that we have recovered from euphoria and grasped the situation, we must gradually set up horizontal ties. We must all now think how we can bring people together, how we can lift the border barriers, how we can establish freedom of movement, and how we can help each other's economies find their feet again?
