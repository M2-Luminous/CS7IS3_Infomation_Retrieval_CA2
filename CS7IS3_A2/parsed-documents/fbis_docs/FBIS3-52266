It was unclear how long this latest round of talks, focusing on trade, labour, financial, banking and other economic issues, would last. The head of the Israeli delegation, David Brodet, was not present at the talks Monday. The Palestinian delegation is headed by Muhammad Abu-Ghawsh, in charge of international economic issues for the PLO. Israeli Foreign Minister Shi'mon Peres said in December that Israel had made various "concessions" to the PLO in terms of economic issues and was in favor of setting up a common market among Israel, Jordan and autonomous Palestinian territory.
