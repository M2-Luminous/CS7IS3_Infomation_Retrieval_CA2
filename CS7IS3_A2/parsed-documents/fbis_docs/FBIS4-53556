The plenary session of the upper house of the Japanese parliament passed the 10.89 trillion yen supplement to extend for 40 days an earlier 50-day provisional budget worth 11.05 trillion yen. The revised stopgap budget, totaling 21.94 trillion yen, will expire June 29, when the current Diet session ends. The rare revision of a stopgap budget -- the first since fiscal 1990 -- was necessitated by the political confusion following the abrupt resignation of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and the selection of Tsutomu Hata as his successor. The political turmoil had long stalled Diet deliberations on the 73.08 trillion yen full budget for fiscal 1994, which started April 1, until Tuesday when budgetary debates finally began. The chances for quick passage of the full budget, however, are viewed as slim because the Hata government holds only a minority in the Diet. The revised interim budget earmarks as little as possible for the running of administrative bodies, while boosting outlays for public works projects. Revised outlays for administrative expenses are set at 25 percent of the full budget, up from 14 percent in the initial stopgap budget. Public works got an additional 1.07 trillion yen, bringing the total so far to 3.84 trillion yen, about three-sevenths of such investments envisaged under the full budget.
