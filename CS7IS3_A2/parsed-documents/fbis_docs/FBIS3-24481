Pisarzhevskiy, Kiev; UDC541.145] [Abstract] The development of effective photocatalysts is closely related to the search for ways to eliminate undesirable deactivation processes resulting in the dissipation of photoenergy into heat or luminescence whereby a significant portion of the light quanta absorbed by the photocatalyst is expended without inducing chemical reactions. In the case of semiconductor catalysts, the main deactivating process is recombination of generated photoexcited charges, i.e. electrons in the conductance zone and holes in the valency zone. Therefore, in considering the possibility of using any particular semiconductor as a photocatalyst, preference is usually given to materials in which electron-hole recombination is not well pronounced. In this respect, heterojunctions are of special interest. These are systems consisting of a semiconductor matrix with some other semiconductor material superimposed on its surface. One special property of such semiconductor heterojunctions is their very efficient and in some cases irreversible ability to separate photogenerated electrons and holes by transferring one of these charge carriers or both from the semiconductor-matrix zone to the semiconductor-heterojunction zone, or vice versa. These semiconductors should have very high photocatalytic activity and indeed many have found practical applications as photodiodes, transistors, solar energy converters, etc. Currently available data on these heterojunctions refers mainly to dispersed coprecipitation products (cadmium and silver sulfides, copper (I) and cadmium, copper (I), cadmium, and zinc). The photocatalytic activity of these systems in hydrogen evolution reactions from aqueous sulfide-sulfite solutions is much higher than for the individual metals, which is attributed to the presence of microheterojunctions between similar semiconductors and the coprecipation products. In the present work a study was made of the preparation and photocatalytic properties of heterojunctions made from cadmium sulfide and sulfur-containing heterocomponents formed from copper (I), copper (II), and bismuth (III) ions. Photocatalytic activity of the prepared semiconductors materials was studied for the reaction of molecular hydrogen evolution from alcohol-water suspensions. The studies demonstrated that the photocatalytic properties of these materials are largely comparable with the properties of cadmium sulfide, although there are some differences. All three materials containing Cu[.sup]+[/], Cu[.sup]2+[/], or Bi[.sup]3+[/] manifest a photocatalytic activity under light of the same spectral range as that of non-modified CdS, although in the case of hydrogen formation, the reaction proceeds at a considerably faster rate.
