The participants of the meeting were protesting against nuclear tests held at the Lop Nur testing site, which is located only 300 km away from the Kazakh border. Multiethnic participants of the meeting expressed support for a statement released by the Kazakh Foreign Ministry in connection with the explosion at Lop Nur. Kazakhstanis are especially concerned about these tests because they have suffered for over 40 years from the tests at the Semipalatinsk site and are worried about the fate of their future generations. The Kazakh people, who have contributed so much to the closure of the Semipalatinsk site, are protesting together with the peoples of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, who also border on China. There are no borders to protect us against nuclear radiation and its consequences. The meeting and rally, which began yesterday in front of the Chinese Embassy, will finish on 29 August in New York in front of the UN headquarters.
