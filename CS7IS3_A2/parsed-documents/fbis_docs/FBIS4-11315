Robaina announced the decision during deliberations of The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, which began in Havana on 22 April. A conference spokesman told PRENSA LATINA that one such measure will be to lift the five-year waiting period normally required of people who legally left the island before they can return to Cuba for a visit. Up to this time, anyone who left Cuba for good had to wait five years before visiting the country unless the purpose of their visit was humanitarian. The requirement for emigrants traveling to Cuba to reserve hotels during their stay, which they usually spend at relatives' homes anyway, will also be removed. The spokesman indicated that Cubans living abroad will also be allowed to study in Cuba but will have to pay a tuition established for this purpose. According to the source, the issue of a Cuban publication for emigrants will also be considered.
