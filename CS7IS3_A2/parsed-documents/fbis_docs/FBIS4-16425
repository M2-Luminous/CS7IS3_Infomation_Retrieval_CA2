Unlike the previous sessions in December, these were held with the active participation of delegations from Ukraine and Moldova, which announced their desire to affiliate to earlier accords on the Commonwealth. There was another innovation -- for the first time Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, took part in this work. Presumably it was the participation of the authorized representative of the legislative branch of power which helped to free the stranded ship of CIS business ties. The participants in the "premiers' council," chaired by Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian Government, settled all 20 questions ahead of schedule. In the words of Vladimir Mashchits, leader of the Russian Federation Ministry of Cooperation [as published], the main achievements of the meeting may be considered the institution of a standing body -- the Commission of the Economic Union -- under the CIS Coordinating Committee and the signing of an agreement on a multilateral free-trade zone among Russia and all the other CIS states. "We are now transforming these bilateral treaties into multilateral ones," the minister stressed. In his opinion, this agreement could begin operating in the very near future. "It all depends on how long it takes each republic to fulfill all the legal requirements," he explained. A significant place among the package of documents signed by the premiers is occupied by the agreement on the development of production, credit and finance, insurance, and mixed transnational associations, which enshrines the obligation of the sides to ensure state support for cooperation among economic players in the CIS countries (regardless of forms of ownership). The draft concept of a payments union was also examined and some amendments were made to take into account the "distinctive character" of the former Soviet republics. Unlike the European interpretation of the concept, we are going to view it merely as a system of agreements on the reciprocal convertibility of national currencies. The document is essentially a program for the organization of payment and settlement relations among the CIS states with their own national currencies. On the basis of this concept a multilateral agreement on a payments union will be prepared before the end of the year.
