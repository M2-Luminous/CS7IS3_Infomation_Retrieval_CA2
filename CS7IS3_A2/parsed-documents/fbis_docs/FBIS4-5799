"I'm watching whether (the ruling coalition parties) will be able to adjust their policies while sticking to the coalition framework," Watanabe told reporters. He also said he wanted to appeal to the people to rescue the country from difficulties, and said party or faction ambitions should be put aside to this end. On possible talks with LDP President Yohei Kono, who has vowed to run in the premiership race in the Diet as the party's candidate, Watanabe reacted reluctantly, saying "now is not the time to meet with him." Watanabe's bid to become prime minister has brought the LDP to the verge of a major split, political sources said. Watanabe's faction, which is beefing up its campaign to promote their leader as a successor to Hosokawa, meanwhile has rallied some 50 House of Representatives lawmakers of the LDP, including 36 of its 45 faction members, behind Watanabe, faction sources said. The faction, the fourth largest among the LDP's five factions, is aiming to collect signatures from some 100 LDP members of the powerful lower house, supporting a call for faction members to back Watanabe, they said. The leading opposition party holds 219 seats in the 511-member lower chamber. Shinseito and Komeito, two of the key parties in the ruling coalition, once deemed Watanabe as the leader of a possible new coalition grouping, because of his political savvy and influence, political sources said. Although Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who heads Shinseito, has emerged as the most likely successor to Hosokawa, the seven ruling coalition parties remain divided over the process by which a new premier will be selected. Hosokawa announced his resignation last Friday over financial improprieties.
